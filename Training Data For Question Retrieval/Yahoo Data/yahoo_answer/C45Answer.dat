KTNqah9eaa	I don't know of any petition, but you could always start one. I know you're not a racist, but the problem is that very often people who band together over such an issue are racist. You seem to make a lot of broad statements about affirmative action and hiring etc. I don't know how true or untrue they are. However, I would suggest that if you are really concerned about this issue, it might be an idea to do some more research on how affirmative action works and is meant to work. I have often heard it said that the poor whites get a raw deal, but I don't know if it's true. That could do with some checking as well.|`|shtP63traa	If you're a minority in your area, apply for aid as a minority then.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I suggest you write to your state representative in regards to affirmative action policies in your state.|`|1KGXts5Daa	Yours is an argument I have been raising since 1989.

Margin of Error<br>  <br>  Ever heard of margin of error?<br>  <br>  It's that little +/- (number) %, such as +/- 2% you see after a poll result.  This means that any poll can be manipulated with margin of error in any direction you want it to go.<br>  <br>  So 62% with a +/- 5% could be as little as 57% or as much as 67% in reality.<br>  <br>  2. Acquiring the data<br>  <br>  How is the poll conducted?  What devices are used to reach the number of people?<br>  <br>  Here's how this can work.<br>  <br>  A poll using landlines will likely net more Conservatives-as landlines are far more common in rural areas (Conservative dominated areas)<br>  <br>  Most younger people and those in cities (Liberal dominated areas) don't have landlines, so a poll conducted by landlines will likely get few people of this category.<br>  <br>  So basically, a poll can be manipulated before you even ask the first person.<br>  <br>  If I wanted to show that Obama had high approval, I'd poll people either walking down the street in a major city-or I'd call Cell phones as opposed to landlines.  This is far more likely to net Liberals than Conservatives.<br>  <br>  If I wanted to show that Obama had low approval ratings, I'd poll people with landlines or send out reporters to rural and small town communities.  People in these areas are predominantly Conservative, so a poll can be expected to be less than favorable toward Obama in this case.<br>  <br>  These are the two most common ways to manipulate a poll, and in all likelihood, this poll (if you'd provide a link) is likely biased.<br>  <br>  So in conclusion-a poll is no more than an often controlled group of opinions.  Even polling a million Americans would not be sufficient to determine the actual opinion of our country.|`|IMaJbaPqaa	His approval rating was never 92%. The only President who ever managed that was Bush and that was on 9/11. <br>  <br>  A 62% approval rating is extremely good for a President. Especially when you consider that George W.

I live in Texas.  But I had a girlfriend this happened to and the judgement was totally against him.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Yikes!  Does the decree say that he was supposed to refinance it?  I hope so or that is big error on your lawyer's part.  Take him to court before you get hauled in.  Get that refinance order now!  You can go back to your lawyer and have her/him straighten this out.<br>  <br>  Since he has no job, it will probably have to be sold.  Do whatever it takes to keep your credit rating good.  I would also call the creditor and tell them what is going on.  At least hold them at bay for a bit until you can get going on this.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, they will still come after you even though he was supposed to pay according to the decree.  That is what co-signing is.  The original borrower is supposed to pay but if they don't, the co-signer becomes responsible.  Just don't let it get that far.
RkfIPD7Iaa	No, but he could pull you over for suspicious behavior and ask for license and insurance papers.  Let's fac it, you made it pretty clear you were avoiding him.<br>  <br>  If your continued action still seems suspicious, he could try to establish probable cause to search your vehicle.<br>  <br>  But basically, if you were doing nothing illegal and broke no traffic laws, he'll eventually let you go.|`|NvsFhD7Laa	Not unless you broke any traffic laws.

The speeding ticket 10 months ago would show that you haven't learned your lesson, so you are probably gonna get the points.<br>  <br>  If its not too far, its worth a shot.  Sometimes showing up and trying to defend yourself is sufficient.  Depends on the judge.  Its probably a coin flip.

There is more: The nations with the most executions in the past few years are:  China, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, the Sudan and the United States. <br>  <br>  I think anyone the UK should take a look at the death penalty system in action- in the USA- before making up their mind about it.  They would find surprising and disturbing things:<br>  <br>  Most disturbing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. <br>  <br>  The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative. <br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty. <br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states, regions and otherwise similar nations that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money.

There are always things which can be reasonably done to protect ourselves, but we should never be willing to trade the reality of freedom for the illusion of security. Nothing noticeable has changed yet since Obama has become President on the security front of the nation. This is not to say that he won't lessen our security, merely that he hasn't yet. You are entitled to feel the way you must, but in this case it sounds more like mild hysteria. Now having said that I should also say that emergency preparedness at a family level is good.

This is not a democracy. America is no where near a democracy. We are a democratic socialist state. we choose, through our politicians to be socialists. Ever since the great depression and the world wars, the government has been increasing their powers ever since and they don't give up power. <br>  <br>  I feel the same as you that our hard earned money shouldn't be given to the people who aren't decent enough to go find work by themselves. i believe that if people decide to find a job hard enough and put in enough effort they should find a job. An example is that when welfare is cut, unemployment goes down, but when welfare is increased, unemployment goes up. <br>  <br>  Even though this is true, the government is still a very controlling force that borders on socialism. Been to school K-12 recently?

And don't just google it because the very people you are trying to research are the ones who control the surface information - they have labled all of this a 'conspiracy theory' in order to keep ignorant people in the dark.<br>  <br>  Also, back in November, Bush signed agreements and treaties at the G-20 conference weakening our sovereignty and nobody paid attention because of all of the hope and change hype over Obama.  Minutes after the inauguration, Obama set to work diminishing our defense, violating States' rights with the hidden stimulus 'strings', and just about bankrupting our nation.

Then the oil companies lobbied for oil subsidies and the nascent hemp ethanol business couldn't compete.  Government is full of unintended consequences when it meddles in the market.

AA11494150	The search was legal, for two reasons. First of all, you have a lesser expectation of privacy on school property. Secondly, you have a lesser expectation of privacy in a vehicle (Carroll v. United States). In either situation, no warrant is needed to search, you only need probable cause. <br>  <br>  The odor of marijuana is probable cause. <br>  <br>  As far as the box, a search includes any containers in the vehicle.

The fact you had it packed up like you were going to mail it does not give it any special protection and would not rule it out as containing drugs.  Besides you have even less of a right to an expectation of privacy since you left it in a friend's car.<br>  <br>  I was not there and there are obviously some things that went on that I don't have all the details on but I would bet the Officers involved are okay on this one.<br>  <br>  Valid search.<br>  <br>  As far as your other friend's lights, if the Officer negligently broke them then the department may pay for them.

But, according to your story the box had not yet been opened, therefore it was not mail.  It only becomes mail once it is in the hands of the postal service.  Until then it is just a box.  Also, you brought this box onto school property.  Anything brought onto school property is subject to being searched for the safety and security of the students.<br>  <br>  As to the neon lights being damaged, the officer has the duty to take "reasonable care" not to damage property.

Because, until people say "this President stinks" or calls his names, the way they did attack the last 4-5-6-7 ones, etc. etc. and doesn't pander & bow because of his "culmination" then, deep down the true meaning isn't passed. Because you're still seeing the face, and not the Man making mistakes. This man walked into a White House window from outside -- and if that was a GWB, he's have been lampooned without MERCY across 10s of media outlets & shows from nightly Letterman video, Stewart, Maher, etc. Of course, a lot of this is simple DEM pandering and support -- but, it's not equal, if you can't laugh at it "all the same".

kLf9OtHbaa	each branch of service is posted on a military base pay, it really depends on your carrer, and what you do. your job will also get bonuses. right now i believe the army is giving away 30k for doing 2 years active and 4 years national guard. also navy isnt giving away any good bonuses unless you were special forces, and Coast guard well i really do not know. <br>  <br>  but i can tell you that if your looking for exellent pay your going to need to score high on the asvab, and then pick a job you like. if your just going into the service for money, well then your probably making a wrong decision because you will end up hating your job. so pick something in the middle (good bonus and something you will like).  special forces always gives good bonuses but thats only if you qualify.<br>  <br>  o and make sure you get your bonuses in writting otherwise you wont get it.  and Dont be sold on a 10k bonus because it could end up saying 5 years for only 10k bonus...no thats not worth it. and because the economy is falling then the bonuses are falling too because more people are joining the military.<br>  <br>  so like i said all branches of service have a base pay depending on your rank in the military starting from 1200-2200 a month (this is just regular enlisted) i believe officers get about 1600-3200 a month and this is without taxes taken out and if your smart you would eat at the mess hall every day so you wouldnt waste your money, and you get shelter and food and clothes for free. so go by the bonus if your looking for money. but if you choose a carrer because of the bonus chances are your going to hate it. soo choose wisely not money wise.<br>  <br>  remember this is your future you are about to sell 2+ years of your life|`|IdtzdpqGaa	first if I were you, I would stay in school to learn how to spell and get a better command of the english language.  second the pay is uniform through the services no one gets paid any different than anyone else, it is all based on grade and time in service. third that is way too general of a question to be answered in this forum, try to get some specific questions and topics so you receive better responses|`|LUosDsYaaa	I truly do not understand why it is that so many folks have such a strong to desire to lie about this.<br>  <br>  I do not understand at all.<br>  <br>  Navy bases really suck, All the navy wants at a base is piers and warehouses.

VRfcRh7Laa	I know many ideological Democrats who live in heavily Republican counties who are registered Republican because of situations very like the one you laid out.  I grew up in a mostly Republican district of an exceptionally Blue State.  Those people realized that in order to have any say in local governance, they needed to be able to effect the Primaries.  In order to do so, they needed to be registered with the opposite party.  These people generally vote Democrat in State and National elections, but are still able to effect local politics because of their affiliation.  Remember, there is no rule that says you have to vote your party line.  If you want to effect a Democratic primary, register as a Democrat, then vote your conscience.  Otherwise, try to get more Republicans to move into your area, that way they can elect a Republican to the office.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	If he is an American he's committed numerous crimes, just be having a 17-yr. old girlfriend.|`|de711i5Vaa	yes and charged, Hope your community smartens up soon.|`|MlshtGVTaa	I have never heard of what you are talking about, only democrats being able to vote for the next sheriff. but yeah it would be do right to get his *** kicked out of office.

1KGXts5Daa	It is meant to say (fictional depiction of non-specific founding father): "Hey, future American, we know that it's 1787 and we're all dead and buried by now, but you know that Constitution that we spent years writing?  the thing that is the very foundation of your system of government?"<br>  <br>  "Well, here's the deal: we really worked our butts off creating all the rules and processes to run this new country (you're welcome, don't mention it) and we had to make it so that the government has certain authority and powers (don't worry, it'll be okay, it won't be anything like that tyranny we fled)."<br>  <br>  "As a matter of fact, if it's not a power specifically granted to your government - then you have that power.  Enjoy your liberty and freedom!  Oh, and please take care to protect both, we went through a heck of a lot getting them for you."<br>  <br>  Amendment 9:<br>  "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."<br>  <br>  Here is a more factual (less fictional) look back at our history:<br>  <br>  Some states objected to adopting the original 1787 constitution because it lacked a bill of rights. Several states drafted proposed amendments (attachments) to the constitution, and congress met two years later to talk about them (debate them).<br>  <br>  During the debate process, some argued that adding a "bill of rights" to the constitution was dangerous because there was no way that any of them could possibly list (enumerate) all the rights that the American people had (retained).  They wanted the articles of the constitution to serve as the people's "bill of rights" (if, in sort of a seemingly backward but brilliant way).  <br>  <br>  Since the articles of the constitution go into great detail of how this new government of the United States is going to function - and what powers this government has in its judicial, legislative and executive branches - then anything not specifically listed as under the authority of the government remains under the authority of the individual citizen.<br>  <br>  In other words, if in doubt, err on the side of personal liberty.<br>  <br>  Others argued that without a bill of rights as an addendum tacked onto - thereby made part of - the constitution, the powers delegated to the government might someday expand to things that should be listed as absolutely and forever the right of American citizens - the "basic freedoms" being one of them.<br>  <br>  That is the group that won the debate, but not until they allowed 2 more amendments to be added to the 8 that had been agreed to (to make a total of 10 amendments in the "bill of rights")<br>  <br>  James Madison wrote what he thought would be a remedy to the danger of a partial enumeration (detailed listing) of rights.  He quickly wrote out the language that became the ninth and tenth amendments, which are basically one thought broken up into two sentences.<br>  <br>  Amendment 10:<br>  "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States,  respectively, or to the people."|`|XNfjaPaSaa	It means that the Founding Fathers were smart enough to realize they couldn't even imagine the kinds of questions that would come before the legislatures and courts if the country lasted more than two centuries, and they didn't want future generations' rights and freedoms to be limited by the ones they thought to specifically include based on their times.  Many of the Founding Fathers were concerned about even adding a Bill of Rights for that very reason - their philosophy was, if the Constitution didn't specifically grant the federal government the power to restrict speech, for example, then it couldn't.  You didn't need an amendment to say that it couldn't, and adding such an amendment would only lead to future interpreters assuming they *didn't* mean to protect any right they didn't specifically think to mention.  But they couldn't get the Constitution ratified without a Bill of Rights, so they assuaged those fears by including the Ninth Amendment.  To me it makes it clear that the Founding Fathers wanted the Constitution interpreted broadly and with the aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals against government interference. I guess if I have to pick one of your answers it would be B.|`|RhDPB70Baa	It means that the constitution outlines the ONLY things the government is allowed to do.  It means that all of Bush's fear mongering and Obama's communism is a direct slap in the face and a blatant insult to everything our founding fathers died for.  It means that we the mother fu*king people are supposed to be the controllers, and that this country was created on the idea that an omnipotent government is the greatest crime against mankind conceivable.  It means that when today's Americans piss away their essential liberties for the the temporary security of safety from "terrorism" or even worse for a Marxist maxim of "change" that they do not deserve either freedom or security.<br>  <br>  It means that America has become everything its forefathers hated.
t3QAaSN9aa	Obama is referring to the deficit, not the debt. McCain didn't have a clue regarding any substantial economic proposals and his economic advisor said that the current economic crisis was all in our heads.  McCain's proposals appeared to be an even more unworkable extension of trickle down, i.e., more tax cuts to the wealthy would somehow magically stimulate the economy. That has never worked and never will because it is inherently illogical.|`|m5J36D28aa	McCain promised that he knows nothing about the economy and that he would invade more countries with our troops.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	It doesn't matter what McCain said or promised, he'll never be president and we're stuck with Obama.  I'd rather concentrate on the promises that mean (or don't mean) anything.<br>  <br>  It's a little ironic to get all excited about cutting the national debt in half (I think you mean budget deficits, national debt is impossible in only 4years to pay off $5 trillion + manage budgets) after you just signed the largest spending bill in US history.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	He didn't. I tell you what he promised...to send more troops overseas to fight that's what he promised, putting a strain on a already bad economy. More Military spending to send troops, ammunition, military fuel, equipment, etc. It's time to bring home the troops. Let us guard our nation from home the way it was supposed to be (National and Coast guard) Guard our borders of our country so one attacks instead of going out there and fighting them. Plus, it's all about oil. We're doing the same thing that we've done to the Indians(Native Americans) by taking their land, Making slaves out of Africans and bringing them to America forcefully, and now I guess it's the Arabs turn...so what do we do?.....attempt to take their oil away from them by starting a war in trying to take over, meanwhile let's get the rich republicans who already have a lot of money to invest in it so by that time when the war is over and we've taken their oil we can make huge profits off of it for the time we invested in it. Some people are going to hell. Men, women, and childrend died for nothing. That blood money is going to be stained on their souls (the republicans souls).|`|2gx2LgzEaa	LOL yes, every one of em does.<br>  <br>  Notice how obama diddnt specifiy EXACTALY how he was going to do it, or what he was specifically going to get rid of?<br>  <br>  For the record, Obama TRIPLED it in less then a month... to do it now, all he would have to do is cut the programs he just put into place!

In general I would encourage people to evaluate politicians by what they do and not what they say they are going to do.  McCain would have done record spending just like Obama, whether he said he was going to do different or not.|`|My65doewaa	It's a trip isn't it?

Are people brainless?|`|4pHTkTUaaa	Well a political promise means nothing at all anyways.  Obama isn't exactly impressing me right now and if we are in as much trouble as it seems, then that would have been a lie on McCain's part----so he didn't lie then.|`|55NKPb82aa	If Obama did promise to reduce the national debt he is doing a wonderful job in adding over a trillion dollars into it.|`|vTQN4QAzaa	Didnt Obama promise....Fission cars?<br>  <br>  Then decide....to trample over the constitution...<br>  <br>  And now we have no rights?

It started long before that.|`|IpsCbw4Oaa	You people are halarious. First, the economy was going down the tube before the election even started. Next, for everyone that thinks the democratic house is responsible, let me remind you that republicans are the ones that had control for six years. Also, the economy is not a button that you turn on and off. In other words, what we are experiencing now is from bad policies that have been around for years. Not the past few months. Let me also remind you that republicans are the ones that took a surplus, and made it a deficite with a war that costs a trillion dollars every month. Not to mention the regulation issues. I love how republicans now want to blame others, and pertend to be responsible after they spent more money than any other administration, and lied to the American people.|`|93044ca7fb99900d037ad5d2e097256daa	NO Republicans have been denying the economic problems since 2001, starting with the collapse of the US dollar and the wealthy abandoning it for euros.<br>  It is no coincidence that they finally changed their tune after democrats started taking control of the government.<br>  That is how right-wingers always pass the buck to avoid taking responsibility for their own policies.<br>  <br>  The US economy always gets volatile when we choose a new leader. It is up to the new admin to pull things back together and get the ball rolling again, something the Bush admin didn't do. They denied the problems and added to them rather than trying to fix them.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	The Investor's Business Daily is a conservative rag which prints nothing but Republican/Conservative vitriol.  The fact that the market tanked over three times as much under George W.

So, as you can see under Bush, the market fell more than 5000 points, while under Obama it has only retreated 1700 points.

This is not really true. They surrendered after being defeated, following months and months of a failed Anglo-Franco policy of ignoring Hitler. Sure, they failed horribly. But they were not alone in their failure, nor did they fail for lack of trying. Furthermore, it would be tremendously unfair to say that the French did absolutely nothing to retake their homeland after being conquered, just as it would be unfair for a French person to say that the French did so unassisted (but again, I know no French person that believes this.)<br>  <br>  The other claim appears to be that France relies on the US for everything. Outside of WWII, that claim simply does not hold up.|`|fiKneZ20aa	The French helped, yes, but the only real contribution they gave was ships that blocked off a British retreat.

I'm not one of those people who thinks they owe us for helping them during WWII, but I can see how they'd rub some the wrong way.  Also, the French have some different social customs that can seem a little bit odd to Americans.  They often come across as conceited or cold.  (We have a reputation for being very open and demonstrative.) <br>  Finally, the French have thought and always will think of themselves as the cultural epicenter of the western world.  This also comes across as arrogant to Americans. It's not meant to be taken that way, they're just proud of their national identity. <br>  <br>  Most problems that people have with the French stem from their critique of our nation and from differing cultural values. I personally know some democrats that can't stand French people, when really the French are turned off by how loud they talk. (They're my in-laws. I would never say this unless they asked.)|`|hLSIRDtZaa	Because they have more money than the Republicans. You see Republicans hate Democrats because they play the role of Robin Hood.

It is a central theme of certain brands of 'state socialist' policy that the means of production, distribution and exchange, should be owned by the state on behalf of the people to allow for rational allocation and operation, and rational planning or control of the economy. Many socialists believe that public ownership enables people to exercise full democratic control over the means whereby they earn their living and provides an effective means of redistributing wealth and income more equitably.

The odds are they will make you stay in jail a night or two before you can be bonded out. You see, this type of offense makes law enforcement a little angry.Your car will be towed by a tow truck. When you get out of jail, you will have to pay the towing fee,plus the storage fee that you will be charged also.. They do this to teach you a lesson-To take law enforcement more seriously in the future.It can be an expensive lesson.

9QB658mZaa	Because it is the holiest Serbian ground.Hundreds of our medieval monasteries and churches are built there.And it is wrong to say that we expanded from a very small country,because as early as 11. century Serbia was one of largest Balkan countries.During emperor Dusan it was a huge empire.Unfortunately Turks conquered Serbia (after it was weakened by internal disputes) in 1459.And we never managed to return to our previous glory since that (even though we liberated ourselves in 1815).<br>  Kosovo is also a sight of greatest battle in Serbian history (against invading Turks) in 1389.Kosovo is Serbian holy land,cradle of our nation.We will never let it go.We will use our opportunity,NATO and USA will not be able to support our enemies forever.|`|F1bjZjkaaa	Historical continuance is something that really should not make that much of a difference here. It is about the people. <br>  Now, for the historical continuance we can see who "owns" the land. <br>  <br>  4th-1st century BC is was th Dardani, then the Romans took over. The slavs came in in the 6th-7th centuries, then it was part of the Bulgarian empire, then the Byzantine empire though it went between the serbs and the bulgarians for years.<br>  It became a stable part of serbia by the 1200s.<br>  Then came 1389, the battle of kosovo, by 1455 it was totally under the Ottoman empire. This lasted until 1912, Serbia had it until 1918, and then regained it after WW1 again. <br>  <br>  So, 1918-1999 plus 2 years 83 years. Plus 300 years to be generous, and perhaps a little more for the moving between bulgaria and serbia. so, 400 years. <br>  The ottoman empire was there 1455-1912 which is 457 years. Muslim rule. <br>  <br>  Who should therefore "own" or rule kosovo? The answer lies no where in what i have written. Today, Kosovo is ethnically 90% muslims, called albanians though in reality they are kosovars. 5% are serbs. Who should rule? <br>  <br>  The question of whether we should follow that a nation that tries to destroy other's culture, identity, or purely just killing or ethnically cleansing should have control over the population. Unfortunatly in most cases this is so. The Native Americans are still a part of the USA, Spain is still held together, northern ireland is still british, chechenya is still part of russia, tibet is still a part of china. But the question is, What is right and what is wrong? This is how the 21st century should become to be seen, not based on ideas of politicians who think this and that because this is how it used to be. <br>  <br>  People should be free to get on with their lives in the best way possible. The kosovan people were not able to do this under the serbs, so they are independent, the best solution for all, the serbs can get on with their lives and not worry about kosovo now. Deal with their own problems.|`|04021fc4881460602edfbe93dc6ae44eaa	Your question is not completely clear. You don't know yourself what you mean by the "why exactly". "Why exactly" what?<br>  <br>  Not one country in this world wants to give away its sovereign territory. Territory is not something which is on some bargain list for "giving away". It belongs to all the people of that country and only a total referendum could create the conditions for "giving it away", but even that would have to come from an unpopular political move.<br>  <br>  Who cares what resources it has, how big Serbia was yesterday or tomorrow or how many monasteries it has. There are two factors which are relevant in the issue. The key word we are talking about is the "claim".<br>  <br>  The first factor is the historical continuance. Kosovo has been settled by Neanderthals, Iliric tribes, Romans, Byzantines, Serbs, Albanian tribes, Turks, Italians, Austria Hungary, Germans, USA. Out of all these the oldest settling nation which has historical continuance are the Serbs. The famous Iliric claim holds no water. Ilirians have no historical continuity reaching today and are rather considered as groups of tribes than a centralized ruling entity.<br>  <br>  With the formation of the United Nations, all sides agreed to settle boundaries, ending active historical claims once for all. Members of UN became sovereign within their borders, under compliance of international laws and practice. This was done for the reason of settling eternal disputes and creating conditions for peaceful coexistence. Kosovo is legally an autonomous province of Serbia. Only the extension of autonomous rights can be questioned politically. <br>  <br>  To answer your question in exact terms. Serbia as member of UN Security Council, has legal sovereignty over Kosovo. Only Serbia or UN Security Council can legally proclaim Kosovo to become independent. That is the exact and only reason.

xVRGz3Oaaa	The money will go to the Govt. Mtg program to be passed out to Mtg. Owners to help Mtg. holders refinance. <br>  <br>  The hole is this is it will not free up any new funds for lending-none. It just keeps the same homes, temporarily owned (rented) by the same owners, with Mtgs. by the same holders. No money goes into the economy, just forces lenders to rewrite current loans with lower rates and lower amounts/payments. <br>  <br>  The value of the Home is not impacted since the true value of any real estate is not known until it is sold. The Govt. thinks it can determine the value of these homes today and into the future--that is pure speculation-which is a problem for any economy.<br>  <br>  This plan will lose at least 30-40% in Govt. processing fees as the salaries of all the new Govt employees overseeing-implementing the plan will be paid out of the allocated funds. That is who will be helped in this--new Govt employees-who will be the very ones who first created the Sub-Prime Mtg. mixes, which put all the so called home owners (renters) in the fix they are in now. <br>  <br>  Just another failed waste of money promoting Socialism and taking over the market pricing system.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	This brilliant plan is simply for the benefit of the banks. The homeowner is being portrayed as the victim when in fact they are the excuse. The bank will have much less to lose once this is restructured should the person (6 in 10 will anyway) default on the loan in the future because WE are going to balance out the amount owed vs actual market value. The banks will make out like the bandits they are. <br>  <br>  This will not make property values that have already seen substantial lost value go up, nor will it prevent property values from continuing on the down slop.<br>  <br>  Let's face it. The government uses the American people as victims to pad the pockets of big business and corporations. We are owned by these businesses and our government works for them, not us.|`|D5A9JUDMaa	NOOOO.......<br>  The RIGHT plan (IF we accept the government GIVING "free" money away") was to use the IRS records and send $100,000 to every person who filed a mortgage deduction last year.  (Simple, to the point, f-ing brilliant.... but that's just me..)<br>  <br>  O-Sham-a is giving money to the CROOKS who got us in trouble in the first place.... lined their pockets.... rewarded their friends....   and THEN is going to insist they NOT foreclose on those STILL not paying back their mortgages.... causing ADDITIONAL financial impact to the banks who will be "out" EVEN MORE months of missed payments before the EVENTUAL foreclosure.<br>  <br>  Obama's plan is PURE CRAP, but has a "free money" wrapper around it so no one notices the stench coming from what's inside the box.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	I think the best thing to do would not do ANYTHING.  The people that shouldn't have gotten the loans they did should end up eating in soup kitchens just like EVERYONE ELSE before all this.  5 years ago if I would have lost my job my @$$ would have been out on the street.  Why are all these lazy people so much different.  So now they are goign to give them the same loan back again so they can do it all over again.

I think the money goes to the banks and this allows them to restructure the mortgages for these people. In any case it's still the taxpayers who are basically paying for other people to stay in their homes.|`|848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	The banks who deliberately made bad loans should be allowed to eat those bad loans. The banks should be able to own the homes they approved but be forced to allow the residents to stay in the bank owned homes until the residents are able to get out. If we don't bailout the banks, they'll never knowingly offer those bad loans to anyone again. It's bad enough we have people buying crud they can't afford, but when a bank loans money to these irresponsible people they're equally guilty and should suffer the consequences and not be bailed out.<br>  We have preditor banks who loaned money to degenerates who bit more than they knew they could chew. Only those two parties should be made to suffer the results of their actions, not the entire society.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	If you are familiar with the concept of jubilee from the Bible, then you will understand what Obama plans.  There is no way to be against this plan on the basis of an intent to reduce principles and mortgage loans if one is a Christian (or a Jew, I suppose).<br>  <br>  This isn't rewarding bad behavior.  The ones who behaved badly are the banks and the mortgage brokers.  The reason radical conservatives blame the homeowners is because - as usual - they are offering opinions on something about which they know nothing.|`|3MM64geHaa	Rewarding the successful is not socialistic.

Filipino doctors even go to nursing school just so they can acquire VISAs to come to the states to work. They are not interested in becoming citizens, send money back to the Philippines bolstering that economy but not the U.S. economy, work here until retirement and then retire there wealthy in that impoverished country.

8Mi15cTtaa	that's hard - I don't trust either but at least the thug will admit he's trying to screw you out of your money.|`|pPyaUCLHaa	You know, I don't get why you have such a problem with Obama robbing your family. He knows you're one of those overly religious folks, who use God and Jesus and all those other pompous religious illusions as a guideline for their lives. And he also knows that Jesus says the rich should give to the poor. So even if he was taking your money and giving it to the less fortunate (and he isn't), he'd just be doing what Jesus tells you to do, because you're too self-involved and hypocritical to do it yourself.<br>  <br>  But back to the original question. First of all, what fear-mongering threats has Obama made? Are you sure you're not thinking of the last guy? Oh yeah, and if a street thug were in Obama's position (POTUS) he could rob your family, and most likely would, unlike Obama, who isn't. And if Obama were in a street thug's position (on the street, a common person) he wouldn't be able to rob your whole family, and wouldn't because he's not a criminal. So if you don't mind me saying, you're essentially comparing apples to oranges, unless you ask if you'd trust a street thug or Obama more in the presidency or a street thug or Obama more on the street, and the answer to both those would be a street thug, because it would be in his nature to harm you.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	At least the street thug is straightforward about his intentions.|`|FVDhYH6Baa	Obama|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Obama is a street thug.|`|reeU4N0eaa	Aren't they the same thing?|`|ljRE5MeAaa	A common street thug.<br>  If I defend myself against a street thug, there is a slight chance I will not end up in jail (NJ laws favor criminals, especially the (D) ones).<br>  Otherwise, I would not want to think of the consequences.|`|9HRkwzruaa	Well, Obama does dress better, and he smiles pretty.  He's also good with a teleprompter.<br>  <br>  But yeah, I'd have to go with the street thug.

hRc7Awfbaa	At the time of hire, were you employed as an "at will employee" meaning they could fire you without notice?  Were you hired as a temporary or contract employee or permanent employee?

But if you want unemployment benefits, you send in your application right away.|`|ndQkhqZeaa	Hired "at will" does not mean they do not have to let you know that you were fired.

Obama will be aiding this effort. There already talking about changing the dollar to the Amero. This is the currency that would be used for mexico, canada, and the usa. RFID chips are also being implemented for total government control over the people. It will be instated due to national security and to stop terrorist efforts but this is just an illusion to get people to want them.

The quickest cheap way to go is pay the fine and be on your way, the long-term cheapest way to go is the fore-mentioned.<br>  <br>  If you do violator's school, there's no points, which means no insurance increase.

Unless you have it in writing that they are going to increase your pay, they don't have to and a legit reason why they can't is because the economics of the company aren't that good. <br>  <br>  Be thankful you have a job at this point.|`|AA11510511	There is no proof os sexual discrimination within your statement.|`|AA11097492	If;<br>  <br>  You are doing the same job as the previous manager and are getting paid less, you are being screwed. This is not the same as sexual discrimination, as you'd have to show you were being paid less purely on grounds of your gender, and nothing in you question shows this to be the case, but it is still potentially illegal.<br>  <br>  The fact that someone supposedly under you gets higher wages makes it highly unlikely that you are being treated fairly, as I suspect you are expected to know more and do more as a manager than you are as a guard and therefore should be paid at a higher rate. <br>  <br>  Best advice I can offer is find your local Citizens Advice Bureau and tell them about it. They'll be able to give you a proper answer. My opinion is that you are being shafted; they'll give you an answer with knowledge behind it.|`|hRc7Awfbaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I sympathize with your situation.   It's a difficult place to be in.   I don't know what the laws in your country are.   Can you talk to HR on your own? You can also consult a lawyer to see if you have a case and to find out more about the laws in your country.  If you decide to sue, do so knowing any future employer could see you as a trouble maker.  I'm not trying to scare you.  Consider your environment. Do you like your boss and the people you work with? If not, would it be easier to find another job? Could you get payed more somewhere else?|`|q1b7170caa	You could try but short of resigning there is probably little you can do,  its a rubbish rate for anyone to be on but they are right about the economic climate, my previous firm has let 60% of staff go and the rest have had a 10% pay cut!

The higher the clearance, the more likely they would be to find out.|`|DUtOWHARaa	Certain clearance investigations are more indepth than others.  Some go back 7 years and others go back 10 years.  A background investigator will probably compare both ESPQ's (?) (old one you lied on) and the new one you'll be required to fill out.  Just tell him/her the truth and you MAY be fine.<br>  <br>  Also, joe pvt who lived in one town his whole life and didn't have more than a few jobs is likely to just get stamped off..cleared.  So no, they may not talk to every single employer, reference, etc.|`|cb4JQ4Kgaa	It is a huge deal like you stealing money and anything that can lead up to a felony don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Like what the others said. They won't look to hard and i'm sure they won't kick you out when your already at basic.<br>  <br>  But when it comes for you to get a top secret clearance which i think you won't get anytime soon they can look into that. if it isn't that bad they won;t kick you out.|`|yrBSkJKGaa	As long as they have your SS number, they can check anything.  Although since the military is desparate for recruits, I doubt that it will stand in the way of anything.|`|kVTbEb1Paa	IF they cared to find out, they could just call your boss. BUT they probably won't even try.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	If your job needs a secruity clearance, <br>  <br>  They will go talk to every past employer you have had, to verify what you told them.<br>  <br>  IE: dates you worked for them, reason for leaving the job.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	They can always find out but since they are hard up for bodies, I doubt they will look too hard.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.

The psychiatrist won't go in to detail about the things you talk to him about, if that's what you're worried about. They still follow doctor/ patient confidentiality.<br>  <br>  I hope you get better.

BphZi9yDaa	depends on what hes at ft. benning for, is he there for ocs? ait? when my husband was there i didnt have to sign him out, i could meet him on or off base, if you go on post without a military id you just get a visitors pass, i went to visit my husband there(he was my fiance at the time) almost every weekend, the people at the visitor center were very helpful in giving me directions, they should also be able to give you a map. i think that post (and the surrounding area-columbus) is pretty easy to get around(and im pretty directionally challenged too..lol) i would find out from him though if you need to meet him on post or off just to save you some time and stress. and find out what building hes in too so you can have that info ready to look up on the map or ask someone on post. good luck! if you have any more questions i can try and help.<br>  addition:<br>  tell him to ask around and see what some of the other guys are doing.  here's a map, hope it helps a little.<br>  <a href="http://www.benningmwr.com/mainpostmap.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.benningmwr.com/mainpostmap.ht...</a><br>  my guess is you'll be picking him up on post.|`|Ot7PJrddaa	If he is at Benning he is getting his break between basic and AIT.

Wow, things have really changed.<br>  <br>  If he's in AIT, then I would pick him up on base.
vGu6bcR9aa	You deserve at least a bit of jail time...and may well get some. But you've helped yourself A LOT with the court by taking all the steps that you've taken to make right what you've done and acknowledge that you know it's wrong.<br>  <br>   A suspended sentence is a possibility.|`|AA11622716	Hard to say.  You have done the right things and the victim does not want to press charges.  That is all good, but it is not her decision.  The decision to charge someone with a crime is reserved to the DA or prosecutor in your area.  Whether that person will decide to go forward, I couldn't guess.|`|0hSpsSByaa	If this is a first offense, and depending on where you are, you have a shot at probation since there is no violence involved and the victim is not insisting on jail time.  Keep up the counseling and bring the receipts to court.  Admitting what you did and trying to fix it ups the odds greatly for staying out of jail.|`|3267581d4fe0c877a2fee89c9c9a0c43aa	Wow, someone actually did the right thing after they screwed up.  I think that in and of itself deserves a round of applause.  Seriously, most people would have used your sob story as some type of means to get charges reduced or dropped due to mitigating circumstances.  On to my answer.  Seeing as I have no expertise in the legal field, I can only guess.  It sounds like the charges were originally brought by your gfs mother, and if she refuses to bring charges, then you are off the hook (for the same reason police don't arrest people when the person who was beaten refuses to press charges).  If charges were filed by anyone else, you have a little further to go, and if the state or county or municipality brought them, you might be out of luck.  However, seeing as you went a few extra miles to put things back as they were prior to the incident, you will probably get a slap on the wrist, just bring your lawyer with you.|`|u2u2uHczaa	You shouldn't have a problem staying out of jail. If the mother truly isn't going to press charges, and that story is true you shouldn't have a problem. Although I wouldn't be surprised if "second degree burglary" is on your record.

It was at one time colonized by the French and they won.  Look who has it now and what the government is, it certainly did not stay democratic.  There are a lot of parallels between it and Iraq and Vietnam was only forty years ago.  What do you expect though from politicians and a government that largely has never served in the military or fought in a war.  They have a shallow frame of reference in the history books to refer back to and no first hand, personal experience and so we have what we have now.  I don't know what generals they were listening to but I heard several say that we would be in Iraq for quite some time (like we are) if we do this and many vets along with them agreed if they (politicians) ran it like they did Vietnam instead of the military running it.|`|QyzPLCNTaa	Age : 19 - 25<br>  Gender: Male<br>  Student<br>  <br>  <br>  1)Vietnam borders Cambodia, Laos, China and Thailand, in Asia<br>  <br>  2) France<br>  <br>  3) North Vietnam's Communist Regime, US pulled out and N Vietnam took over<br>  <br>  4) Yes, Lost support and drawn out

OHfZFR31aa	This sounds like a complete scam to me.<br>  <br>  If you want to enter the greencard the lottery, you do so on your own and it doesn't cost anything. You don't go through an agency or consultancy - they can't do anything to increase your chances. It's a random lottery. You enter directly through the US government, though the entry is already closed for this year<br>  <br>  As for sponsoring the visa, the company hiring you is supposed to pay for that visa. That's what sponsorship is - they cover your visa application fees. I've been sponsored for work visas in 4 different countries and have NEVER had to pay anything towards my work visa. The company has always paid the visa fees.<br>  <br>  Do you really believe they would ever refund you 80k? Why not turn it around to them and tell them you will pay them 80k only when they have secured your visa. I can just imagine that scammers shut down after a few months so you can't trace your missing money, then reappear under a new name and address.<br>  <br>  It's also worrying that their website doesn't even have a corporate address listed on it and. What sort of legitimate consulting firm does not list all of their US and overseas office addresses on their site? They also do not list the names of any of their executives which is also unusual on a company profile.|`|1AzCDrO6aa	it is a scam.|`|yTdQUqVRaa	It sounds off to me for 2 big reasons.<br>  <br>  1. If they're sponsoring you for a visa (presumably H1B since there's a job offer in play), then there is no need for you to go through the visa lottery.<br>  <br>  2. It doesn't cost any where near close to $80,000 to get a visa.|`|8OYONwrpaa	Sounds like a scam.

9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	The Iranian government is a potential threat to the West and to Israel. Their leader is very open about the fact he watns to see Israel wiped from the face of the earth and I'm sure that if he had the power he would do so. If Iran was a more powerful nation than I would be very afraid as that would be a potential WW3 but as things stand at the moment Iran could not hope to win a war against america or the UK and it would be a very difficult war if they chose to fight Israel (but the US would intervene if that happened anyways).<br>  If Iran ever manages to produce Nuclear Weapons then we should all be very afraid, religous extremism and the power to nuke entire countries is not a good combination.
pnkyubEAaa	Despite what the knucklehead above me said, I've sailed all over the world on Coast Guard ships.  Hong Kong, Sweden, Germany, Finland, Bermuda, Colombia, Panama, Dominican Republic, etc....<br>  Since we're much much smaller than our Navy brethren, you'll generally be given more responsibility at lower pay grades than you would in the Navy.  In the CG, a LT jg can command a ship. No way in the Navy.  Also, with so many people, the Navy can afford to highly specialize its enlisted jobs (rates).  The CG can't do that.  Many of our rates encompass several Navy rates. The CG can perform law enforcement, the Navy can not.  The Coast Guard will generally go to sea for 6 to 8 weeks.  The Navy leaves behind their families for 6 months.  Also, with so many people, I've seen the Navy stick senior enlisted people on jobs that the CG would only give to a junior enlisted (gate guard).  Navy=just a number  CG=an individual who is known|`|rF0zUeKvaa	The Navy is combat-oriented...we have vessels that carry weapons, each of those vessels is fitted with physically-trained Sailors that are ready to answer the call of duty when hostiles come to threaten the ship...<br>  <br>  The Coast Guard is rescue-intensive...I don't know if Coast Guard ships leave the United States proximity but I highly doubt it...the Coast Guard is comparable to the National Guard only water-inclusive|`|tM5MdSDPaa	The name Coast Guard pretty much sums it up. While active duty Coasties do travel overseas, they don't do it as often as the Navy does. Their priorities are to maintaining maritime security in all US oceans and waterways. That includes search and rescue, port security, intelligence, and law enforcement.|`|znLzOCHlaa	Coast Guard rescues people and patrols american land and sea, and the navy dont really rescue people and might not be stationed in american waters.|`|3059c69d713a3b3f99a4757099599918aa	Coast guard is almost purely a defensive military branch. They are the last line of defense in an invasion or attack. Because of this, they are required to patrol the seas and coasts near the States trying to discover threats or information to United States. Often times when not in times of threat this will include drug patrols on the sea, search and rescues, and disaster relief. The Navy is a more traditional Military branch, dedicated to neutrality and strikes in offensive invasions, as well as cover and transportation of land units.

How about first he asks why there are more black prisoners than white ones as a start before calling us cowards?|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	No. Holder is just the Rev Wright in a rubber mask.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	No. Basically, he is saying that we "pretend" to not be racist, working with each other, etc, but then we all go home on the weekends and segregate. Hmmm...<br>  <br>  Should I seek out all my minority neighbors and have a party? (or does hanging out with my lesbian Hispanic best friend and her black relatives count?)  I don't know. Apparently NOT, because it was by MY choice and theirs. He also basically said we don't have the nerve to have any conversations about race and that we can't have conversations. He is right, but not for the reasons he stated. We can't have those conversations. Americans (and a lot of them white!) attack people on personal grounds stretching it into destroying them professionally should they utter a word regarding race. To Americans who are confused about the issue and seek to redeem themselves through their white guilt by persecution of others for the cause--just saying the word "black" sends them into a frenzy.<br>  <br>  So, the cowards are Mr. Holder and those who seek to destroy anyone who doesn't agree with them. Right now, it's just a vocal battle. However, the way things are going...it could change. Civil unrest is pretty close for a variety of reasons (not just this one) and all I can say is....I imagine MOST of these people will not be so damn sanctimonious in the future when reality pays them a visit.|`|mBZU9a1Baa	I think it was more of a Freudian slip, regarding his own inability to find gainful employment outside of the Government.|`|Wd5HJJqbaa	I think it should be addressed how obama got elected based on race, not substance.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Helps when you link the rest of the story to what your talking about.

But if this little arrogant kid tries to pick a fight with Iran, oh man, HE WILL BE KNOCKED OUT.<br>  <br>  Iran does not believe in pre-emptive strikes, but will fire 11,000 rockets, missiles, mortars, shells, bomb, etc. if any country attacks it. some of those 11,000 toys will also go to countries that assist in the attack.

Short, isn't it?|`|l0yesNhdaa	No!!!|`|KOGxur8Vaa	While it's true that if it were in reverse, the legal system would invariably label the offence as a hate crime, if we're being completely fair, it might not actually be race related.<br>  <br>  Chances are if he pissed of an asian kid, the kid will have asian friends.<br>  The victim could have been white, asian, oriental, hispanic, black, etc, and regardless, it seems that person was going to get a beating.<br>  <br>  People have been beating eachother up for hundreds of years.. so whether or not it was actually race-related... the media found an opening, something controversial that we'd all talk about,and made a big deal of the story.. we're talking about it right?<br>  This very moment, kids are beating eachother up everywhere, but 99% of the cases won't make the news.<br>  <br>  Assuming it was a race-related attack... there's very little they can do to prove or disprove this, and the legal system does tend to turn 180 and favor minorities on these rare occasions. 'I'm not getting this job 'cause i'm black', etc.<br>  <br>  Either way, you'll do yourself no good getting angry at the judicial system. There's plenty you can do about it. For example try the number 10 website for starters.<br>  <br>  HFS.|`|8ZUs3qxxaa	Huh. Well, I guess it is. Some people are just...demented. White people are usually seen as the racist people because, well, they have the conditions to be racist. You have to acknowledge that white people do kind of "rule the world" lol.<br>     But given the conditions, everyone could be just as racist and even worse. So I guess here the Asians are being racist. But gosh not all Asians are racist opportunists. I've noticed there's a lot of ranting conservative anti-immigrants answers here. Like there's a bunch of people raging about how dirty ol' damn foreigners are polluting the pure good ol' whites in noble countries and stuff. Yeah...<br>      Anyway, if the point of your asking people to "explain" this to you was to win a bunch of agreements about how white people are too often wrongly painted as racists, I have to agree. There's racists of every race, and evidently Asians can be racist too. It's just that a lot of people answering here about how white people are being classified as the only racists are kind of racist themselves lol. Yeah, someone's going to give me a thumbs-down. Too liberal of an answer, huh?|`|d2fcf78a4441e801854c7b22e08d60b8aa	To demonstrate it is a racist attack you need more than the fact that the attackers and victim were of different races. On the basis of the article nothing suggests that the attack was racially motivated. There was an altercation in the school corridor. It would all depend on the evidence that the attack was actually due to race. It would be necessary to show this beyond a reasonable doubt.<br>  <br>  Apart from Mr Webster's assertion the article provides no evidence that this wasn't simply connected to the earlier disagreement. The youths were given prison terms for the actual assault.|`|ZN2dmoEnaa	I had the same thing happen to me a couple years ago in Seattle. It was defiantly racist, while they were trying to beat me they kept saying things like'how you like that white boy?'. it was 8 asian gangbangers on two white boys. At first they caught us off guard and attacked us, but we turned it around. As we left them all on the ground bleeding, I tossed the metal pipe that I took from one of them. My nose is still crooked from getting hit with that pipe, but I'm sure their faces are even more crooked now.<br>  After I had the pipe, they were trying some lame kung-fu that doesn't work when I was just clubbing them in the head with the metal pipe repeatedly. <br>  <br>  Asian males don't like white guys, because the asian girls like white guys better than asian guys. So they try to beat us, big mistake. My last 3 girlfriends have been asian.|`|ZbG4adQmaa	Ahh - but didn't you know that it only works one way and NEVER the other way according to the powers that be.  Let me tell you something that happened to by husband a couple of years ago.<br>  <br>  He worked in a team of about 12 IT specialists.  Within the team there were 5 Asian guys.  During one of their shifts some of the guys were having a discussion re. cricket.  One of the Asian guys made a comment, and I quote "You Whitey's cannot play Cricket to save your lives".  At this point my Husband sat with his chin on his lap for about 10 seconds.  He then closed his mouth and told this guy "you have just made a racist remark and I find it very offensive ".  To which this Asian guy said "No that is not racist, I am never racist".  Husband asked why he thought that and his reply was "I am Asian and because I am Asian I am not a racist, but you white people are because you are white".  Says it all really doesn't it!!<br>  <br>  Oh BTW my husband did report this to HR and nothing was ever done about it!!<br>  <br>  Bigmha2000 : No the reason for the lack of racial cohesion is not because of "white people" it is because of people like you with your slanted views.  Not heavy on the sarcasm - not required!!|`|xKjm7t5Iaa	A disagreement is a disagreement just because the two involved were different races does not make it racially motivated.

It never works the other way round. Having said that, these Asians could have had a fight with the white boy without there being a racial aspect to it in the same way as a white gang could pick on a white boy or a black gang on a black boy. On the surface, it does look like a racially-motivated attack but we haven't been shown any evidence.|`|c30e7d5dc21c881fa2b4e10f9ca03ee5aa	what do you mean asian, that is a big continent and can basically mean anyone from syria to japan.|`|doLyOac0aa	The race card can only be used against a white person, sick country we live in, eh?|`|yPncyjK1aa	It only works one way, didn't you know?|`|AA12020119	"The jury heard last year that Mr Webster had had a disagreement with an single Asian youth in the school corridor.

They almost killed the kid ,, he was in a comma and all kinds of stuff wrong. But when it was brought up that the attack was racist,,all the blacks said no no no the white kid was sitting under our tree and he did that to make us mad cause he knew it was our tree..!! All the blacks defended these ghetto children and they were soon released out of jail with jackson and sharpton there hugging the boys and all that ****!

So it is NOT a "thing of the past" and it IS still a part of tradition. they also DO wear them to things like change of commands, hail and fairwells, Military balls and other special events. <br>  A individual unit IS ALLOWED to have it's own regs about what one must do to wear the Stetson. <br>  Some require that you MUST have earned spurs in order to wear it (be they Spur ride spurs or Combat spurs) . <br>   It is NOT only for those in the horse detachment. <br>  There is NO brim difference between an Officers and an Enlisted Stetson. <br>  The difference comes when the Hat cords is applied. Here is the differences between the colors: <br>  General officers shall wear solid gold hat cords. <br>  Company and field grade officers shall wear black and gold hat cords. <br>  Warrant officers shall wear black and silver hat cords. <br>  All enlisted ranks shall wear cords designated for their branch (yellow: cavalry; red: artillery; green/white, medical, etc.).  If hat cords are not available in a particular branch color, the yellow (cavalry) cord or the primary color cord of assigned unit May be worn.  Black hat cords are not authorized. <br>  <br>  Branch and rank insignia is worn centered on the front of the hat.  Rank is worn over the branch insignia.  Branch insignia includes standard or regimental branch insignia.  Embroidered or metal “period’ branch insignia from the Civil war, Indian wars, or modern era are authorized.  The distinctive unit insignia (DUI), more commonly referred as unit crest is worn centered on the back of the hat.  Care should be taken when selecting insignia to avoid gaudiness.   <br>  <br>  Additional insignia or decorations such as unit, division, regimental pins, miniature combat infantryman badges, etc. may be worn on the side of the hat, above the hat cord at the wearer’s discretion.  When worn as authorized headgear for parade only branch insignia, rank and DUI are to be worn.   <br>  <br>  For more info on what CAV deems appropriate wear of the Stetson you can visit <a href="http://www.1cda.org/cav_hat_moi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.1cda.org/cav_hat_moi.htm</a> for info on the specs of the actual Stetson go to: <a href="http://www.cavhooah.com/stetson.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cavhooah.com/stetson.htm</a> and scroll towards the bottom.|`|AA11163314	Both officers and enlisted wear the Stetson.

The US denies that the Guantanamo Bay belongs to the existing government of Cuba or to any other existing foreign government. And by denying this, it denies its status as ‘foreign soil.’ So by simply occupying it in defiance of local government, the US asserts its territorial rights to it and makes it de facto US territory.

AA11546221	The Madoff situation is a prime example of why I would be worried on where I would put my hard-earned money. Thank god I don't have an account there. In fact, this is a spectacular scandal causing huge losses that undermines trust in the financial industry. Maddoff's apparent scam, which may have cost investors billions of dollars, comes as the industry tries to rebuild its tarnished image with cash-strapped and often times disillusioned investors. If a person worked all there life & saved their money in an investment firm, only to find out the account has been wiped out (Balance: $0), that would scare the *hit out of me. Where's the bail out money for that?<br>  <br>  The stimulus bill makes sense & I also have faith in it. Obama warned the nation's mayors (& govenors) that he will hold officials at all levels of government accountable for how they spend federal stimulus money, pledging to "call them out" if the funding is wasted on projects that do not generate jobs. Obama's signing of the stimulus plan means that money will soon begin flowing in states and cities over who controls how that funding will be spent. I've noticed here in Washington state that people's approach to receiving federal funds for whatever reason --tend to get greedy. Our dumb Seattle Mayor, Greg "McFat" Nickels, said that he hopes to use its stimulus money to speed up in rebuilding major road projects. But what about jobs that were slashed? We'll just have to see what happens since Obama is holding them accountable on how federal funds are used.|`|Mq16QtmFaa	The people with really big money created this crisis on purpose I'm sure they want to make it much worse,its called "Disaster Capitalism" after everyones savings are destroyed they will have a new group of former middle class to enslave|`|JthubNIsaa	I don't need any brainiacs to tell me commercial is failing.

It inhibits investment, but people should be more careful with their investments than they have been.  Look at all those people in Palm Beach who got into financial trouble because they trusted practically all their finances to Madoff.  Didn't they ever hear about diversification of risk and doing your own research?
5dRvtaGgaa	I'd have to agree.|`|LfrsrJEDaa	The market is really  people like us. Helping out people because they cannot pay their mortgages, helping banks who put out bad loans, and the car industry is a joke.

So it's no wonder they react negatively when they hear words like rules, regulations, nationalization, pay limits, no golden parachute etc.<br>  <br>  We were all living in an overly inflated balloon and it burst.

No one is spending their way out of a recession - only a moron would think that.  The spending is getting done to get the money moving.  Then the economy will work itself out.  <br>  <br>  2.  This was going on long before President Obama got into the White House.  Matter of fact, things were going wrong about 3 years ago.  Bush just put on his rose-colored glasses and said that everything was fine and it would all work itself out.  Yeah, how did that method work??<br>  <br>  Basically people, the economists are all stating that this is the way to go.  And I would take their opinion over the opinions of a bunch on here that are either in school still, or working a job that has nothing to do with the stuff their spewing about.  Really, get a clue.<br>  <br>  And by the way - there are many alternatives to staying here with a President that is ruining your nation, isn't there??  Don't let me keep you here. . .|`|AA12324370	I don't necessarily think it is his fault.  I don't think it's Bush's fault either.  It's a little early in Obama's presidency to say it is his fault.

Just a little bit of hypocrisy it seems, eh?<br>  Of all of the Hollywood elite Democrats have never run one for president that I can recall. That doesn't mean a few haven't tried, but none have ever gotten the nomination. Dems haven't even placed one in the governors office. Just because Arnood doesn't play the right wing games they hang him in effigy, but still keep voting him in just because he has that big R by his name on the ballot.

Instead of making markets efficient, free market policies such as deregulation have made special interests richer and made the majority of people vulnerable to market manipulations by speculators and large corporations.<br>  The solution to reducing the price of gas and basic foodstuffs begins with educating the public about the failure of free market ideologies. As progressives, we need to show how Reaganomics and free markets have created the mess in which we now find ourselves. We can do this by pointing out how people spouting off the benefits of Reaganomics are responsible for higher gas prices, higher food prices, war and other economic hardships.<br>  The last 8 years have proven that giving huge tax cuts to the rich does not provide the incentive to invest in the economic growth of the USA.<br>  It only gave them to invest in the stock market and job growth in other countries.<br>  The only proven way to give the rich the incentive to invest in the economic growth of the USA is to raise their taxes greatly.<br>  When you are taxed at 70%, you will invest, invest and invest so that you can put most of that 70% to work for you instead of the government.<br>  Which should lead to even more income the next year and even more investing.<br>  In 1918 congress increased the top tax rate to 77%, it led to a booming economy in the 1920s.<br>  In the late 1920s when they reduced the top tax rate to 25%, it led to the Great Depression.|`|f2uQOcY8aa	Actors, in general are to ignorant and self centered.

I think the problem with Y!A's is that there area a lot of people who post rants and raves in the form of questions that are facilitated towards an answer the asker wants.  Take your question for example.  The verb-age is narrow so that the answers you will receive are only going to be a yes or no with very little evidence to back them up.

James Gordon Brown was Chancellor of the Exchequer during “the longest period of growth” in the UK ’s history, but economists blame Mr Brown for encouraging soaring house price inflation and the spread of credit which fuelled the years of boom and led eventually to the current bust. <br>  <br>  In a recent speech to the London School of Economics, George Osbourne, the Shadow Chancellor, said: "Our competitors used the fat years to prepare for the lean years. Britain did not. We are the least prepared country in the developed world to cope with the current financial turbulence. Our financial reputation has been badly damaged by the only run on a retail bank in the world. Our double deficits - external and fiscal - are worse than any other European economy. Taken together, they are worse than the United States." The blame "lies squarely and fairly with Gordon Brown", he concluded".

emNCaAq7aa	The instructor did not say the US or even similar CJ systems. The old Napoleonic system did attempt to seek justice.<br>  Kind of funny, Back in the 70'd my local commuter university offered a CJ major. The intro in the catalog said some of the same stuff, (not for argument sake, they meant it), what was even better the intro said that if you did not agree with them you should not major in CJ at that school.  Us cops going part time (not for CJ classes) could not let on that we were the hated police or it was an automatic flunk from some of the instructors.<br>  <br>  Now as to the statement. I agree that in the US a small part of CJ  has nothing to do with justice, it is when it occurs, a byproduct. Our CJ system, especially the courts and the advocate system used for findings, does not seek justice or the truth. I do not agree that it was designed by those in power to keep themselves safely in power or to fool the masses that government cares..<br>  It is a very flawed system in that it does not seek truth but follows law and judicial opinion. It often does not work and is based on the idea that there is no absolute truth but arguing about what happened (advocating) will somehow lead to justice if not the truth.<br>  <br>  One of the reason I liked being a cop and a detective instead of a layer was that we cops looked for the truth, we were neutral and did not advocate for a side.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	Not true.  It is a statement by someone who has something criminal happen to him (or someone he knows) and the outcome was not to his liking.

We all know of instances where the results were not to our liking, but it is (in the USA) still the best justice system in the world.|`|HBx6q05Oaa	Wow, what a nut job!

Despite all of the Wall Street greed and corruption, it's still a thousand times better than what we are headed for under Obama.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Because it does exactly the opposite.  Obama is not stupid.  He just has a totally different agenda that what he has told the American public.  When someone's actions are not consistent with their words, this usually means they mean what they do, not what they say.  Therefore, Obama obviously wants to screw up the economy so that the government can have more control over it, bringing us closer to the socialist dictatorship that he wants this country to be.|`|cl9Ghxrlaa	Yup.  They sure are.  They remember the "boneheaded" investments he made several years ago.  There was a blurb in the local paper here back in 2007 that said he unwittingly invested in several bad stocks.

lCwmfNuraa	It seems so. 50 years ago there was work and home and that's it. People made just enough money to get by and everyone seemed to be fine with that. Going out to eat meant going to the local diner or ma & pa restaurant, not steak houses, buffets, bistros three to four times a week. Families ate more meals at home together, real meals not mac n cheese.<br>  <br>  Loans that mislead us into thinking we can afford something when in reality we can't, never existed. Business was done honestly to try to help everyone not to burn everyone. <br>  <br>  Children had music & dance lessons at school with the gym teacher about twice a week not daily. Children played outside in the sun, snow, sleet and rain. Parents today feel obligated to buy game consoles, computer games and so on. <br>  <br>  People knew how to live within their means 40 - 50 years ago.

It's just a convenient method of keeping track of the exchange of labor and resources between individuals, groups and nations.  The problem is, for every needed thing we produce for ourselves, we produce ten for lazy, shiftless, and quite frankly, evil, slobs who contribute nothing to the system.  Our system of money has evolved to cover up what is going on.  But, the system is collapsing under its own weight.<br>  <br>  When it finally collapses, the parasites that wiped it out are all going to starve to death.  Entire nations, and at least one entire continent are going to experience massive starvation and die off of their populations.  The penalty nature will exact upon them for not creating the means to provide for their own people (despite having many times the resources that the western world does).<br>  <br>  And once the people of the developed nations truly grasped what happened and why, such a thing will never be allowed to happen again.
hcc8fq7jaa	As a conservative, I would have preferred that GW have drawn Iraq and Iran into another war. We could have even sold them each the arms to annihilate each other.

Of course, not ALL Muslims share his thinking, but there are a significant number that do. It IS a cultural issue... not a mental health issue. But many Westerners... obviously, yourself included... just have a hard time realizing that fact. We just can't conceive of that line of thinking, but that doesn't make it any less real. Muslim honor killings have been going on for generations... including here in America. This is by no means the first.<br>  <br>  But as to trying to make this some sort of argument against trying to bring democracy to the Middle-East, what has one got to do with the other? I seriously doubt Bush ever believed he was going to totally do away with Muslim extremist fundamentalism.

3fa6f56441b907487541819a03872781aa	I know that Obama has a hideously horrible attendance  and voting record in the Senate, voting present half of the time and on the campaign trail the other half. I know that when he did vote it was against saving the lives of babies who survive abortion attempts; and that in general his record is extremely liberal in both economic and moral issues. I know that he has a tendency to break away fro lifelong friends and associations, both political and spiritual, the moment such association becomes detrimental to his career; and that he puts up a remarkable charade of pretending he never knew the person. I know that he is likely to criticize Republicans for debating a bill and label their efforts as "stalling"; and I know that if he knows he has enough votes to get a bill passed he'll rush it through Congress faster than a UPS delivery; not giving the slightest care who has read the bill nor how much of an affect the bill will have on future generations; putting up a brilliant acting performance the whole time that his bill was the only alternative to doom and that if they didn't act in a day or two on it the Earth would open up and the country would cave in. Then in a speech he'll hide his far left and sneaky agenda by intermixing it in with things that few could disagree with like health care and helping children. I know that he is dishonest and a liar; and not that I want to sound like a whacko; but to be honest I am not even 100% sure he was even born in America. <br>  <br>  That's what I know about Obama's politics.|`|FKDv6ycbaa	If you dont know whats going on with this country after 2 years of election campaigns, than im not doing your homework for you. obama the big ear'd circus freek has already put the country in the gutter with his trillion dollar welfare package, thats all their is to it. Oh yea, IMPEACH THE F"N FOOL!!!!!!!!|`|gc16g57Iaa	The people that voted for Obama are, for the large part, sheep who voted as if it were American Idol. Don't expect many intelligent responses.|`|qlduZDO3aa	He wrote an entire book about his policies.  It's called "The Audacity of Hope".  Read it.  He explains his ideas better than anyone here could.|`|9bgBIzjFaa	I would like to know when he plans to resign|`|G6yyceAxaa	I don't think I saw your previous question, but I would like to answer this one.<br>  <br>  Obama's politics would be a bad way of phrasing it. his policy however are not written in stone.<br>  <br>  As with former president Bush, sometimes you need to change the plan due to unforeseen issues (in his case 9/11)<br>  <br>  there are a couple things that I like, first, his willingness to listen and talk.  some people may say he is headstrong, however Governor Jalin commented on how much he enjoyed being able to have his say, and to be acknowledged for it.<br>  <br>  I don't care who is president, you will always have dissenters, and like the old saying goes "the greasy wheel gets greased"  so people that don't like Obama for whatever reason will constantly find issue in any and everything he does.  he could be getting all his ideas from John McCain, and people would still criticize.<br>  <br>  His Idea to shift focus to Afghanistan from Iraq is a good one, as Iraq never posed a threat to the US, however Afghanistan and that region actually do.<br>  <br>  The jury is still out on the stimulus package, however I am glad that he is doing something. and as far as the pork argument, I looked at a few issues, and I honestly don't see anything wrong with giving 100 million to the National endowments for the arts.<br>  <br>  I really like his work ethic also, because he is pretty much doing everything he said he would do in his campaign.<br>  <br>  I didn't vote for Obama because of personality or any other shallow thing like that.  I listened to debates, read policies, looked at his tax plan and McCain's.  the one thing that actually made me vote for his was his lack of Washington experience.  seems that everybody in Washington works for some major corp and not for the American people.<br>  <br>  Also, since I have lived through the Reagan "trickle down" economics, and know that it didn't work (sure people can show numbers and all this crap, but fact is Detroit looked like the set of Mad Max, desolate)<br>  <br>  the numbers game can be manipulated, so I look at what is happening on the ground, and not what wall street says, or any other polls.  <br>  <br>  you can't piss in my face and tell me it's raining|`|Gbwiwkauaa	You have said that Obama's plan is one that's been tried and has failed - do you mean another bail out? Bush and Paulson's bailout money went to Wall Street, banks and corporate CEOs. They wanted no over sight as to how the money was used - resulting in huge bonueses and trips for the people who helped create this mess.  What I think about is the cause of the economic crisis in this country. I certainly did not vote for President Obama because of his personality. His opponent was John McCain. What did McCain do to help create the mess we are in now. Do you know? Phil Graham was an advisor to John McCain. Besides saying the economic problem was in our heads, do you know how he contributed to this mess? Tax cuts for the rich and deregulation of Wall Street is at the heart of our problems - both of which John McCain and the Republicans voted for. The only thing Republicans know is tax cuts. Why would I vote for a man who helped to create this mess?<br>  <br>  President Obama has an impressive resume - including President of the Harvard Law Review - twenty years of experience. He is willing to reach out to the other side - something a Republican controlled Congress and White House was unwilling to do. President Obama will represent the people more than a Republican administration.<br>  <br>  John McCain's campaign was dishonest and racist - a disgrace. His choice of Sara Palin as his VP pick shows what we would have to look forward to. These are the people who talk about Joe six-pack  and Sam the Plumber, but their policies help the business owners and not the workers themselves.|`|XYLbZ1f1aa	You are looking for "proven evidence that you know it will work" on Y!A? <br>  <br>  The government itself for both Obama and Bush and many others have even admitted they do not know "Exactly" what will work but are trying everything they can come up with. <br>  <br>  I doubt you will find your proven evidence and facts on Y!A of what will work...The last time we were in a depression a war was what helped us out...this time a war helped us get in one.<br>  <br>  Our country is very young and has not had to deal with this very often as we have been lucky. noone really has all the answers you seek. If they did, it would have been fixed by now.|`|JO8YzDNVaa	Darr, I think he is gud... uhhh... he is pretty and talks nicey.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps bolster your impression of liberal democrats.

Most of which were serving during Clinton's term, a time of economic prosperity. Nobody knows how things will turn out, but McCain admitted he knew little about the economy.|`|reeU4N0eaa	I know he is trying his best to wreck the economy and force his sheep to believe government is the only answer to society's problems.  This is how he plans to usher in socialism.|`|HLf1QYd1aa	He is preparing himself for dictatorship|`|yrDqtazLaa	I do not vote on personality, color, religion, whatever. I vote on policies. I do understand what he's planning to do and what he has to do. This country is run in a mixed economy, both socialist and capitalist. To make the economy prosper, it has to be run that way. We're not trying things that have failed, the "trickle down" policy Bush used isn't what Obama's wanting to do. He wants to help the middle-class, which makes plenty of sense since the middle-class is what stimulates the economy more than anything. He wants to create more jobs and bring back our jobs that have been sent overseas to give people the opportunity to work. He also wants to remove our troops from Iraq, some of which will be going over to Afghanistan to catch Bin Laden. He plans on doing Healthcare reforming, and possibly making Universal healthcare. I know people have logical arguments about universal healthcare, but I think it would be good to have. That's just a little of what I have.

Bush.<br>  <br>  Sure, I disagree with some of Bush's policies, but to be honest, I don't think he was a bad president, especially not as bad as the left-wing media is portraying him to be.<br>  <br>  History is typically objective. The likely outcome of history's assessment of George W. Bush will be portraying him as a man who dealt with the 9/11 terrorist attacks to best of his ability: by starting the War on Terror to defend America from our pernicious enemies who hate us (is there really anything so bad about that? - the liberals in the media would have you believe so).<br>  <br>  Although the media hates George W.

You all seriously believe that Iraq is going to become "a shining beacon of democracy" and yet fail to realize that the country in still in rather extreme turmoil and will remain so long after we leave.  Additionally, what proof do any of us have that Al-Qaeda is "growing weaker" I certain have yet to see any proof of this in the U.S. Media.  Given enough time I am certain that history will look marginally kinder on GWB then the liberal media but that is somewhat similar to looking at a dictator during his reign and then looking at the same dictator 50 years after.

Most American Soldiers have various religions and beliefs.  Each very in his/her religious/belief commitment and do not believe that a Devinne power sent them to war.<br>  Instead it is love of country and the fact that our government sent us to war that we do what we do.

According to the U.S. Census, in 1990, the number of immigrants was estimated at 28 million. Fourteen years later that number increased to 32 million. Most of the 32 million immigrants are Hispanic with Asians as the second largest cohort.  In a report published by the CEA, or Council of Economic Advisers, immigrants were found to positively contribute to the U.S. economy.<br>  <br>  The data indicate that immigrants contribute more than $30 billion in income for American workers (U.S. born). <br>  <br>  Other reports indicate that immigrants had a lower probability of ending up in prison and committing crimes, as compared to individuals born in the US. The CEA report also found that immigrant workers in the United States yield a greater output. Immigrants play a role in the country’s macroeconomic growth and their taxes help increase public budgets. The study found that on average, immigrants and their offspring contribute nearly $80,000 more in tax revenue compared to natives. This figure helps to offset the problem that will arise with the nation’s Social Security system, but it will not take care of the problem entirely. Due to the large number of “Baby Boomers” retiring in the near future, the number of retirees will outnumber the number of contributors. The Medicare program has also seen an increase in enrollees and will also benefit from addition tax revenue.|`|ABdZDjjcaa	They don't. mexico is in america|`|G4TJ8nibaa	Crime pays better in the US!|`|IZALRGWqaa	money and nothing else

He said he would not cancel the Bush tax cuts expiring in 2010.  He said he would back substantial spending for infrastructure projects across the Country, extend unemployment benefits and food stamp increase.

We demand the unification of all Germans in the Greater Germany on the basis of the right of self-determination of people. <br>  2.We demand equality of rights for the German people in respect to the other nations; abrogation of the peace treaties of Versailles and St. Germain. <br>  3.We demand land and territory (colonies) for the sustenance of our people, and colonization for our surplus population. <br>  Only a member of the race can be a citizen. A member of the race can only be one who is of German blood, without consideration of creed. Consequently no Jew can be a member of the race. <br>  Whoever has no citizenship is to be able to live in Germany only as a guest, and must be under the authority of legislation for foreigners. <br>  The right to determine matters concerning administration and law belongs only to the citizen. Therefore we demand that every public office, of any sort whatsoever, whether in the Reich, the county or municipality, be filled only by citizens. We combat the corrupting parliamentary economy, office-holding only according to party inclinations without consideration of character or abilities. <br>  We demand that the state be charged first with providing the opportunity for a livelihood and way of life for the citizens. If it is impossible to sustain the total population of the State, then the members of foreign nations (non-citizens) are to be expelled from the Reich. <br>  Any further immigration of non-citizens is to be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans, who have immigrated to Germany since the [2 August 1914], be forced immediately to leave the Reich. <br>  All citizens must have equal rights and obligations. <br>  The first obligation of every citizen must be to work both spiritually and physically. The activity of individuals is not to counteract the interests of the universality, but must have its result within the framework of the whole for the benefit of all Consequently we demand: <br>  Abolition of unearned (work and labour) incomes. Breaking of rent-slavery. <br>  In consideration of the monstrous sacrifice in property and blood that each war demands of the people personal enrichment through a war must be designated as a crime against the people. Therefore we demand the total confiscation of all war profits. <br>  We demand the nationalisation of all (previous) associated industries (trusts). <br>  We demand a division of profits of all heavy industries. <br>  We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare. <br>  We demand the creation of a healthy middle class and its conservation, immediate communalization of the great warehouses and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in contracts with the State, county or municipality. <br>  We demand a land reform suitable to our needs, provision of a law for the free expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility, abolition of taxes on land and prevention of all speculation in land. <br>  We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, usurers, profiteers and so forth are to be punished with death, without consideration of confession or race. <br>  We demand substitution of a German common law in place of the Roman Law serving a materialistic world-order. <br>  The state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national education program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education and subsequently introduction into leading positions. The plans of instruction of all educational institutions are to conform with the experiences of practical life. The comprehension of the concept of the State must be striven for by the school [Staatsbuergerkunde] as early as the beginning of understanding. We demand the education at the expense of the State of outstanding intellectually gifted children of poor parents without consideration of position or profession. <br>  The State is to care for the elevating national health by protecting the mother and child, by outlawing child-labor, by the encouragement of physical fitness, by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young. <br>  We demand abolition of the mercenary troops and formation of a national army. <br>  We demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the press. In order to enable the provision of a German press, we demand, that: a. All writers and employees of the newspapers appearing in the German language be members of the race: b. Non-German newspapers be required to have the express permission of the State to be published. They may not be printed in the German language: c. Non-Germans are forbidden by law any financial interest in German publications, or any influence on them, and as punishment for violations the closing of such a publication as well as the immedi|`|AA10928202	<a href="http://lebbeuswoods.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/slum-mumbai1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://lebbeuswoods.files.wordpress.com/...</a>|`|tyCnjhXCaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_republic" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_repu...</a>|`|vxYCkGcsaa	For me personally,I would say it will be like new orleans after the storm.Thats just my opinion because I am an Obama fan.They will probably re-elect Obama over and over till he can't be Prezident no more.I know that doesn't answer your question but it makes the answer have more sence.

Obama can and will do everything he can to help our economy.  Think about this a second.

The next largest department in the US is LAPD with over 9,000 so they would have at least four. <br>  <br>  The badge number is unique to the department, so a small department could have only two.<br>  <br>  Some departments issue the same numbers when someone retires.

AA11156037	That would be C. <br>  <br>  Kim Il Sung petitioned Stalin several times in 1949 for permission to invade South Korea. In late January 1950 Stalin finally gave his assent and dispatched large amounts of military aid and Soviet advisers to prepare the invasion. Stalin finally approved Kim’s request because the United States had withdrawn its last ground combat unit from South Korea in June 1949 and Kim promised that the Korean People’s Army (KPA) could conquer the South before the United States could intervene decisively. Another consideration was that the United States had indicated that Korea was not needed for “strategic purposes,” a euphemism for bases from which to fight the Soviet Union in World War III. The chances of a direct confrontation with the United States thus appeared small.<br>  <br>  BOY was that a really bad error in Soviet and NORKOR judgment!|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Yeah, it was pretty much "I say, you DO" relationship.  As it was with every Communist movement up until the Sino-Soviet split.<br>  Mao had just, barely, defeated the Nationalists and was still organizing his government; one reason he didn't want to get involved- he had no relationship with Kim Il Sung to speak of.<br>  An indirect cause was the idiocy of the Secretary of State at the time, saying publicly that the US didn't care about Asia.  To Stalin, this was a green light to take the Korean peninsula.  Not unlike the brilliant diplomatic work of the US Ambassador to Iraq, saying the US didn't care about Kuwait.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	c|`|G6yyceAxaa	After WWII, the Koreans like many other countries no longer wanted to be ruled by the former occupiers (in Korea's case the Japanese)<br>  <br>  Kim IL Song petitioned the united nations to hold free elections in his country. this was denied, and the US placed Rhee Syng Man back in power (he was the provisional president in exile.<br>  <br>  Kim Il Song felt that his country was becoming a puppet government, and asked the soviets for help. and that was basically what got it started, it then turned into an ideology fight, with the US backing South Korea, and the soviets backing North|`|AA11707728	Lol....I'd say C is being a bit generous.  Stalin DEMANDED that the north invade the south in order spread communism by the sword.  They were hardly in a position to refuse.<br>  <br>  That was the deal between the oriental world and the communists.  We support you materially....you spread communism via proxy wars.  It failed, of course.<br>  <br>  Interesting thing.  Putin sent his ambassador recently to address the G8 and plead with them to resist the third world.  He warned that they would attempt to take over the various 1st world countries demographically and then engulf them in wars of genocide.  This is a DRAMATIC departure on the part of russia in its view of the third world.  And a sign that they very much regret the military adventurism of the past that lead them to build china and north korea up militarily (not to mention the former soviet states).  They are damned worried about being attacked by their former allies as part of a threatened third world war.<br>  <br>  This is history repeating itself.  During the LAST world war, russia allied itself with the nazis.  One day, stalin basically lost his damn mind.  He gathered up all his military commanders and had them summarily executed (why is not exactly clear).  This severely weakened the russian military.  Hitler saw this as an opportunity and attacked russia...which is how russia ended up on the side of the allies.  In a way, this pattern is repeating itself today.....except Putin is smart enough not to fall into the same trap Stalin did.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	C. is the answer that fits the most. Mao did have some say in the matter though.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Don't know if Stalin gave his approval but it was the invasion of the South by the North.|`|BCRNnk8Gaa	yeah it must be c<br>  <br>  At the end of World War 2, South Korea was split in 2 different parts, north and south. Soviet's controlled the north, and the United States controlled the south. It was decided that both would leave and Korea would have an election to choose a president. They did so but people in northern Korea didn't vote. North Korea seperated itself from South Korea and began a invasion. The United Nations saw this as an act of defiance, and sent UN troops, mostly US, into South Korea to stop the North Korean advance.|`|MepSpocsaa	my gramps was in that war he died a few days ago
6Gfz125Paa	She has the power to set the agenda, meaning she can decide what comes up for a vote and what doesn't.

I applaud them for saying thanks but no thanks.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	They're doing their jobs, which is to be cautious regarding monetary policy. If only all governors thought like that. Their logic is that they want to know just what strings come attached. Nothing is free. Getting money from the feds ALWAYS comes with strings. Look at our crappy education system. <br>  Only a fool will jump at "free money" without asking "what's the catch?".|`|d1db35adbcde64b740cc81d751e49915aa	The money belongs to the people not the politicians. They have no right to send back other people's money. It's rather stupid of them to think they will win points from voters by this protest.
f6vLKIFZaa	You just tell the landlord you are going to be leaving.  A brief written note would be nice.|`|dgU7nWo2aa	If you are the landlord or the tenant yes you can since its basically renewed every first of the month. If you are the landlord you better have a good reason to file the vacate notice especially if the tenant is in good standing. The tenant can simply state that he/she will will not be renewing the lease and will vacate after the current month.<br>  <br>  Side note:if you are the tenant you should give the 30 days since the landlord will have to find someone to replace you and he/she could possibly take you to small claims court to get  restitution for not abiding by the 30 terms of the lease....The landlord should give the 30 day at the beginning so that the tenant dosen't have recouse and a lawsuit

In the US, it is illegal for an employer to ask about medical history or conditions.  They are not allowed to ask personal information that might result in discrimination like age and ethnicity.
i1bj5UDBaa	It depends on the visa you have.If you are an immigrant they don't expect you to have a round trip ticket.But if it is a non-immigrant visa, they will more likely check if you have a return ticket.Besides, airlines and travel agencies nowadays inquires first what kind of visa you have before they sell you a roundtrip or one-way ticket.|`|s115uaybaa	depends on where your coming from|`|IeJgYvZ7aa	They get all the information when you check in as it is transmitted to the US customs.

AA10118655	For an RE-4, I think a lawyer that specializes in military law would be best. This code is going to very difficult to get overturned and upgraded.
AA10709853	if you are a single parent you cannot go Active duty,only Reserves.   the military will not pay for your degree.<br>  <br>  If you are not a Doctor, Nurse,Lawyer or Clergy, you cannot get a Direct Commission and must apply to OCS/OTS.  standard length of training runs about 3 months ish plus follow on training for your specific community.  .|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	You need to go in as an officer.  There are zero enlistment bonuses for officers BTW, but your pay and responsibility will be much more than as an E1.  Age is a factor: you must be under 34, 27 1/2 to fly.<br>  Officers don't have "basic training".  You will have to go through Officer Candidate/Training School.  Name depends on the service, but the idea's the same.  Keep in mind that for the AF at least, if your undergrad is non-technical, like your Master's, they only hold one board a year.  As opposed to 3-4 boards for technical majors.<br>  No service will reimburse your MBA, however, you can get loan deferments for up to four years.  Actually the military would've paid for it, had you been in when you started class.<br>  What your degree's in will probably determine your fate.  Since you say you're a professional, that would mean Engineering, Law etc.  But you do get to choose.<br>  You have one dependent, which is OK.  You will have to make up a plan, on file in your unit that details who is responsible for the care of your child, and the financial plans you've made with that person(s) to support it while deployed.<br>  If you have any other questions, please PM me.|`|0dJMn9nTaa	no, everyone at bootcamp is treated the same way unless you did ROTC in college and go in as an officer, then your treated with more respect, also depends on the branch. air force and navy are the easier ones when it comes to training, bootcamp and the way your treated, then army and marines.<br>  <br>  your degree will only help you with your MOS which is the job you are willing to take up in the military branch of your choise, also you must score high on the asvap,<br>  <br>  regarding your son, if your a single father and decide to join then i hope you have somewere to leave him incase you are deployed and while your in bootcamp. he cant live on base on his own.|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	If deployed YOU have make sure your son has a home to go to.<br>  No one really cares about your "professional degree". I have three myself.<br>  <br>  They will NOT pay for someone else's school debt, they might reimburse you for some of your schooling.|`|d3kRpqKGaa	Go see a recruiter. They can tell you what you need to know.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	I suggest that you look for an officer recruiter. Those guys know all the answers.|`|keLd4vpYaa	Joining the military is technically the same as agreeing to a work contract.  You give them a specified amount of time, in a specific MOS (military occupational specialty), for certain benefits.<br>  <br>  Saying that you can negotiate with recruiters for what benefits you want.  Many times they offer cash bonuses (which are subject to taxation).  I'm sure you could negotiate for them to pay off part or all of your education expenses.  And you would qualify for the GI bill which<br>  would help cover expenses during or after you enter the military.<br>  <br>  Basic training is no different for people of different education levels.  The only difference is that you can go in as an officer if you want if you have a 4year or better degree.  Officer Candidate School (basic training for officers) is much more difficult than basic training for enlisted.  They also require you to sign a much longer contract (generally 8years vs. 4 for enlisted)  I would advise only going to officers school if you plan to make the military a career.  <br>  <br>  Have a good family if you get deployed.  You will need someone that you both know and trust that he can live with until you return.  Make sure that person has a power of attorney for your sons affairs.  And as always-have a will.|`|xLqvAf44aa	It all depends on what service you join, and what you want to do. I know ore about marines so ill base it off them.<br>  First, what do you want to do? Do you want to go enlisted or officer? Generally since you already have a degree officer would be the better choice.now as for it being payed off that's a mabye. I know that if you do a special program then they pay for a year of tuition for every year you serve.<br>  Now your son might be a problem but generally isn't, most likely you'll just deploy state to state and have any spouse or children move with you. Sad to say though that because of the economic crisis people are staying into the military causing a lockout causing only special cases to be allowed in. You do have your degree though so that's a plus.<br>  P.s. If you do go officer then basic will consist of normal. Combat training and OCS, officer candidate school, which trains you to become a officer. Now I honestly don't know what will happen to your child during basic and OCS, probly could be left with a family member. Arrangments are made I do know that. <br>  A recruiter will tell you everything I can't.
6HwcJDbiaa	A lot of it depends on where you live. I know someone in Ontario, Canada who is about an inch shorter than you. She received disability money because of her height. She had to purchase things like pedal extenders for her car, and other things here and there to help her out.

cervQlVzaa	McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone, which is no longer American territory. Obama was born in Hawaii. Part of the US last time I checked.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Well, they both ran, so obviously they are both eligible.<br>  <br>  Obama was born in Hawaii, McCain was born in Panama but on a US military base.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	No. Both are citizens.|`|JthubNIsaa	McCain was born on an American military base in Panama. It is considered "American soil." <br>  <br>  Obama was born in Kenya but certified in Hawaii. However, no hospitals in Hawaii has record of his birth.|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	I dodn't support Obama.  But seriously, you're a little late for this argument, and it is of little importance at this time.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Both are US citizens. McCain can't be president because he lost the election.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	That nonsense has gotten pretty stale, kid.  How about thinking up something different for a change?|`|AA10251268	Both are citizens.  The issue was whether they are natural-born citizens.<br>  <br>  The argument against Obama is that he wasn't really born in the United States, and because of some obscure laws that means he wasn't born a citizen.  However, he has a Hawaiian birth certificate, Hawaiian officials have stated they are convinced he was born there, and there are several hospital workers from that time who claim to remember the birth of the child with an unusual African name there.  Theoretically he also may have had Kenyan citizenship, but there is no evidence that he or his mother ever claimed that for him.  There is also a secondary argument that his mother renounced his citizenship when he was a child in Indonesia, but U.S. law states that a parent does not have that right.<br>  <br>  For McCain, the issue is that he was not born on U.S. soil (having been born in the Panama Canal Zone, at the time a U.S. administered territory).  However, he was born to an American father and American mother, and long-standing international law holds that a baby's citizenship is that of his parents.|`|vG0tsqJtaa	Not true.<br>  Obama was born in Hawaii in August of 1961.

fAaLjlI0aa	Never in all of my days have I met a person who is Pro-Abortion. Never a single person who think abortion is good. The problem and confusion lay in the common misconception that being Pro-CHOICE is the same as being pro-abortion. It is not. <br>  <br>  Abortion is, I think, a sometimes necessary evil. While I would never want to have one, and do not believe they should be used as a form of birth control, I also know enough to understand that there are times when it is the lesser of two evil options, and that things could be worse without it. The reason I am Pro-Choice is simple: The government should NEVER have a say in what I do with my body. If you give them the power to decide what choices you are allowed to make, you open the door and set precedents for further invasions. No person has the right to tell you what to do with your body. The choices you make are between you and your God, and no one else. Pro-Lifers love to spread a lot of propaganda that confuses the issue. They like to make it seem as if late term abortions are performed all the time- they're not. They like to make it seem as if late term abortions account for a large percentage of abortions performed- it's less than 1% and even those are almost always done out of necessity (severe defects and malformations that make it a likelihood the baby wouldn't survive outside the womb). They like to impose their morals on anyone and everyone they can, regardless of the beliefs of the person who is actually pregnant. <br>  <br>  They act as if the answer to everything is to bring unwanted children into the world...in their rose-colored glasses view, all these children would magically find homes with loving and responsible parents...but you need only spend 5 minutes talking with a social worker about foster care to see there are plenty of unwanted children out there with little or no chance of finding a loving home with good and responsible parents. Yet you don't see many (if any) of the pro-lifers out there adopting these kids, volunteering to cover their medical expenses when they are born with birth defects, volunteering to pay their expense when they're healthy, taking care of them or the mothers in any way, shape or form for that matter, once they've gotten their way and shamed or guilted or threatened the mother into choosing not to have an abortion. <br>  <br>  They'd also have you believe that abortion is murder, and life begins at the moment of conception, but that's utter b.s. as well. Before there is brain activity, there is no life. Just cells, doing what cells do. Cancer cells multiply just the same as embryonic cells...does that mean chemo and radiation therapies are murder? No, that would be nonsense, right? Well so is the concept that having an abortion during the first trimester is murder. <br>  <br>  A young girl who gets pregnant, whether it be by molestation, rape or even consensual sex, is NOT ready, physically or emotionally or mentally, to bring a life into this world, and shouldn't be forced to do so. It will do more damage to their bodies than most people realize. Just because they've reached puberty does NOT mean their body is ready to carry a baby to term. To have the government step in and say they cannot abort the baby would be tantamount to abuse, and since many very young girls who get pregnant do so through abuse, what kind of message does that send? <br>  <br>  Pro-lifers what the government to decide that women cannot get abortions because they believe it is wrong or it is a sin....so the ends justify the means in their eyes. Should the government decide one day that women of a certain age, say 38 years old, should not be allowed to have babies because there is a higher incidence of birth defects or whatever, and women over that age must therefore be sterilized, I'm sure the pro-lifers would be singing a different tune when it comes to the government making decisions for our bodies.|`|SmFcDx4waa	I am pro choice - but if it was COMPLETELY up to me I'd have a limit on the amount of abortions you can have before your tubes get tied. There are so many easy forms of birth control - If you are having multiple abortions, you are just being careless and stupid - I think everyone should get 1 abortion, then if you get another you get your tubes tied automatically because you have proven that you are not responsible enough to choose when to have a child. That way women who know they eventually want kids might be more careful when they are just having a good time.|`|AA10242867	abort! abort!<br>  <br>  reduce crime, gov dependence, plus republicans hate to pay taxes to support families with 18 children, <br>  so abort!<br>  <br>  did you see the clowns on Fox?<br>  reporting how irresponsible the Octomom is.<br>  well do you want her to abort?<br>  or do you want to pay for her children?<br>  <br>  of couuurse!!<br>  see it does not work.<br>  <br>  For freedom and democracy to work each and every participant has to be responsible for their own actions, or it will not work.<br>  <br>  You will instead have a welfare state, mass imprisonments, higher taxation, and government in anything and everything.<br>  <br>  read your history|`|xL6McXTfaa	no, I'm pro-life, but I used to be pro-choice, and thought that aborting was a terrible thing to do, but didn't want to legislate my opinion.

I'm also against using abortion as a birth control.|`|AA11623763	Pro-choice doesn't mean Pro-abortion.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	There is no such thing as 'pro-abortion'.<br>  The majority of Americans are 'pro-choice'....which means that we do not support the government telling you what to do with your own body and uterus, NOT that we are 'for' abortions.<br>  Anyone claiming to be 'pro-life' in all circumstances SHOULD necessarily be supportive of social services, sex ed, contraceptives, food staples, and medical care for impoverished pregnant mothers and their children. Since you will find that most people who are pro-life are the same people who are anti-social services, it just goes to show you that 'pro-life' really isn't a stance either...as it isn't about life, but about one particular form of life...fetuses. The moment that fetus becomes a living, breathing child, oddly, no one gives a rats a$$ about his/her life any longer.<br>  We have 3 million children in foster care in this country. We would have FAR more millions if every pregnant woman was forced to carry her fetus to term.

I don't believe anyone believes in abortion as birth control. I, as a pro choice advocate believe every woman has the right to decide what is right for her own life and body. It is that simple.<br>  <br>  What has led be to this viewpoint is memory. The memory of the struggle to get to this place. The memory of all the young women who died having "back alley" abortions. The memory of how only women had to bear the stigma of an unwed pregnancy and how they were abandoned by their friends and families, while the sperm donors walked without any recriminations. Witnessing the pain and panic my friends went through when faced with this agonizing choice. There is so much we went through in the sixties that most on this site will be lucky enough to not know.

This uncharacterized separation is neither honorable nor less then honorable because you have not been in the military long enough to develop a record.

As long as a person is driving in the far right lane and there is a passing lane let them go the speed they are comfortable with.  <br>  It has been my experience that the maximum speed limit is not enforced.

V1RsWiAAaa	do you mean the napoleon's coup de tat to gain power in france?<br>  the sudden, violent overthrow of an existing government by a small group. The chief prerequisite for a coup is control of all or part of the armed forces, the police, and other military elements. Unlike a revolution, which is usually achieved by large numbers of people working for basic social, economic, and political change, a coup is a change in power from the top that merely results in the abrupt replacement of leading government personnel. A coup rarely alters a nation’s fundamental social and economic policies, nor does it significantly redistribute power among competing political groups. Among the earliest modern coups were those in which Napoleon overthrew the Directory on Nov. 9, 1799 (18 Brumaire), and in which Louis Napoleon dissolved the assembly of France’s Second Republic in 1851. Coups were a regular occurrence in various Latin American nations in the 19th and 20th centuries and in Africa after the countries there gained independence in the 1960s.|`|c0c735d316018380d93a14360a5defd6aa	From 1600AD onwards, the French monarchy became more powerful and extravagant. This period established the French court, scientific breakthroughs, colonisation and developments in the arts which were sponsored by the royal court. However, engagement in serial wars (including further religious wars) drained the national resources and demanded an ever increasing taxation burden. The seeds of unrest were therefore planted in the feudal population.<br>  <br>  By 1750, the population were questioning the absolute power of the king, and the local impact of the church. Liberal thinkers such as Voltaire and Rousseau began questioning the current political system.<br>  <br>  In 1789, the storming of the Bastille initiated the revolution. Initially there was extreme violence (often death) towards to the nobility, moderates and radicals. Revolutionary committees established control throughout France.<br>  <br>  The revolution then lost direction as various groups tried to assume control. During this period of turmoil wars* continued with Russia, Spain, England, Prussia, Austria, The Ottoman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. France was surrounded by enemies, who formed various anti French alliances. They were afraid that republicanism could spread and therefore preferred a restoration of French monarchy. The newly liberated feudal citizens saw little improvement in their lot and a counter revolutionary movement became established. This was crushed during the reign of terror. In 1795AD a new constitution was adopted by Plebiscite.<br>  <br>  The country was still in economic turmoil. The army was increasingly used in France to break up dissenting groups and control riots. This resulted in the rise to power of Napoleon Bonaparte, a succesful Corsican born army general, who installed the Consulate as a new legislative power following a coup in November 1799.<br>  <br>  Napoleon inherited a France weakened by poor government, ongoing wars, famine, corruption and civil unrest.<br>  <br>  His first action was to defeat Austria and again end the land wars. England continued the war using its naval power to blockade France whilst attacking French colonies overseas. The 1802 Treaty of Amiens brought an unlikely peace between England and France. This period was characterised by an ongoing need to defend France in repeated wars*.<br>  <br>  Louisana was sold to the United States in 1803.<br>  <br>  Napoleon then turned his attention to the administration of France. The Code Napoleon, a civil code defining the legal system, was installed in 1804.<br>  <br>  In May 1804, Napoleon was proclaimed emperor, and the French Empire established.<br>  <br>  Napoleon annexed Spain in an attempt to conquer Portugal, an ally of England.<br>  <br>  By 1812 the tide had turned. France suffered ongoing losses in Spain as well as losing a disastrous campaign against Russia. The Russians retreated with a scorched earth policy, and the French army was decimated when winter set in.<br>  <br>  In 1814, Napoleon was forced to abdicate and settled in Elba. Louis XV111 was crowned king and the allies tried to unravel the changes resulting from the previous 25 years of conflict. After the brief return of Napoleon and heavy defeat at Waterloo, the ex Emperor was exiled to St Helena where he died in 1821.<br>  <br>  <br>  * Anti France wars<br>  <br>  1792 : The First Coalition included Austria, Sardinia, Naples, Prussia, Spain, England. Napoleon defeated Austria and signed a peace treaty, leaving only England against him by 1797.<br>  <br>  1798 : The Second Coalition included Austria, England, Naples, Ottoman Empire, Papal States, Portugal, and Russia. During these wars France lacked the funds and administrative facilities needed to be succesful. Napoleon, the most effective military campaigner in the First Coalition, was occupied in a campaign in Egypt. France suffered a number of defeats. After Napoleon returned to France and seized power, he was able to defeat Austria again in 1800. Again England continued the war alone.

Zrq8vjaXaa	The short answer to your question is "NO," and the explanation is as follow:<br>  <br>  A VAWA petition is a self-petition in which a victim of battery or extreme cruelty.  A person who may file a VAWA self-petition must either a spouse, child, or a parent of a U.S. citizen or perm residence.  It is important to keep in mind that a "self-petition" is one in which you, the victim, is applying for yourself.  As such, the  petitioner MUST NOT be married to the current spouse, or that there is a pending I-130 or I-485.<br>  <br>  To be eligible for I-130 or adjustment status under I-130, the marital relationship must not have change while pending with USCIS.  That is, the moment in which the spouses divorce, the I-130 or the I-485 is terminated.  Because VAWA demand that the applicant no longer is married to the spouse, a pending I-485 (green card application) previously filed is no longer valid.   As such, there cannot be an approvable I-360 (self-petition) filed, while an existing I-485 application pending.  <br>  <br>  These issues are very complicated.  You should contact your immigration lawyer for more information.  There may be factual issues that affect your legal status in which an attorney can only determine after a careful consultation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Steven Pham

While the ideas and beliefs of socialism are enshrined in communism, Communists take a more definitive stance on certain key issues. While many socialist advocated gradual and slow change, communists are unhesitant in their support of open, armed rebellion. Karl Marx, the originator of communism, concluded his work, The Communist Manifesto, with, "The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.

9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	Churchill was democratic as he believed in democracy. <br>  He definitely wasn't autocratic although it's true that in the war he didn't hold an election and was chosen by the war cabinet to be PM after Chamberlain quit. This was mainly because the country was in a state of emergency and an election would be a waste of resources. As soon as the war ended he held an election. Although the people respected him he lost because his socialist opponent Clemment Asquith promised more.<br>  He later won another election in the 1950's his second government was completely and undisputedly democratic.<br>  <br>  As for him being Laissez Faire I honestly dont know, the Laissez Faire style of government is most noticeable during a recession and churchill never presided over one. Churchill made his own decisions and never really towed the line of any party this is why at one point or another he was a member of both the Liberals and the Conservative governments. So even though we know that the Liberals weren't Laissez Faire and the Conservatives were we dont know what he thought.<br>  Whether he did or he didn't have an attitude to letting the economy take it's course we dont know but either way we do know he was democratic.<br>  <br>  Whatever you classify him as the man was a fantastic leader, one of the best this country ever had.
xapeC3tJaa	Go to your states homepage and search for the state police section of the website. Most states have a link where you can do a criminal background check for a fee as well as driving history. You may also find this service at district court websites throughout your state. If you see a link to submit an anoynomous tip then take advantage of it and turn her in that way. If not, then call your local law enforcement and tell them for safety reasons you wish to remain anoynomous.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	I find it quite humorous that you are looking to turn her in and then call her vindictive. Hello, pot? This is kettle- you're black!<br>  <br>  Not showing up for a citation court date can result in a bench warrant, but they usually will not expend resources going out of their way to pick someone up for such a trivial charge. It's none of your business if she went to court for it or not, and none of your business if she has a warrant or not. This isn't a murder charge or robbery charge...this is a simple traffic citation. It's petty and vindictive to try to involve yourself, so before you judge her, maybe you should look in the mirror, since you're behaving the way manner that you claim to dislike about her. <br>  <br>  As for her job, that's none of your business either, really. Your boss has the final say, and trying to get her in trouble can result in your own loss of a job...not a very desirable outcome in these trying economic times. If she is not doing her job, eventually it will catch up to her unless she ends up marrying the boss, in which case you'd better get used to her. Rather than spending so much energy looking for ways to hurt someone you happen to dislike, perhaps your time would be better spent concentrating on doing YOUR job, and minding your own business for the rest of it.|`|RvVvaVsAaa	youre a sneaky one arent you.

You will need an experienced attorney who has consular processing experience to hlep you file a K-3 visa, which is what you should have done from the beginning.  Filing it now would save your husband valuable time; but had you done it earlier, he would have been here already.<br>  <br>  A K-3 visa is a spouse nonimmigrant visa that would allow your husband to be in the U.S. while waiting for his green card application.  because the background check and the waiting period, due to back-log, can take up to 2 years or more, having a K-3 approved for the spouse to come to the U.S. would save 1-2 years.  Again, please contact an experienced U.S. immigration attorney for assistance.  many foreign nationals file fraud I-130 and K-3 applications; and therefore, the USCIS and the U.S. Consular offices are very suspicious of all K and I-130 applications.<br>  <br>  Steven Pham

di43MlSFaa	This is an article dated January 31, 2009 which speaks to the Governor's supporting the stimulus as a whole for the most part. <br>  <br>  "This past week the bipartisan National Governors Association called on Congress to quickly pass the plan".<br>  <br>  It speaks to Palin's meeting in Washington to make sure that Alaska got its share of the stimulus, Jindel stating he would probably accept the funds, as well as a few other Governor's mentioned in the article.<br>  The statements in this article that I have disagreement with are those made by the SC Governor who speaks to inflation, when we have actually been experiencing deflation for quite a good while now.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newsminer.com/news/2009/jan/31/republican-governors-including-palin-support-stimu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsminer.com/news/2009/jan/3...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article7585.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article758...</a>  <br>  <br>  I read an article yesterday that CA would welcome all the funds rejected by the other States.<br>  I'm wondering if perhaps the states in question didn't get as much as they would have liked perhaps. I would think that the people living in those states would welcome the assistance so property taxes don't go up, sales taxes, school closings etc. <br>  <br>  The link below is about unemployment regionally, as of December 2008.

It mentions that Jindal would accept the increase in current unemployment checks but not further unemployment because he thinks that would raise the employer's taxes and the Gov of Miss. thinks along the same lines. <br>  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/us/politics/23governors.html?partner=rss&emc=rss" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/us/pol...</a><br>  <br>  One has to wonder how much is for political posturing and how much is looking out for the states well being.

hv295voUaa	If you are part of ROTC, the only reason you could be delay is to attend graduate school... example... Medical, Law, Dentist, etc.<br>  Is not that we hate LTs... we might hate the person who is wearing it. They don't listen to their soldiers... they think that since they have a college degree they are smarter than anyone. You can't substitute education with experience. As long as you respect and give credit where credit is due to the soldiers... they wouldn't hate you. Just be humble, and listen to advise from soldiers... from privates to SGMs. They have the experience that will be useful in the rest of your career.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	That's pretty much the whole idea behind it.  If you do the last two years you're committed to serving.  You can't "delay" it unless you drop out.  Don't want to do it, then don't.|`|AA10829482	Bless your heart:<br>  <br>  The whole point of ROTC is to train you to be the best O-2 you can be.  You have up to 4 years to learn how to do this.  If your PAS doesn't think you are up to it; they will find a way to let you go before you commission.  <br>  <br>  Part of being a leader (regardless of rank) is to realize that mistakes will happen; you minimize the likelihood as best you can and do not repeat them.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	2Lt.s are generally looked down upon, not because of inexperience, but from an attitude of "I'm an officer" and/or "know it all attitude".  A good officer will get to know his men, especially sargeants, and be not afraid to ask their advice.  This is the advice I gave my son when he received his commission as a 2Lt.  If you don't want to be an officer, don't take ROTC.  You can serve as an enlisted man, even with a degree.|`|DUtOWHARaa	If you're concerned about your lack of experience, why not join the Reserves or Guard while you're in college?  Once you graduate, apply for OCS...you'll have experience from the bottom up.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, make a decision and don't be afraid.|`|Dbj8pU8haa	Sure you can.  There is no requirements on your choice of commission.|`|yB7b4qQNaa	You can take college ROTC for the first two years as an elective, without being contractually obligated to the Army. However, before your third year, you must sign a contract that binds you to serve as an officer upon graduation. You cannot delay becoming an officer, you're commissioned upon graduation.<br>  <br>  If lack of experience is what worries you, there is a way that you can enlist, and serve in a Guard/ Reserve unit while going to school. You'll get a feel for how the Army works, go to real basic training, and have the experience of being a private that will help you greatly. If you're male, you won't even have to interrupt your school schedule. You'd go to a basic/ AIT combination over the summer at Ft. Benning, then return to school to do ROTC classes. <br>  <br>  Get with the ROTC cadre at your school, they'll be able to explain it at length, plus tell you the incentives you can get to help pay for school. Good luck.

Obama's plan to cut the deficit is sound.  Look at what he is actually proposing to do and you should be able to figure it out. I also think that you are confusing the deficit with the debt.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	Raising taxes on the richest 5%,<br>  <br>  And doing little borrowing (creating dept [a deficit]), save to pay for the Iraq war, which he's already put an end date on.|`|EPObVPzVaa	Taxes won't cover it.<br>  <br>  He will do the same as Clinton did and get the money from the next largest slice of the budget pie, Defense.<br>  <br>  He will cut the Military budget, like Clinton did, and call it a budget surplus, like Clinton did.  It lasted ONE year, 1996.<br>  <br>  What everyone forgets is that;  Every time the US cuts its military budget, it gets attacked and then three times the amount that was cut needs to get spent.|`|RermzbWgaa	Well first he will nationalize the banks, and then perhaps work a deal to create a world central bank with a singular currency.

In common law jurisdictions, the practice dates back to medieval England and the English common law, when sheriffs encouraged ordinary citizens to help apprehend law breakers.<br>  <br>  Each state with the exception of North Carolina permits citizen arrests if the commission of felony is witnessed by the arresting citizen, or when a citizen is asked to assist in the apprehension of a suspect by police. The application of state laws varies widely with respect to misdemeanors, breaches of the peace, and felonies not witnessed by the arresting party.

The idea of people who have the leisure during the day to watch Trisha and then to spend their benefit money on Bright House goods (have you seen their APR?) and on internet bingo is troubling to my mental equilibrium, as it is a cynical recognition by advertisers, that is connived at by govt, that there are enough people sitting around during the day with enough dosh to risk tonights dinner on a bingo game. Notice that the advertisers are targetting women - it is always women who are shown in the adverts, rejoicing at being able to win back a portion of the last 4 weeks housekeeping money.<br>  <br>  Worse still, the cynicism of media, advertisers and govt recognizes, sub rosa, that there is an underclass who can see only one way out of their mediocre existence, that is to win money through gambling.<br>  <br>  Whilst there are parallels with the Stock Exchange, most speculators on the latter medium are using other peoples money to finance their speculation and putative bonuses.<br>  <br>  The banning of smoking in public bars and such places as betting shops has removed a portion of govt tax revenue from tobacco and alcohol consumption.

Examples are Delta Force, Green Berets, Navy Seals.|`|LETPAa6Oaa	When a large infantry force can't be used, they use some kind of special operations forces(SOF).<br>  Airborne Rangers<br>  SFOD-D(Delta Force)<br>  Navy Seals<br>  DEVGRU<br>  Air Force Special Tactics<br>  Special Forces<br>  Marine Force Recon<br>  <br>  and thats just some of the U.S. SOF's, the list goes on

AA12341057	That's not what the DJI measures- it has nothing to do with how much money the government has. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an index of 30 large companies who are important to business, but are also perfectly replaceable.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	The Dow is unrelated to the solvency or insolvency of the government.<br>   It simply measures the cumulative share value of a very small (30) number of companies.  It is an indicator of the health of the economy, but is not the economy itself.|`|Ql95Ram7aa	All markets have a bottom.

You don't keep the title after you leave the job.<br>  <br>  And "czar" isn't actually the title, it's just shorthand. For example, the "drug czar" is actually "Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy".
318386389c51a5739cd225edcf165aaeaa	Look at the video of impeached president bill clinton at Ron Brown's funeral.  He was yucking it up with his buddies until he saw the camera and then suddenly got serious.|`|QI74CxD0aa	I think we all want our political leaders to treat the current financial crisis with serious consideration.   <br>  <br>  The fact that a political leader is seen on TV "grinning and fat and sassy" does not mean that he does not take the situation seriously or does not understand the pain of so many in his constituency..  <br>  But if you think the behavior of a politician indicates he does not really care about the people, then take a look at his policy decisions to see if you are right.

I refuse to have and raise a child on welfare. And I didn't want to go through pregnancy and birth just to give it away. That I know about myself. What others do is their business.<br>  <br>  Just because others can have children on welfare doesn't mean I have the energy and time for that. I KNEW i wouldn't. My career had to come first. And, frankly, I made the right choice. What I leave behind has been worth it.|`|TQhTd0Traa	um... Brutal rape maybe. I'm not talking about a girl who gets to drunk and bad things happen that she can't hardly remember, but a woman/ girl who was attacked by someone she doesn't know or raped by a family member. These things happen and that was the argument that started all this pro-choice crap. It has become a horrible form of birth control and that is a problem.|`|ljRE5MeAaa	I have had two female friends "choose" death.  Not because of rape but as birth control for irresponsible sex.

Given that a few hundred thousand men run out on the kids they have, I suspect you could label that 'convenience' as well.  Somehow the Jesus freaks rarely discuss desertion as a 'sin against 'God' or any of that other clap trap these goofballs get behind.  Generally speaking, if there was a 'man' who was able, willing, and ready to deal with these kinds of situations there would be fewer abortions...but either way it's not anyones business except the woman involved....not the state, not the Jesus freaks, not the Republican party, not God Almighty or the little boy that lives down the lane.

Ow3iwCJlaa	I think the fair/flat tax is the best alternative we have at this point – but income tax has to be abolished in order for it to be a fair tax and I don’t think the Left will ever go for it|`|HizAP9Z8aa	If we assume that the government owns your wealth and permits you to keep some of it, which is the basis for income taxing to begin with, then a flat tax would be the most fair.  But even better would be a massive reduction in government spending, paying off the national debt, returning to the gold standard, and paying for the essentials of government (only what is explicitly authorized by the Constitution) with a very small sales tax.<br>  But the whole notion of a shrinking government is a fantasy.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Oppose. On the grounds that income taxes are a terrible idea no matter how they are cut.<br>  <br>  Sales taxes should be the only kind.<br>  <br>  Did you know that income taxes were invented by the "Progressives" in the late 1910s in order to fund the new "welfare" programs?<br>  <br>  Did you also every major economic recession/depression in this country has happened after that?|`|5f63dadbbe9931a964419168c9443efdaa	OPPOSE! rich pipol like you should be paying more  tax! fair is fair. i dont care. all u rich pipol living in a rich neighborhood should be paying more taxes. it aint gonna kill you, besides dat u will still be ahead. democracy baby! dat clown below me should be paying triple tax. he has been robbing the poor!|`|318386389c51a5739cd225edcf165aaeaa	I favor it as the lesser of the tax evils.  For those who say it will be hardest on "the poor", how can you prove that?  The punishment will be equally distributed.  If I work harder than you, why should I be punished with a higher tax rate?  Even the leeches on welfare should be taxed.|`|4ojHnyZkaa	I oppose all tax: The power to tax is the power to enslave!|`|sI3kqp7xaa	I like the Fair tax.......taxing ONLY what we buy. <br>  <br>  This forces taxes paid on those whose income, is in the black market.|`|vZe5DwRdaa	Support.

Cut the head off the beast.<br>  <br>  Anyways why the hell do we pay taxes when the government can just print revenues?|`|AA11277726	Just think of all the losers at the IRS that will lose their jobs if we go to a flat tax. No exceptions just pay a fixed percentage of total earnings. That will reduce some of the waste in washington. Next step would be to put term limits on congressional members to stop the special interest controls on everything.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Oppose.  A flat tax favors the wealthiest 10% of the nation and would actually be a major tax increase for most people making under $30,000 a year.|`|M3maZgdyaa	Flat tax would be felt at the lower levels. Middle class and lower class will be devastated.|`|AA11424005	I oppose.  I am against taxes in general.  None are fair.|`|de711i5Vaa	I would favor it if we could make it fair.

As a return favour the US government of teh day insisted on having a leased port, Guantanamo Bay. It was thought quiet rightly that this would give the US navy a base in which to operate against any threat in that part of teh Carribean whiel alos giving th eUS a foothold in Cuban political life.<br>  Being British, my government has no p[roblem with me visiting Cuba. Ive just returned and can say its a safe, friendly fantasic but very poor country. Th eUS embargo has just strengthened Castros power in Cuba as most Cubans are very nationalistic. th eeconomic system is a joke but people do have very good education and healthcare for free.
AA11163314	Because they felt that Batista was corrupt and they felt that by placing themselves in charge - they would create a 'worker's paradise.'<br>  <br>  Interesting how the Cuban people had more freedoms and economic opportunity under Barista than Castro.|`|65fc3847b67d2c0fa6bbc523caf1aa16aa	Batista was seen as a corrupt politician that would abuse his power to gain favor from the United States. A lot of Cubans felt that Cuba was pretty much a puppet-state of the United States.<br>  <br>  Cuba's economy was heavily based on agriculture (fruit growers) and Batista made sure that companies like United Fruit had access to cheap fruit from Cuba at the expense of their own impoverished workers. Also, Cuba's economy had a large tourism industry in which American businessmen came down and used it has a party island and completely disrespected the place.<br>  <br>  Cubans are very proud of their country and culture and wanted to be sovereign and free of American influence.|`|AA10409832	Because Batista, who was running Cuba at the time, was corrupt.  His regime was robbing the people of everything, much like Saddam Hussein did in Iraq.  At first, Castro was pro-American, but after talking with the Russians, he converted the island to Communism.
6eN8Sx3Qaa	No statues or statutes.  Pay what you owe.|`|AA11622716	Yes there is.  If you want to know how long that period is, at least identify the state or country where you are being sued.|`|94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	each state has their own time line in order to bring a civil suit. After a set amt. of time they cannot sue you, but they will threaten.<br>  However, they can continue to attempt to collect a debt for as long as they like, they just can't collect via court judgement. <br>  Most likely if it is a store card, then it has been purchased by numerous 3rd party debt collectors who have attempted to collect and added their own charges to the acct. <br>  When you go to court, ask for proof of debt. The judge will give them so many days to prove debt. If it is not proven within that amt of time, the complaint must be dismissed typically with prejudice. If it is a 3rd party agency then most likely they won't have any info on the original acct. They may have an acct # and an original balance. But if it has gone via more than one agency most likely they won't have any of this.<br>  <br>  Try legal aid, if you meet income guidelines they can handle the problem for you and you won't have to go into court.|`|wg78UkxFaa	I would think that it would be better to just pay them  what you owe them, so that it won't be on your credit report.<br>  <br>  Even if you pay them like $50.00 a month, it shows that you are making an effort to do some thing to clear it up.  Pay them some thing each month until you have it all paid for.  As long as you pay them some thing each month there isn't much that they can do to you, since you would be showing them good faith that you are trying to pay them what you owe.|`|EWhPNsnKaa	why don't you pay your bill...its because of losers like yourself that don't think that your bills should be paid by YOU, that we're all in this current financial mess...everyone wants to blame the government or corporations...but the blame starts with people like YOU!!|`|iiRbOAQnaa	Statute.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	How long have you owed them?

He's already said he's not interested in doing so. If Obama wants to open a can of worms, then let's investigate fully Tim Giethner, Larry Sommers, Eric Holder, Rahm Emanuel, David Egan.

3jOCDfDbaa	It's your right to contest an officers actions. I'm not saying you will win, but at least you can tell your side of the story !  As far as the officer taking as long as he / she did to catch up with you, did you ask why it took so long? An officer making an enforcement by radar on a highway has the right to articulate in court that within a timely matter and with due re-guard of the safety of other traffic, being his / her reason why it took as long as it did to catch up with you. This is just to give you an ideal what the officers defense will be if you contest it. But, you still have that right !   Good Luck !|`|PddGC0lYaa	If he got a clear description of you and the vehicle, you're done in.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, he cannot prove it was you.

Today however the majority of people pass back and forth with political parties and are less firmly a Republican or a Democrat.  <br>  <br>  A Open primary, or semi-open primary reflects that.|`|NP6ES2GPaa	Closed.<br>  <br>  Informed voters know which party or candidate they support (and have already engaged in political activity) and thus need no open primaries.|`|FKDv6ycbaa	closed. to keep the opposing side from voting for the wrong guy/women.|`|3UTlASavaa	based on this last go around I would say closed.
z93tSvKxaa	Exactly.  They want our country, our money, our jobs, our welfare BUT WANT TO CONTINUE TO ROB, FIGHT, FREE EDUCATION, FREE MONEY, REFUSE TO LEARN ENGLISH, START GANGS, RAPE, AND EVEN KILL US.  Yet the govt. says we have no right to protect ourselves from them. What gives???<br>  <br>  Why does the U.S. keep importing these garbage people when there are more civilized and educated people willing to assimilate and speak English who can uplift our country?<br>  <br>  They even use our country's laws against us yet the pinheads in Washington do nothing but RAISE OUR TAXES TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.|`|0jQcNWITaa	We are all immigrants - the only people who are not are the American Indians.

I'm in the USA now, so I can be frank about this and not worry about being accused of subversive behavior.  I mean this with all respect, but the people that immigrate to the united states are the lowest socioeconomic class (the poorest).  I don't hate immigrants but it's the reality.  Nobody WANTS to leave Mexico... they have to.  The middle and upper classes have it better in Mexico than they would here, so they don't wanna leave, and I don't blame them.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, some of the illegals come here and abuse the system.  This shouldn't be tolerated.  There are sorry people in all countries, and the abuse shouldn't be tolerated regardless of where the sorry people are from.|`|I8M5kw5Saa	anytime ONE job is taken by these people that have no right being here is one job to many.Obama talks about helping people out and starting millions of jobs ,the best job he could start is immigration officers to round up these low life's and send their @sses packing.That to me would be a great stimulus.Getting rid of eaters and breeders that do nothing for our economy but live off of welfare and we will have jobs for people that want them.....EDIT Nurse Molly is right you people that love these Illegals so much I wonder who much you will love them when we don't have ER's anymore ,one hospital where I live already has gone to NO WELFARE and will turn you away as they are privately owned,and its just a matter of time before our other one does the same and I say hurray......|`|4xpXoG5Oaa	No they are not, but if they are taking your job I imagine that you are applying for one to pick lettuce, which I doubt.<br>  And regarding immigrants that are legal, now it seems that people now want to complain about them too.|`|spuz7DvNaa	Not only are illegal immigrants taking American jobs, our government is still bringing in 150,000 foreign guest workers (to replace Americans) monthly while millions of Americans are out of work! There are also companies that train business owners how to NOT hire American workers. They teach them how to place false ads to make it look like they have tried to fulfill the positions with Americans.<br>  <br>  As far as owning America, even the leader of Mexico encourages Mexican to reclaim the southwest. He has put out pamphlets on how to illegally cross the border safely. <br>  <br>  Visit the link below if you want to be part of fighting illegal immigration.<br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE: to the idiots that say we are all immigrants, please get an education!

I suggest you read a couple links I will provide to give you more facts to support those feelings.<br>  <br>  As a nurse I know hospitals are closing down all over the country because illegal aliens have babies and do not pay.

They care about American MONEY and their culture is taking over. <br>  ~OTHERWISE~<br>  We wouldn't have to press 1 for English!|`|zAhlNl6oaa	YES, THEY ))) ARE (((......100% they are taking jobs from Americans. Or lowering hourly wages for American workers through cheaper wage competition, which illegals can do, since they live 50 to one apartment, pay no health care-freeloading on hospitals-mostly pay no taxes, and other expenses that a citizen must pay.So they can afford to work for half decent/normal hourly wage, and "export" half of their stolen-from U.S. workers- money to Mexico.|`|iWLeHnlnaa	HA! .....NO! <br>  <br>  It amuses me when the question is regarding jobs and unlicensed drivers, but people come back with answers like this "Illegal immigrants cost California $5 billion a YEAR! Its no wonder California is broke! Send them back to Mexico!". It really shows the lack of knowledge on the issue.<br>  <br>  If Americans really wanted the onion, fruit and watermelon picking, and toilet scrubbing jobs, don't you think they'd be lining up to take them back during these hard times? They ARE NOT!, so the answer is NO! They did these jobs before, but today's American has easier alternatives, and there's also that easy unemployment check.<br>  <br>  As for unlicensed and uninsured drivers, you should talk to congress about that one! They are the ones with the "smart idea" to ban them from obtaining and renewing their Driver's Licenses, so now they can't get auto insurance or even pull money out of their Bank accounts. Too many negative consequences.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.totalimmigrationlaw.com/articles-north-carolina-illegal-immigrants-driving-policy.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.totalimmigrationlaw.com/artic...</a><br>  Ban on Licenses for Illegal Drivers Has Unintended Consequences<br>  <br>  That means that illegal immigrants now have no way of renewing their driver's licenses. To legislators, this may have seemed like a great solution to illegal immigration: if immigrants didn't have any way of getting around the state (they must have figured), they'd leave and attempt to reenter through legal channels.<br>  <br>  The actual consequences of this law, though, are much less straightforward. An estimated 300,000 illegal immigrants live in North Carolina, according to sources. As their old driver's licenses begin to expire, they're finding themselves unable to get new ones. Without a valid driver's license, they can't withdraw money from a bank account or get auto insurance.<br>  <br>  States that deny licenses to illegal immigrants (like California) reportedly have higher rates of uninsured drivers than those that offer licenses to this group - in CA, a whopping 25% of drivers are uninsured.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Re: Lydia's answer:<br>  She used a link to a site that has ties to Racist Organizations, so it's hard to believe anything coming out of them.<br>  <br>  See for yourself: <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=175" rel="nofollow">http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelrepo...</a>|`|VhgyQES9aa	close the borders|`|qcSkl8ayaa	unless your dream is to sort out fruits. then no|`|AA11707728	For every dollar an immigrant earns, he costs our government easily ten to 20 dollars.

The French and Dutch countries followed. <br>  <br>  USA formed a government funded by Citizens who work and get taxes taken out of their earnings. This government paid to build roads, bridges, hospitals and schools. People living in the USA who are not Citizens are living in my country and deserted theirs. <br>  <br>  European descendants from SPAIN conquered Aztecs and Myans in what's now Mexico, hence Mexicans speaking Spanish.

Hi5NyLfvaa	Because the classic conservative mistake is to look only at the tax rates imposed on wage income, and not at all the other types of income, all the deductions, all the credits, and, most importantly, the lower tax rates on dividends and long-term capital gains, all of which disproportionately benefit the wealthy.|`|4fe57b5c446aad12ac2483ea0782d468aa	hoooo there partner. I think you got it half wrong and half right. Yes, the tax bracket will go down for the rich. BUT and this a big, BUT the rich  will not have any write offs. If you make $500,000 you will pay certain percent of tax (17%) that's it. No right off, it will be a smaller tax bracket but you will pay more tax. Now as for the poor if I remember correctly Steve Forbes idea was that if your income was less than a certain amount ($36,000) you paid no tax. Yet, the Democrats scream that it would take away homeowners tax breaks and other tax write offs. But, they will pay less tax overall. There would be more money in the treasury because the rich now have no write off and have to pay tax on all there income. It also will will do away with the IRS. and it would balance the budget.|`|bfB0luGQaa	You might want to do a little more research. ALL Americans would pay<br>  the same percentage. Most very wealthy people do not pay any, or little in taxes, using Tax Free Bonds. Therefore, they would be paying more tax. A LOT more tax.<br>  Is it not right that EVERYBODY pay for shared services?|`|711R4J6saa	What is unfair about every single working taxpayer to pay the same percentage of their income. No loopholes...Sounds fair to me!<br>  <br>  If you make less you pay less...make more and pay more...everyone the same %<br>  <br>  You think you shouldn't have to pay taxes at all?? Come on!!|`|5hxWSezPaa	The point is that the current system, which taxes at higher rates the more one makes, is unfair.  We favor the eminently fair 10% flat tax for everyone.  We all pay the same %.  Can you tell me what is wrong with that?|`|091ca1bd7e49158f5110601cac84ad3baa	What is fair? Should everyone be treated the same? I say yes which means we all pay the same rate. What is fair about making someone that earns more then someone else pay more. Then you are treating the two people differently.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	How can it be unfair? If the tax is a flat percentage of what one earns, then the more you earn, the more you'll pay. Am I missing something?|`|0P9GYAx6aa	I like it and I am not rich|`|ipWRgKetaa	Well, I think it is fair to expect ALL Americans to have a stake in how our government spends our money. If you're not contributing to the effort, you don't care how much it costs. To extend that point, if you're not contributing, why do you get a say? If you are not contributing, are we all then still equal? As a tax payer and one who pays tens of thousands to OUR government every year, I do not feel those who do not contribute to our government should have a say in how that money is spent. <br>  <br>  But to answer your question, even if we had a flat tax of, say 21%, it is fair since we'd all be paying the same percentage. You make more, you pay more. What could be more fair? I think your problem is that you want to pay nothing and have folks like me continue to tote your note. If so, then your right to vote should be revoked. THAT would solve a lot of our nation's problems.|`|c1566a746196b29f9589775543f6928caa	How is it unfair?  <br>  <br>  1) you get 100% of your salary<br>  2) you only pay taxes when you buy something<br>  <br>  If you don't have a lot of extra income, you do not pay taxes because you will spend less.  A wealthy person may go spend $300 at Emerils restaurant.  So you paid $0 and they pay $x  How is that not fair?   <br>  <br>  People who are drug dealers will now be paying federal taxes  because they will go to the store to buy things with their drug money, so they are now paying taxes.

No deductions, no loopholes.<br>  <br>  A man making $10,000/year would pay $1,000 in taxes.<br>  <br>  A man making $1,000,000/year would pay $100,000 in taxes.  Ten times in taxes what the poorer man MAKES per year.<br>  <br>  How is this not fair???<br>  <br>  I think the rich man should claim it's not fair, not the poor man!|`|VgOCLskYaa	Because most intelligent people choose not to want to penalize success. Only liberal and some democrats want class envy to be the model for taxation. For your untrained mind the poor do not pay taxes NOT EVEN FICA & SS they get it all back plus a refund due to income averaging. Also you like so many liberal do not have a clue to who is middle class.|`|eUdBD4tPaa	If everyone pays 10% of their income, then the rich still pay in more money because their income is more.  If you have 10% of $20,000 you only get $2,000 paid in.  If you have 10% of $2,000,000 then you have $200,000 paid in.  Now when I went to school $200,000 was more than $2,000, but that was just my school maybe.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	i like the idea of it.<br>  <br>  or a national sales tax - the 400 wealthiest people in the US paid only a rate of 17% in 2006 in federal taxes.<br>  <br>  I paid 35%.|`|xjcZkmpbaa	I guess it depends on your definition of "fair."  If you think it's fair for the bottom half of income earners to vote themselves money out of the pockets of the top earners, then we disagree on what's fair.|`|My65doewaa	It's fair because it has everybody paying an equal tax rate.  What can be more fair than equality?|`|xzSuXnvpaa	Because we also propose decreasing taxes across the board.|`|23bgwpD1aa	flat tax is fair because it does not discriminate against anyone.

It is absolutely normal. Again, 67% of highly educated people vote for the left wing. <br>  <br>  Now, when an aberration such as Palin is running for VP, no grown up or intelligent person would ever find her serious. I believe there was a DESERVED search and destroy mission against Palin, YES!|`|flV8NKruaa	No, not at all.<br>  <br>  First, the campaign limited her exposure right from the start, this is because she really didn't perform well for the media to begin with.<br>  <br>  Second, she put herself in that position.  If you are running on the presidential ticket, you are going to get asked hard questions, you are going to have to answer them with intelligence.  After all, she could have turned down the VP ticket.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	No, not tough enough. Much of the media is in the hands of corporations, which support Palin's positions, and would therefore like to see her run again.Nevertheless even conservative media had to recognize what a fool Palin was together with her dysfunctional family.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	ROFLMAO!!!

I dare the libs to name 1 VP candidate who was attacked so fiercely. <br>  They attacked her, everything she did, her family, even the unborn. All the while the libs saying BS like this is normal when you are in the spotlight. NEVER HAPPENED TO THIS EXTENT EVER!

Making speeches was her only strength.  <br>  <br>  It was painful and embarrassing to watch her try to answer questions when it was obvious to even the most casual observer that she didn't have a clue.  It was not only her vapid answers but her repetitive barrages of thrown-together talking points that made her look ignorant and foolish. The media initially fawned on her until they quickly realized how clueless she actually was.|`|GG7WjH6Raa	media is third power. but, palin did not loose election because of media.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	She brought that on herself.<br>  <br>  If she would have come into the public eye more when she was running, they wouldn't have had to search for her.<br>  <br>  She destroyed herself when talking to the media.  They couldn't make that stuff up if they tried.|`|AA11828439	Not at all. She couldn't shut her mouth and stop the stupid. It continues today. Katie Couric may not be the center of the universe, but she has a lot of viewers and fans. Insulting Katie does not help Palin's image. Perhaps a 3 year disappearing act would help, but I have my doubts.|`|JO8YzDNVaa	Yeah<br>  They listened to her and reported what she said and asked her questions about what she would do as VP<br>  <br>  Those dirty b@stards.<br>  <br>  Her being a inbred hillbilly moron had nothing to do with it.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	YES<br>  <br>  they were tough on poor lil Sarah<br>  <br>  they asked her questions anyone in Y/A could have answered<br>  <br>  but as we all know<br>  <br>  <br>  she couldn't

What I am saying is that the globalists have enough influence in both of these parties to prohibit a Ron Paul, or anyone else who opposes the globalist agenda from gaining the presidential nomination. <br>  <br>  Unless the people in a congressional district are very well informed, it is rare to see a congressional candidate running on either party who will take these interests on.  There is no shortage of good Americans who are willing to serve.

There... I heard it straight from the horse.  Nurses and teachers get treated like crap, and there is nothing to entice Americans into these professions any more.  The teaching profession has similar problems... no one wants to be a teacher, especially where I live.  Teachers are asked to give up their lives and don't get paid enough to live on, let alone a fair salary.  I don't think that the jobs of US nurses are in danger.  They would probably take someone from Mars as long as he/she doesn't bail on them in about five years.  I don't blame nurses for leaving the profession, though... like I said, I don't want to get treated like crap for forty years.<br>  <br>  I hate to say it but as a teacher I deal with a lot of kids who are very, very bad.  I'm not saying that all young  people are bad but I worry a lot about the future of this country when I spend my day in a classroom with 30 kids, most (not all) of whom would rather give me heart trouble than learn Spanish.  It scares me to death to think that the country is gonna be in the hands of kids like this.  <br>  <br>  The Asians and Latin Americans and others coming here are industrious.  I think it's admirable that they come here and work hard.   <br>  <br>  The US has always been a country of immigrants who came here, for reason whatever, and wanted to work.  The only true Americans are the Native Americans, and compared to some of the things the early settlers did to the Indians, this is nothing.  At least the immigrants aren't forcing us out of our homes at gunpoint (like the Trail of Tears).<br>  <br>  I can understand your perspective, though.  No value judgements.  <br>  <br>  I think that US citizens should have reciprocal rights... as long as we have the skills we should be able to go abroad and work.  I could be wrong and I don't mean to offend.  For example, I would love to go to Spain and teach, but with the exception of a US military base, it's hard.  <br>  <br>  I like the idea of equal opportunity... people should be free to work wherever they want to.  :)<br>  <br>  I'm not putting the USA down, I'd just rather be in a Latin country.  That's another story though :)|`|1AzCDrO6aa	filipino nurses are here because there is a shortage of nurses here in the US and not that they are taking away the jobs of american born nurses. if there is no shortage then they will not be here. plain and simple.|`|c6e4f1055e2cd01c39d43355e5af4d01aa	YES. Go to You Tube and watch the video called "Immigration gumballs" and you will see just how bad immigration in general is>|`|Zrq8vjaXaa	And your point is?  The reason that there are laws allowing people to come here legally, is because (1) there is a lack of professional skills in that field, and (2) because without legal immigration, there would be even more illegal immigration.  If you are so afraid of losing your job to immigrants, study more, work harder, don't depend on welfare and food stamps.<br>  <br>  It amazes me how many ignorant people are on this discussion group, representing people from all walk of life.  I can see which "walk of life" you came from.<br>  <br>  Stop worrying about who take your job and just DO YOUR JOB; that is, if you have a job!

Stopping immigrants, legal or not, from coming into the country and working, is not going to "keep jobs for American citizens".

AA11494150	Shoplifting, speeding, and drunk driving are prohibited by state law.

n2oEhdZiaa	There is a three year enlistment (technically 3 years drilling, 5 years IRR as all initial enlistments are 8 years).  The current bonus program is only effective through the end of February.  On March 1 a new one comes into play and there is no way that they're going to be giving out big bonuses anymore.  Why would they?  Kids are lining up to join now.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Bonus programs come and go.<br>  Ask more recruiters.

Don't take something else just to meet some deadline. If you knew exactly what you wanted to do and could do it AND there was a rush to qualify for a bonus, it makes sense to hurry. Otherwise, it's just retarded especially to "hurry and take a job I don't actually want."<br>  Your actual question? Yes. It IS going to end, but I don't know when. They ALL end. Later, there may or may not be a better bonus, an inferior bonus or none at all. That changes-up all the time.<br>  If you're enlisting to get the bonus, stay the hell out.

Bailout all the companies is impossible, on the other hand we must think about the consequences of letting all the companies make it alone and the serious consequences of that decision. Probably all of us would lose lots of money and our jobs too. The main cause of the crises it not on the lights and decisions: the lack of serious regulations. The banks did it, profits above all, they inflate through the hedge funds the stocks value for years, till the point the last to buy had to pay the profits of the firsts, as the Madoff pyramid, the same conception. They create a virtual value that never existed, US$ 50 trillion, when the world real product value was US$15 trillion. And now they're the first to receive help with taxpayer money. Severe regulations is what we need to avoid something worst in the future.

AA10671705	There is little difference being active duty AF vs being Reserve AF.  Especially in medical fields, it's pretty much like an 8-5 job anywhere else.  As far as studying, the test is the ASVAB (Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery).  Since it's an apptitude test, there is not a lot of studying you can do.  That said, there are study guides published that you can purchase in most good book stores.  AF scores the test in Mechanical, Administrative, General and Electronics areas.  Medical falls in the General area.  If your about to grad with a B.S. you don't need to study!<br>  Depending on your area of study, if it's in a medical area already, you may be able to go into the medical corps.

JiNW7avWaa	The Bush tax cuts benefited mostly the very wealthy. The money was borrow and we have to pay interest on that money. They were huge tax cuts and resulted in a very anemic economic upswing. The upswing was mostly cyclical and may have occurred anyway. The jobs created during the Bush years were just a fraction of the jobs created under Clinton. They definitely have contributed to the enormous deficit Obama inherited.|`|DHYZfSLRaa	No, but you can ask Chris Dodd, Frank Raines , Barney Frank, Obama, Prince Harry Reid, Princess Pelosi and they'll tell you how they F&*& up.<br>  <br>  P.S.

People who are passionate about the military don't do it for the money. <br>  <br>  Just like any profession, nobody gets paid big bucks right away. Unless you have a degree or something else to give you a boost, you are entry level just like the others and get paid accordingly.<br>  <br>  Now, you DO get other benefits...exceptional health care at no cost, food, clothing (or at least a clothing allowance), training, place to live, tremendous opportunities that would be rare to find elsewhere.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	You start out at $1,294.50 a month and that goes up to $1,399.50 after four months and up to $1,568.70 with a promotion to E-2.

Also, it doesn't hurt to have a steady paycheck when the economy isn't doing too well.  My job is secure and will be until I ETS.|`|LwPcGpAOaa	Not crap, you can google 2009 military pay charts.  In addition to your salary you get free housing and food.  If your married you get a tax free housing allowance and food allowance. You will not be rich but its a honest days pay for an honest days work.  I made well over 2,000 a month and that was 3 yrs ago when I got out.<br>  <br>  You also get<br>  Free gym access<br>  Free health care<br>  Shop on base where its way cheaper for food<br>  Free legal services<br>  to many things to list|`|e205d688e231b13af75443c794fc1564aa	I wouldn't say it's crap.  My husband is an E-5 with almost 5 years of service.  he brings home $1200 every two weeks.  We live on base and don't get BAH.   If we got BAH, that would be another $1400 in his check.  Medical is free, dental is next to free.  The BX is tax free and the commissary is cheap compared to civilian grocery stores.<br>  <br>  It's definitely not crap.  He makes enough that I don't have to work and can stay home and raise our son.  He makes enough that we have a nice savings account and can afford to vacation every year. Yes, you have to budget but you have to do that with ANY job.|`|cz8OtTOJaa	Pay is much better as an officer, however enlisted doesn't get paid as poorly as you think. Base pay for an E-4 with 5 years in is about 2400 a month. There are other things in your pay though such as BAH (for housing) and BAS (for food). The more time in service and the high rank gets better pay.  Here is a link to the 2009 pay charts so you can see the difference in rank as well as time in service.<a href="http://www.dfas.mil/militarypay/militarypaytables.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dfas.mil/militarypay/military...</a> Your duty station also effects your pay. For example, If living overseas you receive COLA to compensate for the higher cost of living.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	The pay is crappy at first glance, but you aren't thinking about the whole picture.  If you are single, you do not pay rent/electricity/utilities or for food, you live in the barracks and eat in the DFAC.  If you are married, you receive BAH (or live in housing) and BAS.  <br>  <br>  You also have no medical expenses.<br>  <br>  So think about it.  If you didn't have to pay for a place to live or for your food or medical expenses, how much would you need to live?  How much would a cable, internet, cell phone, a nice car payment and car insurance cost you per month?<br>  <br>  Oh, and here is a link to a pay chart, you only have to make E-4 and 3 years in before you make over 2,000 per month.  And you make JUST under 3k per month at E-6 and 8 years.<br>  <br>  Now think about 2k or 3k per month without paying out of pocket for housing, food, or medical expenses...  Not too shabby, huh?<br>  <br>  Oh, and think about this as well:  Shopping at the commissary allows my family of 4 to not only eat (and eat well), but to buy cleaning supplies, diapers for one baby, and other things, like batteries and toilet paper for the $323 in BAS my husband gets for HIS food per month.  <br>  <br>  So, not only do we not pay for our housing out of his base pay, we also don't pay for any necessities.  So that leaves his entire base pay for our bills, savings and fun money.  Not to mention what I bring in with my photography.|`|DUtOWHARaa	Define crap?<br>  <br>  With BAH/BAS w/ dependants, I brought in just under 5k/mo<br>  <br>  A pvt w/ a family to feed w/ two car payments and a bunch of credit cards, who orders pizza every night?  yeah, they'll be hurting...|`|AN5lf1u9aa	You should also consider many of the other benefits that help to "increase" your pay. Join the military because you want to serve your country, not because you want collect a check.|`|fe57457146ff1608077b527bfec6f2dcaa	An E-4 with 3 years TIS makes $2025.00/month.<br>  <br>  Military pay grade information is publicly available.|`|SmFcDx4waa	yes but remember - they pay for school, you live free on base and they feed you too, so the pay is lousy but if you have no bills, then most all your pay should be able to go to whatever you want it to.|`|EKHCLvZiaa	The basic enlisted, infantryman's position is not one for someone looking for bill gates salary, hell, my dad works for ODOT and gets paid more than I do!|`|xLqvAf44aa	Technicly that's true, but ill give you several reason why there pay is better than what you'd think. <br>  Ok first thin of it this way, at a fast food resturant you can make 7$ a hour. In the military you make about 2.50$. Now at the resturant you work 5 hours a day giving you 35$, in the military you work 24/7 leading to around 50$ a day.<br>  Now another thing is benefits, you don't have to pay for housing, electricity or food! Just cable and internet. If you live on base that is. <br>  Also if you serve 20 years you get a retirement fund. You could be retired at 38...<br>  Last one is a mutual savings fund is available taking 200$ or 10% of your pay check. If you save it over 20 years you have over 3 million dollars.|`|AA10230317	yeah plus full medical, dental, education, food and housing allowances and don't mention the discounts you get from some places just by showing that military i.d. card, restaurants, clothing stores, cell phone bills just to name a few. there is much more than just a salary to consider|`|c25bbe7e9d7cc82f3eaa2e5ed284dd02aa	actually, no.  you get well compensated, considering, you don't have to buy food, pay rent, or pay for medial or dental.

AIuN5Lw9aa	The UK has two kinds of lawyers - solicitors and barrisers. Only a barrister can pursue the rank of judge. A barrister is usually recommended to judgeship based on their rank in law school. The judicial system in the UK is very different from the U.S. It isn't as political, for one, and, two, the judiciary in the UK does not have the power to overturn an act of Parliament. The Lord Chancellor presides over the House of Lords and the High Court of Britain (one in the same) and he/she appoints judges.

Zrq8vjaXaa	Without knowing more information, I cannot assist you in filing for your documents.  However, in a family-based petition, you need documents to prove that you are related to such person and that he/she (they) are qualified to be sponsor.  That is, you have the legal status and relationship to sponsor them.  In addition, you need to show that you have the capability to support them, so that they will not depend on piblic assistance.  You should consider obtaining professional assistance from an immigration attorney.  This would only be the safest route to ensure that proper documents and evidence is filed, and that your family would be granted a visa in a timely manner.
fAaLjlI0aa	Depends on the seriousness of the warrant. If we're talking a misdemeanor warrant for something like a traffic offense, then handle it when you do get back. If it's a felony warrant, and you are serious about wanting to take care of it, then turn yourself in at the nearest police station. They will contact the state your warrant is in, and they can then choose to extradite you themselves, which means they provide the transportation. Not a very pleasant way to go, but the only other options is waiting until you do have the money, which with a felony warrant can make things go from bad to worse in a hurry. Good luck.|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	If it's a felony, you can turn yourself in at your nearest police station, and you'll likely be arrested and extradited back.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can call the court clerk where the warrant was issued and ask if this is something that requires a personal appearance, or if you can take care of it by mail.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	Call them and ask if they can cover the flight cost...<br>  <br>  of course you do know that you're still going to jail right?|`|UiewAPE3aa	Don't turn yourself in locally.<br>  They will ship you back to the state of the offense but they will charge you a ridiculous amount for it.

J70iEDBhaa	Let me explain something. I doubt you know the truth about 9/11 since you formed the question the way you did. Im not going to sugar coat things for you but I do hope you research what Im about to tell you so you can see it for yourself, instead of just taking my word for it. September 11th was a false flag terrorist operation carried out by elite members in the US Government. I could sit here for 6 hours and go over the evidence we have that names Bush as the main person behind the attack, but I don't want to overload you with to much information all at once. I can however explain his motives. <br>  <br>  First of all they wanted to establish a permanent base in the middle east. The order to attack Afghanistan and Iraq were already planned out well in advance of 9/11. <br>  <br>  To create Homeland Security and the Patriot Act in America. <br>  <br>  To erase alot of government information. (building 7 was a CIA spookhouse and had alot of important government information about investigations such as Enron and other insider trading cases)<br>  <br>  To stop the investigation of 3 trillion dollars that went missing in government spending. <br>  <br>  2 illegal wars that US citizens are expected to pay for, while their companies pocket the money earned from war.<br>  <br>  That is just the tip of the iceburg. There is so much evidence and motive behind it, its astonishing. Now to answer your question. How did 9/11 affect the arab world and us relations?  Well If you were to go to the middle east, the majority over there know the truth about who was responsible. They have seen things that Americans have been blocked from seeing and the things that they have seen, obviously just make them angrier. Take the Bin Laden confession video for example. Anyone who knows anything about him and his religion knows that it wasn't Bin Laden in the video, not only did it look nothing like him, but he was also wearing a wedding ring when jewelry is forbidden in their religion. Things like that outrage the public over there, and for good cause. Many people know Bin Laden didnt make it out of the hospital in Dubai when he was there for kidney dialysis. He was visited by CIA there a month before 9/11 and no one has seen or heard from him since. The mass media covers up the truth so Americans do not realize that we have murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians for NOTHING. They tell us they hate Americans because we are supposedly a "free country".. well thats not why. They hate us because we justify genocide and we ignore evidence. We dont educate ourselves, and we only place blame on others. Until people wake up, and realize that we have murdered all those innocent people for nothing, and until we get out of their country and let them rebuild what weve destroyed, America will always be hated in the Middle East.|`|d22dabff8e58fe9a95192b36f5b46897aa	well it directly lead to attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq.  Iraq is Arab, Afghanistan is Persian.  If you mean Muslim, Iraq was not exactly a Muslim nation but the US did seem to spend great efforts in showing respect for the Islamic culture.

In CA, for instance, a warrant can be issued and they will make the warrant active both locally and NCIC, which is national.  However, I now live in AZ, and here, they can create a warrant and only make it local.  I'm not sure how UT works, but it's very possible that they put their traffic warrants out nationally, too.  Here's the thing...why don't you just take care of the warrant before you leave the state.  What's the warrant for?  Failure to appear?

I think you should be glad that they have interlock devices for people that can't control their drinking and driving, I can understand that there are people who just can't stop drinking, but using cabs or just not driving drunk seems to be a good idea.  If this forces you to not drink and drive it is very fair (at least for the other people on the road with you).

You won't be the only person being thrifty in this recession! <br>  <br>  Interesting that your judge has three DWI charges . . . I find this incredibly difficult to believe.  In the same vein, it doesn't matter that he has a personal history of what you say.  Your sentence is YOUR sentence.  Unfortunately, judges are not all the same . . . some are tougher than others . . . it's the luck of the draw.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, going to the victim stance of "picking on young men" will never help you.  How he chooses to be a judge and deliver sentences is his business.  Your business is to get out of the past, stop dwelling on mistakes and start living by the law, making corrections in your own life.  If you don't choose to live by the law, you're going to find yourself repeating the same or similar mistakes over and over again.  Don't do things AGAINST the law--plain and simple, they will eventually catch up with you.  <br>  <br>  Stop focusing on Mr. EvilbastardrevengefulnogoodSOB judge AND start focusing on getting YOUR life together, even if it is day by day, dollar by dollar.  I wish you all the absolute best for you and that your life starts to change for the better.  I wish you happiness and financial security for you and your little baby.  : )<br>  <br>  Going to college with school loans can be an option.  You can also use the bus system.  If you go to school then you will have an education that NO ONE can take away from you AND your potential to earn money will be great.<br>  <br>  The lesson will be to be able to learn from this, not repeat it and make your life better because of it.  Good luck!

d22dabff8e58fe9a95192b36f5b46897aa	Anyone who has been convicted of a felony is banned by federal law from ever possessing “any firearm or ammunition." Specifically a person "convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year" cannot possess any firearm in any location. 18 U.S.C. 922(g) is the federal law that prohibits anyone ever convicted of any felony to ever possess any firearm either inside or outside of his home. The federal punishment for felon gun possession is up to 10 years in prison.<br>  <br>  There are many other federal gun ownership restrictions. A good summary is available from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.<br>  <br>  The Statutory Exception<br>  The rule prohibiting felon gun ownership has some exceptions. There is specific statutory language providing that the federal criminal firearms possession does not apply to individuals who have had their civil rights restored by the state in which they where convicted of the felony.<br>  <br>  18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20) provides:<br>  <br>  "Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter, unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly [or implicitly as a matter of state law] provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms."<br>  <br>  State Law Restoration of Rights<br>  State law determines the restoration of civil rights for a state conviction, not federal law. The civil rights restoration must incorporate the right to serve on a jury, the right to seek and hold public office, and the right to vote. Absent restoration of these rights federal recognition of the state restoration of rights exception will not apply.<br>  <br>  Federal law contains another passage to be considered. If the restoring state includes the three rights above, then one must determine if state law in any way restricts the convicted felon’s rights to possess a weapon. If there is any state restriction on the felon’s right to have a weapon then the possession of any firearms by the convicted felon is federally illegal. This is true even if all other civil rights are restored.<br>  <br>  In the end, federal restrictions on the possession of firearms by convicted felons are entirely dependent upon the restrictions imposed by the various states. If there is a state restriction on an individual’s gun possession as the result of a criminal conviction, then possession is a violation of federal law.<br>  <br>  The Process for Restoring Rights<br>  Every state has its own process for felons to petition the government to restore their civil rights. Rights can be affected by the expunging or sealing of records which are judicial actions or pardons from the governor, which are executive actions. The level of restoration may be affected by the crime itself, whether it is a violent crime a drug crime or a crime of dishonesty. State laws vary greatly. For an example of the process, see Illinois Criminal Expungement Law.|`|JthubNIsaa	In California, if you are caught even with a single bullet,  you can be arrested for violation of parole.

It's not just a "sit home and collect checks" option.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	The Guard is a better option if you are not interested in serving full time all the time and if you have other civilian goals.  For example, I'm in the Guard because I need more time at home with my family between deployments and because I am going to be a full time student.  If you have no other plan or civilian job and you don't want to go to school, you may as well go active army.  Find something you'll enjoy though.  YOu have a lot of MOS control when you join the Army, but specifically in the Guard because you get to pick what unit you join and what MOS based on how far you are willing to drive and what you qualify for.|`|yB7b4qQNaa	If you would like to be in the Army full-time, join active duty, if one weekend a month is more your speed, join the Guard. Keep in mind that you will have to take months off from your job/ school initially to go through basic and AIT (the school for your specific job) and that could take from 3 months to a year. Also keep in mind that once you're qualified, you can be activated (sent overseas) at any time. the "war fronts" you're speaking of are just either OIF (Iraq) or OEF (Afghanistan.) You can choose your job provided there are availible slots for it at the time you're at MEPS (in-processing) and your ASVAB score qualifies. Keep an open mind, and research the jobs.

Intestate law will apply|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	JUst your mom's kids, in most cases.  Because he predeceased her, any claim his children had on his estate was superceded by his spouse.  Now that she has died, her estate will likely go to her children alone.<br>  <br>  But laws vary, you'd have to check with a lawyer in your own state to be certain.|`|oFiGyMWraa	If a person dies without a will their property passes according to the intestacy rules. Under these rules everything passes to the spouse and/or issue (children, grandchildren etc). Only if there was no surviving spouse or issue will more distant relatives get a share.<br>  <br>  Your mother's spouse had already died, so all her property will go to HER children. The children of her spouses previous marriage do not count, unless you mother had legally adopted them. Your mother's 2 children will take an equal share of her estate.<br>  <br>  Whether her estate includes the house depends on how it was owned with her late husband and, if relevant, what he did with his share when he died.<br>  <br>  If it was previously owned as a joint tenancy then his share would automatically have passed to your mother on his death. If it was owned as tenants in common and the husband left it to your mother then it will now be all hers. Either way the whole house will now be part of her estate.<br>  <br>  However, it is possible the husband did something more complicated so that some, or all, of the house actually now belongs to someone else. In which case that part of the house does not form part of your mother's estate. Exactly who owns the house will be obvious when you look at the details held by the Land Registry.<br>  <br>  Obviously with no will there are no executors. But someone has to administer the estate. First in line to do that are you and your sibling. You do not have to do the job, but you have to formally decline before someone else can. Given that you stand to inherit I recommend that you do it. I also recommend that you talk to a solicitor for advice. Don't leave everything to them otherwise it will cost a small fortune, but pay them for professional advice when you need it because that will probably save you a lot of hassle in the long run.|`|H5NGXgqsaa	Generally any kind that is direct survivor-ship of the one who has passed is the FIRST & foremost to deal with the legal issues. When I say legal issues, be careful BECAUSE such legalities also include unpaid debts etc... All survivor-ship generally share what is left in ones estate, however based upon various circumstances man may wish to contest such situation as well as expressed wishes or wills... I suggest you seek legal counsel & be aware of your legal situation...none of which is easy by any means! Good ol Uncle Sam manages to do a terrific clean up job of many financial situations remaining...only legal counsel can advise you best. Take care~|`|AA12231679	Get a solicitor! It will probably go to probate, and depends on who owned the house and in what context. This can be found on the deeds, if you don't have them you can get them from HM Land Registry for a small fee. It will also depend on the will left by her late husband if he left one. It could get really complicated.|`|d4cf52959f97cc6ef63e1ad730f1436caa	The laws of intestacy say that her dependants will get what she leaves.That is the ones she gave birth to or adopted.

You typed forced, but I think you mean talked you into it.  If you were talked into it I would say no abuse, but if he actual forced you to do it physically, say with his hand or something then I would say yes abuse.  It really comes back to how you were feeling at the time.  Being pressured into sex is uncomfortable but if you really didn't want to do it, you could have walked out.  So since you did do it I would guess no abuse.  You may feel bad about it and regret it after the fact but think real hard about the circumstances at that time and decide for yourself.  Most likely it wasn't abuse but keep it in mind and try to learn from this incident.  If you are saying no and the other person is not stopping.  Use force, that is your personal private area and you can defend it as if it were your life.  The elbow and knee are pretty sharp to the groin area so, do so if needed to avoid being talked into something you don't want to do.

You can read, you can write, you can ask questions and understand the answers: just download the forms, fill them out, provide proof of everything that's being asked for, pay the fee, and then wait.<br>  <br>  The only conditions are: 1, you have to be married out of mutual love and respect for each other, not solely to gain immigration benefits. 2, your husband must have arrived legally at one time, even if his legal status, like a visa, has since expired. 3, your income has to be 125% of the povery level.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|XRYAfxpTaa	No, there is not going to be another amnesty.<br>  What you can do is file a petition for him.

How many times have you ever heard of anyone actually being arrested for being married to an illegal immigrant? Some people will go to any lengths to spout a racist agenda.|`|Zrq8vjaXaa	The short answer is , "no" you can not apply for amnesty that is past unless you are grand-fathered in.  That is, if there is a previous application filed on your behalf in a different category before the "sun set" date of the amnesty program.  For example, the last amnesty program was the LIFE Act of 2001, which has a sunset of April 30, 2001.  You must demonstrate that there was an I130 or I-140 application filed on your behalf before that date.  Also, if you application is filed between January 14 1998 and December 21, 2000, you must also prove that you were physically here in the U.S. at the time of the application.<br>  <br>  With regards to future law, there is no bill that is presented to Congress as of date.  You will have to wait, and under this economy, immigration is probably not the priority for Congress.|`|4c21e2f4c011e6cd394d8baf6024f878aa	The American people will not support in any way, shape or form Amnesty!!!!!

Immigration law is Federal law that precede to State law regarding immigration procedure. <br>  <br>  Even with $7000 ( I think you are referring filing fees and attorney fees), if he has no status in US, he still have go back to his country to complete the green card process at US Embassy. Unfortunately due to his illegal presence in US, it is more likely he will be denied the green card and barred entering to US for 10 years. <br>  <br>  Sorry.

wg78UkxFaa	It isn't against the law for a prison to not allow an inmate to attend a funeral.  When a person goes to prison they no longer have the same rights that people who live in the free world do, because they are incarcerated.   <br>  <br>  There are many issue that come into play when some thing such as that comes up.  The cost of escorting an inmate.  The amount and cost of the staff that would have to be used to escort an inmate, depending upon the inmates status.  If it is out of the state, then there is the cost of travel as well as the cost of putting an inmate up over night.  If the inmate is considered an escape risk, the cost would be high.   And now we also have an economy that most likely wouldn't allow for that to even happen, due to no budget for that to take place.  Mostly it just doesn't happen, since there really isn't a budget for this to take place.<br>  <br>  If this is a real situation that you are speaking of then I would suggest that you speak with the prison where the person is being housed.

Say what you want but everyone was living high on the hog back then. As soon as Dubya came in, he cut taxes for the wealthy and our country went to poop.

In 2002, I announced a goal to add 5.5 million new minority homeowners by the end of the decade. Since then, we have added 2.3 million new minority households. My Administration has also set a goal of adding 7 million new affordable homes to the market within the next 10 years. In my FY 2006 budget, I proposed a single family housing tax credit and two mortgage programs -- the Zero Downpayment mortgage and the Payment Incentives program -- to help more families achieve homeownership. In 2003, I signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, and I have proposed more than $200 million to continue the American Dream Downpayment Initiative to provide downpayment assistance to thousands of American families. By promoting initiatives such as financial literacy, tax incentives for building affordable homes, voucher programs, and Individual Development Accounts, we are strengthening our communities and improving citizens' lives. <br>  <br>  NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2005 as National Homeownership Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities recognizing the importance of homeownership. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/...</a>|`|M3maZgdyaa	I agree with Big E.<br>  <br>  The more he does the worse it gets.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Try as hard as you may, the responsibility of what we are seeing on wall street is just a reflection of eight years of failure from bushco.<br>  <br>  You loved him for eight years, now love what he has done to you, the economy, and the military as well.|`|JKbvnwcDaa	A TRILLION dollars in one month of office??!!

n2oEhdZiaa	21B is an MOS closed to women, so if it is OSUT training (your training reservation will indicate if it is OSUT or BCT/AIT) you will only have male Drill Sergeants.  Keep in mind you're probably going to have to drill at whatever unit you hold an MOS in, so it may be closer and easier to get to the combat engineer unit than it will to get to the Infantry unit.  Your recruiter will have to give you guidance on that.  Good luck.|`|Im8G3mjRaa	Well, I just graduated from my Infantry OSUT at Fort Benning on Friday. I don't know much about Fort Leonard Wood but I'd guess Basic Training at Fort Benning is more infantry orientated and then you got Drill Sergeants who are all infantry combat veterans that's been overseas at least twice and have ******* PTSD and go from zero to pissed in a second. I was thinking about going Rangers or Special Forces, but **** that. I'm lucky I got my blue cord. lol|`|F1VXXMrOaa	Benning is more infantry related. My boyfriend went there and will be a Dill Sergeant soon. Whats with the female comment? We're broken down to be soldiers too and females go through the same training to get their campaign hat. Well, I'm not upset or anything, I just thought it was a little funny that you said that. I would say stick with an MOS that will more closely relate to what you really want to become. Either way, female or male Drill Sergeant, AIT isn't going to be fluffy.

ktMefP0oaa	There is media bias, but outright falsify news? Probably not, but omit the news they do not want to present they can, at least until it becomes so obvious they have to. Like the 5,000 dead in the Mexican border towns, the New York times is a liberal paper and would like open borders but the problem has gotten so bad they finally had to report the cartel strength, but put a spin on it that the Americans are supplying the weapons, and it's our fault because we have so many drug users. gotta love it.|`|f9crUDTwaa	Our politicians corrupt our system of checks and balances . News can be falsified . But slander and libel kick in when they lie about a person verbally or in print .|`|2KORqD1Oaa	Sometimes it does.  It depends more upon the listeners, however.  Some people will swallow anything they hear without giving it any thought.  I refuse to get all my 'news' from one single source.  Sure, it takes time to read articles from several major newspapers every day, but since they can be accessed on the Internet, it only makes sense to do it.  Same with magazines and TV channels.  It is probably impossible for anyone to present the news in a totally unbiased way, but if you get several different slants on the same event you have a good chance of finding out most of the truth eventually.<br>  <br>  I don't know if they can legally falsify news, even though it is common for things to get misreported unintentionally.  When that happens, the media usually issue a retraction and say 'oops ... we screwed up.'<br>  <br>  Edit:  Bear in mind that the main purpose of the media is to make money,  not to educate the public.  They're going to take some liberties from time to time, and they're going to present the most 'sensational' stories they can just to keep people watching.|`|byp8ShAjaa	the media is corrupt.|`|TpdVba4baa	Yeah, absolutely. Just watch MSNBC.|`|lzsyNKBzaa	Yes, CNN, MSNBC, CNNHN, looks pretty unfair to me.

Socialism wasn't going to just be accepted by the mainstream....no matter who they voted for. So he had to rush it and call it a "stimulus" to appear to be meeting his campaign promises while ramming his agenda down the throat (no discussions first) of those of us who know what it is. Fooling his voters into thinking this was a good thing was the first step.|`|f1ecec25428774ecc93857a3b57ba395aa	No, the porkulus bill is the first step to socialism.<br>  <br>  The Socialist that are now in power want the stock market to crash so that all will be dependent of the government.<br>  <br>  Welcome to the USSA Comrade.|`|3f7UV5zDaa	It certainly would have but he and his advisors were so anxious to show off their power and wanted to give the appearance of getting things done they didn't take the time to do any planning.

So yeah go ahead clean up the water while the pipe is still leaking.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Of course it would but Obama was running out of time in paying back his cronies for getting him elected.|`|Alkn6IJYaa	I am not sure if you are just trying to be funny, if your lying to convince others, or if you are being simply ignorant of basic economics.<br>  <br>  If you are in a recession where monetary policy does not work, then you use fiscal policy, which is spending and deficit financing.<br>  <br>  When the economy recovers, you use surpluses to pay for it. It is important for the world to know that Obama knows a bit of economics. That way they don't think he is like the Republicans, who know nothing about basic economics and run huge deficits even when the economy is not in recession.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Genius - how can you collect the proper amount of taxes if there are too many unemployed??<br>  <br>  Stimulate the economy first, and then you work on the deficit.  That is the lesser of the immediate things.<br>  <br>  And where was this concern for the past 8 years?  You think that Bush was just sitting and not spending any money??

Bush is the past, the current problem is named Obama.|`|qAL0CZIiaa	Are you trying to justify Obama spending a trillion dollars by saying that previous administration had a deficit too?<br>  <br>  I thought he was change. The question shoud really be "for all you Bush haters who didn't like the deficits - why are you accepting of Obama's excessive spending?"|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Obama doesn't represent liberals, he's a neo-lib.

But the reality is that the first half of that bailout has already been spent and it did not unfreeze the credit market so it did not help to stem the foreclosures, which in turn are decreasing property values and eroding the local tax revenues that pay for schools, essential services (police, fire protection), etc. Basically, the money was funneled to the top and did not 'trickle down' to the root problems. So now, the second half is supposed to go towards rewriting loans to hopefully stem the tide of foreclosures. Will it work? I have no idea, but I do think that it stands a better chance of solving the local community problems than the first half did by going towards retreats, CEO bonuses and dividends.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Because the Democrats don't really care what we think.

That's an easy thing to say when you think people won't do the work to prove you wrong.<br>  <br>  2)  Understand something.  Obama was smeared on the basis of lies about his religion, on the basis of his nationality (again lies - I can't tell you how many people I encountered who genuinely believe that he wasn't born in this country while ignoring that John McCain actually wasn't, and who think he's an ARAB because his father is from KENYA.  I had someone actually say, "His father was a Somali slave trader...he wasn't African."  I had to show the person a MAP.), and on the basis of his church membership which is his private business in this country.  Sarah Palin was smeared for what?  Her history in office, her decisions on the job, her position on issues and her lack of academic prowess.  She was to some small extent smeared for what happened with her daughter, but there was a specific reason for this.  When you position yourself as the person who is going to promote abstinence only education for EVERYONE'S daughters when it didn't work for yours, that becomes a public issue.<br>  <br>  Having said all of that, nobody ever said Palin wasn't allowed to "fight the smears," only that you can't equate what is actually true and is public information with what are lies and private information.

The money for their care comes from the general insurance fund, and is the main contributor to rise healthcare costs (the others: the declining dollar, inflation, taxes, This is why illegal immigrants are "hurting" us, because we are subsidizing their travels itno the states. However, in poor neighborhoods you can often find cash-only (no insurance) clinics that charge just about the rate of a co-pay for full routine care.

He claims the interrogators were asking with knowledge about his time in Britain.<br>  <br>  The charges that were made against him were made quite some time after he'd been arrested and followed torture. It appears the charges were totally false  Here's a narrative from his lawyer, which suggests the dates of the "crime" were impossible because his so -called accomplices were already detained:<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  "Binyam explained that, between the savage beatings and the razor cuts to his penis, his torturers “would tell me what to say.” He added that even towards the end of his time in Morocco, they were still “training me what to say”, and one of them told him, “We're going to change your brain.”<br>  <br>  As it happens, one of the confessions that was tortured out of Binyam is so ludicrous that it was soon dropped, but not before Clive Stafford Smith had learnt of it and had been able to use it to demonstrate the extent to which it indicated that all of Binyam’s “confessions” were untrustworthy. <br>  <br>  As he explained in his book Bad Men: Guantánamo Bay and the Secret Prisons, “[T]he US authorities insisted that Padilla and Binyam had dinner with various high-up members of al-Qaeda the night before Padilla was to fly off to America. According to their theory the dinner party had to have been on the evening of 3 April in Karachi … Binyam was meant to have dined with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah, Sheikh al-Libi, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Jose Padilla.” What made the scenario “absurd,” as Stafford Smith pointed out, was that “two of the conspirators were already in US custody at the time -- Abu Zubaydah was seized six days before, on 28 March 2002, and al-Libi had been held since November 2001.”<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  All charges against this guy have been dropped.

(a male Marine)   Could the Marine Corps do that?<br>  <br>  No.<br>  <br>  Why not? . . . because she has right to "some" measure of privacy. . . not to be forced to be naked in front of a much of guys who will be eye-f-ing her the whole time.<br>  <br>  Ok . . . . if the Marine Corps can't make a woman get naked in front of me . . . how come the Marine Corps can order ME to get naked in front of an OPENLY gay male? ? ? <br>  <br>  Hello?  . . . . What's the difference?<br>  <br>  So, you say, . .  . oh, no gay will "touch" you . . . <br>  <br>  Ok . . so order that woman to shower with me . . . . I won't "touch" her . . <br>  <br>  Can they do that? . . . If I "promise to keep my hands to myself?"<br>  <br>  No.<br>  <br>  Then they should not be able to order a guy to get naked in front of a GAY male, either.<br>  <br>  It's the SAME thing . . . . . basic right to privacy.<br>  <br>  Dan in Miami|`|spbqfjvbaa	They are.  The military isn't supposed to ask if they are gay.  The recruit/military member isn't supposed to tell.  Unfortunately, there are 2 other parts to DADT:<br>  Don't Persue:  The military DOES still persue gays, even on a (unfounded) rumor someone may be gay.   And that is grounds for separation. <br>  Don't Do:  The military member is supposed to stay celibate.  Well, at least not sleep with someone of the same sex while they are in.<br>  <br>  The military has had this in effect since 1992, since gays in the military would allegedly disrupt the good order, discipline, & esprit de corps of the military.  Guess what?  That's a crock.  Gays were in before DADT, were in during my time in from 1991-2003 (I should know, since I am gay), & are still serving now.  The character, work ethic, personality & ability for a person to work as part of a team sin't diminished OR strengthen because of the person's sexual orientation.  It depends on the PERSON.<br>  <br>  Boils down to this:  If the military followed their own policies on sexual harrasment/sexual assualt & actually punished the offenders of those crimes (REGARDLESS of the rank or gender of the assailant), that would cut out 90% of any problems folks would have with gays.  Military is still majority male, & no man want to report being assaulted by another man.  They've already seen how the women are treated when they have reported something & nothing is done about it.  And that is a threat to their manhood.|`|ED433Q6Yaa	htey are allowed just not openly, it is that clinton , don't ask, don't tell thing. the main reason i guess is that men who are attracted women cannot shower with them so men who are attracted to men would have to have their own facilities. it is somewhat unfair but all they would have to do to fix it is have communal showers for all service people, men and women and gays.|`|AA10788612	You can be gay in the military. When you join it's the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. She got in trouble b/c she got caught & someone complained about it.|`|V3t83pytaa	Its okay to be gay you just gotta keep it to yourself, and the whole point of joining isn't to be sleeping with other men, do your dirt on your own time. Just keeping it real.|`|Pe15GxjSaa	You can get discharged for "heterosexual conduct" too. No difference.|`|rTscI3Lwaa	they are aloud in the brits army dont know about anywere else sorry|`|xxDjV6Axaa	They ARE allowed, the activity isn't.  It goes back to the days when people thought it was a choice or you could "turn" someone gay.  At least they now don't kick them out in Don't Ask, Don't Tell.  Everyone knows who they are in the military but as long as they are discreet, nothing will be done.  It just can't be open.|`|25Cu0kjFaa	The same reason blacks were once banned. The same reason Jews were once prohibited from attending West Point. The same reason Japanese-Americans were only allowed to fight WWII in special units, and then only in the European Theater.<br>  <br>  The military is inherently conservative to the point of being reactionary. Change comes at a glacial pace, and has to be imposed either by changing fortunes (the US Navy refused to accept aircraft carriers as a real weapon until Pearl Harbor) or their political masters (Truman ordering the integration of the armed forces.)<br>  <br>  The time has come to allow all Americans to serve their nation.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	The military isn't like a regular job.  They can discriminate against you based on sex, race, and other things that a regular job can get sued for to complete the mission. <br>  <br>  However, homosexuals are allowed.  They just can't be openly gay, they have to hide it in public view and their supervisors aren't allowed to ask them their sexual origin.  There are various reasons for the policy given by different people but if you have a problem with it you have to take it up with Congress (the only ones who can overturn it).|`|0BoDF6iBaa	It's a little more complex than "eyeball f-ing in the shower."<br>  When it comes down to a reason of why "don't ask, don't tell" is still in place it is for the protection of the gay.<br>  There are an awful lot of military folk that would beat up, harass, or kill a gay if they felt they were "being eyeball f-ed in the shower."<br>  <br>  I'm gay, I never once even had the slightest inkling to check someone out.  I was there to do my military job and shower with females sometimes.  I'm glad I didn't get killed over ignorant people that felt like accusing me of some kind of perversion.<br>  <br>  And what the heck does the center of disease control have to do with something that as common as being born with blue eyes or brown hair?<br>  It's not a threat or perversion, you need to step off your soapbox, little girl that said that.|`|Ot7PJrddaa	Gays are allowed in the military if they don't say they are gay.  Kind of a stupid rule.  The thought is that homosexuals would undermine the moral character of the military.|`|spuz7DvNaa	Homosexuals are in the military. Why do homosexuals think they need to advertise how they like their sex?<br>  <br>  <br>  Homosexuality is abnormal and nothing more then a sexual deviance....and very high risk according to the Center for Disease

1hOTlMvaaa	It is merely a tactic to blame and keep an illusion of who is the problem or who is the benefit, now we saw where the profit side of it took us. Out of every ones hard earned money into the pockets of the rich and now no one has a penny or owes many.<br>  It was propped up and inflated to tell a lie to people to invest and it was a plan for the past 27yrs to tell baby boomers that they invest will have a retirement only for it to be sucked out when the  money was in and about ready to be used. Nope, gone for god, my dad and mo did without for a lot of years to save for retirement. My dad invested over 280,000 of his own earnings and lived just getting g by, and now the money has been snatched. He still has 70grand left, and he better take it out, or it will be gone. It was a big fat lie for the elite , and as  long as they can snatch your money and the ceo's will profit, no f-ing way should anyone take a chance!|`|AA10081079	You do realize that the constition was written to keep as much power out of the hands of the federal government. <br>  You do realize that the current size of the federal government has the forefathers turning in their graves?<br>  <br>  You do realize that the word Nationalization should make any decent American cringe!<br>  <br>  You do realize that anyone that uses the phrase "spread the wealth around" should never get farther in politicking than local grass roots hippie community organizing?<br>  <br>  You do realize that most conservatives I know were pissed off that GW grew government the way he did?<br>  <br>  You do realize that ALL people, cons or libs, should agree that the size of the federal government should be cut by 75% or more and that we should make the lib/con decisions at the local level.. not even the state level (IMHO) but at worst state level... so you have a better chance at kicking the blago out?|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	Because those who are selling stocks and not buying any more are SAYING they're not buying any more because the Obama Administration has pledged to tax them into oblivion with capital gains and will eventually make them turn all their profits over to the government anyway, so they're bailing like rats off a sinking grain barge.<br>  <br>  To answer your question simply, we believe the stock market is failing because of Obama BECAUSE those involved say in plain English that they are getting out of it because of Obama.<br>  <br>  Simple enough for you?|`|Ef9zLkOTaa	When A Top ranking Liberal speaks, the market drops.  Seems like a pretty solid trend to me.  <br>  <br>  Maybe its because Socialism detours people from investing when they know their taxes will be raised.  Maybe its because Republicans believe in free market and Democrats believe in government taking your money and then giving it to people who didn't finish high school.  Higher taxes|`|kJM65nXJaa	You asked a honest question, with well thought out and logical details. Honest,well thought out, and logical are not part of the Republican thought process.

If he speaks or is suppose to speak the market goes down prior or during. Like today for instance. As long as he is speaking doom and gloom and of nationalizating banks, and taxing the people who do the most investing, it will keep going down.<br>  <br>  And I agree with the previous poster, you guys blamed Bush for everything.|`|Hw8rr1TCaa	Because republicans do not want to accept their defeat and therefore are trying to demonize President Obama at all cause.

If the economic outlook called for several quarters of strong growth, the assets would not be over leveraged. Cart after horse remember?<br>  <br>  Item 3, We are talking 1 to 2 years or well inside of one economic cycle which by definition is short term. Long run is 10 years or so. And yes negative commentary by leaders and press can lead to negative psychology of the market, that at least for the short term (several months to a couple of years) can worsen markets and delay a rebound.<br>  <br>  Item 4 Yes see community reinvestment.<br>  <br>  <br>  Do you realize that when faced with a credit crisis severely restricting capital movement in the economy instead of loaning money on a vast scale, BHO's first official move is to borrow 1 trillion dollars, decimating global credit availability. I have to laugh at this approach, as if, deficit spending on a record level could help, then we would have never gone in to a recession to begin with. Then he continues to talk as if it is 1930. It is no wonder why Wall Street has had such a tepid response, what has he done to build their confidence? No given the efforts BHO has made to make this thing worse, and prolong recovery, he owns it now.|`|ZqA7qDWAaa	I cant believe these words coming out of your mouth. Do you realize this pork filled spending bill was pushed through by Obama? Do you realize he knew the public did not like the wasteful spending in his spending bill, and this is why he only allowed less than 24 hours for senators to read then decide on it. Who can read, and study a spending bill with over 2000 pages in less than 24 hours?<br>  Do you realize this pork filled spending bill along with his take from the rich to pay the debt in our housing market for people that cant afford their home is the reason Wall Street is falling faster than ever before.<br>  The Republicans can see it's crap. Wall Street can see it's crap,and this is why nobody is willing to invest. Our financial market is going under because of this idiot's idea's, and spending plan's.<br>  The only people that can't see it is people like yourself that is stupid enough to believe this socialist idea's.<br>  Who are people like yourself going to blame when this country goes under because of Obama's spending? Oh I forgot; when your stupid idea's fall you can always blame Bush.<br>  get a life.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	I'll agree with you over the long term where the stock market is concerned.  But, the evidence is there that policies enacted or statements made by a president (or his administration) DO have potential for at least a short term impact on the market.  Here's just one example:<br>  <br>  Last week - Administration officials state that it may become necessary to begin nationalizing banks.  The market went into freefall.<br>  Same day - Administration officials want to reassure everyone that there are no plans to nationalize banks.  The market began to come back up.<br>  <br>  Today - "The S&P 500 falls below its Nov. 20 closing slow and hits levels last seen in 1997 as economic fear overwhelms news that the government may take a larger stake in Citigroup.

I'm too old to think it started with him or even both/either Bush and/or Clinton hit the scene. <br>  <br>  Just because a car is still going really fast doesn't mean: <br>  -- It hasn't been consuming all but the last few drops of fuel<br>  -- It hasn't been slowly heating up for hours<br>  -- It isn't low on oil and, hence, about to burn up<br>  -- The driver isn't totally off course<br>  -- It isn't headed the wrong way on a one-way road<br>  -- It didn't just fly off a cliff<br>  <br>  Start with all the acts and amendments beginning around 1910 and move forward. <br>  <br>  -- Congress has the Constitutional power to simply increase the money supply if needed... but it can *Not* put that money in an envelope, mail it back to itself, open said envelope and call that money a "loan" to be repaid at exorbitant interest. <br>  <br>  Enter the "Federal Reserve" which is no more federal than Whataburger and keeps no reserves. In fact, they could have named it "The Privately-Owned, Legalized-Theft Cartel". But you know Congress; truth is so complex!<br>  <br>  Then, there was that crucial, stop-gap measure to stop the incessant increase in the number of Lower House Representatives. My Gawd! Imagine if they hadn't set the number at 435 and then Capitol Hill had run out of chairs and there was no space to put more chairs and then they had to build new building?!<br>  <br>  Well, they nipped that smack in the bud, didn't they? Yep. With the "Reapportionment Act of 1929", the Congress protected the Citizenry of the United States from any and all injury which might result from actually being represented as opposed to just taxed without representation (the latter of which seems to squirm its way back into government after government despite the noblest designs of preventing it).<br>  <br>  Fearing I've birthed a veritable diatribe, I'll stop with this: Few things political are more enlightening than hearing the uncharacteristic admonitions of a career military, Texas-Conservative, Republican-President. As such, give a minute to the 'dark side'; listen to President Eisenhower's Farewell Address of 1961, with which he capped his second and final term and the underlying wisdom of which has never effectively been questioned. <br>  <br>  Good luck and may the realities of governance prove more attractive than emotion and all its assumption. <br>  <br>  <br>  ...|`|3g3SCnDDaa	I think it's because the conservatives on here have too much time on their hands...I try to stay away from this section of Yahoo!Answers now, considering the huge amount of ignorance that surrounds it like a giant bubble.

His so called "change" hasn't been what people were expecting it to be. Many of them are not responding positively to Obama because they probably feel like idiots, being that they practically bowed down to him as if he were the Messiah!

TMkhlCCTaa	I support Israel.  I don't understand how the Palestinians have been "refugees" for over 60 years.  Considering the lifespan in Gaza, almost none of the current people were probably alive when Israel was formed.  The problem in my mind is that the other Arab countries won't let the Palestinians into their countries.  Israel occupies "other people's" land because it won its wars (like how the US got Texas) only instead keeping it forever, it uses it as a buffer.  I like to imagine the whole situation as if the US were Israel and Texas was Gaza and the other Arab countries were Mexico.  What would happen to Mexico if it played around bombing the US?

First of all, Congress adopted the HMO's because they had inflated the cost of healthcare so much during the "guns & butter" of the 1960's where they took control of 15-20% of the healthcare dollar.  Now, they control over 50% of the healthcare dollar, and their "babies" the HMO's reign over the industry.<br>  <br>  When American had the least expensive & ebst healthcare in the world (by today's standards as well), people paid msotly cash and had insurance for emergenices.  Now, we over-use insurance, including to provide free healthcare to people who cannot afford emergency room care--even in non-emergency situations. The money for their care comes from the general insurance fund, and is the main contributor to rise healthcare costs (the others: the declining dollar, inflation, taxes,  This is why illegal immigrants are "hurting" us, because we are subsidizing their travels itno the states.  However, in poor neighborhoods you can often find cash-only (no insurance) clinics that charge just about the rate of a co-pay for full routine care.

They do nothing but keep people with their handout which causes more money to come out of my paycheck.|`|I9FOycm6aa	Please god, no.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	Simple,  a person's health, a child's health should not be a profitable thing.<br>  <br>  Why should a bunch of Board Members make decisions on who gets what in order to put more money into their own pockets?   <br>  <br>  A child is born with a disease, lukemia for example, should he be denied coverage because his father worked for Merrill Lynch and was laid off?  <br>  <br>  You need to stop thinking in terms of what pundits and insurance company stockholders want you to think and see that this is more a human rights issue.   We are the richest most powerful nation in the World, and yet we have a health care system that is rated very low for industrialized nations.<br>  <br>  You have no problem with the US Govt being the biggest employer around when it comes to the Armed Forces.  You have no problem with State and Local Governments paying for Police, Firefighters and Teachers, not to mention prisons.|`|6cm6MB66aa	The only thing i want Bush to run is his nose up his azz.

I would rather have a bigger government that will spend its money on its own people then to give the money to foreigners other countries to buy weapons to kill us with . You keep arming the world with our tax dollars it will come back and bite you in the azz. As of now the hardest people to control and do as others say are Americans .

(organizing data using technology, organizing health info so we can all benefit, Allow imported prescription drugs! etc).<br>  <br>  frankly, the best way to deal with health is Prevention. That would save this country a ton of money.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure of everything listed there, but some of the issues deal with Vets and their health. I think most of us know vets have been treated rather shabbily. Which is a crime.<br>  <br>  Health is the best gift we are born with and abusing it is horrible. Education about what to eat and exercise are the real key to making and keeping this country healthy

The banks do not own our money. Any money on deposit with the banks is owned by the depositor, not the bank. So even if the government were to take over the banks (Which it will not do, despite your use of the word "when"), that does not make the government the owner of the money on deposit.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	It will happen as soon as this Summer, all the banks will be owned by the Government look at Wall Street and see where we are going.
gJzEAvNTaa	the united states conducts 60% of the world's arms deals<br>  <br>  for example, ronald reagan sold saddam hussein C & B weapons, ak-47s, air tracer ammunition<br>  <br>  the US also sold and supported the Kugame regime in rwanda which was carrying out the acts of genocide. so wherever there is money to be made? uncle sam will be there, regardless of human rights abuse<br>  <br>  in fact, america downplayed the acts of genocide in the Rwanda to prolong arms deals being made. <br>  <br>  also, you can look up the Suharto regime in INdonesia. he killed hundreds of thousands of civilians who supported his political enemies, and Jimmy Carter, the nobel "peace" prize winner sold Suharto billions in weapons/helicopters/tanks in exchange for oil. <br>  <br>  then there's Chile. uncle sam overthrew the democratically gov't, set up Pinochet and sold a ton of weapons and bombers to his military junta. then they proceeded to bomb civilians for rioting and dissent. again the US downplayed the atrocities b/c business was too good. <br>  <br>  also yuo are very misinformed. Amnesty International reported in Sudan, it was the united states who started the actsd of genocide on July 2005. like Iran Contra, the Bush administration felt the need to train, arm and finance rebels (terrorists) called the SPLA. the Sudanese People's Liberation Army. the US sold them weapons and trained them so the SPLA would overthrow the Sudanese gov't which did not allow US oil companies to dig for oil. <br>  <br>  by international law it is illegal for any nation to arm revolutionaries, but the US has done this everywhere. Colombia, Nicaraguan, Iran Contra, ETA, etc<br>  <br>  it's the same thing in Congo. America once again is supporting rebels and violent militants to overthrow an African government which conflicts with American interests<br>  <br>  to be totally honest w/ you. we don't do enough in african. we're the richest ocuntry in the world and the only UN peace keeping force sent there was in Somalia. we all know how that turned out. contrary to what you see in the media, France, Europe and China does send a lot of aid to Africa. For example, French and Chinese peacekeeping forces are in south shara africa, congo, somalia, sudan, Egypt, Kenya, East Timor, Gabon, ivory coast, giunea, while we send 0 UN peacekeepers anywhere<br>  <br>  so far, just before Bush stepped down, they made a new entity called AFRICOM. it's for building more US military bases in western Africa to overthrow more governments and secure more oil contracts.|`|944e2748d03e1efff042dce931e63f28aa	Why not wonder why the Chinese did nothing to help?<br>  <br>  While I am angered that it took so long for the world to respond, I don't think it's fair or right to only critique the West for their failure to act.  The WORLD failed to act.|`|z2XCCrxqaa	They want the resources found in the ground...|`|ncdTxID9aa	I feel that the USA knew what was going on and should have taken steps to stop the genocide. A horrific number of people died horrible and traumatic deaths in something like 3 months' time. <br>  <br>  Paul's decisions were influenced by his past experiences to a certain degree. Because in the past, he had felt safe, he "passed it off" as something that "couldn't happen here." This is similar to what many of the Jewish people thought when the Nazis began to round them up: that such horrific things couldn't happen in their homeland. As a result of this, he did nothing for a time, hoping it would "blow over." In addition, his wife influenced his decision by being afraid for her life and the life of their children; as well as for Paul. Since Paul was a member of the Hutu class; and his wife was a Tutsi, she and the childen would be targeted; as well as the fact that Paul could be looked at as a sympathizer. She ended up being afraid and Paul tried to send her and the children to another country. Paul's family was sent away with Paul's brother, who was a radio broadcaster, and who, as a result, was looked up to. Paul thought that his brother's status would assist in getting his family to safety. Another person who influenced Paul's decision was his second "wife" later on in the movie. She is the one who "grounded" him and they healed together. She also was his support when Paul went to see his brother in prison/on trial. Finally, his decisions were influenced by a total stranger. The woman stayed in the hotel room next to him when he was visiting his brother. She was at the trials so that she could testify against the war lords.<br>  <br>  Finally, Paul was a teacher and he never let his students forget what happened. <br>  <br>  More than that, though, he was at a hotel and he kept 1200 people safe by putting them up in his hotel. When the soldiers came by, he would pay off the soldiers. He also told his friend, who worked for the UN, about the atrocities, hoping that someone would come to help. He was a leader in the fact that he kept hundreds of terrified and hungry people as calm as could be expected; and he was someone that they all looked up to because he commanded respect.<br>  <br>  <br>  Check this out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.canadians.ca/more/profiles/d/d_romeo_dallaire.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.canadians.ca/more/profiles/d/...</a>|`|AA10742996	I didn't know it was the wests responsibility!

Otherwise, he would stay true to his promise of not passing legislation without the public being able to look at it FIRST. The reason he does it is to continue to feed the blind masses the illusion that he is responsible and is keeping his promises. The sad part is, facts don't phase these people. They eat it up and call him wonderful. Not to worry though...there are many websites dedicated to people who regret it and have awakened from the coma. There really are more of us than the ones who are still making excuses for him, I promise. (another reason he is going out and doing this...if public opinion was SO high as people report and polls appear to indicate, he could do a five minute speech saying "gee golly ain't I wonderful?" and move on...yet he holds one every other day to justify his reckless actions)|`|ljRE5MeAaa	I'm a political junky so more that I can hear from the guy in charge, the better.<br>  <br>  That said, I probably never need to hear this man utter another over enunciated word again!

ujIinLzGaa	Excellent!!<br>  <br>  roninnocal, with all due respect, I think you are missing some things.  The states have to ratify any change in the Constitution, and the Constitution does not grant to the federal government the power to regulate medical care,  vehicles, drugs, abortion, guns, or any of a large number of other things that the federal government has seen fit to regulate.  Even the amendment authorizing the federal income tax was never properly ratified.  The state of Tennessee, which is said to have been one state to ratify it, never even heard it in their legislature, much less voted on it.  The states created the federal government, and the states have the power to declare it null and void when it oversteps its Constitutionally granted powers.  The Civil War did not prove that secession is wrong, it simply proved that the North at the time could overpower the South.  Might does not make right.  Also, the Constitution never actually granted the people any rights in the first place; it merely reaffirmed rights that we already had and will always have, regardless of what anyone says to the contrary.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	"Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth."|`|AA11702773	I love it.  <br>  <br>  I understand the guy who brought it is a Ron Paul supporter, per Campaign for Liberty, and that similar resolutions are being brought before a number of other state legislatures.  <br>  <br>  Viva la r3VOLution!|`|CowgOqXTaa	This, like most "resolutions" by State governments, is effectively meaningless.<br>  <br>  The US Supreme Court is the only arbiter of whether a power exercised by the Federal government has been exercised legally or not. Since the dawn of the 20th Century, they have virtually never found that the Federal Government has exceeded its tenth amendment authority.<br>  <br>  Richard|`|Pe15GxjSaa	I feel most of the Red states will eventually come to this. After the stimulus bill passed, Obama is forcing states to take the money and consequently let the feds mandate how, when, and who the money will be used for. A lot of people are really tired of it.|`|wFmL5tWEaa	I think it is great now all 20 of the other states that have drafted similar resolutions to the federal government need to do the same. They need to totally break away from the federal government  and form their own union apart from the established federal government. The courageous patriots are speaking loudly to the feds.<br>  I just wish that the state of Illinois would get the testicular fortitude to do it, but unfortunately the state of Illinois has Obama croonies working for the federal government.

You will be paid handsomely for your service at the end of the study...|`|WubBcqOBaa	you do know that "The Onion" is satire right?|`|0925b6e49a69fe375d1a58ad2c4b8713aa	Wow, I wonder how many times some people will need to watch this before they figured out that it was a parody.  The funny part is at least one of them will probably take this and run with it (send it to their friends, discuss it in class, etc)|`|81Iglngeaa	Me too, do you know how many lives this research can save!
78Xb7enMaa	Some people 'report abuse' for the most spurious reasons. I guess some don't like opinions different than theirs. I guess you were reported for not answering. This is my third or fourth account, it comes with the territory I'm afraid.|`|SIHg9sWHaa	I dont know what the question was You shoukd of stated!!!<br>  <br>  But if you are positive your anserw is in no way offensive apeal and the violation notice will be retracted i can asure you.<br>  <br>  I it is offensive you stand to lose 10 points ( whoppy do ) But in the past I found yahoo answers mediators to be fair, liberal, sensible and just so you shoudnt have a problem.|`|TDVIb4SBaa	That is nothing I got a violation notice because Yahoo crashed before I could check my answer and it was half finished,when I appealed I got a reply which covered a multitude of things except being unable to finish posting question because of yahoo failure,am still wondering how answer actually was able to be posted|`|HyulW3aiaa	Yahoo are not keen on freedom of speech and work to community guidlines. Someone reports you and wham,violation notice.Take not notice of them.Anything anti labour,black,muslim or sexist etc usually get blackballed.|`|zILwtO22aa	You submitted a question, when an answer was wanted, so it went against Yahoo guidelines,...,been there.|`|hE7fK4W0aa	ahh dont  sweat it dude , lifes too short :)|`|PZZkjST7aa	Don't worry about it, some people are petty, but if you want to know what grounds it would have been on I think it would have been 'not answering the question', if the question was something like 'where can I buy a five man tent?'|`|xxDjV6Axaa	I don't know what the question was but are you referring to something sexual?  Maybe it offended someone, I don't know.  If you think you didn't do anything wrong, send in an appeal.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	There is really only one answer to your question...<br>  <br>  There is no logic to the system whatsoever. I have seen profane, ugly answers slide and perfectly decent and logical answers, including a few of my own, deleted for a reasons that make no sense at all.<br>  <br>  All it takes is a couple of buddies or one person with more than one account to violate you and trying to appeal it is futile most of the time.<br>  <br>  Just continue to answer questions as best you can and don't let it bother you.|`|HKNbWjtOaa	it's because it offended the gay/lesbian trusts as it should cater for all persuasions and variations 2g+2L+1h or 4g + 1L you get the picture|`|auUeI2Vnaa	If you didn't do anything wrong, appeal the violation.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	Maybe somebody clicked the Report Abuse by accident.
97ef16e9c13a4597a175d5786da95200aa	That is a big question and it is really hard to be unbiased. Instead I will try to give you both sides.<br>  <br>  Democrats: You have to spend money to make money. Liberals believe that by building ATV trails, golf carts, buildings, roads, etc. will create jobs because because someone has to make these things.<br>  <br>  Republicans:  Only 3 Republicans out of like 192 voted for the stimulus package. Reason is that this is only a temporary fix. Once the money runs out, who is going to work? It does little to create long term jobs, and your grandchildren will have to pay for it because the government is borrowing the money.<br>  <br>  It is like you are personally deep in debt, but you go to a bank to borrow more money to buy a luxury car to deliver pizza's.|`|byp8ShAjaa	you mean porkulus.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	The same amount of money that was available to the government to spend in large quantity is now available to the public.  The public will not receive enough to compensate for inflation.  The economy is basically unchanged with one exception.  The people who the government was spending the money on will now have nothing unless the government continues to pay them through deficit spending.  Deficit spending increases the amount of money in the system and the value of the dollar will decrease accordingly.  Taxes will increase and pull money out of the system to raise the dollar value.|`|AA10962298	Briefly. Government funds are being spent on infrastructure projects, financial assistance to individulas and businesses and on increasing or extending un-employment compensation. It is meant to put money back into the economy by creating jobs and providing money to get people spending again, so that businesses can become profitable and create more jobs...

Hw8rr1TCaa	They lied 100%. Truth for them as crucifix to vampire.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	Are you in never never land when you use the word conservative? Do you not know that liberals lie just as much? Do you want me to point out each lie that Obama has told already? Of course that would be a pretty long book.|`|sI3kqp7xaa	Great examples.<br>  <br>  Why do Liberals make these sweeping generalizations, with absolutely nothing to back up their deceitfulness???????|`|7B9KEqCnaa	Why limit this to the conservatives.  All politicians do this.  And if you dont believe that then I feel sorry for you.|`|aFC72tLZaa	Conservatives of the NO party believe in tax cuts for the wealthy.  I don't think they are smart enough to lie, they're just ignorant and put party before country.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Every politician lies, or at least bends the truth, to be elected.

You've got to be kidding me.  Jump off your high horse and look at your own party before you start pointing fingers..."I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky" (the greatest political lie of the late 20th century).  So are you the pot or the kettle?|`|9qKAy0dlaa	I don't know if they get elected because they didn't but you will find many people who believe Obama is a Muslim, born in Kenya, who is a communist/socialist who is associated with terrorists like Ayers and the Taliban and will raise taxes and destroy America.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	oh come on now<br>  do you believe this?<br>  and liberals and Dem's do not lie to get elected?<br>  no serious ?<br>  have you noticed any thing unusual since  obama was elected?<br>  please answer truthfully|`|FY17j1Ajaa	How else is ANY politician going to get elected? Tell the voters what they want to hear. This isn't just limited to conservatives. They all do it.
M3maZgdyaa	Spud your 1/2 right banks are not socialized, They are being Nationalized. Government owned and controlled.<br>  <br>  Citi Bank was Nationalized in his first week in office. Bank of America is being Nationalized now along with Wells Fargo and many others. Welcome to socialism. When the transition is complete then the communism will start and we will not have a choice since the Government controls everything even the vote that is if we still have bogus voting.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	All your base belong to us.|`|KF48OjyDaa	Um...it has more to do with the fact that there is a need to nationalize the banks than it is about socialism.|`|fzzkDo3saa	i actually took a political test this weekend online at <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/politics" rel="nofollow">http://www.okcupid.com/politics</a><br>  and Obama was at the bottom left for Socialist.  People are becoming aware.|`|I9FOycm6aa	"F" the dow!|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Wall St warned us not to elect Obama<br>  <br>  Now they are sitting back saying " we told you so"|`|EdnQBmxZaa	I think everyone knows he is a socialist now.  The scary thing is that liberals are no longer denying that fact, but rather embracing it.  This is a dark day in our nation's history.  We are giving up our liberties to a government that insists it is taking them for our own good.  Wake up America...this is exactly why we have a constitution.  Big government will result in universal suffering.  I think many of you don't understand that yet, but you will.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	When will you realize that perpetuating a lie does not make it true?  I wish you neo-cons would stop the BS already...and actually get to work on helping us fix the economy instead of sitting there on the sidelines talking trash yet being too cowardly to actually get in the game!|`|5lflypTiaa	Banks aren't socialized and the markets losing value. That's the only real fact you have to work with. All your doing is speculating.|`|Ka7UjuMbaa	WOW!!! Is everyone loving.....Obamas message of hope called socialism?<br>  <br>  My opinion is...fu dude. This is America!!!<br>  <br>  Go suck some balls...and resign.|`|AA11450062	Someone has to stop them from harming anymore humans. Ask our troops how they like their "socialist" bank.
Ry61ViNZaa	The fools that championed this guy to office are now suffering buyers remorse.<br>  <br>  The thought of easy money was what got him elected.  The times ahead are going to be tough for just those that elected him in.<br>  <br>  As for me, I just hope for some tax relief and that they do not try to actually take away my guns, religion and other FREEDOMS that the founding fathers penned into the Constitution!|`|e19ukSO0aa	Sorry, it still makes whoever is saying it sound dumb and not know what they're talking about.|`|u23sBafTaa	No more like a reality, unfolding more everyday in our faces !|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	It still is far fetched.  It appears the "new" definition extends to any social program.  That is not what socialism really is.  It really is a system where you eliminate all private property, where the the production of goods is owned collectively or by the government, or the first stage to Marx's version of communism, which includes the eventual withering away of all government.|`|tMnWRIcSaa	I prefer to think of The Immigrant as the head of a Kakistocracy.<br>  <br>  Calling him a socialist is offensive to filthy disgusting self righteous socialists everywhere.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Yes.<br>  He's advanced to a Hard Core Communist.|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	<a href="http://www.nationalpriorities.org/costofwar_home" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalpriorities.org/costof...</a>|`|4Wgf6WZraa	I don't under stand why anyone would deny or be surprised that Obama and the Democrats are Socialist. <br>  It was declared as such in 1944 by Norman Mattoon Thomas,  a<br>  leading American socialist, pacifist, and six-time presidential<br>  candidate for the Socialist Party of America.<br>  <br>  Norman Thomas said this in a 1944 speech:<br>  <br>  "The American people will never knowingly adopt socialism. But, under<br>  the name of "liberalism," they will adopt every fragment of the<br>  socialist program, until one day America will be a socialist nation,<br>  without knowing how it happened."<br>  <br>    He went on to say: "I no longer need to run as a Presidential<br>  Candidate for<br>  the Socialist Party. The Democratic Party has adopted our platform."|`|aFC72tLZaa	You don't even know what the word socialism means.  Remember social security, medicare, medicaide, unemployment, food stamps?  Do you know what they are?  Heaven forbid where you got into a situation where you needed help.  Would you say no to unemployment if you lost your job?  Would you refuse food stamps if your children were starving?  Mr. Obama inherited this mess from Captain Bush-beans and his cronies and came up with a plan in 30 days.  If we did nothing, it would be worse than the Great Depression.  You should really listen to a better grade of friends and stop putting your foot in your mouth.|`|204577ae32c80edc66057923f993dd9aaa	OH MY GOD.  He's done nothing he didn't get elected to do.  Sit down, shut up and accept the fact that if your party hadn't screwed the pooch to within an inch of its life for all of the last eight years and the better part of the last 30, you wouldn't be having to choke down the idea that we have a black, liberal president.<br>  <br>  UPDATE;<br>  <br>  Questioner, allow me to enlighten you as to why those programs are "failing" (it's in quotes because depending upon why you think they're failing, we may or may not agree that they are).  They are failing because we are a Democracy and a diverse nation full of varied and differing agendas and so the Democrats and others/Liberals are under unfortunate obligation to care what those of the Republican/Conservative others want...at least to some degree, and when the right is in charge, they have their way, and YOUR WAY is to do everything you can to eliminate these programs and if you can't eliminate them, you underfund them to such an extent that they are bastardizations of what they could have been and could have achieved.<br>  <br>  Your side is so hateful of the poor and working class that they manage to whip into a frenzy even those of you who ARE poor and working class but who link to the party ideology in other ways so that you'll become convinced that helping those in need is bad economics and a violation of your constitutional rights and taking help is shameful.  Thus, though Democrats would create a Welfare system that successfully gets people off Welfare with dignity and a future by sending heads of the family to college, moving people into homes if they're homeless or into livable homes if their homes are unlivable, or train these people to open their own businesses if they're so inclined and then give them some funding to do it, Republicans make sure that these programs get underfunded to such a degree that people are given just enough money not to die and never enough money to be able to stop using these programs.  This is done to the detriment of everyone in society, because we wind up with lifelong welfare recipients instead of people who could have had their fortune completely changed, never to need Welfare again, and positioned to give back to those who have less, in 4-6 years. So if you're really concerned about the programs failing, try getting out of the way.|`|fzzkDo3saa	No, did you see the details of the "stimulus" plan?  Very disturbing.  Just a bunch of pet programs and welfare crap. Not a stimulus at all, if you work.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	Step by step we are closer and closer everyday.  We sit in shock and awe and do nothing. Our Founding Father would be Ashamed.|`|B6BUR6zJaa	"Socialist" seems too kind these days.<br>  <br>  I'll be sitting here thinking up new names for him.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	calling him a socialist may be too kind!|`|cMHxg372aa	Of course, we'd have to apply the same term to Bush too then, now wouldn't we?<br>  <br>  While it is technically true that the administration is engaging in "socialism," there's a difference between nationalizing banks out of necessity and being an ideological socialist. Believe me, the administration is NOT happy that they're having to deal with all this. Politically, it's lose/lose/lose any way you play it.<br>  <br>  I don't think those advocating the laissez-faire approach really understand what the consequences of that would be. It would not be free-market capitalism, it would spell the end of market capitalism. For instance, if BoA and Citi were allowed to just fail, all of their assets would be liquidated simultaneously. This would drive down the prices of all marked-to-market bank assets to nothing. The entire financial system would collapse - everything from Wall Street to community banks. A world-wide run on every bank would ensue. Nearly all economic activity would grind to a halt. World GDP would decrease 80-90% within a week. All debts would be zeroed out. All assets would be crushed. All savings would be destroyed. Within days, the world would be in a state of either total anarchy or martial law, and then we really would have socialism.|`|kmV5MnvPaa	"I think Jefferson would have wanted us to overthrow this Government"<br>  So you think Jefferson would have wanted us to overthrow someone who is trying to do his best with the crap Bush left behind, but i'm guessing you didn't want to get rid of Bush his first month in office, did you? Maybe because when bush had been in office only a month he hadn't had time to screw anything up and he at least received a good economy from Clinton.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mike Said "It didn't seem socialist before either, One would only have to take a look at his senate voting record to see what this man was all about , <br>  But it's highly doubtful many who voted for him did that, But looked no further then the color of his skin." <br>  <br>  Really??? thats about the most racist thing i've ever heard.

They also receive free cable television to entertain themselves free food free water free clothing and jobs. While the law obiding citizens have to pay for there own aswell as the inmates. It would be cost effective to execute everyone facing a life sentence but nobody knows if there innocent or not.the unemployment rate is out of control in the citizen population but the inmates are making money doing jobs in prison. There wages are very very low but it is still a job that a non criminal citizen could have sent from my iPhone|`|jqNhg4T2aa	I think some prisons have computers, but the use is scheduled and probably very restricted.|`|byp8ShAjaa	I hope not
YupMCYHlaa	They do, but their idea of capitalism changes with time.  Originally capitalism was a co-equal partnership between capital and labor.  Each side needed the other, and they were both free to negotiate wages, and that was how the fairest level of compensation was arrived at.  Just like any transaction between buyer and seller.  But American-style capitalism today is all about capital, labor is seen as a drag on the economy.<br>  <br>  In other words, capitalism was once seen as the best system because it raised the standard of living for everyone.  The standard of living was the whole purpose, the pursuit of profit was only a means to an end.  Today, though, profits are not the means to an end, they are the end in itself.  So anything that boosts profits is seen as good, even if it causes poverty among workers.<br>  <br>  Republicans believe in capitalism for the successful and socialism for loss.  If a big corporation like Chrysler or AT&T loses a lot of money, they are considered 'too big to fail' so the govt. helps them out.  But if -you- lose your job and can't make your mortgage payments, you're on your own.<br>  <br>  The GOP has never believed in public schools (or public -anything-).  They don't want social mobility. They want kids to get as good an education as their parents can afford.  Well-off parents don't want their kids to have to compete with 'rabble' for the good jobs.|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	capitilism is an 80/20 mix of mercantalism and socialism and that is why the system is pretty brilliant we realize there will always be need of social programs and there will always be the elderly, widowed, fatherless, motherless, poor people and even lazy people and that typically will be 20% of the population give or take a few points <br>  <br>  so yes I am all for capitalism as it is laid out properly <br>  <br>  God is so good ....all the time <br>  <br>  I am my brothers keeper|`|cMHxg372aa	They'll say no publicly, but that's the logical end result of their ideology, and one that many support privately. It's not really capitalism though - it's neo-feudalism.|`|AEtGbSs6aa	Of course not, dont be so ridiculous...but I do support smaller government..not a big government nationalization like Obama is doing..less freedom for you and me!|`|ohgrMZDkaa	Not total capitalism, just less socialism then Democrats.|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	FYI - Law enforcement and fire fighters are handled by local governments, not the federal government.  That allows them to remain more efficient on use of money because they have to maintain budgets.  It's the federal government that is unable to make efficient use of money since they aren't forced to stick to a budget.<br>  <br>  Where Capitalism comes into play is in the economy with businesses, consumers, and profits.  And that portion needs to be 95% capitalism in order to prosper. In particular, you can not socialize losses and expect capitalism to succeed.  What drives capitalism is the ability to fail and try again until you succeed.  Without failure there's no way to learn and improve in order to reach that point of success.<br>  <br>  True Republicans just want the country to be run based on the early foundations that were  so successful. There are some basics that the government should handle, government should be kept as small as possible, and each state controls all powers not specifically granted to the federal government in the Constitution.|`|xjcZkmpbaa	This is really a sad and silly argument.  Some level of government funded public service is both necessary and desirable.  But that does not mean that if you accept government fire fighters that you are compelled to accept total government control of all aspects of the economy.  In the real world, there are degrees.  And reasonable people can disagree as to where the line between public and private involvement should be drawn without resorting to some ridiculous "all or nothing" argument.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	Well, I guess since we have fire departments, and police departments and public schools that we should just become a socialist nation, screw our forefathers and screw capitalism, right?<br>  <br>  Let's do all the things that sound nice, because surely they must be nice, we'll just cross our fingers, how can we go wrong?|`|sI3kqp7xaa	You're all over the place with this question.....<br>  <br>  Capitalism works the best, but it needs regulations.<br>  To keep Capitalists from ruling the land, there should be certain LIMITED regulations in place.<br>  <br>  On the flip side, having Government control everything - it's doomed to be a failure.<br>  <br>  Having the Government dictate what products Industries are to produce, you're stifling innovation and entrepreneurship - which stifles economic growth.|`|OZRiZQg4aa	The only diff between republicans and demos is religion and taxcuts.<br>  No, republicans nowadays are keysians all the way. <br>  Only Libertarians practice Austrian School of Economics which use pure capitalism.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	not sure they but think about it, we pay fireman and police thru our taxes to do their jobs. Take out the taxes, get the gov't out of it, oversee it and let private companie get the job done better and cheaper right? What's wrong with that? Then, you kind of go on a rant I guess....|`|fzzkDo3saa	Real Republicans do.  Democrats retard capitalism.|`|JZMfUDylaa	yes and so do Democrats|`|KJZol6Gpaa	No.  Everyone (except, perhaps, a few Libertarians or Anarchists) understands that there are legitimate functions of government.<br>  <br>  It is difficult to generalize for all Republicans, because there are many types of Republicans.  Like the Democrats, the Republicans are a coalition.  However, in general, the Republicans are the more conservative party, and conservatism is pretty well defined:<br>  <br>  Conservative values include:<br>  <br>  * Honesty. That means simply always telling the truth, and keeping your commitments. Applied to government & politics, it means strict construction of constitutions and statutes to mean what they were intended to mean, taking oaths of office seriously (including oaths to uphold the Constitution and its widely ignored 10th Amendment), and resisting the temptation to mislead people about your political opponents or your own goals.<br>  <br>  * Family. Love, honor & take care of your spouse, children, parents & siblings. Honor your marriage vows.<br>  <br>  * Faith. Love the Lord your God, with all your heart. Obey His precepts, and seek His will daily in prayer and the study of scripture. Join & support a church, & tithe faithfully, for where your treasure is there your heart will be also.<br>  <br>  * Limit the size and scope of government to those areas which cannot be handled by the private sector.<br>  <br>  * Limit the federal government to those objects of government which cannot be handled by State and local governments.<br>  <br>  * Frugality & hard work. Work hard, study hard, save instead of borrow. Live within your means. If it is humanly possible for you to do so, carry your own weight. Do not depend of government handouts unless you truly have to, and if that happens then do so as little as possible. Do not promote dependency in others, for that is harmful both to them and to those who have to do the work they should be doing for themselves.<br>  <br>  * Charity.  Studies show that conservatives, and especially Christian conservatives, are much more generous than are liberals.  Liberals like to give away OTHER people's money.<br>  <br>  * "Rescue those who are being led away to slaughter... speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves" says Proverbs. Promote justice, and defend the unborn from abortion, and the elderly from euthanasia. Note that the Republican Party (the USA's more conservative party) was founded for the purpose of emancipating slaves, and the Democratic Party (the USA's more liberal party) is the ancestral home of Jim Crow and the KKK. Likewise, the Republican Party is today the party which seeks to stem the slaughter of innocent babies by "choice."<br>  <br>  * Self control. Avoid gluttony, rash words & actions, covetousness, etc..<br>  <br>  * Purity. Honor God's gift of sexuality by refraining from sex outside of your own marriage. When you experience temptations to do otherwise, resist them. If you have disordered sexual attractions, such as attractions to members of the same sex, be strong, and do not indulge them, even in your fantasies.<br>  <br>  * Eschew socialism, promote capitalism. Limit government interference in the marketplace as much as practical. Oppose excessive taxation and regulation, and Keynesian demand-side economic folly.<br>  <br>  * Recognize that the most important of those later objects is national defense, and that nothing is as apt to provoke attacks by evil men as perceived weakness in their foes. Accordingly, support a strong American military, to deter aggression when possible, and thwart it when necessary.<br>  <br>  * Patriotism & duty. Really, this is just a form of selflessness: being willing to sand up for what is right, and sacrifice for your countrymen.<br>  <br>  * Liberty -- defined as the freedom to do what you ought, not the right to do whatever you wish.|`|jVUEohsNaa	You need to do a little research.  Conservatives support the USA government doing what it was set up to do.  Wage war, and maintain the infrastructure.  Local governments can set up their own fire departments or not...<br>  <br>  The problem is Obama and his liberal cronies want to have government do EVERYTHING and control everything. <br>  <br>  Big Brother is here..<br>  <br>  And yes, homeless shelters should close, hospitals shouldn't take care of non paying people UNLESS THE HOSPITAL CHOOSES TO DO SO AT ITS OWN EXPENSE..<br>  <br>  And yes, you grew up in a tax sucking welfare home, and now that you are an adult you should pay us all back!|`|buIZVoYzaa	Of course not. Most people and I would say from both sides realize a balance is needed. If any side gets too much power it's never pretty. Right now there is a concern because the dems have total control.

By this I’m referring to the way people conduct business and how people earn their money. Let me give you an example of “capitalism”. <br>  <br>  You are know a guy who has an apple orchard who takes the time to prune his trees, make sure they are disease free and are properly watered. It is in the growers interest to “find” a market for his product to make money to survive on. <br>  <br>  Lets say you have a location in which you sell fruits and he approaches you to help him to sell his apples. The two of you negotiate a price, come up with a realistic number of apples you can sell and his ability to meet a demand. A contract is born and twice a week he brings you 3 bushels of apples for you to sell for him. <br>  <br>  He’s not in the business of selling the apples and your not in the business of growing them yet both of you work together to create a “market” for anyone who wants apples. <br>  <br>  Across the street where you own your business lies your competition. He also sells fruit and is dependent on a grower to supply him with a product that people can buy. It is in his best interest to sell a product either superior to yours to make people want to buy apples from him and not from you. There are several ways to do this. Many say what is important to a seller is; location,  location,  location! If his fruit stand borders a parking lot and you sell our apples on a side walk with limited access and parking, his fruit stand is more “convenient” to get to. The “market” for his produce goes up and yours doesn’t.<br>  <br>  To “compete” with him and attract more customers to you, you make arrangements with a cook who is an expert at cooking with fruits to answer questions for your customers about cooking with apples and you put up a sign advertising the a benefit of shopping at your place versus your competitor across the street. You have now appealed to those who had chosen to buy from him out of convenience into one in which the customer doesn’t mind the inconvenience of having to walk a little further to buy from you where, in addition to buying your apples they can get those little pointers as to how to bake the perfect apple pie.<br>  <br>  Watching his business die a slow death your competitor gets his own cooking expert to match your abilities but over a period of time people have become used to having the ability to ask your cooking expert questions about cooking with apples and through word of mouth, people who want to buy and cook with apples have recommended your produce stand as the one they like best.  <br>  <br>  In an effort to attract customers back to himself your competitor lowers the cost of his apples by having a sale. Instead of selling his apples for .5 cents per apple he lowers his price to .4 cents. People are always looking for the best “buy” for their money and begin to buy from him again. <br>  <br>       Obviously this is a very simplistic example but it is how basic capitalism works. Other more complex issues involve different types of advertising; you advertise your product was grown “naturally” verses having been grown with insecticides to sell your product. Exporting your product over seas to expand your market and buying up the “little guy” to limit consumer choice and ensuring that when people buy their apples you have increased the likelihood that they are buying yours. <br>  <br>  What your extended comments contain don’t have anything directly to do with capitalism but with social issues that we all end up paying for with the taxes levied on our pay checks. To touch upon that portion of your question the answer as you asked it is yes. Yes, republicans like to have firefighters put out the fires in their homes and they support the police  and understand that it is beneficial to have a place where their children can be educated  and other basic necessities. <br>       <br>  What republicans are against is wasteful social programs. Should people pay 10 dollars in food stamps for a pack of cigarettes? No, of course not. That money is for food not tobacco habits. Should people who “can” work be getting a check from the taxpayers to stay at home and play video games all day or should it be expected that they should have to work? If they have the ability to work, let them go out and get a job like the rest of us do. We all want to stay at home too. How is it fair that they get to stay home and still get a check home and we don’t? <br>  <br>  Some people can’t work and it’s reasonable to expect that my tax dollars need to be spent to help that person survive. Some people can’t afford medical costs when they are involved in a car crash and that seems reasonable that the taxpayer will have to help fund the cost. But breast enlargement and treatment for balding men are not necessary or life threatening and taxpayers should not have to pay for that.<br>  <br>  I hoped this helped, Good Luck|`|kprKXEOSaa	Why do you make this leap?  Everyone knows that government has its place, there are some things that government is better equipped to do, like building highways and the military.  Liberals and Conservatives just differ in how much they think government should do.  I want less government meddling in my life, and less government reaching into my pocket.  People in this country are very charitable, but government forcing me to support social programs I don't believe in, that's not charity.  It's fascism.  Look it up.

The PC brigade are certainly obsessive, and their influence seems to have extended its gangrenous hand into every sphere of life.  Everyone has to watch their backs nowadays, or risk being sued or accused of offence.  Religious issues have taken on racial overtones, due to the confusion in understanding the difference between race and religion now so prevalent.<br>  <br>  Sadly, I think this madness will continue as long as people lack the courage to refuse to play the game.  After all, things only have power if people collective collude in giving them power by going along with it.  If people got up tomorrow and decided no more PC, there would be none.|`|7b71287270d8cb608d239de158f4a044aa	Well it does seem to be a bit of a storm in a tea cup but it's a fact that that some-one actively pushing their lifestyle views on to me will get me riled.

And this government has given these sick people political clout to the Extreme . There is unfairness in all collections of concentrated populations it comes with the territory , and no society runs without things to be ashamed of . But to have a small collection of people who see there roll in life is to put all wrongs to rights is insane , For the very ones you  need to be open minded and mentally stable , are picked from a part of society who know nothing about the daily struggles of ordinary people and almost nothing about having to look for enough to eat , They are the Margret Thatchers of society and nobody was more unstable than her , A small incident in her career marked her for who and what she was , at the beginning of her premiership she was asked about the fast rise in food stuffs and how the normal family could cope and her answer was Why don't they do what i do and all go out and purchase ￡500 of food in bulk and get a cheaper price . At that time the average wage was ￡16 per week , and most families could not dream of ￡500 in their savings bank let alone spend it all in one go. Marie Antonetta had little on Maggie . and that is what we suffer from now but the bleeding hearts now seem to see that they must apease every forigner in this country at our expence and untill we kick out this crazy govrerment and its hangers on sanity will not return.|`|HltUWMgOaa	Personally I am of the belief that the treatment given to the said nurse was/is illegal under UK law.<br>  <br>  Article 9 Human Rights Act 1998.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.humanism.org.uk/campaigns/freedom-of-belief" rel="nofollow">http://www.humanism.org.uk/campaigns/fre...</a>|`|Qbwqrmnlaa	Offering to say a prayer for someone who is sick or frail is no different to offering to open the door for someone or carry their shopping, it conveys to that person that you care and empathise with them. Its just a prayer, not a full blown conversion or baptism. In what way can caring for someone be offensive.<br>  <br>  Had the nurse been of any other religion her bosses would not have suspended her. Who knows perhaps the old lady might have been  offended if the nurse wore a veil and asked if she could get out her prayer mat! <br>  <br>  The pc brigade are so keen not to offend muslims that christianity is being pushed aside.

Good politicians know what's possible, they pick their fights carefully.  Sometimes they are charlatans and opportunists, but they can also be good in their jobs.  The problem is that politicians who are good at getting elected are not so often actually good at governing.<br>  <br>  Richard Nixon, for instance, was a very expert politician but a crook.  Bill Clinton was also an expert politician, and despite his faults I think he did a better job for the American people.|`|lPwdDpxgaa	No politician is his or her own person.  All have backers.  They are just puppets who represent the agenda of their backers.  <br>  <br>  A brilliant politician would be one who could convince the public that he or she actually has genuine original thoughts, and that they are acting in the public's best interests.  <br>  <br>  So far, Obama was 'brilliant' during the campaign, but little by little, he is cracking, and the agenda of his globalist backers is coming through.  Only the most uninformed and ignorant actually think politicians mean what they say.  The key is to find out how 'brilliant' their backers are, and in Obama's case, the ultra-rich globalist banksters have pulled off the biggest scam of the century!  Brilliant - but devastating for us!|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	Well a brilliant politician – there are two ways to look at that <br>  <br>  Either one who actually does the will of the people and solves for the problems of the day and for the future as well <br>  <br>  But Hitler was also a brilliant “politician” and Barry is proving to be one too.

He had a gift for touching ordinary people, and he really believed in doing what was best for America.  He died, and probably knew it would happen sooner rather than later, but he remained the same caring, compassionate man who was willing to make the really tough choices and then follow through.  Endless, pointless discussion was not his style.<br>  <br>  My state representative from my district is also great.  He genuinely cares and it's obvious.

zH0h0Tr0aa	Type of government<br>  The Preamble lays down the type of government that India has adopted - Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sovereign<br>  The word sovereign means supreme or independent. India is internally and externally sovereign - externally free from the control of any foreign power and internally, it has a free government which is directly elected by the people and makes laws that govern the people.<br>   Socialist<br>  The word socialist was added to the Preamble by the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976. It implies social and economic equality for all its citizens. There will be no discrimination on the basis of caste, colour, creed, sex, religion or language. Everybody will be given equal status and opportunities. The government will make efforts to reduce the concentration of wealth in a few hands, and provide a decent standard of living to all.<br>  <br>  India has adopted a mixed economic model, and the government has framed many laws to achieve the goal of socialism, such as Abolition of Untouchability and Zamindari Act, Equal Wages Act and Child Labour Prohibition Act.<br>   Secular<br>  The word secular was inserted into the Preamble by the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976. It implies equality of all religions and religious tolerance. India does not have any official state religion. Every person has the right to preach, practice and propagate any religion of their own choice. The government does not favour or discriminate any religion. It treats all religions with equal respect. All citizens, irrespective of their religious beliefs are equal in the eyes of law. No religious instruction is imparted in government or government - aided schools.<br>   Democratic<br>  India is a free country; vote from any place, specific seats are given out for Scheduled social group and scheduled tribes (22%) in parliament called (reserved voters), in local body election a proportion of seats are given out for women candidates. There is also a proposal to give out 33% seats in all elections to woman candidates, at this moment there is no agreement how to apply it and which seats should be given out. The Election Commission of India is responsible for performing free and fair elections.<br>   Republic<br>  As opposed to a monarchy, in which the head of state is appointed on hereditary basis for a lifetime, or until he abdicates, a republic is a state in which the head of state is elected, directly or indirectly, for a fixed tenure. The President of India is elected by an electoral college for a term of five years.!~!
d8m44rGaaa	Hi, I am Krust's other profile.<br>  <br>  I would avoid enlisting unless you absolutely cannot finish your degree any other way. It will likely be two years before you can start school again because you will be busy with training for your job and stuff. Another problem is that medical degrees frequently require a year of clinicals, and that is going to be hard if not impossible while on active duty. Factor in deployments and an erratic work schedule. Here are my suggestions:<br>  <br>  1) Look into ROTC, there are programs for people who have 3, 2, or even 1 year of college left. If you are getting too old for this they can waiver your age. I bet they would happy to do this for someone who is trying to go into Nursing, medical people are in high demand.<br>  <br>  2) You can enlist, but if you do, go for a commissioning program as soon as possible to finish your degree. You are 28 now and 35 will come up quicker than you think. BUT, there is a gamble here, commissioning programs are selective and a lot of people get turned down.<br>  <br>  3) How long do you have in school? If possible, just suck it up and make finishing your priority for the next year or two, even if you have to quit work and rack up some debt. The military has student loan repayment programs if you are non-prior service. Plus officer pay is pretty good and you should make enough to pay off those debts pretty quick.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, I think you can do this. And don't only take what I posted, do some research on this, I bet you might find certain programs or a better plan that works for you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Also, take a look at the interservice PA program, it might be something you would be interested in. Here is the link.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.samhouston.army.mil/ipap/New%20IPAP%20Home%20Page.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.samhouston.army.mil/ipap/New%...</a>|`|5ZPhAlMlaa	Well first off if your a single parent.. thats a no go.. and more than likely its gonna be a tough road, if you can.. 28s not the best age to do so.. officers have to be in pretty good shape, and they're will be a lot of studying and reading.. just like going back to school.

I think you may be too old to enlist in the AF anyways, but are still OK to get a commission.<br>  <br>  I am 32 and going to Army OCS. I spent the last two month exercising five times a week and am pretty fit. Age is just a number. There are 40 year olds that go through Army OCS and make it just fine.<br>  <br>  Your problem might be with your GPA and degree type. The Air Force is picky about their degrees, they like technical (like engineers or programmers) or medical degrees and high GPAs (at least 3.2, the higher the better). Bring it up if you can and they do take non-technical degrees, you just need to bring up that GPA. You aren't out of the game yet. They do make exceptions on the GPA if you are strong in other areas, like volunteer work, etc.<br>  <br>  Officers generally need medical degrees to get medical jobs, like nursing, med tech, or doctor degrees. This is true for most branches.<br>  <br>  Worst case scenario is the Air Force turns you down but try anyways. The Army will take you, they aren't as picky.<br>  <br>  My suggestion: Try the AF first and see if they accept you as an officer. If not, try another recruiter just to be sure. If it isn't going to happen, consider becoming an Army officer.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Being a female won't affect anything, there are plenty of female officers in the military. Being a parent is fine as long as your husband is around to take care of the kids while you are in training or deployed. They only have a problem if you are a single parent.|`|AA10709853	if are not a Nurse  with a BSN, a Doctor or have at least a Masters in health Administration, you will not be  getting into OTS.

For one thing, perjury could carry a heavier penalty than GBH.  Another point is that if there's a credible case against him without your evidence but you lie in the court and are found out, this could undermine the whole proceedings and damage the case against him resulting in his release.  No matter what you think of him, you should only say what's true, if he's what you say then he'll soon end up inside or receive a beating for something else anyway.  Besides, if you lie about him in the court but he isn't sent down, you'll be giving him good reason to start a vendetta against you.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	No.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	No I want to be able to sleep at night.

Yes, it would be good to see due justice for someone with this kind of reputation but not at the expense of you breaking the law.  If fate is good and proper, his time will come.  You should tell the truth and nothing but the truth .... but I suggest that it wasn't a good idea asking such an incriminating question on here.|`|AA12341057	Don't lie, he did enough to get himself sent down. If you lie, there's a strong chance that a decent defense attorney (or barrister, I guess?) could unravel your testimony and he'll get off free and clear.|`|rftEZA50aa	If he was a terror then yea, I'd lie cos he deserved it since he's been terrorising the estate and people are fed up of him. If only for some peace and quiet. Plus I wouldn't feel bad since he was part of it.|`|aSs0tfjUaa	I would not lie for anyone in Court. <br>  <br>  It is morally wrong as well as a serious criminal offence. There can be absolutely no justification for it whatsoever.|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	No because that would let some other scumbag off the hook.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	No I would not<br>  <br>  Why would I risk going to jail?|`|I9FOycm6aa	no|`|G8zAPz8Maa	Hypothetically, I would have no trouble in telling outrageous lies to start a war for instance. Just tell me when you want me what my lines are and what the pay is.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	Well, if you lie, lie good cause they will cross examine everything. You can't screw up.<br>    Does he deserve it? Apparently he has a long list of priors and a long list of future's if someone doesn't take him down. Sometimes to save a nation we must deny someone the truth. It all works out in the end.<br>    But if try to lie without believing it yourself, they will know it and your testimony won't count. Good luck on this hypothetical project
AA11494150	Any lower penalties or amended charges are at the discretion of the judge. It will not cost you any more to appear, so as long as you have the time, it may be worth it. <br>  <br>  You may want to ask about diversionary programs, such as community service or traffic school. Those programs vary too, depending on where you got the ticket.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	unless their was a mistake made on ticket<br>  or you were stopped with other vehicles at same time(showing that cop did not use laser on your specific car)<br>  or you can prove that so many other cars around you cop could not have clear view of your car <br>  you will be charged with speeding <br>  \ask judge to be easy on you and go to a driving course otherwise you will be charged with it<br>  good luck|`|Y0OBhlIwaa	the only way to get out of a ticket is through court. but according to your to your story you are going to get a good lawyer. sorry.|`|DrQ65EaAaa	Traffic school.  Points off.  Ask the Judge.|`|u37jksU0aa	Yup. Pay it and slow down|`|fAaLjlI0aa	First of all, fight the ticket. Go to the court, ask the date be rescheduled for at least a month out. This will give you time to prepare. If you were not doing the speed the office states, then you will have to have evidence to show as much...if there is a problem with your speedometer, then have a shop put that in writing. Find out what the laws are in your area pertaining to the method (and the rules of said method) of speed measurement...i.e. if he clocked you or used radar, what the specs are on the radar, when was the last time it was calibrated, etc. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't show up for the court date, the ticket will likely be dismissed. If not, you can request traffic school since it is your first offense. You go to a traffic school class (usually about 8 hours, and some courts allow you to "attend" online), and not only is it dismissed, but your insurance company never receives anything from DMV about it, and the points are not put on your license. You will have to pay a fine (sometimes called "bail") and you'll have to pay the cost of the traffic school, but that's usually much less than the additional cost if your insurance were to go up, particularly with a newer driver. Good luck.

No one ever said you had to agree with everything Rush said.<br>  b. He criticized Bush as much as anyone. Rush is a conservative. So, when republicans do not behave in a conservative fashion, he and others are the first to criticize them. And, since Bush often did not behave as a conservative, Rush often criticized him. <br>  c. Because democrats NEVER behave conservatively, they take the brunt of his ire and mine.<br>  d. You would know this if you ever actually listened to him.<br>  <br>  But you don't. So I'm not surprised that you don't understand what he was saying with he said he hoped Obama would fail.

That is a loss of 5,946.54 points or 43% of its value.<br>  <br>  However, we all know that that was Obama's fault.|`|kCwhs8Reaa	46% ... that's it!?<br>  <br>  We need to quit getting in the way of capitalism fixing itself.

But somehow...that's Obama's fault too.|`|KoxBca7waa	The Market dropped because of the Housing bubble, which was caused by Democrats and their push for the CRA, which was signed by Clinton in 1999. But I would not expect you to know this because Democrats feel that they can do no wrong. Except the fact they ruined our economy with their socialistic programs.<br>  <br>  And actually it is partially Obama's fault, because he sued Citibank under the CRA, for not giving out HIGH-RISK loans... to those who could not afford them. So you are right it is partly Obama's fault.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself why did he sue them, because they would not do it on their own. They had to be forced to do it because, economically it is a stupid thing to do. Now we are seeing the effects of these actions.|`|4fe57b5c446aad12ac2483ea0782d468aa	It took Bush 15 months while it took OB 4 weeks...on your last comment. tell jimmy Carter that.|`|VDgAJETtaa	because they don't fact check..|`|iSoXvwAIaa	yes|`|3Q5IagWyaa	Yes since the Democrats took control of congress the dow has averaged a loss of 416 points per month. And now the first month of Obama's administration it has fallen over 500 points so it looks like he is ahead of schedule.|`|Iqt83k0daa	Yes it did. So why did Barney Frank say that Fannie and Freddie were sound entities when the brunt of this began in the housing market? He was the chairman. It was his oversight.<br>  <br>  Brian is right. You really need to start understanding what Congress is responsible for.<br>  <br>  In response to your last entry. Again, you really need to start understanding what Congress does. If you look back in history, when Democratic Presidents did well they usually had a Republican Congress. The periods when there was both a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President were the worst. FDR/Carter

Most of them fail. Out of an average intake of 125 candidates, the grueling selection process will weed out all but 10. There is now a joint selection process, UKSF selection, for both the SAS and SBS.<br>  Selection Phase 1 - Endurance <br>  The first phase of selection is known as the endurance or 'the hills' stage. This is the endurance portion of selection and not only tests a candidate's physical fitness, but also their mental stamina. To pass this phase, a high level of determination and self-reliance is vital. <br>  The hills stage lasts 3 weeks and takes place in the Brecon Beacons and Black Hills of South Wales. Candidates have to carry an ever-increasingly-heavy bergen over a series of long timed hikes, navigating between checkpoints. No encouragement or criticism is provided by the supervising staff at the checkpoints. SAS Directing Staff (DS) are fully-badged members of the regiment and leave each candidate to their own devices. This can be a marked contrast from the selectee's experience in their parent units. They would be used to their instructors shouting constant instructions at them, along with encouragement and abuse. The demands of life in a special forces unit require each member to be self-motivated. <br>  The endurance phase culminates with 'the long drag', a 40 mile trek carrying a 55lb bergen, that must be completed in under 24 hours. <br>  Selection Phase 2 - Jungle Training<br>  Those who have passed stage 1 have to then pass jungle training. Training takes place in Belize, in the heart of deep jungles. Candidates learn the basics of surviving and patrolling in the harsh conditions. SAS jungle patrols have to live for weeks behind enemy lines, in 4 man patrols, living on rations. Jungle training weeds out those who can't handle the discipline required to keep themselves and their kit in good condition whilst on long range patrol in difficult conditions. Again, there is a mental component being tested, not just a physical. Special Forces teams need men who can work under relentless pressure, in horrendous environments for weeks on end, without a lifeline back to home base. <br>  Selection Phase 3 - Escape & Evasion & Tactical Questioning (TQ)<br>  The small number of candidates who have made it through endurance and jungle training now enter the final phase of selection. The likelihood of a special operation going wrong behind enemy lines is quite high, given the risks involved. The SAS want soldiers who have the wherewithal and spirit required to escape and evade capture and resist interrogation.<br>  For the escape and evasion (E&E) portion of the course, the candidates are given brief instructions on appropriate techniques. This may include talks from former POWs or special forces soldiers who have been in E&E situations in the real world. <br>  Next, the candidates are let loose in the countryside, wearing World War 2 vintage coats with instructions to make their way to a series of waypoints without being captured by the hunter force of other soldiers. This portion lasts for 3 days after which, captured or not, all candidates report for TQ.<br>  Tactical Questioning (TQ) tests the prospective SAS men's ability to resist interrogation. They are treated roughly by their interrogators, often made to stand in 'stress positions' for hours at a time, while disorientating white noise is blasted at them. When their turn for questioning comes, they must only answer with the so-called 'big 4' (name, rank, serial number and date of birth). All other questions must be answered with 'I'm sorry but I cannot answer that question.' Failure to do so results in failing the course. The questioners will use all sorts of tricks to try and get a reaction from the candidates. They may act friendly and try to get their subjects chatting; or they stand inches away from their subjects and scream unfavourable remarks about the sexual habits of their mothers. Female interrogators may laugh at the size of their subject's manhood. Of course, a real interrogation would be a lot more harsh and the subject would not know that they get to leave alive when it's all over. That said, days of interrogations and enduring the stress positions and white noise break down a man's sense of time and reality. The SAS are looking for men who can withstand such treatment long enough so that the effects of revealing any operational information they might have can be lessoned by HQ. <br>  After all that...<br>  The small number of men who make it through selection receive the coveted beige beret with the distinctive winged dagger insignia. As a newly badged member of the Special Air Service they can feel justly proud. They are not out of the woods, however, as they are now effectively on probation. As brand new members of the regiment, they will be watched closely by the DS as they enter continuation training. Many SAS soldiers are RTU'd (returned to unit) during training.

AA11496527	I think Palin would be a better president since she has not stagnated, and has excelled in her previous elected positions. In a sense she  has worked her way through the ranks since 94 (I believe). I also know she was not the brightest bulb in the room during her last run with McCain, but two thing struck me while watching her. One: She is a good communicator. Two: No doubt in my mind that she would scour the subject (Like Obama) until she knew it inside and out, and I think she has the mental capacity to do it. I've met woman in business that remind me of Palin, they are tough, smart, and not much gets by them.  As for Jindal, truly a good politician but not electable in my opinion.<br>  He would serve well in any one's cabinet as he is super smart, but he really doesn't look presidential and that will knock him out of a presidential race quickly... I know, sounds racist or something, but charisma and looks are part of the game. Kind of like; I could have told Chis Dodd not to run for president last year, he doesn't look the part.|`|abIVkWELaa	I personally like both of them.

I heard they have even extended the GI Bill this year to cover tuition and living expenses for college once you get out of the military (it used to only give you about ~$1200 a month without covering all expenses), so you might get to go to college for free in a few years, no strings attached.|`|AA10788612	Oh yes, join the USAF.

But I tell ya, the best fun was with my friends there. I went to Japan, Australia, & Philippines. It was good to see the world.

(That's a quote from the First Amendment.)  The First Amendment's language explicitly limits its scope to the federal government ("Congress shall make no law"), but I believe that all 50 State Constitutions have similar provisions.<br>  <br>  However, there is nothing in either the federal Constitution or in any State Constitution that I know of which forbids reasonable statutes requiring you to obtain a permit, or not block traffic, or similar.|`|0cfwrcx5aa	you can protest all you want on private property, as long as you have the approval of the property's owner.<br>  <br>  public property is another matter.  you have to take into consideration that you will possbily be blocking traffic, or interrupting business going on in the area.  its only fair to give people in the area a heads up if its a peaceful protest.<br>  <br>  also, the city needs to have officers prepared if things get out of hand.  <br>  im not saying that the police should prevent people from protesting, but if a bunch of protestors are destroying MY property while protesting the government, im going to start shooting, regardless if i agree with them or not.|`|D5A9JUDMaa	No.   You are free to protest, but if your protest is going to involve closed roads, crowd control, and the possibility for people to get hurt.... then you should work WITH the local government to maintain order and control.<br>  <br>  You'll get the right to say what you want.<br>  <br>  If the KKK and the Nation of Islam can march.....

AA12341057	Yes, and trust me, it seems to be the only crime they take seriously in California. I lost track of one of those tickets once, and they came after my wages for it. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, you can get mugged in front of a police station in this state, and no one will see anything because they're too busy staring at the stickers in the corners of people's license plates. It's infuriating.<br>  <br>  But if she didn't pull you over, how would she know where to mail the ticket?|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Probably not.  She would have pulled you over most likely.  I once drove about 4 months on expired tags.  Completely forgot the car was registered in my name (my bd) and not my husband's.  I can't count how many times cops were behind me.  I never got a ticket but I did have to pay a penalty for my lateness.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	The people who say "not likely" and "no have no clue, as usual. and are guessing.<br>  <br>  YOu better believe they can send you the ticket in the mail and this happens often, especially here in CA. It may not happen to you this time, but it will eventually. Get the tags fixed and quit passing the buck off (it's my friends car - if it is, why do you care then about getting a ticket? It won't go to you. Obviously it's you).|`|AaXl3vcCaa	well they can send you a ticket if your insurance has been expired too long, they just send it to the registered owner of the car so i think so, when mine was expired they saw my car in a parking lot and left me a ticket for it<br>  <br>  and they dont need to know who was driving for a ticket the registered owner of the car is responsible for maintaining it, just like you can get tickets from a speeding camera, they dont know who was driving and i got one, <br>  <br>  they do know its expired that is why they send you the letter in the mail saying you need to renew it!|`|ELSKfMpxaa	Not likely|`|4ASDeXsgaa	y|`|G4AxssFJaa	The answer in shot is yes,BUT. They need some sort of evedence as proof so unless the cop to a photo of your tag showing its expired then no. BUT lets say one of those roadside or bridge traffic cams gets yer car for speeding or running a red or whatever if they knowtice the expired tags they will add that fine to the speeding or whatever. Just as a cop needs to stop you and inform you that you are speeding before issueing you a ticket, so follows the expired tag issue. They would have to pull you over to cite you.|`|cRxoNPYkaa	In order to ticket someone for driving with expired plates, they have to know who was driving.  I'd say that you are OK in this instance.

According to a Ranger I met: the Marines is the best.. but both have to be pretty crazy.<br>  You have to enlist to be a sniper, you would want to start off infantry and when they had "try outs" for sniper you could go then. <br>  I have a friend who's son is a sniper in Iraq, he said that they actually don't usually like their snipers to have a background with hunting or shooting. That way they can train the snipers to have any habits they want them to from the ground up, if someone has a background in hunting then they have some habits that won't be good for a sniper.<br>  Of course that doesn't mean ALL the snipers don't have hunting backgrounds, just most (according to this guy's son). You should definitely try it though.<br>  As I'm sure you know, being a sniper isn't just shooting.. you know the deal.<br>  So according to a Ranger and a Marine Sniper: enlist in the Marine Corps.

The purpose of eligibility interviews are to get additional information pertaining to why you are unemployed.  They may ask questions like, why are you unemployed, where you fired or did you quit your previous job, are you able to work and actively seeking employment, etc.  Be honest because they will follow up with your previous employer to confirm your statements.

If any of these folks show up in person photograph them. If they call, record the phone calls. Save any letters. Keep a daily log of all the problems you are having. If the police have to get involved you will have much of the evidence, documents and time lines you need. It will also make good evidence if they decide to follow up on their threats. <br>  <br>  Other than suing you for the money they don't have much in the way of legal action. As you are making payments it weakens their case even more. Any time they show up on the property ask them to leave, and keep the phone conversations to a minimum.

2zym4J9xaa	Bay of Pigs Invasion, unsuccessful attempt in 1961 to overthrow the government of the Cuban premier Fidel Castro by United States-backed Cuban exiles. Increasing friction between the United States and Castro's leftist regime led President Dwight D. Eisenhower to break off diplomatic relations with Cuba in January 1961. Even before that, however, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had been training antirevolutionary Cuban exiles for a possible invasion of the island. The invasion plan was approved by Eisenhower's successor, John F. Kennedy. <br>  <br>  The operation was designed as a means of overthrowing the Castro regime without revealing U.S. involvement in the operation. The plan originally called for the gradual buildup of anti-Castro forces within Cuba into a cohesive political and military unit capable of toppling Castro. However, the operation quickly escalated into plans for a full-scale invasion, with the budget expanding from $4 million to $46 million and the CIA training and supplying anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Guatemala. <br>  <br>  On April 15, several days before the invasion, CIA pilots destroyed part of Castro’s air force. They were preparing to complete the job on April 16 when President Kennedy, for reasons that have never been properly explained, ordered a halt to the air strikes. On April 17 about 1500 exiles, armed with U.S. weapons, landed at the Bahía de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs) on the south coast of Cuba. Hoping to find support from the local population, they intended to cross the island to Havana, but were quickly stopped by Castro's army. By the time the fighting ended on April 19, about 100 had been killed and the rest taken prisoner. The Cuban government later released the captured exiles after a ransom was paid. <br>  <br>  The failure of the invasion seriously embarrassed the Kennedy administration, which was blamed by some for not giving it adequate air support and by others for allowing it to take place at all. An internal CIA secret audit of the operation blamed the failure on a series of mistakes made by the agency in the planning and execution of the invasion. Prepared by CIA Inspector General Lyman Kirkpatrick, the audit was kept secret for 36 years before being released to the public in 1998.|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	The Bay of Pigs Invasion (known as La Batalla de Girón in Cuba), was an unsuccessful attempt by a U.S.-trained force of Americans exiled from Cuba to invade southern Cuba with support from U.S. government armed forces and overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro.<br>  The invasion — planned and funded by the United States government beginning in 1960 — was launched in April 1961, several months after John F. Kennedy assumed the presidency in the United States. The Cuban armed forces, trained and equipped by Eastern Bloc nations, defeated the invading force in three days and the event accelerated a rapid deterioration in Cuban-American relations. This was exacerbated the following year by the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br>  The invasion is named after the Bay of Pigs, which is possibly inaccurately translated from the Spanish Bahía de Cochinos. The main landing at the Bay of Pigs specifically took place at the beach called Playa Girón. <br>  <br>  encyclopedia|`|MnbMpzaoaa	Different from.

If the minor is under the age of 18, their parent or guardian must attend the class with their dependant. <br>  In addition to the fine and jail time, a minor convicted of DWI/DUI will be required to perform community service under the following guidelines:<br>  Not less than 20 or more than 40 hours if this is his or her first offense. <br>  Not less than 40 or more than 60 hours if the minor has been previously convicted of an alcohol-related offense. <br>  The community service must be related to the education about or prevention of the misuse of alcohol. Note: The alcohol awareness class may NOT count towards the hourly requirements. <br>  In addition to the penalties listed above, the court will order the Department of transportation to suspend the license of a convicted minor, or if the minor does not have a license, to withhold the issuance of a license for the following terms: <br>  30 days if this is the first offense <br>  60 days if this is the second conviction <br>  90 days if this is the minor has been convicted two or more times. <br>  most states only allows deferred adjudication for the first DUI offense, and this conviction will be erased from the minor's record when he or she turns 21 years of age.

People back in England could only do that if they were of the aristocracy.  Washington was a land speculator (as was his father).  When his father died, he inherited 5,000 acres and was able to turn it into some 220,000 acres with a bank account to match.  Washington in fact, funded his army.<br>  <br>  I would love to tell you that land ownership is the source of our freedom, but that is simply not the case.  To prove the point, simply ask what happens when one stops paying their property tax.<br>  <br>  Jefferson and Adams believed that money was the source.  When he wrote the Declaration of Independence, the economy in America had grown by 1000% over the previous 100 years.  America was actually financially supporting England, not the other way around.  When he wrote of freedom, he was referring to money.  Those who have money are far more free and have a greater selection in life from which to choose than do those who have little or none.  Those who have little or no money then, are enslaved to their creditors.  He was serving the King due notice that America had money and would no longer willingly be enslaved to the crown.<br>  <br>  Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Adams were all fans of Locke and it was his ideas that helped lay the foundation for this country.
ASXeYOjAaa	Government can do exactly TWO things with respect to the economy. Everything else is just details.<br>  1) Hurt the economy.<br>  2) Dial-down how much they hurt it. This gives the appearance of helping it.<br>  Everything government does, without exception, hurts the economy. Granted they NEED to do certain things but even in those cases there is no direct benefit to the economy. That isn't possible - ever. That's why we should be sure something really HAS to be done before we let them do it. It WILL hurt our wallets, no matter what it is.<br>  EVERY government action incurs an expense. Again, there are details about exactly how the expense is met but in 100% of cases it involves an assault on the economy. There has never been nor can there ever be an exception.

Republicans were in control of Congress for the first 6 years of Bush's Presidency (so, the attack on 9/11 was a concerted Republican failure)...the Bush Administration's SEC failed to enforce the "naked short-selling rule" and, to top it off, eliminated the "up tick rule" making it easier to crash a stock.  Sounds to me like someone in Bush's Administration deregulated the market and then took full advantage of the deregulation and failure to prosecute SEC rules to profit while laying the groundwork to make the next President's job incredibly difficult (they probably knew it would be a Democrat so they pretty much put things in place to fail but it appears to have failed before they wanted it to).|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Revise history much?<br>  <br>  Not only did the Republican party take a 5 Trillion Dollar deficit that took 200 yrs to build <br>  and<br>  DOUBLE IT IN 8 YRS<br>  <br>  they did it while the economy was booming<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  spin that!!

"Illegal aliens are taking Americans jobs" is just pure ?political?, for some (Politicians in Washington) and it's all about spreading "hate" by hiding behind this mess, for others (unskilled and racists ones)!<br>  As a great nation, there is no way America would allow people (illegal aliens) to live and work here if they were really considered as a threat for the nation. <br>  <br>  Obviously this mess, illegal immigration, put people lives at high risk because when they crossed the borders illegally we really do not know "who is who" living in this country, but for others to say those people are taking our jobs and they are all criminals it's just not truth. Let's see: <br>  -Most of them do not speak english, so what kind of jobs they're taking from us?<br>  -Are they criminals for the fact they came here illegally (against the law) if so, how many of our leaders are criminals because they do things that are against the law very often?<br>  <br>  There are many more points that should take in consideration when it comes to this mess before jumping in the wagon by talking non-sense, and it's very shocking and shameful to see people who are using this problem for political reason and personal feelings.<br>  My points is those illegal aliens should not be here at first, but unfortunately they create ways for them to come. <br>  So if they have been invited, there should be a way to deal with them cause the last time I checked they help America more instead of destroy it, like others pretend it!<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: Of course it's easier to give a thumbs down just to make you feel better and avoid the reality, because it's so much harder to use your brain when you feel hate towards others!!!|`|f08acadf20db255caa972f1c2ebf2c7eaa	If there were no farm hands to pick fruit and vegetables ,believe me the American ingenuity would come into full swing and the problem would be solved.Those boarding states have always been Lucky to have immigrant labourers ,but if there were a fence it wouldn't take long to come up with a solution. It's people like Nancy Pelosi that wants the cheap labor.Never enough money.<br>    Amnesty to 12 million Mexicans, let's see if each one brings 3 other family members here then we will have 1+3=4 -- 4 x 12 =48 million ,that will receive free education,medical housing and food stamps.They will then be eligible for Social Security  even though they only worked here for a limited time and paid hardly anything into the system.Their vote would be the main reason to give them amnesty for the next election.Hope you can afford them.

I just was layed off in November, have been to interview after interview and applying for jobs that only pay less than 1/2 of what I make and still haven't landed a job.  I hope for your sake you never have to experience this type of stress in your life.  I am a single mother and and have ALWAYS worked. People like you are plain ignorant.  <br>  <br>  to answer the question at hand, yes, the benefits will keep coming and it will increase but this is only a temporary solution to the problem.  i have enrolled in extra school to make myself more marketable.  Peace|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Employment security benefits were not part of the stimulus package.  That is rhetoric.  Those benefits are regulated though state control.  It is a private insurance the employer pays for protection against employee lawsuits from lack of employment.  Like any insurance, the guidelines are set by state standard and a federal guideline.|`|aV3bFchtaa	Get a job, and don't worry about it.|`|aFC72tLZaa	You should be glad that you have a democratic governor.  Some republican's are refusing the aid.  It's not an increase or raise, it's an extension for those whose benefits have ran out, or are running out soon.|`|f36a70ysaa	don't live in PA. and have job , can't help.
b8svqAMAaa	you need to contact the police or sheriff dept. in the area where you believe you lost it and have them check to see if anyone has turned it in.  You should have already contacted your bank, any credit card company that you have a card with, social security if your card was in there and of course DMV.  Cost about 12 bucks to get a replacement drivers license, but will take a couple weeks to get it in the mail.  when you go to DMV they will give you a print out of your license with a scanned photo of you on it so you can have something temporarily.  hopefully someone turned it in but i wouldn't count on it.  someone might have taken what was in it and threw the wallet away.  good luck.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Yes. A teen returned it and it still had the 400+ dollars that was in it when I lost it<br>  <br>  I took the cash out and rewarded his honesty|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Getting a replacement license is fairly easy if you're willing to sit at the DMV and provide 6 points of identification, like a birth certificate and social security card. First what you need to do is call your credit card companies and banks and tell them your wallet is missing so they can freeze your accounts, just incase your wallet gets into the wrong hands. Call the local police station and see if it's been turned in. I would recommend calling once or twice a week, as you can't always depend on other people to call back. Call the individual stores you went into at the mall. If we find a wallet, purse, keys, or anything, we hold it at the store for a week and then turn it into the customer service desk.|`|9de253f092d1cc279c1330f75282b4b4aa	Yes. $80+ in it too and I was only 10.  What a memory.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	If someone honest found it and there was a way to identify you inside, then you'll hear about it. My husband lost his wallet in Oregon in a state park. They searched for hours, never found it. We got his license replaced, along with all of the credit cards, etc. Then a couple months later, it showed up in the mail, everything but the cash still inside, with a note explaining that it was found and turned in by another park visitor. <br>  <br>  It is important you contact your bank and credit card companies immediately and let them know the situation and get your cards all canceled and reissued so they cannot be used by anyone else. You'll have to take your birth certificate and another form of ID, usually a social security card or something similar, to the DMV to get a replacement. You don't have to retake any tests or anything, just pay them.
z8kAKvGKaa	Nothing in life is free the country's that offer socialized medicine is paid for dearly in tax dollars, and the quality is sad.  If you are truly in dire straits medicaid is provided to all as you pay for it through taxes.  I am sick of people thinking that we are owed things by the government which really is paid for by the middle class hard works...  Canada, Australia, France, England ect... have socialized medicine (or some form of it )and as a health care professional I can tell you it is lacking the quality of care not to mention that we have the best health care system in the world due to research and technology that is paid for by private entities that will be lost with socialized medicine.  So what good is free health care when it is lacking the quality to be effective when needed????|`|0cfwrcx5aa	enjoy your 18 month wait for an MRI.  also enjoy your extremely high taxes.|`|f4759393d980deadc3255b5837265f76aa	no country offers "free" healthcare bucause healthcare costs money.  You either pay for yourself or pay through taxes but you pay.|`|Zrq8vjaXaa	France and Canada|`|YCL50xgnaa	There is really no such thing as 'free' healthcare as it is paid via taxes.  It's really a matter of having insurance, and not having insurance (or being underinsured).  Countries where everyone has health insurance no matter their socioeconomic background would include all western European countries, and Canada.|`|SCvQEFpJaa	Probably France but definetly Canada|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	the health care systems in those countries are not really FREE - the high taxes pay for  it all. <br>  <br>  and you need to have skills and qualifications to immigrate. <br>  <br>  you dont sound very educated. <br>  <br>  From Usa it is taking up to 2 years to legally get to Canada.

fSrmGhOfaa	First: In a debate, you can't just make the opposite statement and tell your opponent to prove YOU wrong. Your job in a debate is to (1) state your premise, (2) explain why his is incorrect using facts if you have them, and logic if you don't<br>  <br>  Second: It has been noted that man is "territorial." I believe it's even more basic than that. Man is self-centered. He cares more about himself than his fellow man. He's greedy. It's like a baby. When a baby's hungry, it wants to be fed -- RIGHT NOW!!! It doesn't make any difference whether somebody doesn't have food ready. It doesn't make any difference if somebody thinks it's not "time" to eat. It doesn't make any difference that there are other people in the world who are on the verge of death due to starvation.  It doesn't know... it doesn't care.<br>  <br>  Now, in the normal course of development, people outgrow those infantile ideas. But, especially in today's world where irresponsibility reigns and greed holds sway, a lot of people seem inclined to retain many of their infantile tendencies. <br>  <br>  In our democratic society, the majority is supposed to rule. The majority of the people are more important than the minority. That's based on the premise "the greatest good for the greatest number." Unfortunately many seem unable to adopt that premise. They're still in diapers, throwing a tantrum, and screaming, "Me...me... MEEEE!!!" <br>  <br>  Now some of these socially retarded individuals get into government positions. Some of these have charisma others -- are ruthless -- and are able to sway the people. Hitler did it. Hussein did it. Every four years we do it to some extent here in the US in the form of elections. And, once in power, with Machiavellian precision, they destroy their country and then tell the people that it was for their own good.<br>  <br>  In the process of doing the greatest good for the greatest number (namely, themselves), they conjure up a war. It could be to satisfy their greed for power -- "That guy has more real estate than I do. I'll just take some more." It could be to prove he's better than anybody else -- "I don't care that my country has only 80,000 and his has 8,000,000. I'm just as important as he is. How dare he snub me at the conference last week." Or it could be just because he thinks he can -- "It's only a little country... and I'm pretty important (at least to me)... who's going to dare to stop me." More recently it's on the level of a school-yard fight -- "He said (or thought) something I don't like."<br>  <br>  So the aggressor moves in.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, because the other countries don't want war, the takeover is successful. But these folks think it's because everybody's afraid of them. So their greed grows... and they feed it by another conquest. Eventually, the civilized world (well, more civilized, because it happens pretty much everywhere) starts to get worried. "This kid's getting a little rowdy and is picking on some of our friends. It's time to put a stop to it." What was regional unrest and hostilities becomes war.<br>  <br>  Add to the mix, politicians thrive on support. So these heads of state form alliances. "If anybody bothers you, I'll help you, if you'll do the same for me." Now, an attack on some small, insignificant country that's way out in the middle of nowhere can have global consequences. <br>  <br>  Add the fact that we're getting better at killing each other. Used to be that, to duke it out with another country, you had move 100,000 men by boat and march them a couple hundred miles into enemy territory... and supply them. A war took a lot of time and planning. Probably, by the time your plan was finally in place, you'd worked out your differences. But, should still want to fight, you'd duke it out with spears and clubs. This was dangerous... to both sides.<br>  <br>  Today, we can fly a few thousand troops and their equipment just about anywhere in the world in hours. We can have combat-ready ships, men, equipment, and planes on station in a matter of days. Planes!!! With planes and smart bombs -- with missiles -- if we can locate the individual with whom we have quarrel, we can obliterate him from the face of the planet... almost within minutes.<br>  <br>  World War I was supposed to be the "war to end all wars." Then that appellation fell to World War II. By the time it got to Korea, the appellation ended. Now we're having some kind of conflict every ten years and the frequency seems to be increasing. Why? Well, back when we were fighting with clubs and spears, often the leaders would be out in the thick of the battle. Today they're sitting around a long table in some enormous board room totally oblivious to the horrors they perpetrate. They don't fight the wars anymore... their troops do. And, in true politician fashion, if the troops win, they stand up on their hind legs and exclaim, "See what I accomplished? It was my supurb leadership..." If the troops loose, they stand up on their hind legs and point an accusing finger at the troops, and say, "You freaking morons!!! I gave you a job to do and you messed it up!!! Can't you do anything right? I'll fix you. I'll cut your budget. I'll cut your benefits. I'll reduce your numbers."<br>  <br>  Then, when the next war breaks out the politicians will stand up on their hind legs and point accusingly at the military, "Why don't you have enough people? Why aren't they adequately trained and supplied? Why didn't you see to it that they had the latest technology?"<br>  <br>  “Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” (George Santayana)|`|xxDjV6Axaa	War is inevitable because man is territorial.   We want to own land and we want more of it.  We also want to hold onto what we have.  So of course, there will be war over land.<br>  <br>  Then we also have almost an instinct to believe in something to justify our existence.  Most of the time that takes a religious form.
