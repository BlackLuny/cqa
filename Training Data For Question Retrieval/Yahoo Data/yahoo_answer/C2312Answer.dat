b375eaa19dd6c56e9909e7ba789daa39aa	First of all, I don't know what level you are interviewing for. I have to assume it is for secondary ed. in English Arts?   I will tell you that you will be in the "hot seat" for the whole 45 minutes. This means that you must be totally prepared to answer in a professional manner, any questions that come your way. Being prepared is essential, as you have indicated in your question.  Now don't let that scare you away here...  Questions you will be asked - How do you handle classroom management? This is the number one concern of admin. Can you handle these kids? What would you do if Suzie wasn't paying attention? What would you do if Joey swore at you? (kids will try anything - and if you are young, close to their age, they think they can get away with anything) YOu need to be firm - no means no. Don't waffle. Be the "mom" or be the "coach" -  Remember your best teacher in high school and base some of your answers on that experience. Your philosophy will be asked next. Just what is it? What do you truly believe teaching is about? Write everything out right now what you believe in. It will help.   What will you do when the kids say "But our OTHER teacher did it THIS way!" - You will have to come back with - I AM YOUR TEACHER NOW. AND IT'S MY RULES.  You must remain the teacher, not the SUB and not just someone who has nothing else to do here. You are the teacher. They will ask you - when is she coming back? Tell them you are here for the rest of the year - pause and think - and say  "And maybe longer."  YOu will have to be careful about not being "buds" with any of the students. They will do anything to get on your good side - and the girls are the most sly about this. Be fair to all. The boys - you will have one at least who will say you look hot today. Just say thanks and keep on going with the lesson. They will do everything to interrupt your teacher's train of thought.   I am painting quite a picture I know, but this is reality. You must stand firm and be in control at all times. But most importantly, you must love them when they are least lovable.   As for the syllabi - look into the state dept. of ed. for the state curriculum. It's there. But you already know your stuff - now you have to figure out how to teach it to a group of different kids every 50 minutes. How will you address the class with autistic kids? What do you know about them? How will you keep your gifted kids interested in your topic? They get bored easily and then become behavior problems.   So let's say you have a student who has broken a "rule" of the school. (Read that teacher's manual very very carefully - these kids are all lawyers in training!) What will you do? How will you handle it? Principals don't like it when you send a kid to the office very fifteen minutes.   So there you have it. When you are done, you will know you were interviewed! It's an awesome responsibility and I commend you for knowing that there's a lot to prepare for. You'll do well -   Hang in there, be professional, dress professional and BE the teacher you want to be. Good luck!
nzwYJbEFaa	Well if ur teachers ddnt think u were sick u WONT get 3 retest!!!  but the+side 2 missing a test on purpose is that you usually retake it with who ever flunked so its easier  ****i have done it alot but not the same semester then the catch on 2 u|`|gHRbi3c5aa	we are usually disappointed in students who miss tests but tend to look at it this way "it's your future, not ours, that you're messing up"    What's the point of missing a test? Why are you at uni?|`|m7lHSV7waa	No.  Don't do it unless you have a valid reason like a family emergency or a horrible sickness.  Missing a test because you didn't "have enough time" to study or because you overslept is not a good reason and often they will know if you are making up an excuse and they will not be very forgiving.  Professors are very busy and setting aside time for you to take a test that everyone else has already taken requires them to use valuable time in order to set up a time, a place, and a person to come and moderate it for them.    Like I said, if you have a valid reason and proof of that reason to miss a test, then no problem.
757c91a5e3a9215007b5dd0c6436e097aa	Ugh student loans are EVIL. They should not be sending you anything since you are still in school and after you graduate, you have six months (which I believe is May 2010) before entering repayment.    I don't know if they are giving you a 'head start' to remind you of things to come or not, but if it means you need to hound them with numerous of calls to get a hold to somebody, then all means to do it! Or write a letter to see if you get a response. Can you visit your financial aid advisor at school to see what their  take on it because personally, I don't understand why they are during that.    You have a right to your financial concern especially in this crappy economy.|`|g6Vci5SUaa	My son receives quarterly statements about what his current loan amount is so he can keep track of how deep in debt he's going.

TmqrCzh0aa	I sorted out my own work experience contact because for our school we have to work with this group called Trident (not the gum, but the insurance company) and their options were laughable.     I want a career in medicine when I'm older, so I aimed for a hospital to do my work experience in, but I chose to shadow a doctor and follow him/her around when they consulted people.     I put together a sort of CV with my expected GCSE grades and my behavioral and academic status etc, and got my Head of Year to write me a reference - because it's an important placement. And I got a reply saying I got my placement, yay!    I haven't been on it yet, but I think I'll have fun. I won't be made to sort through files or anything. And I'm getting a pass so I have access to all areas of the hospital - obviously within reason.     But you have to get an idea together asap because a lot of placements are usually taken this time of year.

juqGUHIcaa	Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (15 December 37  9 June 68), born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, also called Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus, was the fifth and final Roman emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Nero was adopted by his great uncle Claudius to become heir to the throne. As Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, he succeeded to the throne on 13 October, 54, following Claudius' death.    Nero ruled from 54 to 68, focusing much of his attention on diplomacy, trade, and increasing the cultural capital of the empire. He ordered the building of theatres and promoted athletic games. His reign included a successful war and negotiated peace with the Parthian Empire (5863), the suppression of the British revolt (6061) and improving relations with Greece. The First Roman-Jewish War (66-70) started during his reign. In 68 a military coup drove Nero from the throne. Facing execution, he committed suicide.    Nero's rule is often associated with tyranny and extravagance. He is known for a number of executions, including those of his mother and adoptive brother, as the emperor who "fiddled while Rome burned", and as an early persecutor of Christians. This view is based upon the main surviving sources for Nero's reign  Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio. Few surviving sources paint Nero in a favorable light. Some sources, though, including those mentioned above, portray him as an emperor who was popular with the common Roman people, especially in the East.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	Famous for fiddling while Rome burned and   killing his wife Poppea by jumping up and down on her.  Rather than me plaigarise great chunks of text for you, I suggest you look at this site:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero    Incidentally the name 'Nero' means black - which is one of the reasons that there was supposedly a black emperor.

One is going to law school, one is working with special needs adults (she in no way uses her degree for this), and the third is going to graduate school.  You could get your teaching certification.  You should speak to your college career counselor or some of your history professors.

You could teach, although the demand for history teachers is very low right now. You could be involved with publishing history textbooks. If you haven't completed your degree then maybe you should think majoring/minoring in a second subject area. You could always pursue graduate programs (M.A., M.S.W.) or apply to graduate school. Graduate programs will broaden your horizon. Good luck!
YupMCYHlaa	Amorphous is an adjective.  Participles are used with verbs.  So you can make a sentence with a verb with a participle, but it won't have anything to do with amorphous.<br>  <br>  Like this:<br>  <br>  "Jim had been amorphous, but by the time he retired he had a well-defined shape."<br>  <br>  In that sentence 'had been' is a past participle form of the verb 'to be'.  'Had' is the participle.
oOzNMiKtaa	What I did with French was make note cards and studied them everyday.   When you do make the note cards, write them in different colors , because it helps you remember what you wrote. Study the cards 3-4 times a day, say the words out loud, in your mind, and write them down. I PROMISE you, you will learn them, not just memorize them. <br>  <br>  I know that the verbs can sometimes be confusing, so when you make the cards, write a verb with the different endings on the same card so that you will be able to SEE the difference.

3eFbtfQJaa	Hey there mate, I'm currently trying to decide whether shall I go for Engineering or Physics. I was admitted in both.<br>  <br>  In a whole, Physics is VERY different from Biology.<br>  <br>  For example, attending Physics you will deal with Mathematics every single minute, and it is not something like those silly problems you solved in highschool, now you'll get much closer to reality. But do NOT get scared, it is easy, just takes some dedication and love. Physics has many interesting areas.<br>  <br>  Biology is the other way around, the mathematics involved with Biology is easier than highschool mathematics. The subjects in Biology vary but what you will major in will be absolutely different from the one you would in Physics.<br>  <br>  If you love both, why don't you combine them, and go for a Biophysics degree?|`|W3UYWpxiaa	I loved my college physics classes.  They were so much fun and very hands on.  Biology was good too, but in physics I could really see and understand the concepts much better.  I think you could get a research job with either, but not before getting your PhD.  Getting the PhD isn't easy in either field.|`|rwXwr6foaa	I am in chemistry right now so personally i think thats the way to go it , if it was me i would do physics, cuz its simple math, but can also be very dull, and biology which i hated btw, but big bucks for being a doctor|`|10YksH8caa	I think Biology is more interesting|`|0Ji9BEiCaa	Def. bio|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	I went with physics, mostly because I wanted to do astrophysics, but bio is cool too and some field of bio would have been my next choice.  I'm going to go ahead and say getting a PhD in physics is harder (and not just because I'm finishing mine); there's a ton of math, much more about concepts than memorization, and doing original research in physics requires not only math and physics but often computer science and lab skills.  PhDs in physics work for colleges and universities (teaching and doing research), national labs (research) NASA and the government in general (research and development), power companies, computer graphics/game companies, electronics and software and engineering firms, etc.  I'm finishing the PhD, and I show up and leave when I feel like it.  I'm working to reduce data I recently took, making computer models of the systems I'm studying, writing papers, writing grant proposals, and lots of background research.|`|Moz2d806aa	I think physics is more interesting, but it is more difficult. Maybe you should consider biomedical engineering, it applies physics to medical problems. (designing artificial limbs, etc.)

N1UOHz58aa	Well it kind of sounds like you made up your mind.<br>  But don't you want to graduate with your class and just have fun.<br>  I think you should take those classes over summer get the extra credit because it could give You a better chance of going to a really good collage. THen in school the last semester just take fun classes. Such as Cooking Dance Drama. Or just take those classes over the last semester and enjoy your summer and be a kid. I advise you don't try to grow up to fast because you will probably regret it later. Sure it sounds like a great idea but really you want those memories of your senior year later on with you in the future.|`|IAnT8aGsaa	Definitely go to summer school and get a semester free, its worth it.|`|oSbbDTjlaa	u should go to summer school!!!! then u can graduate faster and show it off to your friend lol just kidding. i Think itt's really great going to summer school since you'll earn 2 credits in just half a summer!

XBJVU0Gtaa	As you probably know, the deadline has passed.  <br>  <br>  If you are a full pay applicant, they might accept your late application.  Call Groton directly to find out if this is possible.  <br>  <br>  Have you taken the SSAT?  You need to take that test as soon as possible.  If you go to the SSAT website, you will find information about taking a private administration.  <br>  <br>  Many school accept applications in April, after they know how many signed contracts they have from the regular admissions cycle.  However, financial aid is difficult to get because the budget is usually spent.   There might be some schools with financial aid remaining, but usually these are not among the most competitive schools like Groton.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yHFWcjd7aa	No, it is not too late. I applied there last year in May and still got in. The school always saves a few spots for late applicants. However, there are a lot of things you need to do in a short amount of time. For me, since I was so late, i had to do the whole application process (tour/interview, application, SSATs) in a week or two. It all went be really quickly. The first thing you should do is call the admissions office and let them know you want to apply. They'll tell you what you need to do.

All classes deal directly with preparing students for hands-on equine careers, there are no academic classes - math, english, fine arts, foreign language, etc.  The majority of the classes are going to be hands-on working with horses (riding, training, teaching, equine massage, farrier, horse health, equine breeding, etc.)<br>  <br>  As far as traditional colleges with Equine Majors in NC, St Andrews Presbyterian College (<a href="http://www.sapc.edu)" rel="nofollow">http://www.sapc.edu)</a> in Laurinburg, NC offers degrees in Equine Studies.  Equine degrees at traditional colleges are going to be much more classroom based with the majority of classes being non-equine related.<br>  <br>  NC State I believe only has degrees in Animal Science and Pre-Vet.

"Monique argues that..."<br>  <br>  To change a phrase like "You wouldn't know by looking at him, but..." you could write "One wouldn't know" or "No one would know" etc.<br>  <br>  To change a phrase like "I disagree with the author's thesis because" you could write "It could be argued that the author's thesis is incorrect because..."<br>  <br>  In thesis writing, you usually leave out phrases like that altogether and just state the point. You don't say "I think" you just state it as a fact: "The author's thesis is incorrect because..."<br>  <br>  If you're doing technical writing, you write like things happen themselves. Instead of "We mixed solution A with solution B" you would just write "Solution A was mixed with soultion B."<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and happy writing! :)|`|1dcyEAzLaa	you should say "one" to replace "you" in third-person writing|`|CHCUcfyRaa	Say the persons name, "the reader", or "one"

b244dcd8878ac5c829d9e8db581f15e7aa	I believe the point Thoreau was making is that we waste our life getting bogged down by things that really don't matter.  The frivolous details that waste our time and allow us to avoid the real issues or the things that are really important.  <br>  <br>  My point of view is that yes, that is the case.  Yahoo Answers, laundry and reality tv  won't make me a better person, the world a better place and supply a better future for my family...and yet that seems to be my focus right now....
BRpzCFQlaa	Well, I'm a reading teacher and your question is worded a little confusingly. Some strategies I teach though are underlining and highlighting important details as you read them, writing something called a dialectical journal while you read. That's where you write down essential or interesting ideas from the article or story in one column and then write your thoughts about your selected statement in a second column next to your quote. I know you want to avoid writing while you read, but that's your best bet at remembering what you read. Good Luck!|`|F5A7wgBaaa	What I do is skim through and think at the same time about what I'm looking for and than I take small notes by putting it into my own words or caveman terms where it's not to long but still makes sense to me.|`|jkBAIGMiaa	I carry those small post-it notes that come in a dispenser.

AA12215968	It would depend on the job. If you are busy the whole shift, I don't think it would work.

AA11335444	I'm going to major in Comp Sci next year and I'm picking up the math minor.<br>  <br>  Most of the math courses needed for the minor overlap with the Comp Sci major anyways, so you'll end up doing just a few extra math classes (but check with your school).  So math's not a bad idea.<br>  <br>  Robotic intelligence is a lot of work.<br>  SCANS would probably overlap with a lot of Comp Sci majors.<br>  Not really sure about military science.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
b244dcd8878ac5c829d9e8db581f15e7aa	It means if you create drama with your family, they will eventually tire of your behavior and you will not have them or their resources.  This could be monetary, emotional, etc.|`|1Dshgmywaa	If you create problems within your family or cause them pain, you won't reap any benefits.|`|593f5a959e494d93b72266dbf2f2bd3faa	screw with your family, and they'll fart on you.
v5SXqxo0aa	How about canceling high speed internet, if you have it? Usually, people who have long adjusted to high speed can't deal with the time it takes for regular to load, and end up just doing what's needed and getting off. If you need a faster connection you can always use the library computers.<br>  <br>  You could also try shutting your computer off completely whenever you leave it, and then putting it away in a cabinet so you don't look at it.<br>  <br>  You could enact parental controls on youtube, and ask your best friend or roommate to pick a password and tell them not to tell you. Or you could just shut down your youtube account- I believe this is possible, but if it is not just "change your password", type random letters on your keyboard without looking, and hit submit.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
v5SXqxo0aa	It depends on the test taker.<br>  <br>  SAT rewards a good vocabulary. and a preference for problem solving vs. more advanced math skills. However, the test does not have many difficult questions and really hurts those students who tend to make a few "easy" mistakes while eating up the harder questions. The test is set up to trick--this is part of its charm, but it can be extremely frustrating for some students.<br>  <br>  The ACT is much more straightforward than the SAT. It asks exactly what it wants to know, whereas the SAT often asks for answers one or two layers away from what it wants to know--that, of course, can't be answered if the student doesn't have the knowledge its testing for. With 255 questions to the SAT's 112, the ACT also offers a competitive advantage to those students who are inordinately affected by the SAT's lower difficulty level.<br>  <br>  The ACT tends to talk more to the student. For example, its writing prompts ask about things related to the average high school student, rather than the abstract concepts of the SAT writing. (I.E., Do high schoolers have too many after school obligations these days? (ACT) vs. Do children require time to be quiet and idle in order to be creative? (SAT)) Those to whom reading is difficult should not take the ACT, as three of the four sections require reading. The reading and SR sections are brutally brief with no time for angst-ing over answer choices. On the other hand, there's no "guessing penalty", so take your best shot and move on.<br>  <br>  Princeton is the only nationally ranked school I'm aware of that "prefers" the SAT, while technically accepting both. CalTech broke down recently and accepts both. I don't know of any others that don't take both, but there could be a few outliers. Every so often, you'll see some expert snootily saying "Sure, they *say* they accept both, but they really prefer the SAT" but I can't find any prejudice against the ACT in admissions CDS. *More* students submit SATs, but if you look at the test scores admitted, they correlate nicely.<br>  <br>  More students claim the ACT is easier than the SAT. My general recommendation is to take both and send your better score.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

dSIrXuUFaa	Odd, I just read Night in English.<br>  <br>  The first sentence is fairly weak. The beginning is what hooks the reader, remember. I would rephrase it so it isn't a question. For the second sentence, I would do "A man named Eliezer Wiesel is subjected to a cruel and torturous fate through his years in a concentration camp."

uzxwqKl9aa	I'm a math tutor. People usually fail their math classes because they aren't putting in enough time. The best way to learn math is by doing a little each day. You can't cram for tests and expect to learn it at the last minute. Math takes PRACTICE to be good at it. You won't learn just by watching your teacher do problems. If you aren't setting aside at least 1-2 hours per night on weekdays, you aren't going to do well. My best advice is get used to putting yourself on a homework schedule and stick to it!! You will need to form good study habits to succeed in high school. Study in 20 minute increments and then take a break, so your mind doesn't wander. I don't believe your brain is too weak for math. The only cases of that I've seen were due to brain damage from things like drug addiction. Your school should have math tutors available. Take advantage of that if you need it, or ask your teacher for help.|`|962e1b512986ddda034856c3f3145539aa	No those are just excuse about how your mind is too weak.I used to say that too and now I am in college,about to graduate in December of 2009 and then trying to pursuit going to Grad School.What is holding you back is you thinking that you cannot do it.Yes you can get all the tutoring you want but if you do not crack the book on your own and spend some good time understanding the material then you are wasting your time.Honey,in college for every hour of class you spend 3-4 hours outside the class and guess what I am not saying that you have to spend that much but what I am saying is that you should do all your easier homework first then do your harder one last.Spend more time on the material you do not understand,ask your parents for help or try to make some logic out of it.I get it that you were absent with the quizzes and what not and so was I in my economics class but I am whopping my butt of going to ask my teacher questions after class, if I do not understand the lecture after I READ IT ON MY OWN and then I also yes go to tutoring.It all seems to pay but in part because I also get more sleep,study harder and ask questions vs. not.If you are going to go at this rate your grades will not improve if you do not understand the material yet do not ask questions because that is the worst thing you could do!|`|2N4IMhZCaa	First find the printer of the book being used by your school.  Then go on line with the company name.  Search the site for the subject and grade level.  Refine your search for the subject matter with additional quiz information.  Good luck!
8qVkSA4jaa	Ask to be moved...don't sit by your friends.|`|qkblT2hgaa	Think before you speak. Instead of just blurting out something, stop and think. Have the conversation in your head first. You want to say something, say in your head first. Maybe even repeat it in your head. If it still that important to say it out loud, make sure that you wait your turn or even ask permission to speak.

6876dcaf52063a0714c9fa8522300dddaa	My teachers cuss a lot, ''what the heck'' is nothing, trust me.<br>  <br>  In high school, there are going to be teenagers,teachers, and other people that will say a lot worse, even if they're mad.|`|FnE7BiYJaa	What does this mean to you? It is a saying. Immoral, hmmm, don't think so. informal English, maybe, this is America, Americaspeak. Live with it.|`|1Dshgmywaa	LOL, I read that wrong. I thought you said that it's immoral to say "formal English"!<br>  <br>  To some linguists it is! There is no "formal" English, there is no "broken" English...the language is always evolving. What you are learning is "standard American English" or the English they teach in school. It's the same thing. I just hate when people think there is a "proper" English.<br>  <br>  Anyway, off topic. Some people do not like "synonyms" for "curse words." They say it's as bad as saying the "bad" word itself, like "frick" or "freakin" or "darn". If you are uncomfortable with the teacher saying it, maybe approach them about it to hear their rationale. If the teacher is saying it to the whole class, there is nothing you can really do about that, but if it's in a one-on-one conversation between the two of you, you can request that the teacher doesn't talk to you like that. It's your preference. It's like some people don't like it when others take "the Lord's name in vain" and people should respect that when encountering others who don't like to hear it.|`|W3UYWpxiaa	It isn't the best choice of words, but I don't think that there is anything wrong with it.  I can't see a teacher being reprimanded for it.  If it offended you let the teacher know and I'm sure that he/she will be careful not to say it around you again.|`|fxXJZZRKaa	Relax, you haven't seen anything. My U.S. History says worst things then that. "What the heck?" is noooooothing. He says things like "biiitch, shut-up, shiiit" Yeah if you really thing "what the heck?" is vulgar, you must not know any bad words.|`|D7Ha8y2daa	honestly, its ok, mabey not when a state official is around...but still its ok, lots if not every american says "what the heck"|`|wa3AvezGaa	You need to relax!  Like, what the heck?!!|`|wInLe57taa	The phrase 'What the heck' is not that bad to say, even though 'heck' is a substitute for another word. <br>  Many people say it and it is not a very big deal. My teachers occasionally say worse. <br>  So, don't worry.|`|CCsVvRwpaa	Yes it is fine. Heck is almost never an offensive word. Slang can be confusing in foreign countries. American schools usually do not strongly enforce formal language when speaking.|`|uTN69Vodaa	Almost every teacher I have swears...some more than others, some not at all. It's not a big deal...at least not so much in high school.<br>  And "What the heck" doesn't strike most people as offensive...

AA11313798	Christine has the answer. Also, I'd add that...what's life when you're not living it right? When people tell you to "live life".  It's like time. Time becomes unrevelant unless you're doing something important. If you waited for someone for 2 hours, it'll feel like 2 days. If you are hanging out with your friends, 2 hours feel like 2 minutes.<br>  <br>  Just like time seems infinite, so does life.  A Life span means nothing unless you were a significant person that made life an entity.<br>  <br>  So live well and live wise. =)|`|tUeH8HDdaa	It means whether you lived for 70 seconds or 70 years, somehow, somewhere, good or bad, you made an impression.
o40QqoQGaa	It depends on your district, but for my district, you can fail 3 classes before they hold you back from moving onto High school. And no, if you fail, that does not mean you go to a bad high school, because it is a public school, therefore they HAVE to take everybody in their district. Some schools a D is passing, while in others, it has to be a 70% or higher. (C)|`|hlGn95e9aa	if  you are doing ok in other classes then.. i think they will only make you re-take just that one class that you are "failing" next year.<br>  You should be ok...

04hTn3vSaa	First off, your friend probably didn't get into Harvard because he lied; correct me if I'm wrong, there is NO SUCH THING as a 6.2 GPA. The limit is 5.0.<br>  <br>  and you can not view those applications. They are kept on file at the school and are not available to the public. I'm going to be honest here and risk losing a best answer. The Ivy Leagues want students who are self-sufficient in the academic world and can figure things out on their own, not by copying other people. <br>  <br>  "I want to copy the best students of the country for my benefit"<br>  <br>  That statement literally made me laugh out loud.|`|2EIH11m8aa	You can't get that kind of information.  Colleges keep those on file for years after the students graduate so there is no chance that you will get that information.  It really depends on how much interest you show in the college as well.  Make sure you go and talk to admissions people from where you are looking, and make sure they know that you are very interested in going to that college.  Also it would help to apply early, you don't have to do early decision but the earlier you apply the more likely you are to get in.

3AVHxNNTaa	Talk about someone who has to write about edgar allen poe, but has a horrible case of writer's block. maddening even. he stresses over the intricities of emulating such a famous writer, finding it impossible to write a single word that hasn't been said before. Then he sneaks into his teacher's house at night and steals her grade book, hiding it under the floorboards of the classroom

N7JPzxiRaa	"Biological preparedness" hypotheses are primarily ultimate explanations, accounting for the uneven distribution of fears in terms of original selection pressures, but there has also been an attempt to specify at least some of the details of the proximate mechanisms: associative learning is facilitated when an aversive consequence is paired with a "fear-relevant stimulus".<br>  <br>  Neuroscience looks at phobias from the point of view of “neural circuitry,” more specifically the amygdala and a variety of complex hormones, and this has been written up extensively in the literature. But even in the face of such technologically advanced research, the theory of biological preparedness still plays a role. It has been shown that conditioning to fear-relevant stimuli, including angry facial expressions, is less resistant to extinction than other conditioning to neutral stimuli and can even be acquired through visual masking techniques

XW2fjYHRaa	Considering you already have a comma splice in your first sentence...<br>  <br>  Rephrase it to say: "A vast majority of people dream of becoming a professional musician.  The majority of such ultimately fail in this conquest, those that succeed live a life more wonderful than they could have dreamed."<br>  <br>  Then you could actually describe the life of luxury musicians live and how wonderful it is, etc.<br>  <br>  What you previously had makes it sound like you will just talk about how a musician is wonderful (all opinion).|`|3AVHxNNTaa	theres nothing to write about after this, you haven't set us up for anything.|`|38FQ3YfFaa	I would write<br>  <br>  "Many people dream of becoming a professional musician. Although many don't become rich and famous for their efforts, they make their dreams come true."<br>  <br>  This is an introduction. The first sentence lets you know that the paper is going to discuss musicians. The second is your thesis. It narrows your focus. If this is your thesis, make sure what you discuss is related to this sentence.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and happy writing! :)
Vk6Mz7Mdaa	If you are talking about the National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine (which was approximately $2000) then I would highly suggest that you do everything you possibly can to get there. I attended two years ago and it was amazing. I went to the session in Chicago and met people from Oregon and the Dominican Republic. You get to go to medical colleges and hospitals and learn together in teams as well as have fun. We went to Six Flags and Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier and played games while at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). It was hard getting money for it, but I did and it was amazing.|`|pTCcbKeDaa	yes it's totally worth it! i ended up going twice because it's so much fun. it looks great on college apps too! you really learn a lot and it's a great experience. you can also get college credit. highlight the perks to your parents and try to raise money for it.|`|2EIH11m8aa	If you think you want to go to one of the highly competitive schools and you will need something to fill out your resume then it might be something you look into further but you shouldn't look to much further if your parents are really against it and you don't need something that big to fill out your resume.

WJjfrf0Caa	this is a double negative statement. so to make more sense of it, remove both negatives.<br>  <br>  have friends that are equal to yourself.<br>  <br>  it means: don't hang around with losers<br>  make sure your friends are as good as you are.<br>  <br>  the only problem with this quote is that is also means: don't have any friends that are better than you.<br>  <br>  let's just agree that you should not have friends that are losers, but it's okay to have friends that are better than you. they will make you better.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Everyone here is saying one side or the other of this, but really, it means both ways.<br>  <br>  <br>  Do not have friends who are less than you.<br>  -- They will bring you down and/or resent you for being better than them.  It is also easy to grow unhealthy feelings of superiority and even use your "lesser" friends.<br>  <br>  Do not have friends who are more than you.<br>  --  They may condescend to you, use you or resent you for bringing them down.  You may come to resent them for being better than you.<br>  <br>  You should make friends who are your equal.<br>  <br>  What this phrase doesn't say is how equal is determined.  That is up to you.|`|s1fqy1utaa	i guess it means don't hang out with people who are way better than you.. like a super, duper popular kid unless you were super, duper popular too<br>  <br>  and don't hang out with mean, dumb people if you are not mean and dumb too<br>  <br>  just hang out with people who you like; make friends with people of your "class"|`|kxmxJXEGaa	It goes hand in hand with the saying:<br>  <br>  You are judged by the people you hang out with.<br>  <br>  So, if you are a good person don't hang out with good for nothing bad people. Instead, seek out the people who will be supportive of you.|`|AA12257579	hmm... the way interpret it is "Don't associate with people better than you or on your level" or "Put yourself above your friends"|`|8e172b6b03562dfb30dd48d18dae04baaa	Don't hang out with scum bags.|`|LphicO7Taa	dont have friends that will bring you down. say for example, your a straight A student and you start hanging out with the druggies. then there more then likely going to bring you down with them.<br>  <br>  catch my drift?|`|HHvAFimoaa	I think it means never to have friends that are weaker than you. lol, just what I think
05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	You might call the alumni office and ask. If the class was, they'd probably make sure the office had all the details. Our high school class makes sure our high school knows about ours.

OdnkZt5daa	Yeah, psychology is getting very competitive. Especially the clinical psychology area.<br>  I wanted to be a clinical psychologist, but so many other people do too. Plus, one must go through a lot of school to be able to even be a psychologist. And when one even has the privilege of being one, it's hard to get paid well.<br>  Due to this, I'm going for my alternative instead: being an astronomer.<br>  But if you really really want to be a psychologist, get VERY determined, your in for a long ride.|`|ejReQT5xaa	I was actually wondering the same thing because that's what i want to be

iVv6bFW2aa	Not the first time, but if it becomes a pattern then , yes.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	absolutely -accountability and responsibility need to be taught.|`|bLHvVuhcaa	I understand your point of view and I agree.  I think if a student is sick on exam day they could contact the teacher and let them know so they can make arrangements to make up the exam.  If the teacher isn't willing to work with you, then take it higher up.  That's what I would do, but hopefully I won't have to deal with that.|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Yes, of course.  This is common policy anyways.  If you were truly sick then you can present a note.  <br>  <br>  There is no such "grey area" if you go to school or not...it's a personal decision call.<br>  <br>  Contact your professor and then get the note from the doctor as proof you were acutally going to the doctor.  Professors need that note as proof you went to the doctor.  If not then every student would be "sick" on exam day.  You know this rule is needed and that if it were not in place people would abuse it.<br>  <br>  You just don't want to pay a doctor to give you a note because they can't do anything for you BUT give the note.  You will have the rest of the day to eat your soup and get some rest and feel better. <br>  <br>  If you're well enough to not need meds from the doctor or need exams to find what is wrong...then you're probably going to be able to make it through an exam.  <br>  <br>  We all have days where we don't feel well, are stressed, are tired.  I'd like to have had an extra few days to prep for my exam too but, life throws stuff at you and you need to be able to learn to deal.  There won't be a sick day there every time for you to use.  Also, if you only get 3 absentences you need to ration them and learn this skill.<br>  <br>  Doctor notes are a must like others have stated...accountability.  Contact your professor and THANK them for working with you so you can get those points!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11581621	I honestly don't see the issue with it. It's like, if you have a legitimate reason to be out, like seeing a doctor, then you should have proof to back it up. The teachers shouldn't have to work around you, after all. They're doing you a favor. If you think you're going to be sick, then you should talk to your teacher. Having just a cold doesn't really affect anyone's ability to take a test, depending on what it is, at least in my opinion. I don't know though, back when I was in middle school and high school I used to think it was ridiculous. But now I'm in college and I see so many people take out exam days just because they don't feel like coming to class, and they don't get penalized for it, but I would.<br>  <br>  Even if you could go into school for just the exam time, I'm sure that wouldn't be an issue, maybe? I'm not trying to be mean at all. That's just my opinion on it.<br>  <br>  and I agree with the person above me, regarding responsibility and accountability. When you're sick and you're working, they don't let you call in just because you have a cold. Some places expect a doctors note, and some places won't let you go home sick "just because it's better for you", because they're more interested in getting jobs done, than your health.|`|Gem96NQyaa	Any student who stays home for the common cold needs to reevaluate whether or not they're serious about college.  If you can't get through an exam while coughing and sneezing, you're in for a rude awakening when you get out into the real world.  I get 1 sick day a month... in the two and a half years I've worked at my current job, I've used exactly two of them (and not because I'm super healthy).  I've got almost a month's worth saved up.<br>  <br>  The flu, you might have a better excuse with, provided you're actually puking and not just feeling run down and lethargic.<br>  <br>  Seriously, I've taken exams while running a 102 degree fever, and still done well.  As far as I'm concerned, if you're going to miss an exam, you'd better be clinging to life with one finger...

VvwQdmaaaa	A group of college friends and I were on a trip to Purgatory, Colorado.  We'd gone skiing there and in Telluride several times but this was our first summer trip.  We decided to take in the gunfight show and old west cowboy reenactment up in Silverton (we had already done the goldmine tour and Ouray ride).  There were some retired Clydesdale horses tied to a termite-eaten wooden fence pole on one side of the dusty main street.  I began to feel sorry for the horses and ran my hand down the side of one's neck.  "You touch that there horse and yer a dead man before the night is over, mister!" -1    I turned around and there stood a costumed old woman, her deeply-lined pock-marked face plastered with a lot of makeup and an  ill-fitting obviously cheap wig.  Her wrinkled face wasn't a pretty sight, either, unless you were expecting W.C.Fields or Jimmy Durante.  I assumed the show had begun.  "BARKEEP!!! I'd like a Whiskey Sour with a slice of orange, a couple of them sweet cherries and just a smidgen of lime juice in it."-2       There was a makeshift bar scene  just beyond the old nags tied up out front.  I began asking my friends if  they wanted to leave the lame show.  It was obviously for kids and those with nothing better to do.  She then yelled, "I'm afeared of that cowpoke that's airin' his lungs.......Pluuuum afeared, " she uttered as she pointed directly at me.-3   She sauntered over to me in her frilly dress, which looked ridiculous on the old hag, and grabbed my shirt.  I yelled at her and asked wth she thought she was doing.  "What in the tarnations it look like I'm doing, you sorry *** excuse of a man?!"-4   Her drawl on that one was so ludicrous, so overdone that I thought perhaps she wasn't just a very bad has-been actresss but was ill as well.  She pulled out a gun and I figured I wouldn't leave just then.  I'd let the show play itself out.  "I'm always plumb careful when it comes to handlin' a gun...<<BANG>>.......Oooooops!"-5    She had aimed and shot one of the poor old horses.  My friends called 911 on their cells to get some help for the horse that lay in the street, the one that the demented dame had shot in the side.  I looked at the woman and told her to can her act, that she had done enough damage for one day, and that she needed some serious psychological help.   She just smiled at me (which looked more like the grimace of a scary clown), "You are slightly insane, a lousy card player and JUST the man I'm lookin' fer."-6   I didn't see the look on her face or the end of the show. I was too busy running back to the car.  I'd had enough of the whacky one-person show with the batty old lady as the main and only character in it!<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope my story at least makes you smile because it is basically a true story.  The actress was really a dude dressed up as a woman.  Sometime during the show, Silverton lost power and we had to drink warm canned soda.  We couldn't wait to get back to Purgatory.   I hope you enjoy your trip to Tombstone.  I've also been to plenty of places in AZ but never there.  It should be quite interesting.

MiDYJ8tMaa	First off, neither sentence is correct. Both require a semicolon, not a comma. You have two independent clauses.<br>  <br>  I wish I could sing like them; their voices are amazing.<br>  <br>  I wish I could sing like they do; their voices are amazing.<br>  <br>  After that, both are correct. 'Like' is almost an all-purpose word in English. It may be an adverb, adjective, noun, verb, preposition, or conjunction. In those two sentences, it is used in two different ways.<br>  <br>  In the first, it's a preposition - meaning 'similar to, comparable to'. The preposition requires an object, and that would be 'them', the object form of 'they'.<br>  <br>  In the second, it's a conjunction, meaning 'in the same way as', and as a conjunction, it introduces a complete clause - something with both a subject and a verb. The clause is 'they do', and here you need 'they', the subject form of the word.|`|QrSFskUpaa	Second one is correct. <br>  <br>  I wish I could sing like them then you should have they to describe the pronoun "them".<br>  <br>  The correct way to say the first sentence is: "I wish I could sing like them, they have amazing voices".|`|mBzQSz4daa	First. make more sence|`|TvAXfcWJaa	The second choice is better. I think. After "like" should be a predicate. Also, I'd break it up into two sentences, like this:<br>  <br>  "I wish I could sing like they do.  Their voices are amazing".<br>  <br>  It's easier on the reader that way, not a run on sentence.|`|QD54HVsPaa	2 is correct as far as pronoun usage goes because you need a nominative pronoun for the verb do.  You would not ever say Them do, but you do say They do. <br>  <br>   #2  It is not punctuated correctly, though.|`|NGyfvuEiaa	I wish I could sing like them(.) Their voices are amazing.|`|FDebaor6aa	The correct way to say this sentence is:<br>  <br>  I wish I could sing like they do, their voices are amazing.|`|IlIjGTdiaa	Second one is correct. 'Me' is totally right, the others have no idea obviously. 'Meli' can't even spell...|`|S5d74BnKaa	the first one.<br>  the second one has two verbs in the first clause, sing and do.
AXiKJDV9aa	I don't think licencing requirements for that require any college degree.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|vyVDWIehaa	Private Investigators are usually ex-cops.  Go that route...|`|O3CrGKw4aa	How long do I have to be in college to be a Private Investigator?<br>  I'm interested in being in Criminal Justice and wanted to know how long it will take for me to finish school. Do I have to go to a 4 year or 2 year college.<br>  <br>  This is going to take some detail to explain. Because Private investigators have different requirements depending on place and level of education.<br>  <br>  There are no formal education requirements for most private detective and investigator jobs, although many have college degrees. Courses in criminal justice and police science are helpful to aspiring private detectives and investigators. Although related experience is usually required, some people enter the occupation directly after graduation from college, generally with an associate or bachelor’s degree in criminal justice or police science. The 2006 educational attainment for private detectives and investigators, in percent, was as follows:<br>  <br>  High school graduate or equivalent 18%<br>  Some college, no degree 26%<br>  Associate's degree 8%<br>  Bachelor's degree 34%<br>  Master's degree 13%<br>  Professional degree or PhD 3%<br>  <br>  Most corporate investigators must have a bachelor’s degree, preferably in a business-related field. Some corporate investigators have a master’s degree in business administration or a law degree; others are CPAs.<br>  <br>  Private detectives and investigators typically have previous experience in other occupations. Some have worked in other occupations for insurance or collections companies, in the private security industry, or as paralegals. Many investigators enter the field after serving in law enforcement, the military, government auditing and investigative positions, or Federal intelligence jobs. Former law enforcement officers, military investigators, and government agents, who are frequently able to retire after 25 years of service, often become private detectives or investigators in a second career.<br>  <br>  Others enter from jobs in finance, accounting, commercial credit, investigative reporting, insurance, and law. These individuals often can apply their prior work experience in a related investigative specialty.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Degree area is irrelevant although some of the larger metropolitan police forces do require a 4 year degree (in anything) these days.  You will want to ensure you have some type of expertise in the matter by being on a civilian or military police force for a few years at the very least.

"Drive!" he shouts, grasping at his big, round belly and grimacing in what looks like pain. <br>  <br>  Panicked, you step on the accelerator, narrowly missing a collision with another vehicle. <br>  <br>  Buuuurrrrrrrruuummmmmmmmphhhh.....<br>  <br>  What?! Was that what you thought it was?!?!<br>  <br>  The car quickly fills up with the noxious fumes of his fart, but you're too afraid to let him know that you heard him. What if he's embarrassed and shoots you??<br>  <br>  Pfffffffffffffftttttttt..................<br>  <br>  Oh no... Silent but deadly.<br>  <br>  The smell is so terrible that your concentration becomes broken, your eyes watering. "Uggghhh," you moan involuntarily, and he casts a deadly glare your way. You shut up and try not to breathe.<br>  <br>  You don't know where he wants you to take him, or where to stop. You just keep driving, and the car just keeps filling up with horrible gas. <br>  <br>  I gotta get outta here! you scream in your mind, and through your watery eyes, you fail to see the redlight that you just passed through. A jeep slams into the left side of your vehicle, throwing your car into a spin. The overweight, rank mobster nearly lands in your lap, bringing the worst of the smell with him. Vomit threatens to escape your lips, and your hands are knocked from the wheel.<br>  <br>  The car just keeps right on spinning, getting hit again front the right, which throws the vehicle off-course---heading straight for a subway tunnel!<br>  <br>  As your car crashes into the opening, it shudders to a stop, hanging precariously over the edge of the stairs. Gasping for breath, you kick open your door and lunge for fresh air. The mobster grabs your leg from behind and rolls out onto the ground. <br>  <br>  "Oh geez," he mutters, huffing like a beached whale. "I think I shite myself."<br>  <br>  You realize that he's lying atop your shoe. Horrified beyond reason, you slowly look down, pulling your shoe from beneath him. There, on the tip of your shoe, is a smear of liquid brown.<br>  <br>  "No!" you shout, and you can't help yourself. You throw up, right there on the sidewalk in front of you. With wobbly steps, you start to try to back away, but he grabs you again and yanks you hard.<br>  <br>  "You've seen my face! I can't let you g-----"<br>  <br>  But you're falling headfirst because you've slipped in your own vomit. As your head meets the first of the steps and you begin tumbling down the long flight of stairs, darkness claims you.|`|M21p76wQaa	that is odd...|`|wCoyXA6Naa	in stage show its better to die by hanging youself with rope in your hands not throgh roof|`|ZqzIZ2Zpaa	drowning in a bowl of cereal

5O7dYY0taa	i'm not sure how nursing applies to math, but i know how math applies to nursing.<br>  <br>  nursing has a lot to do with medications, physical help, and numerous other things that have to do with the body. therefore, nurses need math to calculate things such as how much medication is needed, how long a person should exercise for, and even for simple things like how tall a person should be for a certain task and stuff. math is used everywhere, and it's easy to find more ways nurses use math.|`|oO4TUkVkaa	You do tons of math in nursing.  From calculating input and out put to changing medications from ml's to cc's.  Calculating how much of a medication in an iv has drippend and how much needs to drip.  Calculating the amount of insulin a patient requires for a certain blood sugar level.  There are alot of equations for nursing math.
xU7AaQOdaa	Chang Jiang, though it has various similar names such as Yangtse River, Yangzi River, Yangtze Kiang, etc.<br>  <br>  The name derives from the ancient ferry crossing Yangzi Jin.  From the Ming Dynasty, the name was sometimes written 洋子 (yángz?), and because it was the name first heard by missionaries and traders, this name was applied in English to the entire river. In Chinese, Yangzi Jiang is considered a historical or poetic name for the river. The modern Chinese name, Chang Jiang, literally means "long river".|`|CuMYdQV6aa	No. not the Yellow River, that name is given to the Hwang Ho, which I believe is also called the River of Sorrows because of the loss of life caused when it floods. Chang Jiang is the Yangtze's other name.|`|r9BljbWqaa	i think it is like the yellow river because of all the salt in it or something like that. it has something to do with the minerals in it. i am pretty sure it has to do with a colour.|`|WjxEsxTpaa	Yellow River|`|miRzeIGeaa	How about Yangtze Kiang or Yellow River|`|Ds4xCthSaa	Chang Jiang

Now the day is ending, night will fall soon, and they're all going home to rest until tomorrow, when sunrise and the demands of their own and their families' hungry bellies will send them back out to toil (work hard) some more.  <br>  <br>  The animals have been gathering food; the human workers may have been growing or gathering food or doing some other kind of work that will provide them the means to trade for food or buy it.<br>  <br>  The goodly spoils of harvest = food, nourishment, the most basic means by which to keep body and soul together <br>  <br>  Wants = needs; in this case, probably the hunger pangs of an empty belly|`|nzKGyadWaa	It must be twilight. Everyone is settling down for the night. Farm hands (laborers) are "sons of toil" and are heading home. Birds are sleeping in their nests. Squirrels are settling down for the night in trees or long grass and sleeping/hiding from predators until the next day. Then the squirrels will be hungry and need food ("next day's wants"). Squirrels are known for collecting things like nuts and burying them all over the place in the fall to eat later. So when they are hungry they will come out of hiding and go to some of their many buried food sources. Since they hide bits of food in many places, it will take "repeated attacks" or several visits to food hiding places to get the nuts, etc. they've collected "the goodly spoils of harvest".
VeDJa0m9aa	It looks interesting, for sure. But we collect antiques also. And this just doesn't look that old. At first, we thought it migh be a firewood carrier. But it doesn't look scratched up enough. And even as a baby carrier just doesn't look roughed up enough, especially on the bottom. It looks like a fun project, maybe as a flower carrier or center piece with flowers. Never seen anything like that. Too shiny also to be antique. But enjoy it. It's unique.|`|CuMYdQV6aa	I suspect it was a scoop for winnowing wheat or other cereals. The grain was scooped up and tossed into the air.

It's not any type of baby carrier; no one wants a nine month old to wriggle out the open end. It's also not a basket for gathering vegetables. It's meant to be carried on the forearm, like a baby car seat or basket. That means that it would lay level, allowing vegetables to fall out the open end. And besides, if you were growing vegetables to survive on, that basket is not nearly big enough. I use a laundry basket to gather green beans from three or four 25 foot rows. <br>  <br>  It also isn't a scoop of any kind. It's too fragile. Even if you were separating the wheat from the chaff, you would need a wider basket so the material would spread out. <br>  <br>  The most logical answer from the ones that you got was for picking flowers. The open end keeps the blossoms from being compressed together. That would be my guess (only a guess).|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Although it does look like a scoop, it also looks like a baby carrier.<br>  <br>  you need a professional to help with this.<br>  <br>  Try this safe link below|`|DhUMjZxtaa	Damn...you should go on one of those antique shows!!! <br>  <br>  That thing reminds me of baskets farmers use to put their vegetables in when they pick them (from a long time ago), because it's open on one side for the vegetables to stick out instead of get squished

zkBqGMDCaa	I know exactly how you feel! Im 14 and i went to school for the last time last year. I am also a pretty quiet person and i don't usually go out and make friends myself. Im not going to lie to you, it was pretty scary! But its not too bad. First of all, you don't necessarily have to introduce yourself to people. There will always be someone who says hi to the new kid and shows them around everywhere and introduces them to everyone. Its also good to have a certain elective class like choir or art or something like that. A class that is more relaxed so you can talk and get to know the people around you. Then you can make friends and make friends with their friends until you find a group that you want to stay with. Its not all going to happen at once though. Remember that it takes time to develop relationships with people. Just have fun and be yourself around people, cause otherwise you will make friends with the wrong kind of people and mess it up from the beginning. So whatever you do, don't be fake! And have fun. Its really not that bad :) I went through exactly what is going to happen to you and i thought i was going to die! But now i love my school and my friends and i wouldn't leave any of it for the world!!!!!!|`|L5I2tXvVaa	i get that too.....i usually get all toungue twisted when i talk to new people thats why im gonna be home schooling so i really dont know what advice to give you<br>  <br>  im 13|`|OI29tkSoaa	Nope you should not have to go up in class to introduce yourself at all but just be prepared to study and learn with the other students LOL|`|HIn1p4OBaa	i was too. i wasn't made to go up front though. what school are you going to????!!!!!!!! too bad you can't come to my school!!!!!!!!!!!

LKUjbuCuaa	136 is a high IQ - meaning that your score was higher than 98% of the population (approximately; I don't have the tables in front of me) on the tasks measured on the test.   (I am assuming here that a properly developed IQ test was used.)   Your test score may vary a little each time it is administered, but you probably will still continue to get very high scores.  The question now is how well the socre will generalize both to your academic work and to life in general.  You still have to make the best of your ability, and you will have to work hard (sometimes very hard) to address advanced material, grasp difficult concepts or solve complex problems - to turn your potential into real achievement,   And you also still need to develop good social skills,  treat others well, stand up for yourself when necessary, etc.|`|e4b32e33b8c5f290f2ac40c695f487f2aa	I got a 138 :D<br>  anyways, dunno.

zrk2VtPIaa	thats pretty cute! with college interviews, you want them to be focusing on you and not your clothes. if you want to add jewelry to that, make sure that its not too flashy. and remember, keep your legs together when you sit down! good luck with your interview :)|`|U9bQgfY9aa	You want a knee length skirt or dress with no slits. It should not ride up much when you sit down. This the skirt should be fairly loose.<br>  <br>  Avoid bold prints. Mild to no print for top. No print for skirt. Of a light print or solid color dress.<br>  <br>  No perfume. Unscented deodorant.<br>  <br>  <br>  No cleavage showing and closed toe shoes. No sandals.

If he is really saying these things to you then there are disciplinary sanctions that will probably be handed down to him and they will most likely make him change rooms.  Why doesn't he just go and room with his friend and the other kid can room with you.|`|vTra7n5baa	Leave as soon as possible.  It is causing stress so why endure it?   There is no other choice since he sounds so hostile<br>  <br>  His knowledge of Jews is limited to American ones, many of whom are very rich, religious, and powerful.  I am from Russia originally and was classified as Jew before coming to America as a child.  However, I, like many from Russia who came to America at the time, am neither rich, religious, or powerful!  In fact, I am atheist and very different from most American Jews.  Many Jews in Russia today are actually atheist because of the Soviet Union.  Before you leave, tell your roommate this fact.  He probably won't be able to respond, but do not engage in a dogmatic battle you won't win.  We must choose battles carefully and realize we are better off fighting as little as possible.
3m7JDgVuaa	Yes, because it order to get into med school, you need (or should) have a B.

Hope this helps!|`|2EIH11m8aa	You definitely want to take it now because it is important to have a good base for physics especially if you are not that good at it.

cs4bMJMuaa	There was a fire last week at the tire recycling company. The firm has questionable firms for years.<br>  <br>  -- someone against large producing companies that put out pollution (environmentalist) "Companies that pollute our environment like this should be taken to court and made to pay!"<br>  <br>  Fire last week at tire recycling plant.<br>  Flames were doused. Police evacuated the southeast corner of the city. Most or all the staff was called to the site.<br>  --concerned citizen/city official "We were ready this time, but what if it had been worse? We need more funding to hire extra police officers, firefighters, and ambulance drivers" It said we, so the person must be part of the city. Not justa a citizen, but part of the city board or something like that.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	The 1st paragraph  tells that hazardous conditions at a tire recycling  company caused a fire.    The 2nd paragraph  says that we must have an Emergency Readiness Team  & more funding to execute this properly|`|AA12351337	The begging, is just really freaking annoying, for one.  And doesn't give you answer any faster.<br>  <br>  You want the facts?  Well, since we really don't know much about these, it is going to be hard to tell the difference between fact and fiction.<br>  The only really, for sure fact that I can see in the first one is:<br>  "...fire ... at the tire recycling company."<br>  The rest, like "The irresponsible actions..." and "The place was an eyesore!" are all opinions.  Not everyone will believe that the firm was irresponsible.  Nor will everyone agree that they are polluting or that they need to be taken to court.<br>  <br>  In the second:<br>  "...firefighters doused the flames, and police evacuated the southeast corner of the City."<br>  "...staff were called in, leaving little protection elsewhere."<br>  The "...funding to hire extra police officers, firefighters, and ambulance drivers" is also an opinion.  The writer of the letter believes that, but it doesn't mean it is true, or necessary.<br>  <br>  You can find the point of view, it isn't that hard.|`|6SN2LnmYaa	well facts are things that are true no matter what...so for example...in the first paragraph one would be "I was disgusted to read about the fire that occured last week at the tire recycling company." she knew for a fact that she was disgusted so therefore it is a fact. The 2nd sentance would also be a fact. The rest of it looks to be opinions.<br>  <br>  In the 2nd paragraph the second sentance is a fact, the third sentence is a fact, and thats all i see in the 2nd paragraph.|`|WWPbTrOHaa	p1:fire that occured last week at the tire recycling company. irresponsible actions have been going on for years. companies that pollute our environment should take action.<br>  <br>  p2: we need an emergency Readiness Team region. firefighters doused the flames. we eed more funding to hire extra police oficers, fireifghters, amd ambulance drivers<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck with everything!|`|71fdc65a048e11ac79a34e44367969e5aa	If you are smart enough to try to get someone online to do your homework for you, then you are definately smart enough to do the assignment yourself.

Think about what the letter says and only choose what is known-the fact. the rest is opinions.<br>  <br>  2nd Paragraph fact are firefighters doused the flames, and police evacuated the southeast corner of the city. All staff was called in leaving little protection elsewhere.<br>  <br>  The point of of view is everything else that was an opinion or a comment|`|q3kJ6x8raa	par 1 facts: a fire happned last week at the tire recycling company; actions have been going on for years<br>  point of view: the speaker is definitely someone who cares for the environment and doesnt want to see this company pollute nature. they emphasize this fact in the last sentence.<br>  <br>  par 2 facts: firefighters doused the flames; police evacuated southeast corner of city; staff were called in<br>  point of view: this speaker wants more officials working in the city (the jobs he/she mentioned in the last sentence). <br>  <br>  im not sure if this is what you wanted, but i hope i helped you in one way or another. :)

AXiKJDV9aa	Check out:<br>  <a href="http://susankayton.com/college.htm" rel="nofollow">http://susankayton.com/college.htm</a><br>  Twenty years ago, it was pretty easy to predict which students would be admitted, since the highly-selective colleges admitted about 1/3 of the applicants. All the bright, interesting kids were admitted back then.  However, nowadays, colleges no longer have room for all the bright, interesting kids since about five times as many kids apply for the same number of slots, so luck plays a huge factor.  If you play tuba and the school's marching band's only tuba player is graduating in June, you might get admitted!  Or they might be looking for a baritone for the men's a capella group.  Or perhaps they need someone from Wyoming so they can boast they have a student from each of the 50 states.  Or you juggle and the admissions officer who's reading your application also is a juggler, so he gives you the thumbs-up.  If you get in, you aren't "better" than the kids who don't get in - you're just luckier.<br>  <br>  Basically a near 4 unweighted GPA at HS in rigorous and challenging subjects including calculus, physics, chemistry and biology.  And even then its a crap shoot.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to apply to a few similar schools, not just MIT.  That would be schools like Cal-tech, Harvey Mudd and Rose Hullman.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|lSnHR3mTaa	MIT is like Boston college and New York University. It has become one of the "New Ivy Leagues." It is an extremely hard school to get into.  It was ranked on Princeton Review as college where kids study the most. Only the smartest, most well rounded students get accepted into MIT. Basically, you have to be a complete genious. One of my friends at court is an extremely bright girl. She was accepted into MIT. It's definitely a huge feat.|`|bxTcnj7taa	^MIT is way beyond BC and NYU<br>  <br>  It is the best tech school in the country, and it has ridiculous acceptance rates, to be competitive, you should really have:<br>  <br>  3.95+UW , with the most difficult classes possible<br>  2250+ SAT, probably 800 on math<br>  800 on 3 math and science SAT II's<br>  great ECs (extra curriculars) relating to your major<br>  damn good recommendations and essays <br>  <br>  This is not meant to scare you, but this is really what it takes in this day and age.

E70A7aqcaa	I can only tell you a story my parents used to tell about their football team.  My mother, being from Tennessee, took pride in Vanderbilt University, or "Vandy" as it was called.  My dad, being from Texas, and the University of Texas Longhorns, had no respect for Vandy, or, actually, he just liked to rib my mother about one specific play from scrimmage that occurred sometime back in their youth, somewhere in the late 1930's or early '40's as best as I can guess.  Supposedly, according to my father, the Texas Longhorn, the Vandy QB took the snap from center way down on opposing team's territory, near the goal line, and ran the entire length of the field, IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, giving the opposing team a Safety and two points.  My mother, always attempting to defend the Vandy QB, said he didn't do it on purpose as my dad joked, but did so because the other team's defense gave him no alternative, although he could've just taken a knee down and saved a few gazillion yards in their loss.  Vandy's never been known for a good football team, or hardly ever.   I know this isn't the specific kind of information you wanted, but you did ask for "quick facts" about Vandy, and I just had to tell you that one that was a "regular" story at our house in Dallas throughout my youth.  Don't worry.  I don't expect "Best Answer" LOL!!  God Bless you.|`|vxNU56HQaa	<a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/facts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vanderbilt.edu/facts.html</a>

DJYJqYleaa	Yes. But what you should really do is go in and talk to your teachers before and after school. Get the extra help and figure out why you aren't getting the concepts. Ask your teachers what they recommend you do-- whether it be sylvan or a student tutor, or just extra help after school. If you are persistant and really dedicated to pulling your grades up, you can do it. Good luck!

mSVXV2gbaa	Children as young as six years old during the industrial revolution worked hard hours for little or no pay. Children sometimes worked up to 19 hours a day, with a one-hour total break. This was a little bit on the extreme, but it was not common for children who worked in factories to work 12-14 hours with the same minimal breaks. Not only were these children subject to long hours, but also, they were in horrible conditions. Large, heavy, and dangerous equipment was very common for children to be using or working near. Many accidents occurred injuring or killing children on the job. Not until the Factory Act of 1833 did things improve. Children were paid only a fraction of what an adult would get, and sometimes factory owners would get away with paying them nothing. Orphans were the ones subject to this slave-like labor. The factory owners justified their absence of payroll by saying that they gave the orphans food, shelter, and clothing, all of which were far below par. The children who did get paid were paid very little.

eXgL2ex6aa	Well, I think it depends on the environment your child prefers.<br>  <br>  Millennium HS is small and honestly, I haven't heard much about that school, except that it's small. I would expect that the classes are more closely knit and students are limited to certain coursework, whether it be difficult or not.<br>  <br>  Brooklyn Tech is huge. Tech will give your child more options to choose from. They have a large variety of classes, clubs and activities, and during their junior year, they even get to choose their own major, where they take college level classes in that certain field of their interest. Brooklyn Tech is also highly renowned; therefore, getting into college for your child would be easier, due to the expected difficulty in Tech's coursework. And the environment at Brooklyn Tech is incredibly friendly, since there are so many people. This would also be beneficial to your child's social circle since he or she would be exposed to so many different people.<br>  <br>   I cannot say that Brooklyn Tech is flawless, but I can definitely say that it has prepared me well for what awaits me in the future.|`|FNIzlzWqaa	I am a senior at Brooklyn Tech and I'll actually really miss the school when I leave. At Tech, there's a lot to offer to the students that other high schools don't have. We have a major system which helps the student focus more on their interests later on. If the student doesn't feel too comfortable focusing in one area, we have a separate major called International Arts & Sciences which allow them to explore other options. Other than that, we have over 100 clubs and there's a club out there for everyone. <br>  <br>  Also, most people think it's intimidating to be attending such a school with so many kids but in your freshman year you become more familiar with the school since there's a "cluster" system where you essentially have a couple of basic classes with the same people. This is a much easier adjustment. Even so, attending such a big school is a great experience because you meet new people all the time even when you're a senior.|`|10jwxAPTaa	I highly recommend that your child attends Brooklyn Technical High School. I'm currently a Brooklyn Tech graduate in college and believe that Brooklyn Tech delivered exactly what I needed to be successful in college. The school offers a rigorous course selection of APs, Honor classes, and college level classes that other schools do not. Students are allowed to pick a major their junior year to help them find out their interests and possibly continue with their major in college. Although the courses may seem challenging, the teachers make class interesting and the material easy to learn. The teachers at the school are highly trained professionals in their respective fields such as former lawyers, actuaries, science researchers and many other occupations which require experience as well as knowledge.<br>  <br>  Not only does the school foster a great learning environment, the students, teams, organizations and clubs available will help students form bonds and friendships that other schools can not possibly provide. I honestly believe that a small school will not help your child in the future if he plans to attend a college. Colleges will have large graduating classes and it would be best for your child to be accustomed to a large graduating class early on. Although Brooklyn Tech may have a large graduating class, the actual class sizes are still small which enables the teachers to reach out to each and every student.<br>  <br>  My experiences and memories of Brooklyn Tech are the type you remember for a lifetime. I can't imagine attending any other school such as Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, or Millennium.|`|zNW8SuSqaa	Mercedez, no offense but your an idiot<br>  how can you base your judgment on your friends?<br>  that's like saying you like milk because your friends said so.<br>  <br>  But seriously, Brooklyn Tech is better than Millennium.<br>  Tech offers a wide variety of subjects to study and learn from.<br>  Millennium is not as big but personally, i don't think it is as advance as Tech.<br>  Sure, Tech does carries the name of Specialized High school but it does live up to its name. <br>  As a senior at tech, i actually learned a lot in my 4 years. I first entered tech as a quiet person with little confidence but that has dramatically changed. My friends that i have known since freshman year tell me how I am more talkative and more out going. Speaking of friends, i have made so many friends that i cant even keep track of the number but i feel tech has become my family.

There are now 'clusters' for freshmen so they will not feel lost or left behind during their transition into high school. That means that your child will have the same classes with a group of other students. Tons of AP and Honors classes are available, as well as clubs and teams. Tech is also the only high school in NYC (I think) to have majors. Your child will be able to choose from majors like Bio-Med and Law and Society at the end of their sophomore year. There is also extremely helpful professional guidance during the college application process.<br>  <br>  I can go on forever, but you can find out more at bths.edu or bthsnews.org|`|hFpbidA2aa	millenium high school cause brooklyn tech isnt that good and my friend goes to millenium and likes. it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and you put this on the wrong category and luckily i live in brooklyn.
20b8884d24ef262f4c4e2607706a11d9aa	As a York student who has suffered through the strike right before graduating, personally, I don't regret my decision to attend York. In the course of four years, even if you do attend during a strike year, one strike is not actually the most memorable thing. I bet that once this year's frosh students get to fourth year this will just be a distant memory.<br>  <br>  Once it's over things go on pretty much normally - courses a little shorter, assignments a little sooner, exams packed into a shorter time period but made easier. Other than that, it's not really a big deal. <br>  <br>  When it comes down to it, the worst thing a strike can do is make you lose hours if you work part-time at York, lose potential job, grad school, or internship opportunities if you're graduating soon (but lots of students, I think, aren't really in this position) and stress out a bit more once classes resume.<br>  <br>  But I've got to say, it's not really as bad as I thought it would be. <br>  <br>  I got a virtual holiday for months and when I came back, my professors had to be extra lenient and make the courses easier. You get all kinds of assignment reductions and extensions you never would have gotten without the strike. And you'll never "lose your year" because either York will fold or the government will intervene before that happens (even if it happens at the last minute - it'll happen).<br>  <br>  Also, York's CUPE (the people on strike) are just one CUPE. Lots of other universities have been experiencing strikes lately too. York's administration is unusually bad at this sort of thing and we have some very political students, which tend to make a bad combination, but you aren't that much safer if you attend school elsewhere.<br>  <br>  So I wouldn't drop York from the list just because of the strike, because the strike isn't that big a deal. <br>  <br>  It's ironic that I'm saying this because I personally haven't had a great experience at York. The people have been awesome but I don't feel like I've learned much. But that might just be my program.|`|dVrHELZ2aa	Stay away. UofT and Ryerson are right around the corner.|`|AA10832514	If you really feel that you will not get the quality of education you expect because of possible future strikes, then don't do it.  My intuition says to go ahead and attend York.  Its a good school and it has what you want.  Part of college is learning to deal wtih life when it throws you a curve (like a strike).  You'll manage through it just fine.|`|20b95c09e99eb0145c75ed35d7f72163aa	You should not except any compromise except for the University of Mumbai (India)|`|rVfztEUEaa	these things happen like....one every 10000 years....but the thing is that once a bad reputation goes out, there is no way to stop it...<br>  <br>  yes, my frien.... u should

Maybe something like:  Little is said about reproductive technology until the rare, sensational, and extreme hit the news waves, making it one of the most discussed issues in America.

pFs71HsHaa	You may want to word it " This is an alcoholic beverage".<br>  <br>  An alcoholic beverage is a drink containing ethanol (commonly known as alcohol).<br>  <br>  So Baby, you are RIGHT!|`|1uvrkDWNaa	Yes, or you can say it is an alcoholic beverage.|`|RD05jXYwaa	sorry you are right: reference #2<br>  <br>  al?co?hol?ic<br>  ? <br>  1.  of, pertaining to, or of the nature of alcohol.<br>  2.  containing or using alcohol.<br>  3.  caused by alcohol.<br>  4.  suffering from alcoholism.<br>  5.  preserved in alcohol.<br>  –noun<br>  6.  Pathology. a person suffering from alcoholism.<br>  7.  a person addicted to intoxicating drinks.|`|fmr98EBtaa	You're correct. They're called "alcoholic beverages" for a reason. In this case alcoholic is an adjective. They are referring to a sentence like "Bob is an alcoholic." in which "alcoholic" is used as a noun.|`|eca735eb563a6a25bedeef0050127389aa	Adj.1.alcoholic - characteristic of or containing alcohol; "alcoholic drinks"<br>  nonalcoholic - characterized by the absence of alcohol; "nonalcoholic beverages"<br>  At the brunch, she served fancy alcoholic beverages called "Mimosas". <br>  or<br>   All of those beverages are alcoholic.|`|qpln6o9Yaa	Place the word alcoholic before the word beverage and turn it into an adjective.   ie. would you care for an alcoholic beverage?|`|FT8tyqYlaa	Yes you can and you can also say "This beverage is alcoholic.". Grammar wise I think that is better, but its up to you, either one is fine.|`|sTKJkvFsaa	I think it would be better to say, 'This is an alcoholic beverage.' But, the way you're using it is fine, too.|`|QD54HVsPaa	If a beverage can be described as non-alcoholic, then why not describe one as alcoholic?|`|AA11436385	you are correct
QD54HVsPaa	Because as humans, we are naturally drawn to what looks nice.  In your example, assuming the homeless man was not clean, wore tattered clothing, etc, students would shy away from him based on his appearance.|`|AA12368491	well, that's what we called as prejudice.|`|TOTUO3cuaa	As Mark Twain said, "Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society." Before a person even opens his mouth, we see him and judge him by his appearance.  A well-dressed person we assume to be financially well-off and therefore well-educated or at least gainfully employed, someone who gets around in the world and possibly knows something, enough to be successful.  In short, worth listening to.  A person who dresses like a bum gives the impression that he's a loser.  If he knew anything worthwhile, he would apply it to himself and wouldn't be such a loser who can't afford to dress decently.  Of course, first impressions are not always correct.  Famous example: Prime Minister Winston Churchill calling Gandhi a naked fakir (implying Gandhi is ignorant and backwards, but actually demonstrating his own ignorance and narrow-mindedness).|`|sTKJkvFsaa	1, the president is probably the most important person in the United States.<br>  2, people don't want to listen to you if they think you're different or unappealing to look at.|`|gCxO2oMKaa	people always look at your personality and your background education.. the better you have been the more people will lend their ears to you..|`|g4E7877uaa	Not if it were a school for the blind.|`|TFqoEtRDaa	people judge u on how u look its horrible but its life

So you would end up having an extra class, that you like. I would take the Advanced Dance, because it can come in handy when you grow up. I'm a fellow student as well. I would go with whatever your heart tells you to do. OR you can pray to God, and he will guide you in the right path.|`|5e5c65a2cd3552e7b1ff218d6c990e26aa	Thinking long term, which class would potentially turn into a career?  Piano is great, but are you disciplined enough to practice every day whether you feel like it or not?  If not, don't waste your time.  There is no easy way to learn to play the piano - it takes commitment and diligence.  Of the three, dance seems the least productive, but it would keep you fit, if that's an issue in your life.

I ended up skipping most of the freshman courses required at my college as a result of passing those AP tests and saving money.|`|MJyM1XWJaa	ap classes in no way shape or form prepared me for the workload of university level courses beyond freshman year of college. For one class I read hundreds of pages a night and have mastered the art of writing a 3 page essay in 15 minutes. Those are easy. Unfortunately now that I'm a senior, my papers are in the 15-30 page range. And this is again, just for one class. A full load of classes (full time student) is 12 credits or 3 classes (depending on labs) so multiply that times 3 and then add on labwork. <br>  <br>  However, AP classes look good on your transcript. If you can handle it, do it. It might help you learn how to do lots of homework.

To do this, multiply the whole number by the denominator of its fraction, and then add the numerator. Then take this number and place it over the original denominator.<br>  <br>  So, for the 5 6/7... <br>  5 x 7 = 35<br>  35 + 7 = 41<br>  Putting it over our original denominator (7) we get: 41/7<br>  <br>  Doing the same for 4 1/4:<br>  4 x 4 = 16<br>  16 + 1 = 17<br>  17/4<br>  <br>  Now, we are trying to do the following problem 41/7 / 17/4<br>  To divide something by a fraction you have to multiply by the reciprocal instead. A reciprocal is the flipped version of the fraction, where the numerator becomes the denominator and vice versa. <br>  <br>  We end up with this problem: 41/7 x 4/17<br>  <br>  From here we just multiply straight across. Numerators are multiplied by numerators and denominators by denominators.<br>  <br>  164/119 is the final answer. It may be possible to reduce this, but I don't see anything off the top of my head.|`|Ic2RXP1Haa	I'm not sure if this is the easiest way, but here's one:<br>  <br>  1. Change both fractions from mixed numbers into improper fractions<br>  <br>  5 6/7 will become 41/7 (you would get that by multiplying the denominator and the whole number, adding the numerator to the product, and writing "/7" under that number)<br>  <br>  4 1/4 will become 17/4<br>  <br>  <br>  2. multiply the first number, 41/7, by the reciprocal of the second number (the reciprocal is the "reverse" of the fraction; for example, the reciprocal of 2/3 is 3/2)<br>  <br>  41/7 X 4/17 = 164/119<br>  <br>  <br>  You can also convert your answer into a mixed number by dividing the numerator by the denominator.|`|eFeLSrzwaa	The fraction 5 6/7 is equal to 41/7 The fraction 4 1/4 is equal to 17/4.<br>  <br>  Cross multiply 41/7 by 17/4. The result of cross-multiplying 41 by 4 is 164. The result of cross-multiplying 7 by 17 is 119. 164 is the numerator, 119 is the denominator.<br>  <br>  Your answer is 164/119 which is equal to 1.37815126.<br>  <br>  ***EDIT***<br>  Beecee is wrong.|`|AQPdi1KUaa	7x5+6 will be your fraction, then you divide out. if it doesn't you may have to turn it into a mixed number, like its original form.

This ensures that you will be in school furthering your education. Here at Appalachian State University where I teach, this happens all the time. Students don't get in for one reason or another (waiting list, poor entry scores, lack of funding, etc.) and going a semester or two to a community college looks super good. In the meantime, you could work while attending community college if this is the route you choose. After that one semester, call and talk with the registrar's office about reinstating your application. It will still be on file. They will take another look at it, but make certain they understand that you aren't entering as a freshman since you will have that one semester or two finished at the community college.<br>  <br>  Please apply for financial aid as well whether attending a university or community college.

AA10176626	Every school has its own "priority aid deadline" - that's the day that the school begins processing all of the aid applications that they have received up until that point.<br>  <br>  Once the school takes stock of all of the applications, they begin creating financial aid packages for all of the applicants. Everyone gets their own, individual aid package, and the school will inform every student with an "aid offer letter". The letter tells you what forms of aid your school has available for you - and how much - and provides further instructions about what each student must do to "accept" and receive the aid.<br>  <br>  Some forms of financial aid are - for all extents and purposes - unlimited. Every student who qualifies for a Pell Grant will receive their grant - no matter when they happen to apply. Every student will be offered access to the Stafford Loan program - again - whether they get their aid applications in "on time" or not.<br>  <br>  Other forms of financial aid are limited. Every year, the government sends along a certain amount of money to your school and says "here's your annual allocation for FSEOG grants", and "here's your annual allocation for Perkins Loans".<br>  <br>  On priority deadline day, the school cracks open those "boxes of money" and starts awarding them to the students who qualify. Under normal circumstances, they'll give away all those limited funds by the time the day is over. <br>  <br>  End result? Applications that arrive after the deadline date will not be considered for those forms of financial aid, because the school has no more of that type of aid available to give away.<br>  <br>  So - applicants who beat the priority aid  deadline are considered for all available sources of financial aid - applicants who miss the deadline are only considered for some sources of aid. Missing the deadline means that you may not receive all of the aid that you might have qualified for.<br>  <br>  But please - don't misunderstand. Students who missed the deadline should absolutely get their applications in. You'll be leaving thousands of dollars of available aid on the table if you decide it's not worth the time to send in your "late" application.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope this helped.|`|GqvAKwMNaa	In order to get the considered for the most money you need your FASFA in by that date.

GT6396BDaa	Basically, it means that the person would not be where they were or had the success without a particular person's help or insight.  Most people know that their accomplishments are due to the help of a certain person in their life.  Some don't or refuse to acknowledge those who helped them to achieve success.  They think they will have to share the limelight or attention.  In other words, those who don't acknowledge people who helped them to get where they are selfish.  Nobody will look down on their achievements or doubt that they worked for it. If they got help from others.  It's ridiculous and selfish.<br>  Sorry for going on about this, the answer to your question is that when a person makes this statement, they are saying that without this certain person(s) help and support they would not be where they are or succeeded in their accomplishments.

TOTUO3cuaa	I can't type it out here, but I have a good idea.  I got it from a book by Douglas R.Hofstadter, a compilation of the essays he wrote for his column "Metamagical Themas" in the magazine "Scientific American". In the book there were examples of words or phrases that were written (or rather, drawn) so that they were mirror-image symmetrical.  If you held it up to a mirror, it read the same.  I think that sort of design would be very apt for a journal called "Reflection Book".

AA10176626	We get this question, or variations on this exact situation once in a while - it's a tricky question, because the FAFSA rules aren't completely clear on this unusual circumstance.<br>  <br>  The FAFSA rules say that your biological mother and father are the ones responsible to help pay for your education. Obviously, it's not unusual for applicants to have divorced parents, so the rules are pretty clear on how those situations are handled.<br>  <br>  Basically speaking, when parents are divorced, the applicant is instructed to provide financial information for the parent they lived with most frequently during the previous calendar year.<br>  <br>  If the child lives with a parent who has remarried, the FAFSA requires financial information from both the parent and the step-parent, because this is the "household" that the child lives in, and that household is supported with the income and assets of both the parent and the step-parent.<br>  <br>  In that rare situation where the applicant lives with mom and dad equally, the student is required to provide the information for the parent who provided them with the greatest amount of financial support in the previous year.<br>  <br>  Your situation is quite unusual - your biological mom and dad live together, but they never married. <br>  <br>  The Department of Education has never published a specific ruling on how this situation should be handled, but in practice, they have treated this in the same way they would treat a divorced household. Because you live with your mom and dad equally, you are required to provide the income and asset information for the parent who provided the greatest amount of financial support. <br>  <br>  Unless your situation is even more unusual, that would be presumed to be the parent who earned the greatest amount of money last year.<br>  <br>  So there's your answer - based on how the Department has treated this rare situation in the past - you would be best advised to provide the income and asset information for the parent who earned the most money last year.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps you - the "out of the ordinary" questions are the most fun to answer. Good luck!|`|JWp9PMyRaa	which ever parent is more BROKE.. HAS LESS MONEY..use them, so you get more money!!!

It makes sense for college professors to have students call them "Dr." but otherwise people usually assume "Dr." means a medical degree.<br>  <br>  Obviously I value education, having gotten a fair amount, but the smartest person I know doesn't have a four-year degree, and I've known some remarkably odd PhDs.

V0muobgFaa	I am a high school teacher at a school in Michigan.  We currently have students taking classes with Michigan Virtual High School.  We have also had many students take MIVHS classes in the past.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but I don't know about the costs.<br>  <br>  The teachers with MIVHS are responsive and helpful.  The online resources are also very helpful.<br>  <br>  The workload is very high in these classes, so get ready for a significant time commitment.  You'll need to have excellent self-motivation or have a parent or tutor help you keep up the pace.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

UxooffHZaa	University of Michigan has a nice program, and it's there in that state. Eastman, Juilliard and Indiana (Jacob's School of Music) were ranked the top 3 schools the last time US News did rankings. (1997) If you want to make a career in performance, you should follow a professor. i.e. Who's the best double reed player out there? One way to find out is to go to the websites for a number of top symphonies; NY Phil, Boston Symphony, Philadelphia Orchestra, Pittsburgh Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra, Detroit, Chicago Symphony, National Symphony, Los Angelos and San Francisco Orchestras, make up a chart of double reed players, and what colleges they graduated from. From this list, you may get something that looks like this: Juilliard 6, Curtis 5, Indiana 5, New England Conservatory 3, Peabody 2, Eastman 2, Cincinnati College Conservatory 2, etc. . . Just because a school is ranked highly overall (which includes Education, Theory and Musicology as well as Performance) doesn't mean it's the best for Your instrument. For instance, when I made the list up for Percussionists, I quickly found Temple was the best, but that these guys all studied from Alan Abel, who's retired. I don't think Temple makes anyone's top 10 list when considering Music schools, but there was a period of time there when they were putting out the most successful percussionists.

C5E2liU8aa	According to several places that hire teachers (districts) and the hiring people, it really does not matter. <br>  <br>  Some schools maybe unwilling. However, other places you will be correctly qualified.|`|FnE7BiYJaa	I never had a problem. The difference is minimal between a masters and a BA pay. Not to worry.|`|AA10392637	Yes, is is definitely harder to get a job with a Masters degree.  I had more than a bachelors degree with several Masters credits and failed to land a job because of my master credits in teaching.  I had straight 4.00 average and had tons of interviews but they always hired the cheaper person.  I can tell you that there are some very good schools  that do hire Masters Degrees.  It might also depend on your area of study in Education like science, special education, and math it will increase your chance of being hired with a Masters Degree.   Under the state of Wisconsin the schools do have to pay you more if you have master credits or a Masters Degree.  I hope this helps.|`|AA10349002	Yes, there is such a thing as being over qualified and under qualified at the same time.

If it is in a subject, such as English, math, etc., it would be smart to get the M.S.T. instead of just a certificate.  Whether you can be hired with a masters will depend on the subject you teach.

If you stay after school and do something called "ALC" to get all the credits you need, then you can possibly be placed in your right grade, but I doubt you can skip to a whole 'nother grade level when you're failing.

r5Mxre6Saa	"One theory on the origin of this expression is that in ancient times nine was a lucky number because it is the Trinity of Trinities. As cats seem able to escape injury time and time again, this lucky number seemed suited to the cat. While in most countries the cat is said to have nine lives, in Arab and Turkish proverbs poor puss has a mere seven lucky lives and in Russia, is said to-survive nine deaths."|`|75ae4dd030c983bd678c722ce696f017aa	It's because cats have the ability to escape dangerous situations without harm. Many cats are really curious, usually too curious for their own good and they get themselves into somewhat dangerous situations. But cats have really good senses as well as agility and swiftness so they usually barely escape. It seems that cats are always getting themselves in risky situations but they are able to get out of them unharmed. So it's like they have many lives. I don't really know where the number 9 came from though.

RfxyVIh4aa	Dear Ms. 000:<br>  <br>  I received your letter and I’m very glad to have a chance to learn more about you. Now I know that you have been majoring in theatre arts and realize this was why I really liked your accents and tones when you read the book for us in class.  You said we will be spending next few months together so I wanted to introduce myself, too. <br>  <br>  My favorite class is Japanese. It’s very exciting and interesting that Japan and my country have so many similar words and traditions. Besides the Japanese, I like to learn any foreign languages because I feel so proud when I can make myself understood to somebody who speaks another language. In learning languages, I not only learn about individual people, but also about their cultures. I love traveling and that is also one of the many reasons I’m interested in learning the languages. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately I find that I am not as interested in the history of other countries.  I think perhaps it because I don't enjoy learning about the conflicts, wars, and compromises that every civilization goes through.  Sometimes I think it can just be too complicated that gives me headache. I love the teachers in this class, though.<br>  <br>  I’m hoping to go to the 000 University one year and a few months in the future, and I’m preparing for the tests. If possible, I want to major in journalism since I like writing. I enjoy the writing assignments in my US history class because I believe it will help me a lot. I will do my best in this class and in 000 high school to achieve my goal.

MPvYodKdaa	Lols, I go to one of those school where you can find condoms laying around the school ground, so the "no hugging" thing would definitely not work at my school.  A hug is just a way to show friendliness, so I don't know why it should be prohibited.  Even a little peck on the cheek is fine.  What's next?  "No touching"?  "No holding hands"?  I remember reading on the news that some girl got suspended because she gave her friend a hug at some school, and I thought it was just redundant and ridiculous.|`|ENAEcBOmaa	i think that its a great rule. my school doesn't enforce it though. a hug isn't just a gesture of kindness at my school. if a girls hugs a guy, she puts forth hers best effort to squeeze hers breasts tight against him. i believe that it is inappropriate and a distraction from learning. a hug between two girls or two guys (even if it would be weird) shouldn't be a problem. i don't think that breaking the rule should result in a detention, but i believe it is a good rule.|`|okFXfimeaa	that sucks! at our school we can hug our friends and if we hug guys the teachers give us wierd looks but there is also this gay one metre rule and if you even just hold hands with someone a teacher will tell you to move apart its so stupid! you should start a petition or something or tell everyone to hug someone at the same time coz that rule sucks majorly!!!|`|ZDWwszPpaa	It hasnt happened in my school.

UA8USXFNaa	I have never come across an Access course that offers any kind of language - I think this is because in languages you have to have prior experience in order to work to A level standard, and the point of Access is that you don't need any qualifications or experience of any kind. Although there are some specific Access courses, such as Access to Healthcare, Social work, etc most are just combined studies courses which means that you get to pick a selection of subjects as you would at A level. As A levels in Japanese and linguistics either don't exist or are extremely rare, I think it would be very unlikely that any Access course would offer them. They usually go for standard A level subjects, like history, sociology, Eng. lit & language, maths, media studies etc etc. However, as linguistics and Japanese are unlikely to be offered as A levels either, you are in no way disadvantaged in not taking those subjects as part of the Access course. There was someone on my Access course who was applying to study linguistics at university; he took English language, English literature and one other subject (I can't remember which) - and he ended up getting offers from some of the best universities, including UCL and Edinburgh. So you really shouldn't have any problem if you choose similar subjects. The problem you may have if you want to study Japanese is that, although most students would be complete beginners at the language as well, universities offering degrees in unusual languages like Japanese, Russian etc generally require some kind of evidence for the capacity to learn a language, which would usually entail an A level in another language such as French or German. I think you would need to look at some different university courses offering Japanese (look on UCAS for a list of universities offering the course) and see what they require. If you don't have any language skills at all I think it may be impossible for you. If you do speak another language, you may need to take an A level in that language or provide some other sort of evidence of your proficiency. Finally, no, colleges don't offer loans for Access courses. There is the Adult Learning Grant, which is about ￡30 per week, and you may have your course fees reduced depending on your previous earnings. Otherwise, you will just have to get a part time job and a big overdraft - that's what everyone else on Access tends to do. Good luck!

Ql6qFk85aa	I'm not sure about personalities, per se, but here's what seem to be common perceptions.<br>  <br>  West Campus:<br>  Terry/Lander: kind of loud. very small rooms especially when they squish three people into them (which most freshmen will end up with). These 3 person rooms have so much less space, in fact, than McCarty that each person only gets a wardrobe instead of a wardrobe and a dresser.  Still they seem to be the hang-out dorms. It's got a full dining hall which is nice.<br>  <br>  Mercer: I don't know much about Mercer; only that it's far away and has been referred to as the "ghetto dorm".<br>  <br>  East Campus: (note: these are actually on campus, whereas the western ones are a few blocks off campus)<br>  <br>  Hansee: relatively small, at the far north end of campus hidden in the trees. This is where you want to be if you're not overly social and really want to focus on studying.<br>  <br>  McCarty: my personal fav as it's where I was for two years. The rooms are spacious and the residents seem to be a fair mix of freshmen and other years so it's quieter than Terry/Lander. Internet cafe in the basement with a coffee stand and a convenience store. Aside from the semi frequent fire alarms in the wee hours of the morning, it's great.<br>  <br>  Haggett: This one always seemed very quiet and dark to me, but I don't know much about it.<br>  <br>  McMahon: very much the hang-out dorm of east campus. full dining hall in the basement. the suites, each with their own common rooms make it ideal for parties.  it also seems to be the most coveted dorm, so you probably won't make it in there as a freshman.

sjOelwhhaa	Well, some people use "has" and some use "have" for nouns like "couple" and "family."  But whichever you use, you should stick to your decision.  If you use "have" in the first part, you need to use "have" in the second also, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  I see no errors in the original sentence.  The "had been married" means before they got divorced.  It's not wrong.  The couple has two children (That's American English).|`|RmOKu58Uaa	All correct except for the beginning- it should say that the couple HAS been married eight years and HAVE two children.

Hassan, who came to the US in 1979, has been married twice before and has two other teenage children."

9olha1dKaa	There's 3 different ways to become a RN.<br>  <br>  1. ADN degree<br>  <br>  This is the shortest and most popular method. You attend community college for 2 years, obtain an associate degree in nursing (ADN), and the nursing board exams to become a RN. <br>  <br>  The catch is that some specialties in nursing requires BSN degree (see option #2). The other catch is that some states require additional training before giving you a license to practice.<br>  <br>  2. BSN degree<br>  <br>  Next common method is the Bachelor of Science Nursing degree, which is a 4 year college degree. More competitive to get in, but fulfills many prerequisites such as many specialties and additional state trainings.<br>  <br>  If you wish to become a nurse practitioner (NP) in the future, a BSN is a requirement. Although, many RN's don't bother with that route. NP's usually have more responsibilities and may pay less than higher RN specialties.<br>  <br>  3. Hospital diploma<br>  <br>  Used to be very popular 20 years ago, not as common but still exists. It's a 3 year program. Also fulfills many prerequisites for states.<br>  <br>  <br>  In regards to some programs that you've searched that required a bachelor's degree. You may have come across either the Master's degree in nursing, or Doctorate degree in nursing. Those are options if you decide to take after completing your BSN degree. Your primary goal is to become a RN first, so chose either of those 3 methods.|`|SPbHTgETaa	Well in VA, they have a nursing program for high school students(LPN). <br>  <br>  Yes in order to be accepted into ANY nursing program you must complete pre req. And you mention that some colleges that you researched ask for a Bac. first, you are probably looking at Master degree programs. Your right, work on pre req for 2yrs and then your major! But keep in mind that to be accepted into a nursing program you should keep a good GPA 3.0+. Im going to school for nursing also, I will be attending school hopefully in the Fall for the pre req. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.
6W71hiB6aa	What once was secure is no longer forbidden.  And let's be honest, there are so many places that ask for it now that it has become an automatic thing for them.  Many stores now ask for your phone number, social security number or zip and it seems they do not know how to handle it when I tell them I will not give out the information because it is so casually given.  It is almost mandatory to have a SS number when giving a check and I have seen many people have their number printed on the check to save them time.<br>  <br>  While attending college, we were issued picture ID's with our SS numbers on it.  When we took tests, we were to be identified with our SS number on it so they could verify nobody else was taking our test.  Only this past year did they move to random numbers.<br>  <br>  As far as identity theft, it doesn't take long to get on the computer and find social security numbers, which can then be used to get copies of birth certificates and so forth.  The real issue there is we are using outdated techniques to keep very personal information private.<br>  <br>  I am not sure what state you are in, but I have never heard of SS numbers being issued with your drivers license.  In fact, you have to have a SS card to even get a driver's license, a passport and many other official documents which you can get before you get your license.  I was born in 79 and my brother in 81, we both had SS cards within a few months.  Same with the friends I just called to see when they got their cards, and most of us were born in different states.|`|Ru8njhNcaa	Because half the places require your social security number. People get used to giving them away. Now I am not sure why someone would offer to give their ss number to "help" without being asked for it, but if you did ask for ss # I doubt you'd get too many inquiries as to why do you need it.<br>  <br>  Hm, anyone but you rbank? Your employer will want it too, so will credit card applications, loan applications, college applications (I am pretty sure) army documents, driver license (when you get it) probably lots of other places I am forgetting as well.

This can be 3-4x as much as the residential rate.  Community colleges are not worth that premium.  You will want to seriously consider staying within your state.
yJSPecgoaa	Your first step is to find out what the homeschooling laws and requirements are in your particular state.  Go to <a href="http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp</a> and click on your state.  You will then be taken to a page, where you will click on “A Legal Analysis.”  Everything you need to know, from a legal standpoint, will be presented to you in a straightforward fashion.  Some states are more liberal than others.  Hopefully, you reside in a more liberal state, because this will give you more options in terms of homeschooling your son.<br>  <br>  Next go to <a href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/</a>  where you will find a wealth of information on homeschooling, as well as links to other pertinent sites.  <br>  <br>  As for the costs involved, it varies widely, depending on state requirements, as well as your own preferences in terms of what curriculum you choose to follow. However, it needn’t be overly expensive.  There are plenty of reasonably priced options out there.<br>  <br>  In answer to another of your very good questions, I most definitely do not regret home schooling my children.  They blossomed before my very eyes and are now way ahead of their public school peers.  In the case of one of my children, she is quiet and shy and was being badly bullied at school.  After pulling her out at the age of 10 1/2, I gave her some time to recover before embarking on a homeschooling routine.  It made all the difference in the world.  After what she’d been through, she needed time to recoup and regenerate.  Once we began with a homeschooling routine, she took off like a shot, and neither of us has ever looked back.  In her case (as in others’), it was the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  Wishing you the best of luck in determining the best course to follow in the case of your son.|`|LsAArkUyaa	I agree with LindaPam. HSLDA uses lies and exaggerations to cause fear in homeschoolers. They are extremely harmful to the homeschooling movement.<br>  <a href="http://hsislegal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hsislegal.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  A to Z 's Beginning Homeschooling page is a great place to start.

It has become a way of life for us.|`|4eUext7Xaa	I am a homeschooled student. I just want to say, that homeschooling is the answer. There are no clicques, you can choose who you want to be, and you can learn more. The biggest thing about pulling your child out of public and then going into home taught, is the transition. Your child has been being "fed" all the information at school, now when you home teach he will actually learn the information and remember it. Homeschooling will be hard in the begining. Do not make him sit down and work for hours. Take it slowly. He is not even a teen yet, he will eventually love homeschool, just remeber. Take it SLOW.|`|RJYcBlpcaa	I do not regret homeschooling my son.  He's now a married adult with a son of his own and one on the way, and he's definitely planning on his son doing "school" with G'amma.<br>  <br>  Don't depend on the hslda website because in quite a few cases, the info they have there is just plain wrong.  See if you can locate a homeschool coop or support group near you.  They will know all the ins and outs and what is absolutely required or not in your area.  They may have activities that will enrich your own homeschool experience, as well, such as group classes for long or short term, or sports, or park and recreation days.  Hang out at the library -- librarians often know homeschooling families because they're the ones who come in during public school hours and check out the most books.  So they might be able to put you in touch.<br>  <br>  Most of the time, all you have to do is go to your child's school and sign something that says you're withdrawing your child from that school.  Sometimes you have to have formal approval from the state before, and sometimes you can send for approval up to a week or two after you have done this.  Don't give the state one iota more info than they absolutely have to have -- but you need to know your state laws beforehand, so you'll know which.  So start hunting up those other families!

Since one casket must tell the truth, then the picture is not in the silver casket.<br>  <br>  lets say the caskets have an attribute, if a casket tells the truth, on the first day, it will tell the truth on the second day.<br>  <br>  On the second day the gold casket states it is not in the silver casket, which we know from logic is true.

MliJEBF9aa	First, realize that both "heterozygous" and "hybrid" mean that the plants have mixed alleles (one tall and one short) from their parents.  Both of their genotypes will look like this ("T" is tall and "t" is short):<br>  <br>  Tt<br>  <br>  When you cross a Tt with a Tt using a punnet square (the table with four boxes), you will get four possibilities for their kids:<br>  <br>  TT<br>  Tt<br>  Tt<br>  tt<br>  <br>  Since the first three possibilities all have at least one T, they will appear tall, which must be the dominant one since that's how the parents look.  Thus the probability of getting a tall offspring is 3 out of four.<br>  <br>  The last offspring doesn't have any T's, so it will have to appear short.  Thus the probability of getting a short offspring is 1 out of four.<br>  <br>  From the information above, you should express the ratio of tall to short as 3:1.

C5E2liU8aa	The short answer is, yes. <br>  The longer answer: depends on your state and are you willing to move. <br>  <br>  First, get a sub certificate and start subbing. I did this for about 6 months. I just loved subbing to no end. The day I knew I wanted to teach was the day I taught the difference between direct and indirect objects to 5th graders. They were do frustrated with the teacher. I took 15 minutes and did that. I then took the next 30 minutes and did poetry (per lesson plan). They loved it. They eyes opened up and saw poetry in a whole new way. <br>  <br>  I had a degree. So I went to teach at a Christian school and found out that I loved teaching even more then I thought I would. I started at WGU.edu to earn a second BA degree in Social Studies Education. <br>  <br>  I was laid off (as was 1/2 the high school teachers) through budget cuts. I spent the next year working on the wgu.edu degree and doing student teaching. I am now in my second year teaching as a certified teacher and fifth overall as a teacher. <br>  <br>  The real question is are you willing to move somewhere that will let you do what you want. I would suggest wgu.edu as a way of earning the degree and classes you need. Most states have programs to do what you want to do and it is called alternative certification. It is not the easiest way to do it. <br>  <br>  To really start you need the PRAXIS tests (or other state tests) that are required. If you can take and pass the El Ed tests and the PLT (if needed) you will be much further ahead of the process. You can buy study guides to help you pass. The March test deadline has passed but you can still get in on a late reg. <br>  <br>  Go to your state ed dept website and see what is needed.

They don't pay as well as public schools, but you will have an easier time teaching there.|`|NG1a49f3aa	They do have a program similar to what you are talking about in Florida. I would imagine that any programs would be statewide since it is the state that would issue a teacher's certificate. Anyway, in Florida, you submit your college transcripts. Then, based on the degree you sought and the courses you took, they will determine what area you might be eligible to teach in. For example, someone with criminal justice degree might be eligible to become certified in social studies- engineering= math or science. After that, you can get what is called a Status of Eligibility that lists the subjects. You can actually get hired with this and the school can help you get a Temporary Teaching Certificate. The Temp cert is- like the name implies- only temporary. You have a certain period of time then in which to take any education credits that may (or may not) be required and to pass the Teacher Certification Exam.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! I put the link for Florida Teacher Certification- Changing Careers section that may explain the process better than I have!|`|ODedx7t4aa	It's going to be hard, and will probably not happen the way you imagine it.  I've seen instances of districts issuing an emergency certificate on the grounds that you are in the process of completing requirements for full certification.

If they can hire a fully certified teacher, they will (required by law to do so, thanks to NCLB).|`|FnE7BiYJaa	Try the Texas Teaching Fellows at University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP).

xfqHi1tRaa	You can go as a high school student if you like.<br>  <br>  Since you have relatives there, it would be fairly easy. Most programs have direct placement programs -- they apply to be a host family, you apply to be an exchange student. If one of the two agrees to host you and they meet program requirements -- it's a done deal.<br>  <br>  As to how much Japanese you know -- to be honest, they don't expect Americans to know any, so whatever you have is a big plus! There isn't a language requirement for most programs for study in Japan.<br>  <br>  If you work with your counselors at school, you should be able to take a year in Japan and have much of it count for high school credit in the US. You will usually get social studies, foreign language and independent study credit. Perhaps math and science as well. Just make sure  you get it in writing before you go!<br>  <br>  The top three programs to look at are AFS, YFU and Rotary. I'm not positive that Rotary has a direct placement program, but the other two do.<br>  <br>  That is how it would work if you go through an exchange program.

AA10176626	Yikes.<br>  <br>  Your friend's loans are variable interest rate loans - that means it's impossible to predict exactly what her payments will be, because the interest rate on a variable interest loan fluctuates throughout the entire repayment period. <br>  <br>  A typical type of variable rate loan might be "Prime +4", which simply means the interest rate in effect at any given time is the current prime rate plus four percent. Right now, the prime is at 3.25, so the rate on that loan as of today would be 7.25%. If the prime jumps to 5% next year, the interest rate on the loan would go up to 9.0%.<br>  <br>  This interest rate readjustment goes on every so often (maybe 2 times a year, maybe 4 times a year) until the loan is repaid. <br>  <br>  Since I can't know exactly what the interest rate will be over the repayment period of your friend's loan, I can't tell you exactly what she'll pay, but even a generous "guess" will be enough to make you shiver.<br>  <br>  For the sake of argument, let's assume that your friend winds up averaging 9% interest over the entire life of all of her loans (that's probably too low, but let's go with it, for now)<br>  <br>  A loan balance of $120,000 paid over 10 years at 9% (average) interest will require 120 monthly payments of $1520.11<br>  <br>  Quick math: that's $18,241 a year.<br>  <br>  Financial experts say that your student loan payments should never, ever exceed more than 20% of your income, which would mean that your friend would need to earn at least $91,200 a year to comfortably afford that payment.<br>  <br>  If you're wondering, by the time your friend is done paying that loan, she will have paid $62,413 in interest on the $120,000 that she borrowed, for a total payment of $182,413.<br>  <br>  $62,413 is enough to buy not one, but three Toyota Camrys.<br>  <br>  Your friend's loans might allow her to repay them over a 15 year term, rather than just 10 - but even in that case, she would have a monthly payment of $1217 a month, for 180 months instead. In that scenario, she would pay nearly $100,000 in interest on the $120,000 that she borrowed.<br>  <br>  I just hope that your friend has majored in a field that provides very high paying jobs, and that she really got her money's worth in education. If it's any consolation, the average medical school student graduated with about that amount of debt last year - but the difference is (unless your friend IS a medical school student), that a doctor-to-be can probably afford that kind of monthly payment.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to insult her, but your friend is a poster child for what can go wrong when a college student borrows indiscriminately.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and especially to her.

You can go to the school board and talk to them about this situation.  They will have to provide the same or better technology for your son.  In most cases the school boards will agree to do this because they get paid for these types of situations.  If they don't, you'll have to go above their heads to the state board of education to make sure it happens.

lQIKWXDuaa	The most important thing in any field is experience. Since you already know that you want to become an NP (specialize nurse). I really think you should go for the ADN, this will allow you to become a registered nurse within two years (Salaries are like 25$/hr and up) depending on where you live in the US. While working as an RN you can continue to obtain your BSN, which will take you another two years. By then you would have had two years working experience as an RN and your salary would most definitely go up. After the BSN you can go on to get your MSN to become an NP (specialize nurse), which is two-three years long depending on the school. Depending on what kind of NP you will be, you will be looking at a salary has high as 150K/year and up.  At the moment, lots of nursing jobs are allowing people without work experience to start their career as a nurse. In the future, this  may not be possible since so many people are trying to become nurses. This is why my best advice to you is to try to get your nursing license as soon as you can so you can get your foot in the door.  I hope this helped. Good Luck!!!<br>  <br>  ss

Augmentative discussions usually end with name calling and bad feelings.
ebfe21e4693a7038f59529f6ba61a937aa	It depends on the school - it should at least count for some type of humanities credit, or perhaps an elective if the college doesn't offer credit for art history.|`|Moz2d806aa	Yes. Most schools have an arts requirement.|`|AXiKJDV9aa	Depends on the school.  An arts course (not necessarily art history though) is required at some schools like Berkeley, but not at others like Cal-tech and MIT.  Generally speaking math and science schools probably wont require it, but liberal arts colleges probably will.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Normally not a specific requirement unless you major in the art field itself.

oBL3AtRfaa	I don't know about Baltimore, but in NJ, there are adult education courses held at local high schools and they are not expensive. I know a cake decorating course is being offered by them this spring. I would Google "adult education Baltimore" and see if you see something. Also - check with your library. They know of all kinds of community-sponsored education.<br>  And there is Wilton's website. That may help. They are the superstore for cake decorating and baking supplies, and they have all kinds of helpful info.<br>  Even youtube has cake decorating clips, I bet.

AXiKJDV9aa	I am not sure it will materially affect your chances much.  Music majors have the highest admission rates at about 65% compared to the usual suspects of biology and biochemistry at about 45%.  I suspect that's because admission standards for music majors are often quite tough since they often require passing a highly competitive audition.  That would seem to indicate the rigor of what you study is more important than exactly what you study.  I would be looking more at the school I went to and go to a school that has a high placement rate into graduate school.  The two schools I know that are best in that regard are Harvey Mudd and New College Florida (about 2/3's go to graduate school):<br>  <a href="http://www.hmc.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmc.edu/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ncf.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncf.edu/</a><br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|ixBNVvYtaa	Well because you majored in science, you *will* do better.

AA11073898	You can do several things:<br>  <br>  1. Cheat. <br>  Cheating is an art form, and requires much practice. Unfortunately, you would like to actually earn your A, so therefore, this is not an option :D.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Study. <br>  Take Cornell Notes on whatever you're learning. Believe it or not, they do help you remember key facts that you will need on the tests. Each day, do several pages of these sort of notes. Review the history lessons and book(s) as much as possible. History is mostly memorization, and if you are able to subconsciously remember the facts of your lessons, then you will be able to succeed. History class can sometimes be compared to sports. The more you think about it, the worse you will play at a competition. By being able to remember facts without a second though, you will be able to succeed. <br>  You may have excellent short-term memory by answering many questions correctly that your history teacher presents before you. However, you must be able to subconsciously remember the historical facts.<br>  <br>  <br>  Helpful Hints for Studying:<br>  <br>  A. Do not use the computer. Computer will only get you sidetracked, whether that be Facebook, IMing, or what not.<br>  <br>  B. Do not have a study group. Study groups usually go off-track, especially with close friends.<br>  <br>  C. Do not cram the night of your exam. Your teacher may emphasize this to you often, but I bet that you do cram a lot. Try to study a specific section of what you know is on the test each night, and in addition, do a review of everything you have learned so far. For example, study 1.1 on Monday (review 1.1-1.9), study 1.2 on Tuesday (review 1.1-1.9), etc. By focusing on a specific subject, yet reviewing overall, you will be able to remember historical facts quicker and more efficiently, thus getting you an A grade on the test.<br>  <br>  D. Know when your test is. This way, you can give yourself an hour or two every night to study. <br>  <br>  E. Do not blow off studying. No matter how tired you are or how late you stay up, study for at least 15 minutes every night (at the bare minimum) [1 hour every night is better]. <br>  <br>  F. Make sure you begin the hardcore studying at least 2 weeks in advance. This way, you will be able to sufficiently prepare for your test.<br>  <br>  G. Whatever you don't know, write it down on a piece of paper. At the end of the day or whenever you have free time, research this/ask your teacher about this. This is why you need to begin studying 2 weeks in advance, so that any questions you have won't go unanswered the night before the test.<br>  <br>  There is no real way to tell you how to get an A on any tests. The only way to really get an A is to pay attention in class, do your homework, and study hard (just like your friends, teachers, and other people have told you [yes, it sounds lame]). However, this will definately help you, and hopefully, these methods will work for you. Good luck!|`|KV9iJyjqaa	maybe you're just a math person<br>  <br>  try not to get bogged down on Who, What and When but focus on the Why and How.<br>  <br>  try to focus on the narrative of history and not the information. think history in terms of a story (hence "hiSTORY") with character(s), conflict/event, outcome.<br>  <br>  also helps if you're interested in history and interpret them in your own way like explaining it to someone who doesn't know what you are learning in history|`|tSxSjwbpaa	@ school i was the 1 that never study for a quiz and i Always made it good even when i saw 2 or 3 girls in class that the teacher tough were the good ones|`|f1BbMXzTaa	Honestly, I think its just that you have the high anxiety.

AA10176626	Curious:<br>  <br>  Some school districts offer a program called "dual enrollment", which allows students to take both high school and college courses at the same time. Usually, the opportunity to participate in the dual enrollment program is reserved for the best students at a school. The thought is that better students might be qualified to deal with the more challenging work, and might benefit from the opportunity to take courses that would otherwise be unavailable at the high school.<br>  <br>  You would have to ask your counselor if your district offers that type of program, and whether you are eligible to participate.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, the answer is generally "no". Community colleges and universities allow only accepted students to register for their academic courses. Some schools offer "community education" or "non-traditional student" courses separately from their regular curriculum, and those courses are "open" to registration from non-students, but we're talking more like "Intermediate Computer Skills" and "Income Tax Preparation", not math and science courses.<br>  <br>  One thing you might want to consider about your idea is the cost of these courses - the average community college might charge around $60 a credit hour for tuition. Since the standard college course is 3 or 4 credit hours, you're looking at $200 just for tuition. You'll also need a college textbook for the course, and many textbooks sell for $100 or more. That's a lot of money for a single course!<br>  <br>  One other thing - colleges don't offer "AP" courses - AP is a high school term that is used to identify courses that are taught as if they were college courses. In some school districts, the schools send their best students over to the local college, where a college professor teaches the actual AP course to students from all over the county - that's not really a college course, it's a high school course being taught on the college campus for convenience. <br>  <br>  If that kind of opportunity is offered by your school district, you would need to apply for consideration through the high school, and not through the college, because the organization that is offering the course is your school board - the college is just providing the classroom, and maybe the teacher.<br>  <br>  The best resource for you is going to be your high school guidance counselor. He/she will know about available opportunities like this in your community, and they'll also know if your grades qualify you to take advantage of these kinds of classes.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	You'll have to check with the community college you're interested in to see if they offer those classes during the summer and ask your counselor how it'll all work out for the AP...since you'll have to take a AP test and I'm not sure if community colleges offer that test.|`|USoqyjaAaa	You will have to ask the college.

Algebra and calc probably won't change either.<br>  <br>  Other courses have a short life.  Computer and technology courses are out of date when they're about 18 months old.  They surely won't last years.  The sciences change pretty rapidly sometimes too.  <br>  <br>  So, you can take as many years as you want to transfer.  I've transferred courses that are 25 years old.  But, some courses don't live very long and you might have to take those again or demonstrate that you're current in the area.|`|ygDZpQHEaa	You can take a break of few years.

The ACT is not as scary as everyone thinks it is. And even if you do not get a high score on it the first time, there is no limit to the number of times you can take it. The average score for the first try is an 18. Some people get higher, some lower. But almost invariably people improve by at least 2 points each time they take the test. I would start by going to www.actstudent.org. From there, you can register for the ACT, or purchase a test prep program from the ACT company. I bought that program, and it really helped me. When I bought it it was $20.00 for a one year subscription. It will give you an idea of what to expect and what to look for. Good luck with everything, and I hope my suggestion helped.|`|IMFIUyr9aa	you can sign up to take the ACT on their website i believe its www.actstudent.org and it will give u a list of schools in your area that will be offering it.  purchasing an ACT prep book and using that to study might help you feel more confident about the test and get a better grade.  i think using a prep book probably helped me.  best of luck and don't panic.  the best you can do is go over what you have learned and/or important points in a prep book and of course try your best on the test.  as always get enough rest and eat breakfast.  and even if you don't get the score you want, you'll have plenty of chances to re-take it.<br>  <br>  =)

eFeLSrzwaa	How many molecules are there in 24 grams of FeF3?<br>  1. Find the atomic mass of FeF3.<br>  - To do this you need to add the atomic mass of Fe and F3.<br>  --- The atomic mass of Fe is 55.845. <br>  ---The atomic mass of F is 18.998404. Then multiply 18.998404 by 3 to get 56.995212. So the atomic mass of F3 is 56.995212.<br>  ----- 55.845 (Fe) + 56.995212 (F3) is 112.840212. The atomic mass of FeF3 is 112.840212.<br>  2. Divide the molecular mass (24 grams) by the atomic mass (112.840212). The answer is 0.212690136.<br>  3.

AqDson6zaa	I'm in AP Bio this year. Lemme give you the facts...<br>  <br>  I go to a college prep high school.<br>  There are 12 people in my class- all freshman.<br>  We have covered almost 30 chapters so far.<br>  We had 5 chapters to do over the summer, 5 over winter break, and during this week (we had a week off) we have three more to do on our own.<br>  On average every week we have a Guided Reading packet (about 3 pages, at least, usually 20 questions) and a lab to do (3 page packet and 8 page lab report), sometimes the lab is every other week.<br>  Our exams are generally 80 questions with two essays.<br>  Highest grade in the class is a 95. I dunno what the lowest is, probably a D, but my friend has a C-. I think most people have Bs.<br>  One girl dropped out of the class last month.<br>  <br>  That being said, I LOVE the class. It's made me interested in science where I wasn't before and even though I may stay up late into the night typing a massive conclusion on the study of Catalytic Activity of Enzymes or desperately trying to memorize the stages of meiosis, at the end of the day I'm proud of what I'm learning and accomplishing.<br>  <br>  Take AP Bio if you want a challenge and you like to learn. You'll end up knowing a ton, working a ton, and improving your GPA a ton (if you do well). Hopefully having a ton of fun, too.|`|CXlqq0wPaa	AP bio veteran here...<br>  <br>  Wow, everyone here is describing the class as REALLY difficult. Well, the class itself depends on your school/teacher, but I'll tell you about the exam...<br>  <br>  ALL it is is memorization. You really don't have to think conceptually, like you have to for chem, lang, lit, etc. It's ONLY memorization. The labs are straightforward, and you'll know what'll happen in the labs before you start doing the lab, so you know what to expect. The free response questions are graded in a very specific way, meaning each question has several points that you MUST mention, and the AP graders will be looking specifically for each of those points. Learning the techniques for answering the free response depends a lot on your teacher, which only you can assess...<br>  <br>  And another thing about the memorization: it's the kind of memorization that you need to have temporarily. Like, you refresh all of the processes (like cellular respiration, photosynthesis, etc) like a week before the exam, and as long as you can sustain it for that week, you'll be able to do fine on the exam. You don't need to really "learn" it concretely if you're not interested in the subject. Trust me, I've had a lot of experience with taking AP classes where I wasn't interested in the subject (like, all 12 of them. lol). <br>  <br>  Take the class because it looks good on college apps, and if you do well on the exam, you can get out of, or even get credit for, those intro to bio classes in college. (And if your major isn't in science, you may not EVER have to take science again. Think of the joy! For the same reason, you should go ahead and take ap chem/ ap phys too. Get over with it in high school.)|`|E7GowZFRaa	well if you don't want to take chem either, i would suggest ap environmental science, which is like a combo of both- i wouldn't take ap bio without already taking BOTH normal chem and bio... and definitely don't take ap chem without first taking an ENTIRE year of normal chem- the people in my class who took summer chem take longer to learn the concepts... and wow at my school they don't even let you take ap bio as a sophomore... hmmm i wonder why|`|XIwToiAtaa	I am a freshmen this year and I am also taking AP Biology next year. I have heard it is a very hard class and you should only take it if you like the subject or else its gonna be torture. I would recommend doing it because it can raise your GPA. Just my opinion...I like biology though :D<br>  <br>  If you take the class, I have heard that its a good idea to start a little bit of research on different topics you will learn in AP bio to get a headstart...|`|ejReQT5xaa	I'm a sophomore and taking AP Bio.<br>  It is a very difficult class. There is a lot of memorization involved. It's one of the hardest classes I"ve ever had. I'ts true that it can raise your GPA, but only if you do well. I have an 82 right now in the class, but i'm hoping to raise it. <br>  Here is a sample essay:<br>  Describe the operon hypothesis and discuss how it explains the control of messenger RNA production and the regualtion of protein synthesis in bacterial cells. <br>  Describe the production and processing of a protein that will be exported from a eukaryotic cell. Begin with the seperation of the messenger RNA from the DNA template and end with the release of the protein at the plasma membrane.<br>  <br>  Colleges will probably admire that you took such a challeng, I mean it is AP, afterall. It'll be hard work, but it's not impossible. <br>  hope i helped

You can however major in it at quite a few schools eg MIT, Cal-tech and any of the Clairemont colleges such as Harvey Mudd or Pitzer.  Probably Rose Hullman as well - although I haven't specifically seen it.  Of course plenty of other schools wil do it - but these are the ones I know off hand.

MliJEBF9aa	Sometimes, the cheaper something gets, the faster and faster people start to want it.  That makes the line begin to curve instead of staying straight.  The same thing is true on the other end of the curve.  The more expensive something gets, the faster and faster people decide they don't want it.<br>  <br>  For example, if you drop the price of a shirt $5, then 10% more people may buy it.  If you drop it another $5 (for a total of $10), you would expect 20% more people to want to buy it, but it might actually be more like 35%.  As the shirt gets closer and closer to being free, you may actually see the number of people who want it jump up much more quickly.|`|6gMVC8acaa	it is straight at times,who said it isnt|`|j1E4aowoaa	I think because the rate of change of supply to demand is not constant
IVtYZiF0aa	Cumm N Your Answer:<br>  You tell your class about the child: name, where they are coming from, how old they are, m or f,ect. Tell them that they cannot see very well and tell them that you will assign a special buddy each week to help out the new student. But the person who gets to be the specail buddy is the one who has been the best in the class. Then tell them that you are going to play a game with them. Talk to them about being blind and what it means. The game is like hide n seek but you don't hide. Have the student's line up in the front of the class facing the back. Have them put their closed fingers over their eyes so they can not see. Then open their fingers just alittle tiny bit so they only can see through the cracks of their fingers. Then tell them to see if they can move to the back of the class. This is to show them how hard it is to be able to see just alittle bit. This needs to be done about a week before the student gets there so you have time to answer all the question's and to pick the special buddy. I hop this helps you.<br>  Source(s):<br>  This is something that I have done when I worked with special needs pre-k students and it worked great.

bNvChlo9aa	If this happened to me, I would suspect abuse (it's a continual occurrence). I would first talk to this girl and ask her what happened and where the bruises came from. If she appears to offer a legitimate excuse, then I'd let it go, but if she doesn't tell me or gives an unlikely reason, I would suspect abuse, in which case I would have to report it to the principal and Social Services.<br>  <br>  If you are suspecting abuse, watch out for behavioral indicators as well. Some behavioral indicators of physical child abuse are:<br>  <br>  - is overly compliant and withdrawn or overly aggressive<br>  - regressive behaviors (thumb sucking, rocking)<br>  - is clingy and comes to school early or does not want to go home<br>  - shows fear of parents or teachers calling her parents<br>  - is often alone<br>  - poor social skills<br>  - wears clothes inappropriate for weather or refuses to change for gym<br>  - often late or absent from school<br>  - wary of adults<br>  - wary of physical contact (for example, if you pat the child on the back and she flinches like she expected you to hit her)<br>  - acting too grown up and mature (for example, "parenting" other children)|`|FmYkUfIDaa	Hi Jamey,<br>                   I'm surprise that you have to ask for advice about this. Surely when teachers are inducted they are provided with a copy of school/college policy in matters about 'duty of care'.<br>  <br>  You mention that you have noticed the injuries for some time - how much time? If it is over several weeks then it should be reported to your School/College Principal.<br>  <br>  You report it so that you protect yourself from accusation/s of lack of duty-of-care or indifference to visual indicators that might be due to abuse on a minor.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|LeaUjOoUaa	You report this to both the Principal of the school and also report it to child protective services. You do this because you have observed what is a possible pattern of abuse. Teachers are mandating reportings, meaning that if you see something that could be abuse, you have to report it by law or risk losing your license to teach. You should also do this because it is the moral thing to do. This child could be a victim of abuse and it warrents further investigation for the child's sake.|`|7RriQDbkaa	First off, I would NOT automatically assume the cuts or bruises were signs of abuse.  Kids get injured innocently all the time.  I would start by casually talking to the child... at a time when we could be away from other children...and try to get her to tell me where the cuts and bruises came from.  Maybe it is as simple as her falling off of her bike.  If her response sounds legitimate and there were no further signs of injury to the child, then I would do nothing.  If she seemed nervous, or if I felt as thought the details of her story did not add up, then it would be time to take further action.<br>  <br>  Yes, teachers are mandated reporters.  If you seriously suspect abuse, it is your duty to report it.  Obviously, you are not going to call the authorities every time a child comes into the classroom with a cut or a bruise. Use your best judgment... that is all that you can do.|`|N8Mn0EE9aa	Ok...

NlF8lvuzaa	I am not a hundred percent sure, but:<br>  <br>  When someone steals something, he is basically ensuring death.  (this might have come from the age of slavery).  <br>  <br>  If you steal something, you will be charged with crime, and if you were a slave or African American, you would be in serious trouble, and most likely be killed.<br>  <br>  Therefore, this was probably created to help show others not to steal or commit a crime, for if you do, you just became listed on the "must catch" list of the other people - who will most likely kill you.

It would be better to say "It really scared me that he is a teacher."<br>  <br>  <br>  In your question you want the word "can" not the word "may."<br>  "May," means "(are you) allowed" whereas "can" can refer to being "allowed" or "able" to do whatever.|`|SDMqpoFXaa	In the first sentence, you can omit the word "that," however, it makes it sound better.<br>  <br>  In the second sentence, it wouldn't sound correct if you were to omit "that."<br>  <br>  I guess it all depends on the sentence and the way that it is worded.|`|IEVMRGjeaa	In the first sentence, yes, you can omit it so that it becomes <br>  "I will get up early so I won't be late for school"<br>  <br>  In the second one, however, you cannot omit it, UNLESS you put it later and add an and. That is:<br>  <br>  "He is a teacher and that really scared me."|`|sTKJkvFsaa	In the first sentence, if you eliminate 'that,' you must also eliminate the comma.

PzpR3kMFaa	I like the theme of this essay. When I read your title I initially thought that you would be writing about how bad your first car was, but I was delightfully surprised to see that "hoopty" was actually your second car, a consolation of some rough patches and bad decisions from earlier in your life. I think that you have a real opportunity to make that the strength of your essay. It is a story about how we don't always get our best foot forward first. This gives you option to use devices such as flashback and comparison. All I can say is be creative and wax on that descriptive language, and bring on the sensory detail. You definitely have a great chronology here in this draft, though now it seems a tad conversational you have the foundations of an awesome essay here.|`|6eSRjnx4aa	Sounds more like a short version of a short story than an essay.

8QUF659maa	Penn Foster is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Secondary schools but ONLY for their High School Diploma program, otherwise they are accredited nationally through the Distance Education and Training Counsel. <br>  <br>  After going over what schools the DETC grants accreditation to I have come to the conclusion that there are a lot of umm ... "fly by night" type institutions that are pretty hard to find any information on. Here is a list of the schools that go through the DETC for accreditation. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.detc.org/search_schools.php?searchSet=true&category=D" rel="nofollow">http://www.detc.org/search_schools.php?s...</a><br>  <br>  If I were you I would definitely do a lot more research before committing to a school like Penn Foster. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petersons.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.petersons.com</a> is a great website with tons of info on colleges and college programs. <br>  <br>  If you are mainly interested in earning your degree online instead of in person you have to remember that there are a lot more public universities not only offering courses online, but entire degrees online. It will be a lot easier to transfer credits and earn your masters / PhD if you take online courses through a public university. It will most likely also be cheaper. For instance, SUNY Empire State offers online Bachelors Degrees for around $2,800 for a 17 credit hour semester which is less than HALF of what you'd expect to pay for a University of Phoenix type degree. Plus you wouldn't have that asterisks thats says ONLINE next to the schools name. <br>  <br>  So in summation, a degree from a public University earned online will not only be cheaper (in most cases), it will also be free of stigmas associated with For Profit Universities. <br>  <br>  Plus if at some point you would like to continue your education the public university degree will be a lot easier to transfer credits with. <br>  <br>  Hope this info helps.|`|ATQ2L8Utaa	i would say that it is accredited, by not by a recognized association...Those schools u should stay away from as u will not be earning a degree but a certificate.

The only real government grant that is available to INDIVIDUALS is call the Pell grant, and it is for college expenses.  To apply, go to http://fafsa.ed.gov  The Pell grant goes directly to the school to pay for tuition, books, fees, living expenses....

Here is a FREE list of all government grants.  Note the .gov in the end of their website.  This tells you that they are a real government agency and not some for profit business trying to sell you snake oil.  http://grants.gov    These are geared towards those instituions wishing to study the mating rituals of the African Butterfly, the Red North American Fox, study the global warming effects of the Arizona Trout, nutrition and tobacco effects on children living in reservations, again, not something an individual can apply for.

If it happens you do not get in your chosen university (depends on the admissions office and how hard it is to get in overall), you can go to community college first and then apply for transfer (if they accept transfer students). As long you get a 3.5 GPA (3.8+ recommended), you have a shot at every school.     According to collegeboard, all you really need is a 2.0 GPA minimum. It does not appear that college is too difficult to get in like the top 50 schools.     http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreview...

It looks EXCELLENT that you have been in high-level classes, clubs, and are involved in community service. You sound like a sweet, well-rounded young lady. Communicate your heart in your applications and I'm sure you will be successful. If I was on admissions, I'd accept you.|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	Yes, you should definitely go to College.  I graduated High School with a much worse GPA than that, and I ended up going to UCLA.  I went to a community college for 2 years and then transfered to UCLA for my last 2 years.  My gpa when I transferred was a 3.4.  The average gpa to get into UCLA is a 4.2, so how did I get in?   I played up all the other factors besides grades that I could.    I don't know how things work where you live, but Colleges look at several other factors besides your GPA.  Get good letters of recommendation, and also write a superb essay.  Play up your hardships.  If you are a minority or are poor, say so.  If you play a musical instrument, say so in your essay.  Many colleges will recruit you hoping that you will join the school band; of course you don't have to join the band once you get in.  It looks like you are involved in numerous extracuricular activities, so you already look good there.    Colleges like to admit people who have struggled in life, because those people are already self-reflective.  I always hated the way schools "grade" students.  Grades are stupid in one sense and Colleges know that.  What Colleges are looking for are people who are willing to embrace thinking for themselves, and also people who are not going to flunk out in a year.      Don't give up!  College is amazing, and you will learn a lot there, so keep on forging ahead.  Good luck!!|`|24IYOrOtaa	Your GPA sucks, but everything else is great! Just try as hard as you can to raise your GPA, if everything else apart from your grades is impressive and you write a heck of an admissions essay or really impress the admissions counselors, you have a pretty good shot.|`|98fEAu1raa	I think you definitely have a shot, though I am not sure about Fayetteville College because I am not familar with their admittance policies and what the average students admitted had GPA wise (not reported at collegeboard . com) Sure, your grades could have been higher, but you also took a full load of honors courses and you are involved in school. This would be what most schools would consider a "well-rounded student". So I think you do have a chance. Just try to pull up the gpa a little this year and next and I think you'll be just fine. Plus, Fayetteville State Uni is a community school so the standards are set a bit lower than say, a prestigious private school.

The transmission of light through a translucent material.  The spontaneous intermingling of the particles of two or more substances as a result of random thermal motion.    The transport of matter from one point to another by random molecular motions. It occurs in gases, liquids, and solids.    Diffusion plays a key role in processes as diverse as permeation through membranes, evaporation of liquids, dyeing textile fibers, drying timber, doping silicon wafers to make semiconductors, and transporting of thermal neutrons in nuclear power reactors. Rates of important chemical reactions are limited by how fast diffusion can bring reactants together or deliver them to reaction sites on enzymes or catalysts. The forces between molecules and molecular sizes and shapes can be studied by making diffusion measurements. See also Evaporation.    Molecules in fluids (gases and liquids) are constantly moving. Even in still air, for example, nitrogen and oxygen molecules ricochet off each other at bullet speeds. Molecular diffusion is easily demonstrated by pouring a layer of water over a layer of ink in a narrow glass tube. The boundary between the ink and water is sharp at first, but it slowly blurs as the ink diffuses upward into the clear water. Eventually, the ink spreads evenly along the tube without any help from stirring.    Gases    A number of techniques are used to measure diffusion in gases. In a two-bulb experiment, two vessels of gas are connected by a narrow tube through which diffusion occurs. Diffusion is followed by measuring the subsequent changes in the composition of gas in each vessel. Excellent results are also obtained by placing a lighter gas mixture on top of a denser gas mixture in a vertical tube and then measuring the composition along the tube after a timed interval.    Liquids    The most accurate diffusion measurements on liquids are made by layering a solution over a denser solution and then using optical methods to follow the changes in refractive index along the column of solution. Excellent results are also obtained with cells in which diffusion occurs between two solution compartments through a porous diaphragm. Many other reliable experimental techniques have been devised.    Solids    Diffusion in solids is an important topic of physical metallurgy and materials science since diffusion processes are ubiquitous in solid matter at elevated temperatures. They play a key role in the kinetics of many microstructural changes that occur during the processing of metals, alloys, ceramics, semiconductors, glasses, and polymers.     World of the Body: diffusion    The name applied to a physical process by which individual particles move randomly, within a fluid, from areas of high concentration to lower concentration until the particles are evenly distributed throughout the space.

I think that I'm getting the connection that you are making - something along the lines of "no car until you start studying!". But possessing a licence to legally operate a motor vehicle and passing school classes are separate issues, and should remain that way. If someone fails too many classes, does that mean that they should be deprived of something that will be a vital part of their lives should they decide to leave school and take employment? And if someone means to get themselves together and return to school with a more serious, determined attitude at a later date, will depriving them of the right to operate a motor vehicle help them in the interim - or hurt them?    Such a measure also smacks of big brother paternalism.

l2E4qEsAaa	Watch out, folks! (comma needed before folks)  A popular craze is breaking through the 1920's-- the art of dance. (replace "and it is" with a dash-- just sounds more eloquent)  Although dancing has been around for centuries (change "has been around centuries ago" to "has been around for centuries-- it's less confusing), new variations of dance have recently been making their debut (cut out throughout this decade-- it's not necessary). America has been taken a storm (I think the phrase is taken by storm-- can you change this?) by new dance moves being created in the jazz clubs, Hollywood movies, and even school gymnasiums! Forget ballet; (you have a comma splice.  Replace with a semi colon or period)  dancers in America are taking part in new dance crazes that involve much more physical contact (this sentence was worded kind of strangely-- with much more physical contact trailed along awkwardly at the end). The Waltz and Tango are still impacting America greatly with new adaptations on moves. The “Lindy Hop”, named after pilot Charles Lindburgh's first solo flight, has emerged and can be found on dance floors everywhere. This dance move is the first to include swinging their (change "their" to "one's") partner in the air while jumping in tune. It may sound dangerous, (add a comma before but-- you need to separate your two independent clauses) but when the Lindy Hop is executed correctly, this move sure looks swell and is bound to make other couples around you balled up with envy. Another dance move many call the epitome of the Jazz age is the “Charleston”. You probably have seen this move because everyone is doing it! The Charleston consists of outward heel kicks by bending and straightening the knees, creating an up and down motion to the tune of the music. Flappers do this move best, as their beautifully beaded dresses dance along with them while they cross their hands and knees simultaneously. Other dance moves that have been sighted recently are Foxtrots, Camel Walks, and even Square dances. Many of these moves consist of fast-paced (put a dash between fast and paced because both words work together to describe foot work) foot work, which nicely compliments the upbeat jazz music that are (change are to is-- the subject, music, is singular) blasting everywhere in clubs and from the radios. However, the foot work is the least important when it comes to executing these dance moves correctly. The hold, the posture of the body, the position of the arms and hands are the most important parts of making these dance moves look right ("right" is kind of boring-- could you change it to "spectacular" or something). If more people realized this, there would be fewer crazy looking couples on the dance floor.<br>  <br>  Overall, very good work.  I didn't know that fact about Lindberg.|`|ig0miCndaa	it is fine|`|bi5shTkaaa	Great!

I would suggest repeating that someone is beautiful/handsome every time you come across them. Such as... you see a female nurse, not classically beautiful, and say "That beautiful woman, over there, she helps to keep people healthy and make sure you feel good so you can play more games." Keep it simple and positive and they will hopefully start to see that good people are attractive no matter what they look like|`|AE9aauACaa	talk about personalities what makes a person different and how everyone is different.
AA11365951	I think they are hard But they're supposed to be more difficult. <br>  <br>  I'm taking one this year, plus two honors classes and one regular class. I have about 3-4 hours of homework a night. I think this may be my limit (3 advanced classes). Maybe one more. In my high school years, I'm scheduled for at least 6 (maybe as high as 8!) APs. <br>  <br>  I recommend sitting down and asking the following questions:<br>  1) What APs does my school offer?<br>  2) Which ones are in subject areas I like/am good at?<br>  3) Which sound interesting to me?<br>  4) Which am I qualified to take?<br>  5) How much extra homework time do I have?<br>  6) How committed am I/how much time am I committed to devoting?<br>  <br>  Then I would talk to your parents, your friends who are taking/have taken it and the teacher. <br>  <br>  I wish I could be specific, but I don't actually know you and I can't speak for you. I wish you the best of luck in your decision making! <br>  <br>  //\\//\\//\\//|`|zC7pkdK1aa	That would depend what type of AP class and what school you are in. In my school APUSH (AP US History) is the hardest in the district, though the AP test might not be the hardest.<br>  <br>  In my school the typical student takes around 4-6 APs. But it really depends on how much stress you can take.|`|t2qSCCfPaa	It really depends on the teacher. I have taken 7 AP classes (4 last year) and the science ones (Bio and Physics) have been the hardest.  If you apply yourself and know how to manage time, you'll do fine on the AP tests.|`|dVrHELZ2aa	Well they are challenging for most people...that's why they are AP. I took them all through high school and I did fine, but I'm school smart. I can't really help you like this.|`|8twI4Ufraa	Depends on the high school. I recommend asking older students in your school if you can. Teachers never give an accurate answer in my experience. They always tell you it will be stressful and difficult, especially if they are the one that teach the class. In my experience, AP classes were more the "normal" level... if you weren't in an AP class, you were the class with the potheads and the teacher who had given up on students. I would take as many as you are offered, it would benefit you in college.|`|nYswXPaRaa	Well yes, because they are college courses and I would believe that they are a bit challenging for normal high schoolers. There's no set standard on how many AP classes you really want to take. It all depends on which college you are rooting for and how much you are willing to apply yourself in high school.<br>  <br>  AP classes are not just classes you take. They're classes where you actually work in. Trust me, it's not easy but it prepares you a lot for college so if you think you can handle it, go for it!|`|ZfDa40PEaa	ap is only hard if you make it. if you stay on top of your work and study ... alot. in my school, you can only take one ap your sophomore year. then more as you get into junior and senior. <br>  <br>  when you're picking them out, make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. <br>  <br>  i'm in tenth grade, and going into eleventh i'm taking three ap's but balancing them out with being an aid , and art classes. that way it isn't too overwhelming. <br>  <br>  hope it helps, also . talk to upperclassman about ap classes at your school ! :)|`|lSnHR3mTaa	Advanced Placement are exactly what the name says.  If you're not up for a lot of extra homework and studying, then you shouldn't take on too many. I will be taking three APs next year, my junior year.  In order to get an idea of what exactly my classes were going to be like, I talked to the teachers before I put together my schedule.  I made sure that I was really willing to throw myself into these courses. APs are serious, and you don't want to end up taking so many that you can't handle the work load.|`|caQB0VPvaa	I am in a&p now, i love it but thats just me, its hard but all you have to do is study. We just crammed all of chemistry into one chapter so its alot to learn. Honestly I would take as many as I could in highschool, it will help. I took one science class my whole 4 yrs of highschool so I was lost at first but I studied hard and im doing great|`|9j7CGPvUaa	well...duh. AP = Advanced Placement. It's pretty much a college course.<br>  I'm a sophomore and taking one AP (World History) which is pretty much a joke, but I'm taking four next year, which is pretty suicidal. I'd say the normal amount would be like four or five, but I'm on track to graduate with nine or ten.|`|AO44fEv4aa	AP classes are supposed to challenge you more then the regular classes.  If you met the requirements to join one i would recommend it because it counts as more credits and it looks better on a college application|`|gEK6UPwYaa	no ****. thats why theyre called Advanced Placement|`|ZpsbW8gHaa	no not at all they're really easy!|`|ncSd9jXDaa	NO! they are very challenging, but they are SO much more rewarding than the 'normal' classes.<br>  <br>  this is what i took in my years.... i'm a B/C student, so if i can do it you can definitely do it too.<br>  <br>  10th - - 1 ap class<br>  11th - - 2 ap class<br>  12th - - 3 ap class<br>  <br>  <br>  i also took an advanced class in each grade...<br>  <br>  and i would TOTALLY recommend taking AVID, if your school offers it<br>  <br>  it helps prepare you for college SO MUCH, it is invaluable if you plan on going to college.<br>  <br>  p.s. i would ask some seniors or juniors about what teachers are good AP teachers... not every teacher is cut out for that kind of job|`|AA10687492	It's a lot of work, but if you're even a little above average intelligence they're worth it.

If it looks like a gemstone or a crystal of some sort, it is very special.|`|8x3e7Gmjaa	a favorite toy, a piece of jewelry like a necklace, a locket.|`|dQvKvnVuaa	A teacup given to her by her grandmother...<br>  <br>  That her grandma used to use to read tea leaves.|`|rRfV3Pmuaa	a dolly<br>  or something her grandmother/mom passed down to her.|`|gaVhPGWhaa	it depends if it was a girl or a boy. maybe a blanket or a doll?|`|AA11089667	shoe money, a tooth, candy, a book, a game like nintendo ds, or gameboy. im a mother of an 8 yr old boy ;)|`|zFwjZy53aa	a locket from her mom or grandma or something|`|B2jIiOwnaa	Ah--good question!

Penetration must be aggressive in nature, with animalistic screams and moans present at all times. <br>  <br>  Style points are to be added if the female participant (or the receiving partner) yells out mercy during the smash session.

He's got variable revenue ($800/gram), and fixed cost ($25000/day), but I think the variable cost is $10.50 >>>  $10/gram for the cost and $0.50/gram (or $50/100gram) for the transportation.<br>  <br>  Just my $0.02...

mpp0EVxqaa	the reason we use adjusting entries in the financial world is because some items depreciate/lose value. for example, you buy a car at 20 000 in the current fiscal period, the next fiscal period it is worth 18000. so to show that the car has lost value/depreciated, you must make an adjusting entry on the worksheet to prove this. it is necessary for you to make adjusting entries because you must make sure that everything balances correctly.<br>  <br>  i hope this helped you alot, and good luck!

I know I can find the equation (by solving first for "b") if I have a point and the slope. So I need to pick one of the points (it doesn't matter which one), and use it to solve for b.<br>  Using the point (8,10), I get:<br>  <br>  y=mx+b<br>  10=((1/11)8)+b<br>  10-(8/11)+b<br>  10-(8/11)=b<br>  102/11=b<br>  <br>  b=102/11<br>  <br>  y=mx+b substitute m and b values<br>  therefore   y=(1/11)x+(102/11)<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if I use the point (-3,9), I get:<br>  <br>  y=mx+b<br>  9=(1/11)(-3)+b<br>  9=(-3/11)+b<br>  9+(3/11)=b  Take LCM<br>  102/11=b<br>  <br>  b=102/11<br>  <br>  So it doesn't matter which point I choose.

Good Luck!!!! ok.<br>  <br>  ss|`|SPbHTgETaa	yes I agree with the comment above.<br>  When you start going to school for nursing, try to keep your gpa 3.0+. <br>  Nursing programs are very hard to get into because its in demand, and there are not that many teachers/schools.

tCsFxh5Aaa	You might want to try an Informal Reading Inventory test.  There are several different ones available, but they could give you an idea of how far behind the child is.  When doing the inventory, be sure to carefully record the "miscues" (the mistakes that the child makes) to see the types of errors that the child is making.  With a child this age, I'd begin with focusing on addressing the particular problems that the child is having, rather than covering every phonics skill.  Be careful to not use too much "babyish" looking materials.  <br>  <br>  For spelling, get a comprehensive spelling book, such as "Spelling Power" or the less inexpensive "Natural Speller" to work through.  Give pre-tests to see what materials you can skip over and deal with the rules and skills that the student doesn't get yet.  Teaching spelling rules and skills will help reinforce a lot of phonics skills.|`|l2E4qEsAaa	Get a copy of Kylene Beer's textbook When Kids Can't Read.

Without some sort of connection it is hard to get a job in that field.
