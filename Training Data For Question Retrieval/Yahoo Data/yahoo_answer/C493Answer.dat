YbEQ8Wv5aa	Puberty. You're too young to be diagnosed with BPD and most kids fight with their families. In general teenagers are just pretty much hormonal messes.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	i think...you should see a counselor. your family is obviously taking a huge toll on you....i'd avoid prescription meds if at all possible, but talkign to somebody, even a school counselor might help. good luck! email me if you need anthing. =)|`|iybezfi6aa	FIRST You are way too young to be diagnosed borderline. And you don't sound like it anyway except for the cutting thoughts. Don't start it because it could lead to borderline PD. In case you don't know borderlines can not be in relationships so it is a life sentence.    You sound like a confused young girl. Typical for your age. Adjustment to the teens is terrible. And the social pressure doesn't help.    You are right though to "act as if everything is alright". That is a good coping skill and will get you far. It can actually make things really better.  Live as healthy as you can. Eat breakfast and lunch. It will help.   You WILL get through this.|`|3KvTaFMoaa	bipolar|`|jmaC4Lwkaa	No you don't have a disorder,do you have any best friends?if so talk to them and tell them your problems.Or maybe you need therapy and always try to help your parents and say I LOVE YOU to them.Or maybe when you grow up you'll be better and be okay.About the food problem I don't know maybe you have a problem with that.In a tv show once I saw a girl who ate a little and who was fighting and wore not her usual clothes, she  had a problem.Ask your doctor or something.Oh yeah....I hope you feel better.|`|VMVfSNHPaa	I know exactly how you feel. When I was reading this I thought that i might have wrote it. I am a 13 year old girl to. I have the exact same problems and i feel the same. You are stronger than i am because i have cut myself. Its not smart because now i will always have the scars. i talk to my friends and it helps for the time being but never in the long run. If i asked fro a counsler my parents would say no because they don't care. The thing that helps me the most is getting out of the house. I usually go to my best friends house but sometimes my grandma is the greatest help. She sees everything i see. Just talk to someone. It and if our parents are willing to talk... talk to them. I have never been able to but it might help. Good Luck and Jesus loves you.   Jesus died for me so I will live for Him.
46827e1fada67be5dddf23d61ecc3c2eaa	Sounds like you have very tight muscles, especially in the hip area. Tight muscles can be excruciating & people usually don't stretch enough. You need to loosen your overly tight muscles now before stretching can help, that's why pilates didn't help, the muscles are too tight & more than likely have knots that need to be worked out before stretching will help. Massage will help & a long soak in very warm water will help too.|`|sy9rDK1Gaa	This could very possibly be sciatic pain.  There are stretches that can alleviate it .

a7CABccHaa	Sadly, I have this same exact problem.    So, what I try to do is when I'm in a situation where I would get angry I think of the situation from the other person's perspective (if there is one).    Think of how foolish you look freaking out and think of how you see peole acting this way.    They look pretty dumb and unapproachable huh?    So, just try to see things from the other perspective and see if that helps.  :)|`|lTbE6HHHaa	Bear in mind that this answer is only my opinion and I can only answer based on my limited life experience.    I used to an angry person, similar to your case I think. About five years ago i used to throw tantrums over the smallest things, and that have resulted in many holes all over my house.    These fits stopped abruptly after I was 'expelled of the spirit of anger' while i was attending church. I know I must sound ludicrous and irrational but that really worked for me. That being said, obviously especially if your not christian i would not advise you try this after you've tried many things and wants to try it as a last resort.|`|AA10192697	I use to get that way.  It's taken a few years to learn new ways to control myself, counseling for anger, and meds.  I have Bipolar.  I greatly suggest professional help now. And go to the local library or on the internet and find info on anger management.  Have you always acted this way, in childhood?  Did you see a parent act this way?    I journal at nite, either one word or a page, about my feelings.  Meds might help with your calmness.  Are you getting enough sleep and eating well?    go to www.NAMI.org  they have many ideas    Good luck and God bless!

Second, this may be caused by masturbation. If you masturbate frequently enough, your skin may start to chafe, which means that a little bit of it will start to fall off, but don't worry. You are right about the doctor, only dermatologists know everything about skin, regular clinic doctors don't. You don't have a skin disease, or anything like that - even if you are not masturbating.|`|Dj1Sp8Enaa	If it bothers you a lot see an urologist. fjw75
GhetCx0iaa	OK HI  this is not a serious q~~~~~  but im guna take it like one :}    The way you are sitting or standing, or the amount your butt is opened or closed will determine how much vibration will occur.

N6TCELEzaa	Hey,    I imagine you'll be talking about tablets in which the active ingredient is either Cetirizine or Loratidine (correct me if I'm wrong).    The short answer is that you'll be fine. I looked up the toxicity information on Toxbase, which is the poisons database that the UK poisons control uses and it told me that 6 year old children have taken 30 of these tablets and only experienced a slightly high blood pressure, so 2 won't do you any harm!

Zo8RhY9Iaa	a counselor may (and usually does) refer to a psychologist, now a psychologist is normally not a PHD.  They are like marriage counselors "tell me your problems."     A psychiatrist is someone with an MD.  They are going to say you need Zoloft or Abilify.  Be careful when trusting them with your health!  It is like the whole 'Gothika' thing.  Also try to run if they give you an MAOI, you can look it up but, it is bad!  Only if you are way over the bounds of sanity should you take that!|`|Yuzn2fkraa	well a counselor is usually someone who just talks to you and stuff but the psychiatrist is the one who prescribes antidepressants if she or he thinks u need them (for ex. if u have depression) wish u luck and hope this helped i know its not easy im going through the same|`|62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	A psychiatrist is a medical doctor first, then specializes in mental diseases. Therefore, can prescribe medication. Most depression and anxiety responds well to medication, although it may take a few tries to find the right one for you.  A counselor is not permitted to prescribe medication. Can only do "talk" therapy. Apparently your doctor feels it's time for medication and wants it to come from a specialist. Good luck.|`|a0v3q3J4aa	A counselor just talks to you about your problems and teaches you coping mechanisms.    A psychiatrist is a medical doctor that can write prescriptions while talking to you about your problems and working through the issues.|`|ReH5EoR0aa	Counselors are trained by psychiatry in school.  They talk to a person and use methods to stir up what ever it is, hoping to relieve the person with communication.  Unfortunately, some counselors are not very good at it and make things worse.    A psychiatrist is an actual M.D. who prescribes drugs.  They specialize in chemicals and electroshock, and the care and feeding of patients.   Their patients have a very high death rate.       I would recommend going to natural ways before you allow a psychiatrist to touch you.|`|iybezfi6aa	A psychiatrist prescribes meds. Except for the first visit when they are diagnosing you there is very little talk. Just "how are you?"and that's it. A counselor or therapist is someone you talk to. They (if they are good) will help you set goals and work towards a healthier perspective.  A lot of people see both.|`|CLcGxHpAaa	A counselor/therapist has limited mental health training and is not a physician and cannot prescribe medical treatment.    A psychiatrist is a medical doctor that has been trained in the field of mental health.    You have been referred to a psychiatrist because the "talk therapy" you have received from the counselor did not work to alleviate your depression.  A psychiatrist will be able to accurately determine what is wrong and prescribe to appropriate treatment, which may include medication.    Please be open-minded about medication, may people will try to persuade you that all psychiatric meds are bad-that is not the case.|`|BqXSymxjaa	A Psychiatrist can prescribe drugs a counselor can't.

Sometimes when wisdon teeth come through they can impact the other teeth which could also be a cause for the swelling.    Go to the dentist and they can do an X-ray to find out what is happening, the sooner the better as it can get very painful!    I had my back tooth removed which wasn't as painful as It thought it would be.    Hope this helps x|`|f1JS4QDyaa	Its most likely an infection. See a dentist.

dDSuBQURaa	There is your answer: weed. Why don't you go for crab weed that is found in your front lawn and smoke that instead? You can get better sleep if you do.|`|gWSWRUAbaa	Well you have to look at all the aspects that weed can affect...  weather you realize it or not it alters the state of mind, raises blood pressure, screws with the sugar in your blood. What you're dong is increasing the THC that is already normally present in your system. So when you go to sleep you probably have a higher heart rate which is pumping threw the brain faster... which I can see how it can alter you're dreams. Thats why there a myth about eating late at night or eating candy late will give you bad dreams....  Pretty much screws with your system.|`|UhIp4oAmaa	its your councious telling you that what your doing is bad|`|G0y5Orooaa	That is kind of odd. Whenever I blaze I sleep like a baby and have never had a nightmare that I can recall. I'm sure it's fine though. If I eat soon before I sleep it's normal for me to have a nightmare and my dad experiences that too.     We're all different. Maybe don't smoke too close to bedtime?
1oBilGHuaa	Seroquel is a medication that one can only get with a prescription from a doctor.  It is against the law to use or give Seroquel or any other prescribed drug to anyone except for the person it was intended for.    People have a tendency to build up a tolerance for Benzos so they will stop working as well as they once did.  Seroquel if taken at bedtime can help someone sleep.   A small dose of it can help someone feel a little calmer.|`|BC1VXQjWaa	some people prefer seroquel because it helps them sleep
yF8F9k27aa	hey, google bipolar disorder type I (bipolar I). her behavior sounds very much like that. also, try to figure out if she is using any substances or drugs and have your parents cut her off from that because that worsens the symptoms. take her to a psychiatrist. in bipolar disorder there are highs, lows, inflated bouts of self-esteem or 'highs' and then lows after that. her random street episode sounds like what doctors refer to as mania or a manic phase where she does very random socially inappropriate things out of the ordinary. people in their manic phases have delusions of grandeur where they randomly think they are going to be famous (maybe that's related to her acting thing) or think they are on some kind of mission from god or something (that is the extreme of it) definitely get her treated ASAP because at this stage, things will only worsen without medical attention. good luck.|`|ZaMzRSrraa	she needs a evaluation by a professional - she may be on drugs -|`|AA10192697	Get her admitted to a hospital in the mental health unit ASAP.

I was diagnosed 9 yrs ago and I really think I had it when I was 12.  Where are your parents in all this?  A parent or legal guardian needs to admit her or she can go in herself and tell them that she is depressed and has suicidal thoughts.  But be by her side.  She needs love and support.  She is probably scared to death because she doesn't know why she is doing these things.    Good luck!

Also, you sit down & talk with her & just see what all is bothering her.  Being a teen-ager can be very stressful for some; what seems to be minor for somebody else, may be a major thing for the depressed one.   Talk to a Counselor, so maybe you can help her, too.

mgTZD9Teaa	Yes, you haven't used those muscles in a while, so when you do use them it can leave you feeling a bit battered and bruised! Completely normal, nothing to worry about.  Also a tip for next time, stretch well, and do a warm up next time, it helps a lot! Trust me :)|`|2arBeg1caa	Yes since you haven't worked out in a while that is why you are sore. It could also be because you didn't stretch before working out.|`|H7MSxgZ7aa	ur not used to it|`|yoc3lzoOaa	Yes, it's just because you stopped working out.  When you stop & start, you have to go back into it gradually, & even then it will hurt.

AA10563860	all artificial sweetners offer risks.  Most are neuro-toxins (aspartame) and even splenda will turn into chlorine gas when it hits the acid in your stomach.  Chlorine gas is a carcinogen.  As far as your teeth...they are not bad for them.  The more you chew gum the more saliva you make which actually helps reduce the bacteria populations in your mouth.  Especially after a meal.  I would try to find gum without artificial sweetners..but the search will be long.  Try natural gum like gleegum which uses sugar (but dont chew it frequently), or look for gum sweetned with xylitol|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	It is not bad for your teeth. Gum such as Trident is actually good because it helps clean your teeth as you chew!|`|w5KFkyGRaa	no sugar free gum is not bad for you but it can upset your stomach and Splenda if ingested enough it can cause cancer.|`|qwK27ntGaa	Sugar free gum is actually good for your teeth because it can act as a cleaning agent for the food and particles that are trapped on your teeth.     Yes, some of the 'sugar free' stuff can upset your digestive system, but not always and not on everyone.     I like splenda.
DoHaUEziaa	Your mom probably is concerned about you and wants what's best for you. It may not seem like it now but mom's usually want their children to be healthy and happy. Going to a counselor does not mean you're crazy and you certainly won't have to see him/her for the rest of your life.     I went through marriage counseling for a short while and I actually benefited from it! There are many reasons to go to a counselor. Try to make the best of it and perhaps you'll learn a little more about yourself and others. Good luck!!!|`|yOL73epdaa	I love ur name! lol!- but i think u are acting like a normal teenager. i am the same way...|`|3tz4GyIaaa	That is not a good reason.

lAZWTLtRaa	It's ok to miss some school.  You get good grades and (going by from what you said) you don't miss school often. It's good to take a few days off but don't turn it into a habit. You are legitimately sick and I'm 100% sure your teachers rather you stay home and get better faster (and also so don't spread your germs to make other sicks).  If you stay home and rest, you'll recover faster.  Just make sure you get all the notes you missed and do your homework so you won't have a hard time catching up if when you go back.  If you still don't feel well tomorrow I suggest you stay home.  Don't feel guilty! Just focus on getting better.  What's one more day going to do? If you're in elementary school it really isn't a big deal if you miss some classes.|`|S7Q3fRvoaa	You defintely should not feel bad about that!  You are sick... it is ok to stay home.

Since it's taking so long for you to recover, that's your body's way of telling you that it needs more rest.  Give it what it wants and you'll be back out in no time!

I put away 200$ every pay, meaning 800$ a month in savings, also I have a "petty" cash box I use for my spending... $500 every 2 weeks (btw this is on a 2 person income).

vTACiVsgaa	Mucus, the substance found in a runny nose, is scientifically "alive."  Naturally, like you, in cold weather it gets uncomfortable and wants to find warmth. Mucus has no brain, so therefore no thought process, so when it is inside your head, it believes that if it travels to the nearest exit it will find warmth. But obviously it is colder outside of your body, and consequently it dies. Its quite tragic if you think about it.|`|xsZfN0JHaa	It is due to the temperature differences between your body and the air you breathe. when the air is cold and dry. Your nose don't get that much moisture.  You breathe in the cold moisted air into your nose. it heats up. Then you have to blow the moisture out of your nose.|`|tDaU7eYXaa	why do our noses start to run when its freezing cold  outdoors? That has to do with the mucous membranes in our nose,  explains Dr. Uwe Gessner, a specialist in analgesics at Bayer Vital.  The mucous membranes heat the air we breathe in like a heating  system to about 30 degrees in fractions of a second. We pump one  half to a liter of air into our lungs with every breath we take,  increasing to up to ten times as much on exertion. When its cold  outside, the mucous membranes can only do their job by producing  greater amounts of watery mucous at the same time  and thats when  our noses run.            Mucosal membranes in nasal passages are thin and have a very rich vascular environment underneath. They dry easily, so you need to increase humidity in your nose, nasal passages, and sinuses. Use a humidifier, houseplantswhich give off moisture as they metabolize wateror put small plates of water throughout your house. The slow evaporation humidifies the air.  advertisement    lso drink and eat moistening foods and things with a lot of mucilagethe thick, absorbent shells of seeds. Add a cup of water to half a cup of ground flaxseeds, and put it in the fridge overnight. By morning, the water on top will be a jellylike consistency, which, when consumed, can help boost moisture in mucous membranes. Or try making marshmallow or wild oat tea.    he main function of the sinusesto warm the air you breathe ingets taxed during the wintertime. The body compensates by dilating blood vessels in the nose and sinuses. Three or four times a day, put a small cloth into very warm water, ring it out, and put it over your nose and sinuses for about three minutes. Then do the same for 30 seconds with cold water.    ric Chan, ND, Pangaea Clinic of Naturopathic Medicine, Richmond, British Columbia

Or go for a job you DON'T want and see what happens first.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Not only does it not disqualify you, if your in the states, its illegal to even ask.  The only jobs that can ask about certain illnesses are those that have a physical requirement and involve safety, such as flying a plane.      So you do not have to tell them anything because they can't ask.  Your medical history is personal and confidential.   Even the insurance company they provide for you cannot divulge any medical information to your employer without your consent.|`|2jMFurDoaa	no they cant "disqualify" you for that, thats illegal.    its goes right along with race, religion, gender and sexual preference. they cant base hiring you on those things.    the meds you take arent something they look for on drug tests.    its up to you whether you tell them or not when you get hired.|`|CLcGxHpAaa	The government has something called the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), that protects you from discrimination.  Certain medications (usually anti-psychotics and anti-anxiety meds) can restrict you from certain jobs (high level govt or military jobs).  I do not think that you would be disqualified as a respiratory therapist because of your illness if you are stabilized on medication.|`|9yZ4rYa6aa	Difficult question, and as people have already pointed out not hiring you directly because of this is illegal, however they can choose not to hire you for other reasons and claim these are what make you unsuitable for the job. It's a well known fact disabled people are rarely in full time employment - typical human resource action is claim they weren't selected due to something else (e.g they had a more suitable employee) the whole lot's bs ofcourse but anyone who denies this takes place is a liar.    Also, any lies you tell to your employee gives them the automatic right to disqualify you and any lies on your CV is also illegal (although I doubt a case like that would make it to court). you're in a catch 22 situation, tell them and they can choose not to hire you as an (indirect) result or don't tell them and if they ever find out risk being sacked (once again, they'll claim you were sacked for lying but in actual fact it's due to having a mental illness).|`|xnZi0i8saa	Having bipolar should not disqualify you from most jobs. I believe some government jobs and the military frown on it but otherwise, no one even needs to know. As for the drug test, when a drug test comes back positive the doctor who did the test will call you and you will need to provide him with proof that you are on your meds... prescription bottles or a letter from you doc will do, then he will report to the prospective employer that your test was clean. They will not inform the employer of any drug that you are taking legally.    Do not mention it during an interview..... 99% of people have preconcieved misconceptions about mental illness and you are not required to tell them. period! After you have been at your job for awhile and only if you feel comfortable about you can confide in your boss if you feel they should know but you are not required to.     You can do any job that you feel capable of doing.|`|TJGje2blaa	Lieing can black-ball you.  Tell the truth, but specify that you take your medicine faithfully.   If you ever forgot to take your medicine & then you flare up, they will know how to handle your situation, simply by making sure you take the medicine.

When it feels the way that it does, do you think that I would change something?    If you have a natural penis, slide the foreskin back and take a look at your knob and touch it lightly. What do you feel? Do you feel lots? Does it kind of hurt even?    That tenderness when slippery translates direct to the brain as unbelievable feel good as slippery sliding in and out.  You don't get to realize the experience as much through a condom, but when you get married and have direct contact sex, that's when you will be able to relate to the best experience possible through having natural gear.     Now picture the knob as dry multilayer skin. If you touch it and release your finger, you don't feel much at all, maybe a bit of pressure contact and then release. The brain does not translate pressure contact much into sexual pleasure.    Put your finger into some hair conditioner or jell, now slip slide it lightly over the bare head of your penis. Notice the touchiness changes into amazing feel good! Imagine a dry multilayer skin over top of the feeling receptors of your knob as in a circumcised penis head. Do you really think that you are going to feel much of the light touch slipping awesome sensations?    I leave it with you to figure and work out from here.    Your gear is designed and made to give you the best feel good possible. It isn't a matter of "if someone else likes the way that it looks". It's all about you, and it giving the most awesome feelings experience possible to you.    Don't let someone who will never know those feelings, talk you out of, or steal that from You! :- )    Me! :- )|`|nqcnylFpaa	there is really no big difference accept for appearance they both have there pros and cons i am not going to list any of them i was not born with the foreskin over my penis so i guess i was naturally circumcised and yes people you can not tell people to be circumcised because it is unnatural circumcision exist in cultures,religious beliefs and just find it weird looking if you uncircumcised that's fine and if you are circumcised that's fine to this is a stupid thing to debate|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	i prefer uncircumsized it is more natural|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Intact.

Female circumcision is cleaner, as it removes portions of the labia that harbor bacteria and smegma (yes, females produce it, too--that's why they have all of these cleaning and deodorizing products for women!!)  and it can be argued to "look better" and also to prevent infections (women are always getting them) and disease.    Female circumcision removes the clitoral hood, which is analagous to the male foreskin.     It does NOT always remove the clitoris.         But female circumcision of minors is illegal, as it's acknowledged by all civilized countries as being genital mutilation.      It's open season on males, however.    Male circumcision is genital mutilation.     It's just the same for males; geital mutilation is genital mutilation.    It's horrible to mutilate infants, and there is no justification for this; it doesn't prevent disease, and there are no health benefits whatsoever.    There are complications and adverse effects which are suppressed by the doctors, as they make money from it and are very frequently members of the religions that try to perpetrate circumcision on all males.    Anyone with intelligence can see that a whole penis, with foreskin, natural and normal, feels and functions better than one that's been made partial, mutilated and scarred by circumcision.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.    ERIC|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	I had circumcision procedure done 8 weeks ago - wish I'd had it done years ago.|`|6lmFyr2maa	Jews and Muslims are circumcised as far as religions are concerned as a sign of of being under a promise made by God to Abraham.  The original circumcision was only cutting the tip of the foreskin to give blood. The agreement with God was a blood covenant as so required blood being shed. The penis was the part of the body that passes on seed for the next generation and the promise made to Abraham was to all up coming generations. ....Now we see why the penis was the part that was to shed blood in this particular covenant and continues today as a sing!    Queen Victoria of England was kind of warped, and wanted to prevent boy or male masturbation so she took it to a whole new level of removing the foreskin and shoved this idea of circumcision to the colonies of England along with idea that masturbation was a huge sin and that it caused insanity, blindness and all kinds of crap. She was anti-sex, hated sexual pleasure and was really warped. It is much easier to masturbate with a natural penis by sliding the shaft in and out of the foreskin which keeps the sensitive knob covered and feels kind of like sliding in and out of the real thing where the knob is concerned, if you know what I mean.     The UK has dumped circumcision, Europe never bought into it. Australia never bought it, and Canada has moved away from it.    The rebellious Colony of the U.S. for some strange reason bought into it more and it became tradition with all kinds of false information about infection horror and what ever just to resist change and keep sons looking like daddy. While the rest of the world moves on, not suffering from a bunch of infections and problems and having a higher sense of feel sensation and sexual pleasure without circumcision trauma related erectile dysfunction. Strange circumstances are being presented to support circumcision like preventing infections, std and HIV. The reality that everyone has is that good Hygiene prevents infection anywhere, and babies whose foreskin is bonded to the head of the penis are at least risk for infections.    As for std and HIV..that's caught from having sex with and infected person and not from having a foreskin.    Pleasure in America is being sacrificed for looking like a mushroom and there are people who become angry over not looking like a dried mushroom...tradition of fashion as though we are supposed to strut around locker rooms or showers to display our mushrooms!.. :- ) Ha ha!    Nothing on the body is perfect and just like a hair lip, there can be a rare deformity of the penis or foreskin, or any part of the body. Surgery may be needed here to do a correction of the problem, but complete removal of the significant foreskin is rarely needed be the solution to the problem.    ok rant over :D    xxx|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	INTACT-     circumcision is just a preference, religion or cosmetics. it comes with risks like, reducing potential penile growth, erectile dysfunction, infection leading to amputation, a crooked or leaning penis from too much foreskin being removed and extreme tenderness during or after sex|`|PAvYZJK2aa	it is easier to clean and looks nicer if circumcised|`|jOFRD9sLaa	You are never going to get a diffinite answer here.

In the developed world where we have soap and showers and condoms, there's no need for it.
IYu3bBFqaa	as far as him not being able to hold down a job my best advice is for him to see a psychiatrist and have him diagnosed so that he can get on disability.  The best thing you can do is be supportive of him and try to lead him in right directions.  It will take a lot of counseling to even begin to heal his wounds.  best of luck to you!|`|sHgXTD1Oaa	he was probably traumatized as a child, which would account for his current gay tendencies.  there's not really a question
tDaU7eYXaa	I haven't had it this year. I'm in NJ. I know seriously! All these doctors curing cancer and such can't even conquer a simple virus. However, there are teas known for their anit-viral properties. You should look that stuff up. I'd be happy with it. I actually have had a stomach problem August, if you mean last year also. It developed into an eating problem.  My symptoms then included gagging, acid reflux, and nausea, but I never threw up. Is this stomach flu, ya think? Ah well... Stupid virus!!!
jfQdypeMaa	I do recommend doing body cleanse or detoxification.  I have done these myself at least three or four times.  Make sure you clear this first with your health practitioner, since there are certain health concerns that some people have that set you up for problems if you go through one of these.    I strongly recommend researching the cleanse process that you are going to work with.  Make sure that the supplements that you will be taking with it are sufficient.  I have always worked with a product made by a company called M'Lis.  It is the M'Lis Detox Kit, and it includes two bottles of herbal supplements (one for Detox, one for Cleanse), and one large bottle of fiber capsules.  The process involves about five to seven days, and it is an amazing process that leaves you feeling revived and so healthy.  It even completely alters your food cravings.    It is true, when you are going through the cleansing process, your normal bowel and bladder functions might change a little bit, but this is normal.  It isn't like you will have to stay near a bathroom at all times.  You might just notice that your body is working harder at getting rid of unwanted toxins and things that bog your system down.    I hope I have helped in some way.  I am a chiropractor in the Minneapolis (Edina, Minnesota) area.      Here's to your health!  Dr. P.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	There are books you can get where you can cleanse one area at a time. My husband & I had this great book out of the library once & it said first thing in the morning eat 15 pumkin seeds for 2 weeks. It was supposed to clean out certain little worms in your bowls & you can see it did this. But you can find a cleanse for your blood, kidneys, etc I think it would be nice to just pick one thing to cleanse each month so you have plenty of time so you don't do to much to your body at once.
DN3lPdE0aa	i got mines on sep 10, 2007 and im getting them off next week// i had them for 1 year and 3 month    :)    & the ortho said i had to keep them for bout 2-3 years!|`|iE2sDxDAaa	Not sure what you're asking.

ynj5po8maa	THe thickness of your dick, usually the circumference.|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	Its how thick it is. That matters more than the length.|`|lCvJHS13aa	Girth is the measurement around your penis, if you would use a piece of string, wrap it around your penis and measure the distance where the two ends touch.|`|FT2dOlZEaa	All the way around the penis, measured at the base of your penis.    FYI:    The average length of an erect adult penis is about 5.5" - 6".    Its worth remembering that the average adult penis is 'designed' to fit the average depth of the adult vagina which is also about 6".     There is no normal or average size for a soft/flaccid penis because they vary enormously. Some guys shrink a lot more than others when soft. You can NEVER judge how big a guy will be when he is erect from his soft penis size.    The average girth of an erect adult penis, that is the distance AROUND the penis measured at the thickest point, is about 5". Anywhere between 4.7 and 5.2 is normal.     Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18. Sometimes up till about 24 or 25yo.    Approximate lengths for under 18s are:  At the beginning of puberty 2.4   12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0    To convert to cm, just multiply the number in inches by 2.54cm. For example, 5 X 2.54 = 12.7 So a 5" penis is 12.7cm
Vp1Wzu07aa	Wow it is nice to hear someone ask this...I thought I was the only one. I have huge blue veins from mid chest all the way down my boobs. Have had them all my life,...I am 43 now...and when I was skinny I had them and now I am...not so skinny, and still have them. They are so ugly to me but I have never had a guy complain so... yeah.     I have been going to doctors now for years, just went yesterday and had a breast exam. They never say anything about it being abnormal.    I tell you what...I also have huge veins in my arms, like where the take blood in the crook of your elbow. I wonder if that is related?    Don't worry about it. Everyone is different.|`|91c6bKdwaa	yup its normal|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Yes it's normal.|`|sMgrtDO0aa	yes it is normal. normally you they appear when breast grow fast. they might go away in the future but they can stay as well. i have them too, they stayed :s|`|xtH1eDITaa	I have them too. I'm pretty sure it's normal.|`|7TdG2vTCaa	Yes, it's normal.  Especially if they are larger.|`|oFUqegjfaa	There are veins anywhere there is blood. Just more in some places and less in others.  This is normal.|`|faMwY5Xyaa	Yes its normal. you dont have anything to worry about|`|tnEIPjccaa	Yep. That is normal. Boobs, like the rest of your body, need blood too.  Sometimes they tend to show even more on the boobs because boobs tend to grow and change constantly, so the skin can be a little thinner there.|`|d76Mz5c0aa	lol  u freaked out when u   noticed didnt u?  i did too.  and when me saw   strech marks  wow|`|Z6ZJTj8laa	yes its quite normal we have veins all over our bodies some visible some not|`|e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	Very normal especially in very light skinned women. Nothing to worry about. use Nivea on your breasts to prevent stretch marks as your grow.

tVF9O1Olaa	You need to see a doctor who can refer you to see a psychiatrist and be diagnosed. People on here could say it is depression or just your hormones or bipolar etc but they do not know you so they cannot tell you, you need to be assessed for anything like that.  Go to your doctor who can advise you more. Good luck      EDIT- why have i got thumbs down? For the people who said this is just hormones then how do you know? You don't know this person. Young people do get mental illnesses too they are not just hormonal all the time. All i have advised is this person needs to see a doctor if they are worried as people on here cannot diagnose her so why am i getting thumbs down for that???|`|G9VBTg47aa	Without reading this, yes.|`|3F8bCZ55aa	To be diagnosed as a mental illness, the condition needs to last for a specific amount of time.  Talk to a doctor about it.|`|9yZ4rYa6aa	you have a disorder called 'melodramatic teenager with hormone based minor depression'.    You do not have bipolar disorder by the way - anyone who has depression has 'up days' it's not a condition of bipolar disorder, people with bipolar disorder become manic and scream and laugh - if you wan't a rough diagnosis you have very minor depression (68% of teenagers have the same thing).|`|hr3r5Vpoaa	I really think it's hormones. But.. if you feel that it might be a serious issue, talk to a counselor.|`|cJkaFd51aa	Sounds like maybe Rapid-Cycling BPD. (Bipolar Disorder)    BPD has two major stages, Mania and depression. During extreme states of mania one might feel elevated, expansive, or irritable. Typically people with Bipolar will experience hyper-sexual states where they get horny a lot. Depression is pretty much self explanatory. Feeling worthless, empty, crying often, self harm, suicidal thoughts.    My mom has it and growing up with her was hell for me because she always forgot to take her meds, would take too much and has been hospitalized numerous times.She's good now, her medication is adjusted.     But i would talk to an adult whom you trust and will take you seriously. Hope i helped.
AVEwe7gLaa	Your body is changing. This is when you have to start eating healthy. Don't starve yourself, but now the way you eat and how active you are will start to show. Be haelthy and your body will do what it's meant to do. If you are still heavier, then that's what you body type is supposed to be now that you're approaching womanhood. Women have different bodies than girls. Welcome to womanhood!!!!! Be safe!|`|RXI8ImdIaa	You have to be really certain that you are getting accurate weights. Make sure of the following things:    1. Always use the same scale, on flat hard floor, make sure it's a good quality scale. Test it by getting on it a bunch of times all in a row and see if it gives you the same weight every time.    2. Weigh at the same time every day. It should be in the morning, immediately after waking up and urinating. Before the shower and before eating anything, but after urinating.    3. Wear the same thing each time you weigh. Ideally you should be naked, but a light nightgown or pajamas is acceptable if it weighs about the same every day.    If you make sure that you are doing all these things, I bet your weight will not appear to fluctuate so wildly. However if it does, and you're definitely not making a measurement error, then you need to be at the doctor's office asap.|`|IYu3bBFqaa	if you have irritable bowel syndrome I believe that waste can stay in your intestines and then all come out at once because you go from constipated to the opposite.  So if you are constipated and bloated one week and have diarrhea the next this certainly could cause dramatic drops and increases in your weight.  My only suggestion would be to try to include a daily dose of fiber into your diet, its supposed to keep you regular.|`|6IZ30X8iaa	That's an extreme range for so short a time period.  Perhaps your scale isn't calibrated correctly?  Check your weight on other scales to see if you are in fact fluctuating 20 pounds in one week.  If you are, see the doctor.
AA10778838	Sounds like you have a torn Meniscus. I'm no doctor. You need to try to flex and bend the knee as much as possible. The easiest way to do this is ride an exercise bike. Raise the seat, high so your legs are fully extended and progressively lower the seat according to your pain level. Schedule an appointment with an orthopedic sports physician and get an MRI of your knee.|`|H7MSxgZ7aa	u just have to wait

oKehzfkFaa	Quad is one of 4 quadrants of your mouth.  The rest are the different sides of your teeth  Mesial,front;  Occlusal ,  biting surface, Distal, back of tooth  F is facial, front of front teeth  B is buccal..the side of your tooth towards your cheek  L stands for lingual, toward your tongue  Usually these refer to where the decay is or where the filing is..|`|gu1eJ5bXaa	I am a dentist in UK  Quad - unsure, probably quadrant, we dentists divide the mouth into 4 quadrants, 2 on the top, left and right, and the same on the bottom.  The following are surfaces of teeth usually used to denote the fillings needing done -  MOD, DO, MODBL & DOB are the abbreviations for fillings, with each letter standing for a surface of the tooth  M - mesial, the surface nearest the front of the tooth  O - occlusal, the biting surface of the tooth  D - distal, opposite of mesial, the surface nearest the back of the tooth  B - buccal, the side of the tooth nearest the cheek  L - lingual, the side of the tooth nearest the tongue    I am sorry I have no idea what the F in DFL stands for, could it be an error? or it could mean that the F stands for filling (needing replaced)    As I am in the UK I have no idea what prices are like in Virginia!

I look crap in photos. Some people just do. I always have one eye shut or something.

Ha! Not upside down. Write a word and hold it to the mirror.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	No, the mirror image is a reversed image of you - other people see you as you look in photos.|`|QWN8KNCPaa	its you in the mirror,its what you think of yourself that counts,|`|DC4Civrvaa	Trust me when I say this....Others see you just as you would see yourself in a picture, not in the mirror.  Mirror images are not how other people see you.  When I look at myself in the mirror and when I look at myself in a picture I see two completely different people!  I am much more overweight than I think I am.  In a mirror believe it or not some things are hidden.  If you look at yourself sideways you look different too.  I vote for picture is best to know how other people see you.  Good luck!|`|JowyDgSJaa	Well here's the thing, I have the same problem --    in the mirror, you view yourself in the angle that you want to view yourself in. Face up, face down, body to an angle, body forward - makes all the difference. the other day I accidentally saw myself in the mirror turning the lights off and I looked obese. I mean, I always thought I was thin, what happened?    Sorry I can't boost you self-esteem, reality sucks sometimes. But you can EASILY just not be photogenic because flash makes the skin look all wierd and hilights body parts, zooms in etc etc.     Either way, i know 100% you are beautiful but suffer a low self-esteem. Believe that you are beautiful, don't dwell on the bad features - celebrate the beautiful ones that are abundant in your body -- then you will be beautiful in the mirror, photos and anywhere else.    Positive energy babe! You will see the difference ASAP, take it from soneone who knows.|`|iCUstJdNaa	i think others see you different and i think that the way your mother sees you is in a different way that perhaps your friends.  I also think looking at photos of yourself is confusing as some may make you look good and others not so good.  The truth is its not how other people see you that really matters may bee at the beginning but after getting to know a person there is a lot more to human being than just what you look like to others.  As you get older and go through life you will realise that there is a lot more that your looks. Your looks will change and as you go through life you will have different issues with what you look like.|`|C7Vn3T7Aaa	You have to remember that your mirror image only shows the front and a little to the sides.  Photos look slightly different because you're seeing more of your face, especially the left and right profiles.  This can be strange for some people, and why a lot of us get a little freaked out when watching ourselves on film.      Don't worry.  The mirror image is what we all see when facing you.  It is the best representation of your face.  If you are happy with it, then you have nothing more to think about.  No-one is perfect, nor should they be.  Even the most beautiful people in the world see faults in themselves.  Michelle Pfiffer (actress who played Cat woman in a  Batman movie, was the teacher in Dangerous Minds, amongst many other film roles, Dangerous Liaisons, etc, recently played the mother of the blonde girl in Hairspray,) thinks she looks like a duck!  She doesn't, she's a very beautiful woman.      Perhaps you should have more faith in the people around you.  If they say you look great, you should believe them.  Do you have any reason not to trust them?  Do you really think they'd lie to you?

FicyC2TXaa	First, cancer is rarely hereditary - fewer than 10% of cases are.    You don't say what type of cancer your grandmother had or how old she was. A sign that cancer MAY be hereditary within a family is when several members of the same side of the family have had the SAME type of cancer, especially if some eveloped it at a younger than usual age.    An isolated case of cancer within a family, as I assume your gran's was since you don't mention any others, is not hereditary. You don't inherit a general tendency to get cancer.    So from the information you've given, you're not at increased risk of developing cancer.      Cancer that is diagnosed after the age of 50 is less likely to be hereditary too.    Secondly, breast cancer - at your age the chances of developing breast cancer are very close to zero. It's mainly a disease of ageing - 80% of those diagnosed are over 50, only around 5% are under 40, only 0.1% are under 30 and it's almost unheard of in under 20s.    Truly, if you had breast cancer your case would be reported in medical journals worldwide, it's rarity would make it of such enormous interest to medical professionals.    It's quite normal for one breast to be somewhat larger than the other; remember that your breasts are still growing and developing and an changes you notice are likely to be hormonal.    Talk to your mother about this; if you feel you can't do that, talk to your school nurse - she will be used to girls having worries like this and will take you seriously and should be able to reassure you.|`|VCIZJQCJaa	breast cancer is not too common with girls your age it only occurs in 5% of women under  age 40.can be hereditary, sometimes not  so many young girls are loosing their mothers at a young age and it is a legitimate concern. the purple is not suppose to be there.the way to check it have the doctor(female if that will make you more comfortable)she will check you and if necessary do a mammogram.that test is not painful,but cold on the machine.  since it runs in your family you will have to keep the doctors aware in the future,and take care of yourself better,a good healthy diet and exercise will work for you to be healthier.please don't worry,try to read all you can on the subject,knowledge is power.|`|WadzK6ejaa	I dont think you have cancer .relax and live healthy life .do exercise regularly .avoid fatty foods .if you became older and you got baby use breast milk not bottole feeding and examine your breasts now and then|`|xevn7m4taa	well i dont no the percentage you having breast cancer if your nan did. but i do no that it is normal for some girls to have a breast bigger than the other.

BnR4LLhxaa	Sorry to hear that. Shoulders are very complicated joints. Two of the more common problems are a torn rotator cuff or frozen shoulder, but there are plenty of others.  Pretty hard to diagnose from a distance. You need to see a doctor - and perhaps get a referral to a someone who specializes in dealing with shoulders.  Good luck.

This was in the derby area of the Uk    Message me if you have any other questions.    EDIT to add: Privately, It could be from 1500- 3000.. depending on who does it for you.  This is why doctors always suggest circumcision as a first resort; means less loss for them or something.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Win a Lottery jackpot & pay cash for it.|`|4arnbpUCaa	I guess it depends how severe your phimosis is.  Preputioplasty and/or frenuloplasty are definitely less invasive treatments for phimosis. I guess you'd have to enquire with a private medical provider local to you, or get a second opinion from a different NHS hospital.|`|QQRyi4Bgaa	I work at my countrys Bank and could have gone anywhere in the world for treatment. I opted for Forerunners Healthcare Consultants in India because my doctor told me about the medical expertise there. Equally importantly he had heard glowing reports about the humane and patient-friendly doctors and nurses. My surgery was outstanding and the prices, amazing! It was a very happy experience, in every sense. I commend India as a wonderful place to get treated in. Having lived in the US for several years, I can say that the hospital in India compares well with the best in the USA.    http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com
5LJUiqOUaa	i heard it take you seven years to digest gum if you accidentally swallow it . but i don't think that's true . this site should help you :  http://skinnychef.com/blog/chewing-gum-b...|`|UL3XOKJxaa	I would not make this a habit, but swallowing gum once or twice should cause no long term problems. Good Luck
5LJUiqOUaa	it shouldn't do much damage to you . it's nothing serious . some people say it takes 7 years to digest but that's probably just a lie . this site should help : http://chemistry.about.com/b/2008/01/01/...    good luck :)|`|79L0T9bIaa	Some say that it can get stuck in your intestines. But I read in a magazine that it's a myth.   :/|`|aecb87753b7a91041ba0f8e18327da41aa	you know the rubber things around you in your every day life? elastics, rubber bands, etc? bubble gum is made exactly of the same material, the difference is that it has A LOT of sugar and flavouring in it, so it tastes good. but it's not edible, that's why you're supposed to spit it out after chewing.  so, you tell me: if you eat a rubber band, would that be bad for you? then imagine you ate a rubber band with sugar on it.|`|YuUNESK5aa	no.  and it doesn't stay in you for 7 years. It passes through your system regurarly.  it's not a good thing to swallow them a lot.  If you do, you may have to have sugery to get them out.
kD4BBKARaa	Hot chicken soup, hot teas with honey, alot of rest and plenty of fluids; also gargle regularly with listerine or salt water.
Pmb0MeB8aa	Caffeine is a mild diuretic of the class Xanthines, which come from plants like coffee plants and tea plants, and also prescription medications such as Theophylline (a bronchodilator used in treatment of respiratory problems like asthma). Caffeine works as a diuretic in 2 ways, one way is simple..it speeds up the rate at which the kidneys work. The other way is that it inhibits sodium resorption, which also increases urine output.    So, caffeine is going to decrease your sodium levels a little bit, but in no way will it deplete your sodium levels...it just isn't that strong of a diuretic.    Also of note is that sodium is a mineral, not a vitamin.|`|rYg3SOFpaa	I'm guessing potassium and sodium because it's a diuretic.|`|WauRLOovaa	Vit C.  And I am an RN too.  I just don't lecture off topic.  Have a nice day.
rwXcLTNvaa	Actually it will make it worse. The alcohol especially beer and wine, promote the streptococcal bacterium to multiply. I suggest strong spirits only, but I would avoid. Strong spirits help sore throats, because the attack the bacteria and sterilise the area. The more pure the alcohol (eg Vodka) the better, but I don't suggest it because when you stop, dehydration (due to alcohol) and you will feel worse afterwards.|`|3CCIcS6Oaa	It depends on what kind of alcohol you drink and how strong it is.  I don't think it will make it any worse.. but alcohol does dehydrate you, which is not good when you're sick.|`|9Kax4Kekaa	Any alcohol will irritate your throat, more then it already is.  If you do drink, don't drink anything cold because the cold helps to promote more bacteria growth which is usually the cause of a sore throat.
DsLx6Sixaa	Yes, Paraguard can effect your period. It often makes it heavier or causes spotting between periods. It should not hurt to use a tampon.
PAvYZJK2aa	no it doesn't|`|AA11785060	Didn't for the other 2 billion guys on the planet that masterbated or masturbate regularly. Not sure why you think you would be an exception|`|4arnbpUCaa	Not at all.|`|T9vf2uU7aa	No.  But that doesn't mean just go and masturbate a million times a day, everything in moderation.|`|SltEwVX7aa	no dude, it won't affect it's size at all.  Genetics determines when and how much it will grow, and what your final size will be.      Jerk it as often as you like/need to.  It's harmless.|`|5sSjx4GXaa	Not at all dude, there is nothing to worry about here!!|`|zFpHpqiLaa	well that means im gonna have a 1 inch penis lol nah just kiddin it's definitely a myth dude no truth to that whatsoever|`|SoAhPwhraa	no it will not reduce your penis size but it will reduce your fertility|`|FT2dOlZEaa	Nope. Your penis size is genetically determined.    FYI:    The average length of an erect adult penis is about 5.5" - 6".    Its worth remembering that the average adult penis is 'designed' to fit the average depth of the adult vagina which is also about 6".     There is no normal or average size for a soft/flaccid penis because they vary enormously. Some guys shrink a lot more than others when soft. You can NEVER judge how big a guy will be when he is erect from his soft penis size.    The average girth of an erect adult penis, that is the distance AROUND the penis measured at the thickest point, is about 5". Anywhere between 4.7 and 5.2 is normal.     Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18. Sometimes up till about 24 or 25yo.    Approximate lengths for under 18s are:  At the beginning of puberty 2.4   12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0    To convert to cm, just multiply the number in inches by 2.54cm. For example, 5 X 2.54 = 12.7 So a 5" penis is 12.7cm
Vp1Wzu07aa	My 16 year old came to me with a concern one day. She had a lump in her right breast on the right side. I took her to the doctor the next day just to be sure. It turns out it was her gland. She is pretty thin and doesn't have much for boobs. When she gets her period the lump get very uncomfortable.    It is probably nothing but you should go to get it checked out to be sure. I can't believe your mom won't take you. This is nothing to overlook. If your mom won't take you, go to the free clinic have them give you a breast exam and you can go from there.    Don't be worried just yet. Go and see what they say. It is most likely nothing but you have to be sure.|`|Xrvutzmdaa	WELL YOU SHOULD GET one of those breast checkups they just see if there is anything wrong with them|`|Uhbf27hzaa	yeah see doc i heard lumps mean cancer|`|e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	Keep bugging your Mom you need to have it checked out by a doctor.|`|3bsvBa8taa	you might want to do a self breast exam or go to the doctor|`|uiVEaxjqaa	Its rare to get breast cancer at that young. But you should still go get it checked out.|`|o6ACs5z4aa	Any lumps found on or near your breast needs to be looked at by a doctor.  That is why at your wonderful yearly appointment they show you how to do self-examinations.  You really need to call your doctor and have him look at it.  However don't jump to horrible thoughts of cancer.  It could be several things, a harmless cyst, a fatty deposit, or things like that.  Call your doctor immediately though.  Good luck!|`|7TdG2vTCaa	Probably not, but DO go to the doctor and have him/her look at it.  It's better to be safe than sorry, but it's rare to have breast cancer at 16.|`|faMwY5Xyaa	I have the same thing. you need to go get a mammogram or an ultrasound it could be cancerous or it could be just a lump. my doctor told me its something a teenage girl usually gets.|`|oFUqegjfaa	I freaked out this exact same way when I was your age.  The chances of you having breast cancer are incredibly slim at your age.  Especially if you have not gotten your period yet.  These are growing pains.  The lump is tissue.  It does sound like your period is on the way though.|`|AA11809403	ALL lumps should be checked out.    there are some possibilities that aren't scary, some that are.  but it really really has to be checked by a doc.|`|AA10041941	OMG dear if its a LUMP or bump like that you can actually FEEL go to the doctor like NOW....Breast cancer doesn't discriminate and people now are younger and younger that are getting it.. just go! OMG!! OMG!! OMG!!|`|stRWElvPaa	When my friend was about 15 she had a lump in her boob and was scared it was cancer, she went to the doctor and he told her it was just a benign cyst.     So don't worry too much, just book a doctors appointment. Is it one lump or are there like loads of little ridges? My boobs have ridges at the side in the 2 weeks before my period, and they twinge and hurt too.    Are you having sex? Is there any chance you could be pregnant because your boobs swell and hurt when youare pregnant apparently.    Bt the best thing to resolve itis to book an appointment and see yor doctor. good luck!|`|L3Rj6vbJaa	yeah, you should go to the doctor and let her look at it.  good luck|`|xtH1eDITaa	I would probably go to the doctor and get that checked out.|`|vwPlgoXpaa	You should definetly get it checked out! Before its too late.|`|VYxU9vjMaa	I would go see a doctor, but I dont think its cancer though, it might be like a cyst that can be removed|`|J5ryXU8laa	im 13 n had the same thing. im pretty sure it is an infection in ur boob. go to the doctor n they will give u some antibiotics. this is not cancerious but go to the doctor soon before it gets worse. if it gets really bad u might have a needle poked in that spot to drain the fluid. it not fun!!!
d3VV4b6vaa	no, psoriasis is when your body isn't absorbing essential fatty acids|`|8HDQMkSBaa	lol...no|`|bjN4eaqUaa	NO  I think it is not true.  Normally about the psoriasis causation it has been said as by    "Main causes of psoriasis are still not fully understood. It is possible that multiple factor are may contribute in Psoriasis. Auto-immunity is the main role player besides his genetic and environmental factors are also involve in this skin disease.    T-Cells of the body produce some substance to protect skin from infective agents but an irregular activity in immune system take place due to excess of these substances. A rapid growth of skin cells occurs which stack up on the outer surface of skin. Hence an inflammation in the skin occurs. Further more mutation of genes also affects T-helper cells.    Besides autoimmunity and the genetic factor some other factors are also count for Psoriasis like abnormal functioning of liver, anxiety, environmental condition, drugs, infection and injury etc."
d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	An even better idea is to raise money for your local Make a Wish foundation . . they are feeling the pinch this year . . it cost about $5000 for every childs wish . .     Although you are very sweet to want to raise money for games and other things for these children . . I have to tell you that many of the childrens hospitals and children's clinics are overwhelmed by gifts of this kind. My son was a patient in a childrens hospital and the kids had tons of books, gifts, toys, gaming systems, games, movies, television, dvd, ipod, a game room, movie theater, snack bar . . . and it is good to replenish what is available . .but just as important is the Make a Wish . . where real memories can be made with the child and their familiy at a time when it is very much needed.

7d92fea894a319f966b40ae7494fa5a5aa	Sorry, no magic formulas.  Your body has to have time to cure it.  You can help by getting more sleep and rest.  After around 2 weeks, you will have yet 1 more cold virus that you will be immune to.  There's 100's you know.    But, here is the best I know.......  "- Researchers have shown zinc lozenges reduce the severity and duration of cold symptoms, particularly a sore throat. Researchers believe the zinc is directly toxic to the cold virus and stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies to destroy the virus."    Please do not use Zicam nasal spray because it can kill your sense of smell .... permanently.    And if you have fever under 102, Do Not Treat it, a little fever helps speed the process of killing the virus.  That's kind of what that guy above is saying about sweat it out.    You know of course all the symptoms of the common cold are a result of your body fighting the virus.  So you really don't want to stop the fight.

9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	Sounds pretty normal to me. Everyone is different, but what your describing doesn't sound strange. Dark brown, thick blood is old blood.

It might have something with the fact that you lost your virginity but it's also possible that it has nothing to do with it.  Periods are not supposed to be regular...actually it is normal if they are irregular.  If it really bothers you and you get cramps and other things, then you might want to consider taking the birth control pill.   It will regulate your period and be...well, perfect.  Hope this helps :)  And, don't worry.|`|o6ACs5z4aa	Periods normally begin by being very heavy and then get lighter as it goes on.  The thick and dark part is probably skin cells, clots and things like that.  A period is basically a cycle for cleaning yourself out.  It is completely normal although yes very gross.

It seems pretty normal to me. There are two main purposes to having a period. The first is obviously ovulation. Your body release an egg once a month in hopes of it being fertilized. Hence you have your period once a month (well every 28 days or so). The second purpose is to clean out the lining of your uterus. Throughout the month your body thickens the lining of your uterus so that if an egg is fertilized it can implant in the wall of the uterus. If an egg does not attach then the body flushes the lining and the egg out through your period. I believe the thick, dark brown is just the lining of your uterus being shed. It is also normal for your period to taper off towards the end.     If you are really concerned, or this is really abnormal for your periods then you should have it be seen by your doctor. And I don't think it has anything to do with losing your virginity, but I don't know for sure.|`|NAvaa1Araa	Well I don't wanna get into too much detail, but for the first two to three days of being on my period it's very heavy too, then the rest (as it progresses) it's lighter like you said. The reason why you get one little spot on your last two days is probably cause it's discharge. (The extras.) Also it might have something to do with your age. That's my guess. I seriously doubt that there's anything really wrong! I hope that helped and I wish you luck!|`|GH0VZnGLaa	hmm it could be a number of things my period was really weird for a while too i started my period when i was 11 and it was weird like sometimes i would bleed for 9 days sometimes i would bleed for 3 days and it was never on a scheduled time until i got to be about 18 (im 19 now) now that im older its always around the same time of the month and its between 4-6 days long never longer so it could just be your age or your hormones i dont know your best bet would be to talk to a doctor

5ca4a66e8e8c668570b7cb63be24e01aaa	after going through tests to check my heart and thyroid - everything was fine, the best advice my doctor gave me was to breath in a paper bag.  another trick i found helpful was to find my pulse on my wrist and count my heartbeats.  after a few minutes of counting, i found this helped slow my heartbeat.      I too had difficultly breathing and my doctor told me that the attack makes you hyperventilate. when you hyperventilate, you get dizzy and sometimes faint (i never did).  I was told, this is body's way of taking care of itself.  If you faint, your breathing will return to normal.    after I learned the worst thing that could happen is I would hyperventilate or faint, i finally got control over the attacks.|`|ukF0Oqg8aa	Kornfan,    For 3 years I had panic attacks and each time I literally thought I was going to die.  I didn't tell anybody about this either.  Then, one night, a friend  found me hyperventilating in bed and rushed me to the hospital.  Anyway, they told me it was a panic attack.  They gave me tranquilizers and the name of a therapist that I really liked.  He told me about this program:    http://TheBestListOnline.Com/cure-panic-...    He really shouldn't have because this program cured my attacks.      I kept my appointments with him anyway because I liked talking to him and he also noticed how much more relaxed I was since the panic attacks stopped.      Anyway, hope this helps.  Cheers,  Martha|`|wwzoqIvVaa	Deep breathing, creative visualization, cognitive thinking, remembering what I already know.|`|d43e96506445ef1b6b4ace4380a9a5b4aa	depending on what your triggers and reactions are mediation and breathing techniques work great for me.|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	I accept it.  I say to myself, "Oh, lawks, here's another one of these ridiculous things.  I'm just going to sit down (or lie down) and wait for the stupid thing to subside.  But get on with it, stupid thing, I don't have all freakin' day."    Somehow, treating it as a nuisance visitor is empowering.  I control it...it doesn't control me.|`|UDu828VEaa	Yeah, but what happens when you can't breathe, and when you do it, it is like an extreme pain in the chest?  I would try to get myself out of the situation that I'm in, just for a while.  If it is at all possible, go on a vacation, or a long journey, do something that takes your mind off of things.  Go for a swim, go biking, a long walk might help.|`|W1czn0C6aa	First of all, I'm sorry that you have to go through something so terrible. I had a few panic attacks a few years ago when I was going through a rough time. I can't offer any medical advice, but the thing that always helped me was having a friend by my side, talking to me and reminding me to breathe. Just try to remember that it will be over soon, and everything is ok. Good luck, and I hope you find something that will help!|`|pKPPwl3gaa	i no alot of people just look up twoards the sky and count to 10 repeadly till there fine..|`|JMZkaf1jaa	I have panic attacks as well.  For me, I have to be around someone or it makes it worse if I am alone.  I was alone when I had a really bad one a couple of weeks ago and I found that laying down in bed with all the lights on and a television on and a pillow to hug was enough to calm me down.  I think they should rename them to something else cause they are so scarry each and every time.  This works for me.  I have a friend that has to get outside and get air, outside air every time he has one. Hope some of this helps.

dM8EyL6caa	I believe this is completely normal to feel this way. Mothers are a huge part of you. Sometimes you have to let down your guard and allow yourself to go through the grieving process to overcome these feelings. You will never forget but you can cope with it easier than it seems you are doing now. Maybe you should try seeing a counselor to talk to, they can help. Good Luck! My thoughts are with you.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Forget the brave face, and let yourself grieve. Do it in your room if you want; that's probably the best way. Make something special of it. Get your teddies and other toys and line em up. Get a photo of your mum and put it on the dresser in front of the mirror. Light a nice candle. Get yer box of tissues out, put on some soft music (NOT downer music, ok?) and then sit in a comfy chair, or on your bed, and just relax. Breathe slowly and deeply, then in your mind, ask your mum to be near you and to give you a sign she's there.     Then relax again, and start talking to her. Let whatever feelings or emotions come up in you to do that, without shutting off, pushing back down or avoiding... just let em out. It's the best and only way to really heal this.     And tell her everything. How you can't cope with her gone, how putting on a brave face hurts; why the heck did she leave anyways?    You can imagine her replies to you... whether or not you think she's there.|`|9yZ4rYa6aa	Even though your text has annoyed the hell out me i'll answer for you.    the emotional state of yourself is dependant upon several recovery symptoms - when people are put into difficult stress filled situations, they enter into one of these states. It sounds like you've entered into a condition called repression, in repression difficult memories are purposely 'blocked out' due to the harm they can cause, people don't consciously do it, they avoid thinking about a situation until all memories of it fade away, this is similar to denial where a person believes a traumatic experience never happened.    Repression is perfectly natural but can have difficult consiquences, the major one being memories flooding back and causing hurt later on in life. If you think this is going to cause you problems, the best advice would be to speak to someone who can deal and support you with such experiences.    My advice would be to stick with it, like you say - put on a brave face, allow yourself to cry every now and again and one day you'll get over it and be mentally healthy. While your doing your GCSE's try not to think about it too much, it's likely to be a hard time.    On an additional note, one of the over recovery symptoms is related to creativity, people often put their time and efforts into creative tasks in order to distract themselves from painful memories - perhaps you could try this, revise more when you feel sad (Freud himself said this was the best way to deal with emotional trauma).

EDXh0tk9aa	Sugar feeds yeast. If you are going to eat (or smear) yogurt to help with a yeast infection make sure it is Unsweetened.

You should have your period by 18.  If you don't however, it's not the end of the world....just start paying closer attention to it at that age.  I would say, if she doesn't have it by 19, see the gyno.    Gynos say this:  18 or sexually active is when you should see the gyno for the first time.  That is because before 18, women's bodies aren't fully developed (even at 18 and 19 they're not...but they are close).  So, give it some time, and at 18, have her see her gyno (it will be time for her age anyways).    Peace.|`|mdCjmOAXaa	no it isnt too late her body just hasnt gone through puberty yet, if you both are really concerned about it go see a doctor..|`|g2cYsy4Caa	Everyone starts at different times.|`|yfrZowkfaa	It depens how old you are! maybe she did get her period but she just didn't realize. you see, a girl usually get their periods from the age 9-20. maybe she is going through puberty at a different pace then you, so don't judge her like that.|`|huWSAcT4aa	17 is actually realy late.

If she is seriously concerned about it, she can talk to her doctor and they can discuss possible causes.     But as of now, I would say that there isnt anything to worry about. Every girl is different.|`|vawiXqNHaa	I don't think there is anything to worry about.

lS9J9Nrpaa	I have heard of them, they are also known as a Mooncup. I have never used them, but despite them sounding rather gross, I actually think they're a good idea and I would give them a try if I ever saw them for sale but I never have!    I heard about them a few years ago when I saw a documentary about naturalist people living in environmentally-friendly camps in the woods. Their mission in life was to pollute the environment as little as possible, so the women used Mooncups when on their period instead of pads and/or tampons.    People with a phobia about blood might struggle but I personally don't suffer from that so I would give them a try. Plus, I think dealing with one's own blood is easier than someone else's.    I can also identify with that dry feeling you can get when using tampons, especially near the end of your period when your menstrual flow is lighter. I could never use pads because they're so inconvenient and just plain uncomfortable, so I'm stuck with tampons, but I would definitely give the Mooncup a try.    Another benefit worth considering is that the Mooncup is 100% safe. Tampon-use has been associated with Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), which can be fatal. This is because a tampon is still a 'foreign body' being put inside your body. Regardless of the fact that the tampon was designed specifically for this, the vagina was never designed to have various fibres inserted in it for long periods of time. This is why TSS sometimes occur, though it is quite rare.    Consider the benefits and maybe give it a try! If you can find any for sale, that is!|`|RoqxGbgRaa	it's actually not new.  years ago, it was on the market, although it was probably a version from a different company.  i can picture the box, but i can't remember the name.    anyway, i tried it then.  i think i was in my early 20s.  it's a very soft, flexible, plastic cup that you press closed to insert.  when you close it, the width is actually narrower than a tampon.    you insert it the same way as you do an applicator-less tampon.  you use your finger to push it inside until it comes to rest behind the pelvic bone.  it's very smooth and it slides fairly easily, unlike tampons sometimes.    when you're ready to remove it, you insert a finger and pull down and out.  you dump the contents into the toilet, and wrap the cup in tissue and throw it away.    it was a totally new experience, but it wasn't altogether bad.  and it did help me to know my body better.      in some ways, it was better than a tampon or pad: more comfortable, less odor, fewer leaks, less trash, and fewer toilet clogging issues.      in some ways, it was more difficult.  the first few times inserting are tricky, like the whole tampon thing when you're a teenager.      also, let's just say you become even more intimate with the experience of menstruating...like actually pouring your blood into the toilet when you are ready to dispose of the cup.  how often do we do that, ladies?!    also, it might not be the most comfortable change to perform in a public restroom or in surroundings other than your own house.  you have to be completely comfortable, you know?|`|3CCIcS6Oaa	I didn't use the cup, but I used the sea sponge which you are supposed to reuse.. I'm sorry, but as much as I'm all about helping the environment, I couldn't do it!  I know it is a natural thing, but the odor from that and having to clean it wasn't fun at all.. But give it a try, you might like it....|`|To1nHfpuaa	oh my god! never even heard of them... but it sounds awful|`|EjyD1sXeaa	google it I thought it sounded horrible but I think it's actually quite neat, thank you|`|uiVEaxjqaa	No but now that I went and looked I would try it. They also have this thing that's less expensive because I looked and the cheapest one was $25 they have this thing called the soft cup its reusable and you can find them at drug stores ans its cheaper.|`|6qsocyK3aa	I've never used them but I'm tempted. The thing I dislike about tampons is that when you use them, tiny fibres are left inside you apparantly.|`|omwVzteaaa	saw it on a programme once not somthing i would like to use but each to there own. x|`|d43e96506445ef1b6b4ace4380a9a5b4aa	i'm sorry i dont care how environmentally friendly that is it's just gross!!! i'll stick with my landfill filling tampons tyvm!|`|ZCLbrSRlaa	That's just a fancy, newer way of saying a "menstrual cup." Its a rubberized cup that yea, exactly how you explained it. I do not use one of those, I think its weird and gross, I don't want a piece of rubber up me all day. It is better for the environment but that doesn't mean  everyone will use them. I wont for sure.|`|1ATMoQNeaa	That sounds so gross. Just stick to tampons and pads geeez... -_-|`|tnEIPjccaa	I have used something similar called the diva cup. I actually like it better than tampons. It didn't leave me with that strange dried out feeling I sometimes find with tampons, because it lets your vagina naturally lubricate itself while still catching all the mess. And once inside, when place properly, you can't even feel it. Also, you can wear it a lot longer than you can wear a tampon. It takes a little getting used to, simply because you have to have to get used to dumping it. What I really liked about it though, is I didn't have the problem I have with tampons when I wake up. sometimes on my heavier days, when I woke up in the morning and stood up to go to the bathroom, I'd get a gush of blood that no tampon could contain. The diva cup stood up nicely to this, and handled any clots well.|`|0emslEdiaa	I do use a cup.  My brand is the diva cup but there are also different brands like the moon cup and the lunette.  I've been using my diva for a year now and I love love love it.    It's not painful, it's not gross because it's a natural thing your body does.  There's no smell, no waste clogging up the toilet or rotting in the trash can.  There's more room in my purse and I save tons of money because I don't have to buy tampons every month.  They last up to ten years too.    Since this was never taught to us in health class or by our mothers, it's sometimes difficult for women to learn how to use a cup.  Some women have problems with leaking, others with comfort.  However, I believe the benefits greatly outweigh the difficulties.  If you want to get one, I suggest you visit all the web sites to see which one you would like to try.    The Diva cup has the largest capacity so if your flow is heavy, it's good.  The mooncup is slightly smaller.  The lunette is the smallest and recommended for teenagers and virgins.  Although all cups can be used by virgins without discomfort.
AA11993313	i think its more accepted for women because of porn. but for a man to act girlish is off-putting since men are supposed to be viral.  I'm not judging either les or gay men.|`|AA11971037	Well, for some people (like evangelical Christians) it is NOT okay for women to be lesbians and for men to be gay.  But, I agree that the general media in America tend to glorify female homosexuality vs. male sexuality.  I think that is because so many people find lesbian sex alluring, and therefore it gets a stamp of OK by a lot of people (mostly men).  At the same time, I think most straight men don't feel comfortable with the idea of male homosexuality (even if they're not offended, per se, by it), so they tend not to glorify it.      It's all part of the messed up American culture.  Not really about love or sensibility, but about sex AKA money.|`|56c4da157da3e4084dfbbc20810c7704aa	because in societies eyes girls are suppsed to be soft, and kind and loving and respectful, all of the nice things.  men are suppsed to be hard, hard working, unemotional, detached, rugged all of the tough things.    so because women are allowed to love and show love freely its ok for two women to love eachother   whereas with men, men are not supposed to be loving they are suppsed to be tough, and if they're tough there cannot be a relationship as there'd be no love or commitment etc.    it is just public view of what people are supposed to be.  its kinda like this... how many times have you seen a man cry during good soul finding sex in a movie? Yep. there u go, if there's no passion but just pure sex in men, they cannot love eachother, becase the feminine causes the relationship to be a whole.|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	Because society made it a double standard.|`|AA11887801	because people are ignorant and homophobic.  its not a sin to be gay or lesbian.  people should mind their own business.  i do think its easier for women to be lesbians and not get abused or hassled.  its sad|`|56d1fd0805f2375b62ed93980b908980aa	According to whom?

4e678a12039c72fd2bbfd026dbbc3c04aa	I am no doctor but what I was told that just one hit of acid is enough due to the fact that a small amount stays in some part of the brain and can cause unexpected flash back type of episodes even many years later.

Do you mean 12 tabs cumulatively? No, again, same thing, if you were insane from acid abuse, still, you would not be coherent enough to play Q&A on here.  So, no, you could not claim a mental disability because you are proving with every question and answer you provide, whether weird or not, that you are functioning and able to understand what is going on around you.  I would venture to say, that some of the most "famous" acid freaks in our poplular culture, probably had something else eating at them way before they started dropping acid, but still, it's not a road you want to go down.  Stay away from the stuff, ok?

Borderline pd is Hardly anyone had even heard of it.

Bipolar disorder is over-diagnosed. Psychologists just have to face that sometimes people develop unique life-coping conditions. Everyone is up and down, everyone is depressed and manic, everyone is angry and clam.... its a part of life. Psychiatry is the most over used health service in my opinion, who needs to go to pay 60 an hour to have some random doctor nod their head at you while you talk about problems, that's what friends are for. I think there's like thousands of conditions that psychiatry and psychology have just labelled.     Ok, some people do have chemical imbalances and stuff, but nothing that the brain can't cure with the appropriate thinking and behaviour patterns.    As for ADHD; doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned. Only a bunch of overly hormonal teenagers who aren't expressing themselves creatively or being active enough (like myself). That's all.|`|SsXNL74Aaa	na, i'd say borderline personality disorder is!
fDqCPBP3aa	The most important thing is to be sure to glide the blade LIGHTLY on your skin. Remember, the blade is sharp and your skin is tender.

NBpIM9paaa	omg okay just hang in there. I know what it feels like, coming from a 13 year old girl who knows what its like might make you understand more, because adults dont know half of what theyre talking about most of the time, even kids your age dont because they think they konw what depressed is.  I used to be like really happy and preppy too. I have friends,but im not like super popular, im basically just known for clowning around and getting in trouble haha. but its all a mask, realy inside im more sad than anyone can see which a lot of the time causes me to act out. My mom beats, me and verbally abuses me telling me how worthless i am, and how slutty i am "which im not" and she oculd go on and on with her insults. my dads never at home, hes always at work or out iwth some other girl. Im bipolar, and i have adhd. and its a struggle just to act normal. "the only way im not a total loser is because im pretty" the only things that make me happy are my animals. I cry so much, and i cut myself, and i know how it feels, it hurts, but it also feels like your releasing the pain. just recently , my mom found my cuts and took me to a psychiatrist. he ran blood tests on me and hes doing all this science stuff on me. I dont need that, i just need someone to talk to. And then i had to go to a counselor, and there she was, i didnt even know her but i started crying..sooo embaressingggg. Im never going back, i want somenoe my age to talk too, not an old lady lol. and ik ive had SOOO many thoughts of suicide, even attempts, but ive been told by so many peopel taht it always gets better and im just gonna give life a shot. At least there are some good times. And i think that always having something to look forward to helps A LOTTTTTTTT. And i know you want to give up, and i do too but i dont know if that will help to much...  and im being serious here..not just nice.. really if you want to talk about stuff, or just about the random things haha im right here.. you can email me.. juicyyy52@aol.com  i know i didnt hlep muchh   but thats cuz i have to go clean my room hahha.   but really, if you want to email me il check themm andddd we can talk =]] not to be creepy or anything cuz i know you dont know me hahahaaa but trust me im not some like 80 year old pedophil or whtever theyre called lol|`|G9VBTg47aa	You just gotta give it your time and figure yourself out man, no doctor's gonna tell you how to do that, there's no pills for that, it's a natural feeling and nothing wrong with it.|`|3d3d0hLIaa	get help! you will benefit from it|`|J2Rf0xQBaa	You need to talk to someone, especially if you are having thoughts of suicide.

gXne4VJcaa	Alot of girls do. Its something that you have to decide on your own. I do because I feel neat and cleaner not to mention my boyfriend really likes it. Do what makes you feel comfortable, if your young, you could always wait til you get older to try it.|`|hBmafVYoaa	Not sick at all. Lots of people do!|`|woOeYFrEaa	I really wouldn't do it.  You can get ingrown hairs, cut yourself, get razor burn all in a really sensitive place.    I trim mine and its more hygenic that way, but there is no reason to shave it all off.  Some girls do that because they think boys like it better (when having sex), but not all guys feel that way it sounds like you're no where near having sex so I'd defiitely wait.  I've always just trimmed, got married and asked my husband what he preferred and he really doesn't care so I just keep on trimming.    Do shave your legs all the way up where your underwear covers (also called bikini line), but you don't have to shave it all off.    If you want to trim, just sit on the toilet, take a small pair of scissors and cut it a little shorter.  You can also invest in something like a beard trimmer that makes it easier to cut it, but just start with scissors to see if you like it.|`|AA11181101	im 23 and i shave    more for the sexual side of my life, i havent found many guys that are really into a hairy muff, dont fret though if your not involved in a sexual relationship you do not have to worry|`|jtoxFsdYaa	There are arguments for and against shaving 'down there'. The arguments for are that it can improve hygiene, especially if you are a sporty person who gets a lot of exercise and is prone to sweating. If you are sexually active with more than one person, condoms will protect you from STDs but not the little critters that like to live 'down there, shaving will prevent that problem. Many find that if both male and female partners are 'au naturelle'in that area, then they experience heightened sensations during sex. However, the down sides to shaving are razor rash, which can be quite sore as can be the irritation caused by the stubble of re-growth. One way to avoid the rash and reduce the effects of stubble is to use proprietary depilation cream instead of a razor.     At the end of the day it is simply a matter of what suits you best.|`|HYrRkTjQaa	some do some dont. its no big deal really. as long as ur comfortable thn it doesnt matter. i do sometimes.|`|fVMzCP5raa	Most people shave (Y)|`|d6e7ddf8a43ce14679ba91ffde757a43aa	It's not sick, I find most women shave or trim it|`|9yZ4rYa6aa	It's an American thing which became popular through porn mostly, it's spread to Europe though - i'd say if you took a hand full of fully developed women, most wouldn't have pubes and would look like barbie dolls - as to whether or not you should, entirely you're choice.

If God put hair there he wants it to not be seen.|`|25b1af4d56107f6c49922f3fabfc43beaa	its not sick, alot of people do it... i do it just because i feel alot cleaner..  and alot of men love it smooth..|`|pAEDP1Z9aa	Aw it's not discusting in the slightest most men and women find it sexy.    I do and leave a small runway (so to speak). I prefer shaven as I find I feel cleaner (it isn't actually a cleaner thing to do) and less itchy. Plus it looks nice and neat.    Same again some of my friends do and some don't (they hippys who dont shave anything) it's up to you if you shave your under arms and legs why not your girly parts?    Why dont you do it and see, then if you dont like it well it all grows back.    :)
xy4z8bQraa	you can, your husband is an idiot. they function completly different and independently.tums function by converting the acid already in stomch into water and tagemet functions by causing your stomch to produce less acid, just dont take them on a full stomcach or you can get food poisening.

ORjjS1SZaa	Every creature needs to rest. Giraffes, little babies, elephants, dogs, cats, kids, koala bears, grandparents, moms, dads, and hippos in the jungle - they all sleep! Just like eating, sleep is necessary for survival.    Sleep gives your body a rest and allows it to prepare for the next day. It's like giving your body a mini-vacation. Sleep also gives your brain a chance to sort things out. Scientists aren't exactly sure what kinds of organizing your brain does while you sleep, but they think that sleep may be the time when the brain sorts and stores information, replaces chemicals, and solves problems.    The amount of sleep a person needs depends a lot on his or her age. Babies sleep a lot - about 14 to 15 hours a day! But many older people only need about 7 or 8 hours of sleep each night. Most kids between the ages of 5 and 12 years old are somewhere in between, needing 10 to 11 hours of sleep. Some kids might need more and some need less. It depends on the kid.    Skipping one night's sleep makes a person cranky and clumsy. After missing two nights of sleep, a person will have problems thinking and doing things; his or her brain and body can't do their normal tasks nearly as well. After five nights without sleep, a person will hallucinate (this means seeing things that aren't actually there). Eventually, it becomes impossible for the brain to give its directions to the rest of the body without sleep - the brain needs to spend time in bed and catch its ZZZs!|`|hFvEvkqoaa	-Sleep appears necessary for our nervous systems to work properly.  -Sleep is also the time when the body does most of its repair work; muscle tissue is rebuilt and restored.  -Sleep is also a time for restoring mental energy.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Cos the mind needs to rest.|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	the brain regroups and organizes and the body (organs) etc. get time to slow metabolism
RXI8ImdIaa	Yeah, look up restless leg syndrome. And make a doctor's appointment     :)|`|IYu3bBFqaa	depending on your age it could be symptomatic of  a growth spurt.  When the body grows at a rapid pace, it causes the muscles to stretch and can cause intense cramping and also twitching.|`|rctDnhO1aa	maybe you should look up restless leg syndrome
KJGmpphUaa	If you wonder, then it's probably a good idea to get checked.  Tell them the symptoms and they can do the appropriate tests.  Some tests won't pick up on certain things so it would be a good idea to be checked specifically.  They will probbly do a blood glucose test, I have had one of these.  You will have to drink a sugary liquid and they will check your blood hourly for a few hours so they can judge how you react to the drink.  I wouldn't be to worried right now, but get checked to be sure.|`|apXIw0ZJaa	I would go see your doctor. Diabetes CAN come up suddenly. And the symptoms happen within like a week or 2 of being diagnosed. Drinking lots IS a sign of diabetes. not water specifically but being extremly thirsty IS a sign of diabetes. The first answer if VERY correct the 2nd one was not at all. Good Luck!|`|Yaxdy8U2aa	yes....you should go back to the doctor....even though you got your blood tested and they said nothing was wrong.....because when they tested your blood they probrbly were not looking for ketones....which is something a diabetic would have in their blood if they didn't know they were diabetic.....|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Diabetes doesn't come upon you suddenly.  Unless your tests showed your blood sugar was higher than normal 3 months ago, you couldn't have it now.  Also, an increased need for drinking water is not a sign.|`|aW59AbDaaa	If your blood glucose was tested as part of the blood work that was done three months ago, then it's way too soon to go back for another test.  Quite frankly you would be in real danger of getting a reputation as a hypochondriac that your doctor doesn't need to take seriously.    Looking only at your symptoms, peeing 3-5 times a day is hardly what a diabetic would consider frequent.  Combine normal or even infrequent urination with a big thirst and the most logical explanation is that you are dehydrated.  That could also explain at least part of your weight loss.    My advice would change if you experience continuing weight loss and are not intentionally trying to lose weight.  If you lose 10-15 pounds for no apparent reason, you need to see a doctor to find out what is going on.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	check your blood sugar.

UbvBIDy6aa	I never had the problem until I had unprotected sex.I think it's the wetness from you and the pre-ejaculation from him,and most definitely if he's ejaculating in you.The only way to fix it is either not have unprotected sex or take a shower right after.If he's using a strong soap and you know that irritates you he could have given you a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis from the irritation.If it doesn't go away right away I would go get it checked by a doctor.|`|feUMAvgLaa	I wouldn't know sorry|`|GH0VZnGLaa	Try using summers eve wash I always wash myself with that down there and i rarely notice a smell unless i just got off of my period if it smells fishy it could be an infection and not all infections are std related such as a bacterial infection you can get those from just about anything..sitting on a dirty toilet seat. not wiping yourself the right way not cleaning yourself after having sex etc..|`|8kK6Fv97aa	if theres one thing i learned from health class its that this website is very useful for your and other kinds of question. hope this helps    here's a website that might answer your question    http://www.teengrowth.com/
ueJQpa1gaa	First off, Happy Birthday!     I myself just turned 19 years old on February 1st and would have to relate with you on this one. I know depressions a bad thing and all but I dont really consider it being depressed. Personally I think you're just more dissappointed, but I'm just concluding this from context and how I think about the way I felt for the past few years on my birthday.     Theres a lot of reasons that you could feel this way, possibly you had some really great birthdays when you were younger and your not ready to grow up. Were kind of at that age where were not children, so people dont try to please us as much as far as presents and partys go but at the same time we dont have children to please or throw birthday partys for.    The best advice I could think to give you right now is just think about all the people that called/text you a happy birthday and be happy for what you have and knowing they care. I hope this helped, when I thought about it I cheered up alot.|`|piJi29Traa	Happy Birthday (!)    To all those who were so unkind in their answers, get over yourselves. Nobody's perfect, so if you have nothing constructive to say, shut the hell up.    Your birthday is a time of reflection, a time to realise what is important to you, a time to think about where your life is going. It is often a time that these feelings will come up, and my advice is to indulge yourself in them to work them out of your system. Don't let them build unchecked into something more troubling, acknowledge that you feel crappy and KNOW that it will pass just like it has done before. Why shouldn't you have an off day? Everybody does. It just happens to be your birthday that sets it off. You don't HAVE to be happy. Just be yourself.    Hope the rest of your day gets a little better, and if not, there's always tomorrow. Happy Birthday!|`|G9VBTg47aa	Did you remember to take you happy pills? Keep takin' em, cos Frank might show up.. Darn bunny won't leave me alone these days, keeps sayin' the world's gonna end on the 21st of december 2012, and he tells me to do things...|`|cjKPEHaFaa	I know exactly how you feel!  It's like you're expected to have a great birthday, and you feel pressure to be happy and excited about it.  I don't know where you live, but I live in the northeast US and my birthday is also in the dead of winter; no one can be expected to be happy when the ground is covered in ice and it's 2 degrees outside!  We're getting older and birthdays are less exciting and fun, but for some reason we think they should remain so.      I hope your mood improves and you're able to enjoy the last bit of your birthday :)|`|iybezfi6aa	Sounds a little immature.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	Come on!  You're 22.  And, the days not over yet...  You never know what might happen.|`|FkFKDpt5aa	happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday to ben happy birthday to you    btw your birthday is the most popular birthday date in my life i know 4 people born on the 5th, my bday in 21 days.     i know how u feel bdays dont feel the same anymore like they once did i suffer from depression and anxiety so its 10x worse|`|AA10192697	I was depressed this year. Not because I"m 38 now but because I get the typical card and dinner from my parents and a phone call from one of my brothers.  That's it. Oh and $5 from my grandma.  My son didn't wish me happy birthday or do anything. My other brother hasn't sent me a card in years nor calls. And I send him one all the time.    But I don't look forward to my birthdays because it's just another day for me.  No big deal.  I do think of my mother on my brithday though. Having given birth to me. I tear up on that thought. But otherwise it's just a day for me.  I don't understand the concept of getting presents because you were born.  But many people like that stuff.    Maybe next year instead of waiting to see if anyone will remember, invite some friends out for your birthday. Invite them 1 week ahead of time and just say you'd like to be with friends on that day to have fun. They don't even need to bring a gift, just laughter and smiles.    I understand but after 38 yrs now I'm use to it.  I took my son and I out to see Mall Cop a week after my birthday because I wanted to see it.  OTher than that I bought beads with the $5 from my grandmother.|`|8HgNvgu6aa	SHut up your young shut up your alive be thankful      happy birthday|`|169ukxC4aa	awwwwwww  sorry dont have the solution 4 dat   and.....

I just got out of the military and relocated to California.  I left my friends in Japan and Texas.  I've been unemployed since May of last year.  It sucks, and even when I did have friends, I never celebrated my birthday because they were always working and nobody could ever make huge plans with me.  Oh, well, happy birthday anyway.|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	Next year celebrate a birthday week and you're bound to have some good days therein.
1y1c5QWHaa	It depends on the store and the pill, but you should be able to purchase the pills. Even more likely you will be able to purchase them if:  they're herbal  they're non-addictive (meaning they're really really hard to get addicted to)  they can be taken be adults and children (meaning people under the age of twelve)  and stuff like that.    Hope this helps you!|`|RXI8ImdIaa	I'm not aware of any anti-anxiety pills that are available OTC in the u.s.a.    Perhaps you are somewhere else? Or maybe it's an herbal supplement?    If it's an herbal, those are totally unregulated. If it's a drug, then it depends on the policy of the store. I'd assume that most pharmacies would refuse to sell that to a minor, but that's up to them.|`|IYu3bBFqaa	I am not sure there is anything that you need to buy at a pharmacy at the age of 14 without a parent present, this question sounds like you are up to no good!|`|wtQY6VEwaa	You should be able to buy over the counter medication at any age, as far as I know. But I don't think there is an anti-anxiety pill that is available OTC. You'll need to get a perscription from a doctor.|`|AA10287830	You are allowed to buy non prescription pills but I don't think you will find anything for anxiety that works that isn't a prescription.

AA10343094	wisdom teeth do usually come in later than that- closer to 16-19. that's why they're called wisdom teeth. it's not uncommon for them to come in sooner though. once they start to come in, you should go to your dentist and get a referral to go to an oral surgeon to get them removed. they really do stop hurting then.    for now, i recommend taking two aleve- advil- or tylenol to ease the pain, and putting ice on for twenty minutes on and twenty minutes off. it will help to ease your pain until you can see your dentist. once you get them out, it's a one time procedure. you never have to have it done again. they give you some painkillers, so that it doesn't hurt too badly. i wish you the best!|`|3aa9a5a5b72b2abdc0c9e26a9dfe1c5faa	i am 15, just turned 15 in fact. i have been in pain from my wisdom teeth for about 6 months now.. i know.. it hurts.. i just drink cold stuff and swish it around in there. and i take some pain medication. just the other day, it was so bad, i had to go to the dentist, and they have to pull mine out on the 16 th.   so i would say that you arent young at all to get them.|`|g9DWi0DKaa	well its not very common but it is possible it happend 2 my older sis she was 13 when she gt them through|`|qzqDEH7raa	they probably aren't wisdom teeth, as when i thought the same and it really hurt etc.. when i went to the dentist, it turned out they were only back,back teeth if you get me - the ones in front of wisdom teeth.and if you still worry, check in the mirror - 1 have 3 molars ('backteeth') on each side. If you see a fourth appearing it might well be wisdom teeth but try checking with your parents. They proably know. you can also ask an orthodontist for an appointment for a check and ask if they are wisdom teeth or just another set of molars.    hope i helped!! :)|`|fmSuzK2Aaa	you need to go see your dentist as soon as possible. mine started hurting at 14 and my parents thought i was crazy because they thought i was too young but they finally gave in and took me to the dentist and the teeth were gone within a month... try using salt water - it helps tissues to heal and might help to soothe your gums. also use advil or other pain reliever/anti-inflammatory medication until you can get to your dentist and he can check what is going on. good luck! feel better!
fDqCPBP3aa	It's all will power.  As an aid, to keep your mouth busy, you may try gum, but it is really your own self control.|`|VtJBwAOraa	Realize that no sexy, classy girl like myself would ever get with you because of that..|`|kU66m5QRaa	start smoking|`|W6SsAHz0aa	lol at that ho ^|`|6857hnxjaa	i would see if there is a medication for addictive personalities.

mSUKfQ5haa	The bowflex is mostly a marketing phenomenon. Thats why you never see it in any fitness clubs or exercise equipment shops. They rely on their infomercials to sell you, if you tried it first most people wouldnt like it.  Despite what they tell you in the commercials its not necessarily for building muscle anyway, they promote a low impact exercise program with short breaks in between reps. People who like the bowflex are those who are not really that ambitious they just wanted a mild way to lose a few pounds. Besides the bowflex alone would cost you well over $1000 and you will probably not like it anyway.     The best way to accomplish what you are looking for is with a multi purpose bench press, a 7 ft Olympic bar, a curl bar and some cast iron olympic weights. This way you can do all of the core exercises to build your upper body. You should work your lower body also or you will start to look and feel awkward. You might want to get a power rack also for squats. The equipment should last a lifetime and you can get it all for about a thousand bucks shipping included. It could fit in a garage of extra bedroom. You can get great deals for free weights on line but be careful where you shop because there is a profound difference in price depending on how they ship the free weights. Make sure they are using a freight carrier, not UPS  You could get everything within 10 business days of ordering.      To work your abs you can just do crunches everyday, or buy an ab machine for 2 or 3 hundered. I attached a good link where you could get some price quotes.|`|AA10563860	simly buy a exercise ball an adjustable weight bench, and an assortment of dumbells.    You can do wall squats with the dumbells in your hand while leaning against the ball on the wall.    you can do all bench moves (inc/flat/decline) with a good adjustable bench.    You can do abs on the ball.    You might even buy a BOSU stability platform to do all of your exercises and some new ones.    Dont waste the money or space on a big gym contraption.  THey are very expensive anyway.

L6XwTAIYaa	Wikipedia says, "Impaired fasting glycaemia or impaired fasting glucose (IFG) refers to a condition in which the fasting blood glucose is elevated above what is considered normal levels but is not high enough to be classified as diabetes mellitus. It is considered a pre-diabetic state, associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of cardiovascular pathology, although of lesser risk than impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). IFG sometimes progresses to type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is a 50% risk over 10 years of progressing to overt diabetes. A recent study cited the average time for progression as less than three years."  What is going to determine whether it takes 3 years or 10 years to get there is how well you follow a strick regime of diet & exercise.  The Diabetes Association has changed their diet plan in recent years. Now, they're more concerned with carboyhdrates than with sugars.  Eat a simple diet with protein and plain vegetables and raw fruits & no breads.  Avoid fruit juices.  Raw fruit is better because it takes longer to digest.  Once you've hit the pre-diabetic phase, it can turn into diabetes almost overnight.  you'll need to eat lighter meals more often in order to keep up your energy level.  I keep cashews in my purse.  When I'm feeling weak eating a handful of them keeps me from getting weak and fainting.  Do not grab a candy bar or soda as many people do. You'll feel good only for a little while then you'll start to feel sick.  The diet and treatment for pre-diabetic is the same as for a diabetic.  Don't eat too much food.  Keep it light and healthy.  Check your blood sugar 2 to 3 times a day and learn what range it's in when you're feeling really good.|`|apXIw0ZJaa	I found this by searching google and it seems very helpful! Check it out! Good Luck    http://www.aafp.org/afp/20040415/1961.ht...|`|LmicIEOxaa	Insulin's job in our bodies is to carry sugar from our blood stream into the cells where it is turned into energy and used by our bodies. If you have impaired insulin response, your insulin does not carry sugar out of your blood steam as well as it should. The result is that your blood stream has too much sugar, a condition which is an indication of borderline diabetes. Because too much sugar hangs around in your blood, it can stay there and damage your artery and capillaries, increasing your risk for heart disease and stroke. You should start eating ad exercising as though you are a full blown diabetic to keep this condition under control.|`|g9u9suPxaa	Hey Girl!!!!!! I know exactly how you feel.I am in the same situation for 1-2 years now. Does the doctor have you on a pre-diabetic pill called metformin? If the doctor said that your pank-re-is was putting out to much insulin then you probably will be put on the pill if you ain't all ready and you will be pre-diabetic. If she said your pank -re -is is NOT putting enough insulin in your body then the chances are you have type 1 diabetes or type 2 depending on what your blood tests reads. The term glucose means sugar levels. The word impaired means unusual. Also fasting usually means going without food or water but in your case it means the range of your sugar. Another words the way your glucose responds to different sugar levels. I HOPE THIS HELPS I MAY BE WRONG ABOUT THE FASTING BUT I AM PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT IT'S RIGHT AND PLEASE DON'T BE WORRIED EVERYTHING WILL BE OK. YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

Look into the raw food diet,  you don't have to be 100% raw, but raw food can really help to stabilise your blood sugar. If you can, borrow 'Green for Life' by Victoria Butenko from the library, and try to read it all.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	You're diabetic, lose the sugar.  Get a glucose meter & check your blood sugar regularly.  Check on your upper arm, it doesn't hurt.

rIxA3xs9aa	If you have plucked your eyebrows a lot, you could have damaged the follicles, stopping the hairs from growing back.  This happened to me when i was trying to grow fuller eyebrows, only some hairs would grow back.    You should probably ask a professional if this is worrying you.|`|8HDQMkSBaa	Guess you wont have to plush them anymore|`|JSh5ZFhUaa	Well since you plucked them so  much they stopped growing you shouldn't have plucked them so much|`|TWW5DGttaa	It's probably not a balding thing, my eyebrows and eyelashes started falling out around age eighteen. They are still there now but they are scarce. My eyelashes have started to very slowly grow back in but my eyebrows are still going. I have to use a little brwon eyeliner for them and then just say i got really thin eyebrows when people ask. As far as I know there's not a lot you can do about it. Maybe try a balding treatment?|`|pzCWpNFoaa	Hi I had the same problem and what I know is that it takes a full 8 weeks to regrow your full eyebrow and also drink avocado oil and try putting it on your eyebrows. Stop plucking for a long amount of time and then wait and see what the results are.|`|qFOdHHCDaa	You've probably damaged the hair follicles so much, that they won't grow back anymore... i don't think you can fix it, try filling your eyebrows in with an eyebrow pencil
Jwk7Ib2vaa	Simply put, no. the easiest way, aside from going to the doctor's office. Is giving blood. If you are old enough to give blood and weigh enough, just do it. For one, it can really help someone out, and for two, after a few days you can go online and see a printout of your cholesterol, blood type, and other useful things.  Hope this helps.|`|l1p5M0Q8aa	no.  you know when you go to the doctor for a check up and they prick your finger to take blood out?  thats how you type your blood. you have to go and get another prick in your finger.    thats at least what my doctor told me like 2 months ago.|`|bSqzbDPFaa	donate blood theyl send you a card with your blood type on it thats how i found out what mine was
aecb87753b7a91041ba0f8e18327da41aa	my wisdom tooth took four (believe it!) years to come out. every four or five months another tiny bit would grow out, it hurt the hell out of me for a couple of days, then it calmed down, and then it started again after a few months, until the whole (miniature) thing was finally out.  and it felt like i had an open wound in my mouth, my gum hurt, my tongue hurt, my ckeek hurt, my throat hurt, i could hardly speak or swalow.   i guess it's normal, it will eventually go away.|`|4f1cbfa34b402b1148dfd002cafaeff2aa	i remember being in a lot of pain when mine came in. I would be in tears. the best thing to do it get them removed
MhpccWpmaa	If I were you I would just not take them for the rest of the month and get a new pack to start the sunday after your next period starts, like you did this time. Starting to take them again now after you've been off for four days might make you bleed and they probably wouldn't be affective until you started the next pack anyways.  For them to prevent maxiumum protection, you have to take all of them|`|Q7uzVqGtaa	if you have the instructions still you can find the answer in that, it always tell you what to do if you miss pills and it also has different instructions depending on how many pills you've missed, also if you have lost the instructions go ahead and look online they will have the same instructions. but mine said to double up two days in a row to catch up and then start taking them normaly and then use protection for the next 7 days
rcdTluUjaa	I would say it's just a scratch, if you are on the pill and taking it regularly you should be fine, of course there is always that .01% possibility so if you miss your monthly take a test, other than that tell your bf to trim his nails, and be more gentle the last thing you need is an infection down there.
2RkDecZwaa	I have really bad anxiety and the same thing happens to me. For me, I get panic attacks. I dont know if this happens to you. But Ill look at things and see them almost as if Im on drugs. I get a strange feeling and after seeing things strangly is when I start to have an anxiety attack. I know this doesnt help much, but just know youre not alone? I guess.|`|G9VBTg47aa	It's your 6th sense I would say, of course "science" will say there's something wrong with you...|`|KeeaVzxpaa	Depression and anxiety can cause all sorts of different sensation, even hallucinations. Muscles in the ears ans eyes can pull and distort vision and balance. Symptoms overlap between different conditions but it takes a multitude of symptoms to qualify as a specific disorder. I don't think you are anything bit depressed and anxious.
XYNCbMwQaa	You could have a bladder infection, and maybe even a kidney infection.    Usually when you get the chills it means you have a fever, which means you have an infection. You need to go to a doctor.     I had something like this before and I waited forever. It turned out I had a kidney stone and it caused not only a bladder infection but a pretty bad kidney infection too! It could have been treated if I had gone to the Dr. sooner, but since I waited so long, I had to pee it out! (ouch) and then get on tons of medicine.|`|rcdTluUjaa	Those are pretty broad symptoms, that can indicate several things, UTI pregnancy, Kidney infection, or diabetes. Generally though with an infection you will run a fever and with a kidney infection it can be high. diabetes wouldn't generally cause back pain or chills. Pregnancy could cause all of the above. I think your going to have to see your doctor, for a more definate answer.|`|OaJ2bFl2aa	it could be a sign of diabetes. im sure its nothing but go to a doctor no harm in that|`|V6dz395kaa	Idk... maybe u should see a doctor...|`|a8wrGXQAaa	That sounds EXACTLY like a urinary tract infection. I've had about three in the past six months because I don't take in enough liquids. You should either see a doctor, or drink lots of liquids. Cranberry juice, especially.|`|8x1m3T5Taa	maybe ur pregnant. Go to the doc|`|g2cYsy4Caa	I know the back pain and the constant urination are signs of a Urinary Tract Infection

You should really see a dermatologist, it is actually a form of fungal infection and needs to be treated with prescription medication. If it isn't rosacea, you can find out how else to reduce the redness.|`|miNKdNauaa	Aveeno's calming line works pretty well when used consistently, and it's not terribly expensive at all. It's pretty readily available, as well.     Try to figure out what causes it, or makes it worse, and what condition it might be. Dermatology websites will be able to help you narrow down product types.    Best of luck!|`|TgJZ9XJFaa	I personally think pale skin and rosey cheeks is really nice, dont cover up who you really are.  Better than looking like a fake tangerine.  xxxxxx|`|6857hnxjaa	I used to fight that too.  I am VERY pale.  You can see the blue veins in my arms.      My boyfriend is Cuban (mostly Spaniard) and looks mostly white though is darker haired and darker skinned.      He loves pale guys.    Which means, that there must be other 'darker' skinned guys that love pale girls SO embrace your paleness.    Don't tan and stuff cause it will just make you 'age' faster and make your skin look terrible.    We are in our 30s trust me.|`|1QLp7iC5aa	roseacia? depends on why your cheeks are red! Are you irish? lol...thats where my non-stop blush comes from!|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	First, check with your doctor to see if you have rosacea.    If not, see if you can find a green foundation tint.  The better department stores used to sell it as a part of their makeup lines.  Green neutralizes red.  The one I used was a very light lotion, and it did reduce the appearance of red in my complexion.    Good luck!|`|giCUEYsJaa	You should make an appointment with a dermatologist.  You very well may have rosacea.  An auto-immune disorder, that can be treated if caught early.    I have it and was prescribed "Metrogel" that I use at night, just on my cheeks.  My redness was reduced dramatically within a month.    The dermatologist can also recommend a good green based face concealor you can buy over the counter.  The green base covers the red and then you use your face foundation on top of the green base.      Sounds odd I know, but it works!    Good Luck!|`|frItAvRhaa	I dont know about reducing it, but in terms of makeup as someone said green-tinted/based foundations to balance it out, or Benefit Cosmetics do a yellow stick called You're Bluffing which is great for covering red blotches or a correcting powder "Bluff Dust" http://www.benefitcosmetics.co.uk/gp/pro...|`|DCuOzYAMaa	You might have rosatia.

AAgX0SDcaa	cut back or eliminate dairy products and sugars, they are mucus-forming. if it is in your sinuses, you can do a nasal wash with a saline solution, and take hot showers.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	wash your hands well, drink lotsa water, use a nasal rinse, try Mucinex or Claritin, & see your doctor.|`|0uvgAKSZaa	you can try out Mucinex, (over the counter drug)|`|7i1rPTPwaa	take some mucinex to break up the mucus in your lungs and cough it up. if the problem persists for a week then you may need to go on antibiotics.

If they're spread out (and there are some on other parts of your body) you may have chicken pox.
UcYJeOBOaa	I was going through the same thing you are.... I was addicted to porn and to masturbating. People say that this is a good thing... but i felt the same as you- it gets old and it has bad effects.     I just tried every time to watch less and masturbate less. It was impossible for me to stop all the way. Then I just did it a little less and less and I just kinda grew out of it. I still watch porn and masturbate but not nearly as much as I used to. If you feel that you need to... walk out of your room.... hang out with your family or friends. If its not too much, try to get a girlfriend, or just hang with friends more. Maybe more sports or activities. Thats what I did and it gets rid of the hornyness. Lol.... good luck!    I couldn't stop right away. Little by little it got better. Now I still masturbate and watch porn (I consider it healthy and normal) but I'm not addicted.

One of the benefits of sexual release is stress relief.    What I run into is usually Dudes who are trying to quit masturbating, are doing it because of religious guilt that someone is trying to lay on them...The guilt thingy just gets you hooked into all kinds of emotional and addictive disorder cycle patters of trial and failure, until you loose a healthy perspective on reality, self worth and loss of appreciation toward your body which was wonderfully made.

Pmb0MeB8aa	It used to be the the vast majority of vases of MRSA were hospital acquired, like yours might have been. These days because of the prevalence of it, most cases are communally acquired. I don't remember the statistics, but that's the way it is now. Of note is that while yes, MRSA is transferred through body fluids, that is NOT the only way it is transferred.    MRSA is a very antibiotic resistant form of a bacteria that lives on our whole body. It can be spread by something as simple as touch. MRSA lives all over our body, especially notably in the nose and under the finger nails. Many people are walking around with it (like you may very well be...just because you aren't currently infected, like you said, you could be a carrier). MRSA doesn't cause any problems while you have it until it gets into an opening, like a cut or a scratch.    So in terms of where she got it? She could have gotten it from you. She could have gotten it from the family pet (if there is one, like a dog or cat), because if you had it and touched the dog, the dog now could have it too. She could have gotten it at school from a friend who got it from a parent, or at dance lessons by the same route. MRSA is terribly contagious, and it probably won't be long before EVERYONE has it.     Just make sure she takes her antibiotics to completion. They may also prescribe some Bactroban ointment to put inside of the nose for a period of time, usually 2x daily for 5-10 days. After the course of antibiotics, it may be worth it for you and her to get a nasal swab for MRSA.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	MRSA is caused by direct contact -meaning she could have caught the infection by touching a door handle.  it is tricky to treat, so follow up with an infectious disease specialist & be sure the rest of the family is safe.|`|PuVgZiddaa	the baltimore city area is having huge problems with this disease also i was reading a news paper article and also watching the news. they stated that most of the time this disease is contracted in hospitals out patient clinics school, day cares and anywhere else where allot of people are in close knit groups for several hours at a time.  this disease was originally thought to be only involved with people using IV needles but this was changed after further research last year at John Hopkins University.   search the disease online i am sure you will get allot more info there|`|ZVP7348Naa	she had sex...

RzW3FIbeaa	this happened to me last week.  it's only temporary and it should subside in a couple of days. what I did was roll my neck in a circular motion slowly everyday. also massage it gently.     I found the reason that I got this was the war I slept. Change the position of your pillows so that it supports your neck and relieves the strain. The knot might continue to be there until you put less strain while you're sleeping.|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	have yu tried massagin it with warm oil.?  do thatif yu havent& take to ibeprofen[sp]  if it isnt better in 2 days i'd go see a specialist.
87pV5lvZaa	Taking birth control pills can DEFINITELY lower your libido.  Both my friend and I experienced much the same drop in sex drive when we started taking the pill.  Like you, we went from craving sex from morning until night to barely ever being in the mood.  At first, we both thought we were simply tired from starting new jobs or having a mild flu, but it lasted for months.  Actually, my husband approached me in the same way your fiance did; he was concerned about my health and wondering if I were no longer attracted to him.  As neither of these were concerns, he and I decided that I should stop taking birth control.  As annoying as condoms can be, they are a non-hormonal method of preventing pregnancy.  I've only been off of the pill for a short time, but I have already seen an improvement.  We've gone from having sex about once a week to three to four times a week.    If you aren't satisfied with your sex drive, then talk to your doctor about switching birth control medications.  Some pills may not have negative effects on your libido.  Also, you could switch to condoms, which would prevent any type of hormone from interfering with your system.    One more thing: Keep in mind that you had a baby mere months ago.  The exhaustion of caring for another human being's daily needs could definitely sap your energy and make you too tired to be "in the mood."  Talk to your doctor about this, too.  Maybe he/she can offer pointers for jump-starting your sex life after giving birth.    Take heart.  There are options and resources available to you.  I have faith that you will find the answer to your problem.|`|Xrvutzmdaa	DONT HAVE SEX UNTIL YOUR MARRIED|`|rcdTluUjaa	I think you should see your doctor if it is painful, I don't know what all that can be symptoms of, but it shouldn't hurt. You might also try switching birth controls, it could be that the one you are on is killing your sex drive. Maybe even try switching to condoms or a diaphragm for a while and see if that helps.|`|uiVEaxjqaa	Maybe you need to get your self turned on more like so it can get more wet. Or try a lubricant.|`|1H3IsHmLaa	No longer having the desire to have sex sounds like a hormonal problem to me, the pain though, would be something different. Make sure that your well lubricated before penetration, if your not, tearing occurs which can cause pain when u urinate, like a stinging sensation. Other possibility of the pain could be a yeast infection. I would see your OB/GYN and tell him/her your syptoms, or just call and speak with a nurse. Good luck hon!|`|Cha4lyL9aa	The best advice, would be c a doctor.  When u were pregnant did u suffer pelvic pain?  I had SPD or gridle pain as they calll it. when carry both my children, although the only cure is child birth. I still ache sometimes whilst havin intercourse with my husband and certain positions i cant do and if he goes in too deep it hurts me too. But also have PCOS which does cause discomfort. I have terrible PMS systems. which puts me off sex.     It could also be, its hard feeling sexy, when all day ur looking after ur child and keeping a house tidy, being a mother takes over and it doesnt stop once ur child in bed sleeping.      Once u start a family sex naturally can be last thing on the list of things u feel u want or need, sometimes u do jst want hugs just feel appreicated and loved in other ways.  I wouldnt worry too much that will make it worse makes u more tense. Relax and let go. But c a doctor because it could be somethin more but most likely treatable.|`|zz982Znjaa	Hm..maybe you got an STD and you should go to the doctor and get checked out.

It hurts after ive had sex and then when i wee. I think its just from where your vagina has beeen stretched if you get me. exspecially if your partner is big.

I'm off of it now, and on Yaz and still hurts & I never feel like having sex at all, I have lost the desire too, It's horrible.. I also cannot do it in certain positions. I've been to the doctor about it, and they said I had a yeast infection but I've taken plenty of meds and it hasn't helped at all. What does your pain feel like? And where does it hurt? (At the beginning or throughout the whole sex)|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	Im also 23 and Im in the same situation. It seemed as if once I had my daughter and went back on the pill it threw my whole mojo off. I also experience pain in certain positions..so I know exactly where you come from. I went to a gyno a little after my daughter was born and she told me that my husband and I just need to take our time ( i.e. let the man take care of YOU in the bedroom for a change) and to use a lubricant. Neither helped. I've still yet to come to a conclusion. My new doctor tells me that Im too young to have these sorts of hormonal problems, she says its probably mental...so I'm looking into it....    So, check out with your gyno and see what she suggests. Good luck!

This surge period is called systolic. It is the first number in a blood pressure reading. After the surge period, your heart rests briefly and expands in preparation for another beat. This expansion period is called diastolic. It provides the second number in a blood pressure reading. Thus, a blood pressure reading of "120 over 80" means you have a systolic pressure of 120 and a diastolic pressure of 80.     Doctors generally agree that systolic readings of 120 to 140 and diastolic readings of 70 to 90 are normal. Low blood pressure, on the other hand, can cause dizziness or fainting, especially when you first stand up.    Blood pressure varies with the time of day and the amount of stress you're experiencing. To determine your average or typical blood pressure, your doctor may therefore ask you to take readings at various times during the day.|`|AA10954696	perfectly normal BP. the symptoms r related to something else check with ur doc.|`|fccbeede60dcdce2690a63584db3434faa	u r perfectly alright.   u dont get these symptoms due to blood pressure problems at this age. dont worry about them. rather eat well|`|0817655303781d1a57a4800a31dc038aaa	That is a little low.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_press...|`|14e85c00d38098c85b61830aa8e9c72baa	it means your blood pressure is normal    as far as your problem about light-headedness and dizziness, it means your blood pressure may not be normal all the time, particularly when standing up real fast from getting up.  It's called orthostatic hypotension, and it's very common.  When the blood pools in your legs or large veins after you've been sitting for a while or laying down, when you get up abruptly pressure drops in your arteries.  Your heart compensates by increasing heart rate, but this doesn't always make up the difference.    The result is a lack of adequate blood flow to the brain momentarily and all of the symptoms you described.  Since you're female, you have a higher risk of being anemic as well, which also contributes to this problem.  It's fairly common, but go see a doctor about it, as he may want to run some additional tests.

SALUDOS.|`|c8aecd31db713dcf762a23b76cb135a5aa	La deshidratacin es la prdida excesiva de agua, que no ha sido repuesta, de un cuerpo. Puede producirse por estar en una situacin de mucho calor (sobre todo si hay mucha humedad), ejercicio intenso, falta de bebida o una combinacin de estos factores.    Para evitarla se debe beber agua o bebidas isotnicas como la limonada alcalina, no es muy recomendable beber bebidas muy azucaradas, como las de cola, o por lo menos es aconsejable alternarlas con agua. Es conveniente beber antes de tener sed, si la bebida "entra bien" es que el cuerpo necesita agua. La sed no aparece hasta que se ha perdido un 1% del agua del cuerpo. Esta deshidratacin ms leve que se produce incluso aunque se tenga toda el agua que se quiera. Se denomina deshidratacin voluntaria. La deshidratacin voluntaria se reduce o incluso se elimina por completo con las bebidas isotnicas.    Aunque se pensaba que era mejor beber traguitos cortos, ahora se recomienda beber tragos grandes porque se absorbe ms rpido. La causa es que un volumen grande en estomago acelera el vaciado gstrico. De todos modos el agua en el estmago no debe molestar durante el ejercicio.    Los sntomas de la deshidratacin, aparte de la sequedad de las mucosas que provoca la sed, pueden ser: nuseas, falta de fuerza o disminucin del rendimiento, fatiga mental y fsica, y al pellizcar la piel sin clavar la u?a se queda la marca.    Para disminuir la cantidad de agua eliminada, los ri?ones concentran ms la orina e incluso la que se encuentra en la vejiga se puede reconcentrar an ms. La orina se puede concentrar hasta producir solo 500ml al da, pero su produccin no decrece con una mayor deshidratacin una vez pasado este punto. Cuando la deshidratacin se vuelve ms extrema el ri?n falla y ya no produce ms orina, con lo que los desechos se van acumulando. Aunque pueda no parecerlo, el sudor puede suponer mayor prdida de agua que la orina.    La deshidratacin desaparece rpidamente, gran parte de sus sntomas desaparecen en media o una hora despus de beber agua sin ninguna limitacin, incluso con deshidrataciones de hasta el 10% del peso corporal.|`|57ac54cd8dccc3e164d4cbe366e4a9c0aa	es el hecho de perder liquidos en el cuerpo ya sea por falta de consumo en por largas jornada de trabajo o por una enfermedad como lo puede ser una diarrea en el segundo caso lo mejor es usar un suero  intravenoso y supervision medica|`|b3712188213db84146d93f890a34d759aa	Es la falta de liquido en tu cuerpo|`|202e048e1b0581c9fd8e1b743cf1872caa	Primero me gustara comentarte que el 60% del cuerpo humano adulto es agua y en un bebe el 90%, de modo que una deshidratacin es prdida del ser humano.

Para evitarla se debe beber agua con electrolitos tipo Pedialyte o Gaytored, son bebidas que tienen una serie de electrolitos equilibrados, para proveeer al organismo de los que ha perdido.

She paid 25% of the price she was quoted in America.    Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India They arrange Dental surgery, jaw surgery, lasik eye surgery, Dental Implants etc for foreign patients in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and magazines- about their patient stories.  They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low cost, as dental and eye surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.    http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com  Hope this helps.

Environmental and psychological factors play an important role in insomnia and curing insomnia requires finding out the basic reason for lack of sleep. Treatment options include natural treatment, medications, exercises and dietary regulations.    Many things can relieve insomnia, which include having a good health and a comfortable lifestyle. Adequate exercise in the form of skipping, jogging, aerobics etc along with watching what you eat is essential. Although it is better not to exhaust your body at night and neither should you overeat before you hit the sack. Having a feeling of control over your life is vital for you to sleep peacefully. Also the environment of your bedroom should be conducive for you to sleep in, such as dim lit, quiet environment along with a comfortable room temperature. Also, holistic approach can be tried. Yoga and other forms such methods aim at creating a healthy body and sound mind. Drinking milk is also a good alternative before sleeping. For children and teens, barley and oat milk works wonders. Another method is to enforce positive thoughts in your mind by speaking to yourself, as this improves your overall personality buildup as well.    Certain drugs and medications can also help you tide over insomnia, although self-medication should never be considered. Since insomnia is just a symptom, by taking drugs, you are not treating the condition as such. People with psychological conditions are difficult to treat for insomnia. In these cases, drugs are essential as sedatives also help in relaxing the patient. Behavioral pattern and developmental disorders can also affect your sleep pattern. Thus for a treatment to take complete effect, it may be required to take behavioral therapy sessions for a regular period. If the above things are kept in mind, it is not difficult to treat insomnia and thus lead a normal comfortable life.

The best advice is just to let her know that you are there for her whenever she needs your support, or even just a shoulder to cry on. Try to EMPATHISE (not sympathise) with her as she suns the rollercoaster of emotions and hormones. Let her know that you still find her beautiful (and I don't mean try and come on to her) as she may not be feeling like she is still attractive to you.    But most of all, ask HER what she needs from you, keeping the communication lines open between you. And don't forget to look after yourself as well, as you will be no good to her if you burn out in the process.
f8mLpPXlaa	yeah it could just be your asthma but if the wheezing seems to be localized, especially to the area of the broken rib I'd get a chest x ray just to be sure. I'm sure if you call your doctor's office they can handle an order for the x ray over the phone.Of course if your usual meds aren't working to relieve the wheezing then go to the ER.  Who diagnosed your broken rib? They should have gotten a chest x ray at that time to see if the rib was displaced and in any danger of puncturing a lung.  Good luck and God bless.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Lung collapse can happen any time - even without a broken rib.  I would have somebody listen to your lungs.

ZZHFemQfaa	No,i wouldn't recommend you see your GP at the moment. Although, 14lbs in 3 weeks is impressive! :)  it is possible to lose that kind of weight if you consumed alot more calories before such as 1500-2000. The dramatic loss in weight could be caused by the dramatic loss in calories consumption.its only natural. But if the weight keeps coming off and you end as a size 6 then i would go and see a GP for a check up.  But the main thing is that you stay healthy and eat lots of fruit and vegetables.|`|wZCRyx51aa	Hi there it could just be you have been so busy and forgot to eat or if your stressed or worried about somethin this could reduce your appetite.

If Albuterol doesnt work then mabey your asthma isnt as sereve as you think and you may not need it.  Try Flomax 110mcg x2 qd or even Advair, that prevents asthma from even acouring.

reyJSRCaaa	Resist the temptation and see what happens - just try it once on some little, little thing when you're alone and it won't affect things too badly. You will see that your world doesn't fall apart. You need to slowly, at your own pace, work on changing your behavior.  The root cause is worry. You can start a worry list. Write down everything you are worried about. Do this for 30 days. You will see that practically everything you have worried about never happens!  You do not have a mental problem, just a behavioral problem that can be changed.   Some of these issues you have are not terribly bad. Do things where perfection is a good thing - like being a proofreader, or working in a science lab, or drawing architectural plans. The world needs people like you, so relax and feel good about yourself. Work on eliminating the routines that really really bother you, and accept some of them as being there for a reason because you might help make the world a more perfect place.|`|4U5mIsJSaa	You know by doing that you are ruining your own life.

I spent an hour making sure all locks were checked...alarms set, making sure children still breathing.  I even checked on my husband to make sure he was breathing because I was afraid if he died in the night, he wouldn't hear my kids if they woke up.  lol!    (I slept downstairs in front of the TV.)    I used to be really bothered by my anxiety disorders but as I have gotten older and educated myself, I have learned that they are extremely common and they are just part of my personality.  There is nothing wrong with me.   I am just "quirky".  :)    It does exhaust me sometimes, but I have learned to accept it.    A lot of people  have problems a WHOLE lot worse than OCD.  Just have a sense of humor about it.  Laugh about it, cuz if you think about it.......it is actually pretty funny that we do things like this.      Unfortunately my OCD doesn't involve neatness and keeping things in order.  I am a very messy person.  I wish my OCD was more like yours!   lol!|`|pRpgbuqiaa	If you are trying your hardest, which I'd say you are, and you can't get rid of the symptoms the only thing you can do is see a doctor. A doctor who treats OCD is trained how to be very patient and polite and to take your case seriously. Millions of people have OCD and a good portion of them have learned to become symptom-free.

If you're still having some difficulties, I would start with the smallest size you can (light or regular) and go from there. Make sure you always have back up in case it doesn't feel right. And don't be afraid to (coarse as it may sound) shove it right up there. Ah, the things we women must suffer...
dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Hey Angel, I understand completely what you are going through. My husband was deployed for 14 months after being married less than a month. And When I was just a few weeks pregnant he went off to OBC (officer basic course) for five months. He missed the whole first five months of me being pregnant, doctors appointments, his birthday, valentines day, my birthday. It can be very depressing. I was extremely sick during my first three months of being pregnant and wanted him home so bad that I would cry myself to sleep some nights. I can only imagine being someplace where they don't speak my language. That would drive me cukoo! There really isn't anything to make this speed up faster, believe I've tried. The only that I can suggest is to spend every minute possible with your kids. Do a movie night, camp out in the living room, bake goodies. Write in a journal about what you feeling. It will make you feel better to get in out even if its on paper. I know you probably don't want to right now but do try to work it out with your mother. Let her know how you feel and that you are not moving to take her grandkids away. If you can't say it to her face write a note or send a card. You will feel tons better once you make up with your mother. I know when I argue with my mom I am so down and upset. Mothers can be your best friend and your worst enemy at the same time I think =) The best thing to do is live one day at a time. Thinking about how much longer you have will depress you. Hang in there. Before you know it he will be home. It really is hard to not have the one you love there but if I can do it I know you can. I'm probalby the biggest baby there is=)|`|gkqmrIAGaa	I know this is very hard for you especially with two children so young. Can you try to think of positive things.  Think about plans and things you can do when you get to your husband good things. Your obviously very busy taking of your children, talk to your 3 year old about the nice things that are going to happen when he/she see daddy.  Can you get out and walk or take the kids to the park. Try to remember that you are much stronger than you think you are and your husband doesn't want you to suffer. If there is a park nearby there are always other mothers to talk to that always helps. Think about the good things. I am sorry that you are suffering but we find at times like this that we are tough because we are women!|`|a93f33929bf44da78f38944cf6c36a7daa	I have recently had a baby myself and if it has tought me anything, it is that women are sooo STRONG. I understand its hard being away from your guy but you have to think positive and stay strong for your babies. You have to get up in the morning, put on a little make up and a nice smart outfit and go out. Even if it is just a walk with the pram around your neighbourhood, it will make you feel so much better. Also remember 'absence makes the heart grow fonder' good luck and keep positive!!|`|fa8ySWL8aa	try to think about the future rather than nnow think of next year and what youll be doing. think of what nyoull be catching up on when you get home. i no its tough, but why dont you ring youre friends back home and chat to them, just to keep you sane, i no missing valentines with your hubby is kind of crap, but think of it this way youre not the only person wholl be alone on valentines night. why dont you take up a hobby untill you go home to try get youre mind of things. good luck  xx|`|pRpgbuqiaa	Honestly, if I were in your situation I would drink lots of coffee or tea or something else with caffeine. If that doesn't sound suitable, you should drink as much fruit juice as possible, or better, eat as much fruit as you can. This will help your digestion stay at its best, which makes the body comforted and content.  If you are crying all day, you really should go to see a doctor and tell them. In Spain they will have lots of recommendations for post-birth depression. Do you get enough sunshine? That is another thing. Try to go out on sunny days.|`|WNHFuJ4eaa	awhh...i feel for you hun....you've not long given birth so your hormones are 'up the left' (for want of  a better phrase!) .....its natural that you'd want and need your hubby around .....especially with the stresses your undergoin at the minute.....just try and take each day as it comes...and don't think too far ahead for now....just try and focus on the positives you have in your life......like your two healthy kids. As for your mum...well she's obviously gonna miss you...so try to see things from her point of veiw, while letting her know, how difficult the situation is for you also....good luck! x|`|vhtlrbPgaa	My experience was in Brazil. I would be left alone there for weeks at a time when my husband went back to US or to Mexico. I found a newcomer's club there that gave me all the support I needed.    Can you connect to a church or other group of English speakers?   People living in another country are often lonely and more than ready to befriend you even if you are there only two months more. I know what it is to have to wait for passports.     Could you take your children to a park or put the baby in a coach so  you could see some other mothers?        Wishing you some friendly contacts.  Sandy

I was like that and thank God I didn't get into any accidents.    Much of what we need to change is the bad habits that really hurt us and our health.  I sleep at the same time every night, I don't watch TV and I make sure I get at least 6 hours of sleep.  Some others may need more sleep than me.  However, when one of my kids wake me up in the middle of the night, I do get right back to sleep, but the interruption is felt in the morning.    Why don't you take this questionaire and it may help you out.    http://www.sleeptracks.com/go.php?offer=...     Hope it helps...HeartBrigade|`|RALliiZTaa	I think you may have to take the medicine, but if you do and it didn't help you talk to your doctor about it. also one of the guys suggested a schedule to train yourself to get to sleep, even by force. it takes a lot of work. I try listen to something relaxing and practice self massages if I were you or you may want to try hard core work outs before going to your scheduled bed time. try to make sure you get at least 7-8 hours of sleep and if you do don't over sleep|`|AA11661028	I have the same problem. I actually went to the doctors yesterday and he prescribed me Elavil. He told me it would help me sleep and reduce my migraine headaches. The olny thing it did was scare the sh*t outta me when it put me into a seizure. I will never take anything again. I would rather be exhausted all day!|`|G9VBTg47aa	Try focusing your chi http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O20l3E9ma...|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	Talk to your dr|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	Go to sleep.    If that doesn't work see a doctor.|`|gkoX68Awaa	There is a lot of things you can do to force yourself to sleep, but that may not be the answer you need.  herbs, milk, exercise etc are great ways of making yourself tireder or more relaxed and ready to sleep, but many of the things we do day to day prevent us from getting healthy sleep.    It sounds like your setting up a schedule that prevents you from getting normal sleep. ("my mom is always screaming at me for being up") you need to set up a schedule. At a certain time, 9 hours away from when you have to be out of the house for school, you go to bed, you may have to lay there for a few nights before your body gets the message, but you can do it, your screwed up sleep schedule wasn't something you were born with, you can change it if you wish to. But don't just do it for one night and expect it to magically change, it is going to take you a while to condition your mind and body to sleep on a schedule you prescribe.    Stay away from drugs and alcohol, they can knock you out, but you aren't getting the best sleep with those and they make up whole new problems to deal with.

Pennsylvania has a rate checker at the link I provided.|`|3d2bd5deee3540ede736581cb7da08adaa	Cardio usually refers to a high impact training session.  A bike, treadmill, running or jogging, high heart rate.  This is good to strengthen your heart.  If you are overwieght, low impact, same machines or walking, only low heart rate will burn fat.  You can get nice abs by excercising your stomache muscles and eating right.  Check out this book for eating  Atomic Fitness by steve milholac
RzilBdJdaa	combine cardio AND situps/cruches (so you dont become excess skin/build muscle under your fat). eat less, more often. check calories/fat content on boxes. don't eat after 7pm. drink lots of green tea and water.     good luck :)|`|yrjUVBcWaa	I'd disregard the first two... It seems to be just scam bots, or something.    I'd go for sit-ups/crunches. It's how I really toned my abs because I didn't have any weights.|`|2JFfhhkXaa	Targetted weight reduction is quite hard, some peeple would say impossible, but the one method that really worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a few free trials remaining, it was featured in Fox News and CNN. I melted away thrity pounds, it really does work!|`|iBfcGlBgaa	sometimes belly fat is caused because of stress. if you have excerciset of stress it all builds up in your stomach or something like that. you should try yoga or simply just giving yourself 10 min everyday and not do or think about anything or anyone and just relax. but you should still eat and exercise right.
d2zGNPUoaa	yes the pill would help a lot. it does make your period shorter, mine lasts about 3 days. also it helps get rid of acne. the cramps go away within the first couple months also. i get mine from walmart and they are $9 a month. so its cheap and its defiantly worth it!|`|60mDEusiaa	I remember having a heavy period and cramps, when I was going to school.

It's probably because of the vaginal tissues being widened yada yada yada..    and it's probably easier with foreplay (excuse me) fingering and etc. (smallest>smaller>small>big>bigger>fun fun fun)|`|ev33OxJbaa	You are having your hymen broken, and your being stretched.  You have this hard thing going inside you, thrusting like its not a big deal. Men are external, women are internal. We carry everything inside.  Be sure to use protection and know your partner well. Communication is a good idea to tell your partner to slow down or it hurts or just anything.|`|uiVEaxjqaa	Because nothing that big has been in there before so its being stretched.|`|0uvgAKSZaa	you never know if its gonna hurt or not. everyone is different, some girls have broke there hymen already from bike riding, or horseback riding.  so you won't really know if its going to be painful your first time or not.  When you decide to have sex make sure you trust the other person, and let them know that you are a virgin so theyll be gentle.another big thing to make it a lil bit more comfortable i guess you can say is make sure your lubricated and if it hurts then stop and try again after you think your ready.|`|60mDEusiaa	Well, it actually still hurts for me, if he goes too deep or too hard. Ask him to take it slow. Make sure you are turned on, and you can buy some lube, and it might make it better.     Also, you're probably not going to be in much pain, unless he's going hog wild. I think if he takes it slow, you'll be just fine. :)     You really don't have to worry, just make sure you've found the right person, and that you are fine with it. Good luck and condoms are a good idea.    Also, I was 21, when I lost mine, if that makes any difference or not.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	The first time can be painful when the hymen breaks upon penetration. There can also be some blood. Not all girls bleed and not all have pain. I never bled but there was a lot of pain.     The hymen is the thin membrane that sometimes covers the opening to the vagina if you're a virgin. Even if you haven't had sex, the hymen can do a bit of a disappearing act due to an overzealous workout at the gym, horseback riding, tampons, and even passionate "heavy petting" with your boyfriend. (It's not an impenetrable barrier, anyway, as it has holes to allow menstrual blood to escape.)     For some, the first few times might make you feel sore, as the vagina has been an unused muscle or even hurt if you aren't properly lubricated, or if the guy is in a hurry, doesn't arouse you and your body isn't ready.     Relaxing, foreplay, (oral sex, more foreplay  touching, kissing, etc) being fully aroused or better yet, you having an orgasm FIRST or using a lubricant like KY-Jelly or Astro-Glide can help.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	The first time is not "extremely painful". It is more uncomfortably painful because the vagina is not used to having a big penis in it. To make this as comfortable as possible, make sure you are really ready for this. Wait until you are an appropriate age..at least late teens and then use LOTS of lubricant. Have the young man begin foreplay early, the hotter you are the more you will want it and the less you will be concerned with pain. When it begins...relax. If you are tense it will cause more pain.|`|hfybWveMaa	nope... it hurts for the first time because nothing has been in their before, it gets stretched out and sore. and as well your hymen breaks causing a lil bleeding. it can even hurt after that a few times for awhile, its not a one time thing and it never hurts again. everyone is different but all you can do is go for it and if it starts hurting stop and take a break|`|I7eOQ1cpaa	start practicing with a double decker bus. lol!!!|`|JovxU43qaa	It hurts because your partner will be breaking the hymen. Also known as "popping the cherry". You will bleed a little bit, unless it has been done before using a tampon, etc. It will not necisarily hurt but will feel like a stretching until it tears. You will get used to it and it will stop hurting.    And if you want more pleasure your first time, you can have your partner finger you, which will make your vagina more used to having things up there and "loosen" it up a little bit which can also break the hymen.   Don't have sex until you are ready you will regret it. Make sure it is with someone you really love and you are protected.|`|XBH61aAIaa	The hymen (a piece of skin in your vagina) breaks thus causing pain. Just try to relax and have the dude pleasure you in other ways. Or, try to break it yourself at your own discrestion.|`|p5o5aTAoaa	nope grit your teeth and bare it and actuall it hurts more than just once for some. it can hurt up to 4-5 times before you orgasm  just make sure your with someoone you love who will take careof you in that painfull time in your life  thatway its worth it    and yaits because of the hymen breaking  expect some blood|`|RhPNV1ohaa	It doesn't as long as the physical required in many states before a marriage license brakes your hymen.
Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Rhody girl,    Right, let's get you sorted out.    Well if it was an ovary problem you would only get the problem on alternate months because we ovulate from alternate ovaries. Therefore you would not suffer on the months when you ovulated from the good one. So that rules out cysts, cancer etc:    If it was endometriosis you would have other symptoms like severe back pain and irregular periods.    So either you are one of the unlucky ones who suffer to extremes when you menstruate or there is a simple explanation.    You need to get it diagnosed though because you do not need to be suffering like this when perhaps something as simple as medication could help you.    Your  GP will know your medical history so he/she is the best option.    I hope this has helped.    Love Mel.X|`|66jX06Onaa	If it truly hurts that bad, you should consult your doctor.

Your Gynae can resolve all worries. Usually with keyhole surgery called a Laparoscopy which entails a incision hole below your bellybutton . They fill your abdomen with gas to get a clear view of your reproductive organs with a camera they insert in the bellybutton incision. the operation takes around 45mins for straight forward surgery. you will be unconcious during surgery. You will feel pain and discomforf for a week or 2 after the surgery. and you will fart up a storm releasing the gas in your abdomen. i find Pepermint works really well as does DeGas tablets.
dfcCoGwRaa	HIIT stands for high intensity interval training.  It's a form of cardio done in intervals of high and low speeds.  It is done at a much shorter duration (12-15 minutes) than typical steady-state cardio (30 minutes+).      You won't lose muscle mass, but if you plan on doing HIIT and weightlifting to gain mass you'll really need to increase the caloric intake to make sure there's an excess.  There's no point in HIIT really if you want to gain mass, light cardio would be better, because you would get some cardiovascular conditioning but only have to increase the caloric intake slightly.      Cardio should either be done after weightlifting so you perform at your peak during a weightlifting session, or on off days.  HIIT should only be done 3x a week max, non-consecutively, to allow your CNS to recover properly.  There are some very good routines listed here:    http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/wotw40.h...|`|aj0E0j4faa	Acronym for High-Intensity Interval Training, a cardiovascular session which involves a warmup period, several short, maximum-intensity efforts separated by moderate recovery intervals, and a cooldown period.

AA12208063	You just need good running shoes since pavement can be hard.  A treadmill is more forgiving, but running is fine as long as you wear actual running shoes that are meant to cushion each footfall.    Start with what you can and build up.  Try to push past the ache unless it's in the actual joint. For achy knees a knee brace when running works wonders.    Of course, stretch ahead of time.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	If running was bad how do you think our ancestors would have ever survived? they dont have any cars, and they used to run to catch their food and escape danger. there are evne tribes still like this.

Dont worry, get out and get going! you only strenghten yourself each step you take!|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	Yes, running is a high impact exercis and puts stress on our hips and knees.   Tell yourself that the stronger your leg muscles get, the better your joints and muscles are going to be at absorbing that impact.     Any after pain in your muscles means it was a good workout (im not talking about injuries of course!)    You could try cycling, which is great for your legs and there is no impact on your legs besides the muscles getting exercised.    Or even swimming, as this is great for overall body workoutand his no effect on your joints.    Try some other exercise until you feel confident enough to run again|`|ZTPn4nRSaa	Listen to music and STOP thinking about it so much!

Have you expressed to your doctor your discomfort with the prospect of it having long term effects?|`|34f7398a33df7e6f639bf0ee6dbb4658aa	Your doctor has much more information on your medical background than anyone on this board will have so my first response is to encourage you to listen to your doctor.   The most common psychological problems include anxiety, stress, and depression. Insomnia can be an indicator of both anxiety and depression and many people will have insomnia during the acute phases of these issues.    There are two major approaches for treating insomnia but more importantly, treating the underlying cause is more important.  These two approaches include sedative-hypnotic medications and behavior therapies.    Again, listen to your doctor. If you're not completely satisfied, ask for a second opinion.|`|AA10240234	no, because Ambien stops working after you have taken it for a while. that is why they say to stop after 10 nights. Your brain becomes use to it and then it will not work. So if oyu have been taking it for a  year you are having what is called Placebo affect.
y8HyP1bzaa	You are not a creeper.  I will admit that 13 seems a little young... but to each his own.

It's like the forbidden fruit!|`|85V6cHe4aa	Why would you want to get any in real life anyway at 13? Chances are you don't but i don't think porn is like that at all.    Its harmless fun unless you become so obsessed that it has a negative effect on your life and its wise to remember that porn is a world away from the realities of a sexual relationship,its fantasy so dont base your ideas about future relationships on what you see in those films.

AA11483458	That depends. First, flexibility varies from person to person based on a gamut of things from age to gender, then there is the detail of how flexible one is seeking to become. People achieve a greater range of flexibility when they begin stretching at a young age, that is, their bodies are not yet fully developed and they stand a greater chance of permanent muscle lengthening which increases flexibility. However, a maintained long-term work-out regimen of slow-sustained stretching exercises will gradually promote elongation and extensibility as well. Keeping physically fit is another way to encourage increased flexibility as excess adipose tissue (or fat) around the joints creates resistance to movement. Also,in increasing flexibility, it is important to stretch properly and consistently. Without consistent stretching to progressively lengthen muscles, they tend to shorten and become tight, thus stinting elongation and flexibility.     If the only flexibility you seek is toe-touching, try reaching up towards the sky as far as you can make your body stretch. Then slowly round your entire body, gradually pointing your extended arms towards your feet. When your upper-body is directly faced downward, bounce. Using only your torso, pull yourself up and let your body fall. Do this repeatedly and, gradually (gradually being about three minutes), you should b able to touch your toes. The ballastic stretching temporarily elongates your muscles.|`|191b8643defd4297314a4fd8e90f7111aa	It depends on age and your past exercise history. If you have never done any exercise before, consult your doctor first before starting. You could join a stretching class and begin stretching. It is hard at first, but you will be able to touch your toes again. Only the instructor will be able to tell you, how long it is going to take. Good luck and happy stretching.|`|AA11882417	keep stretching!!!....in two weeks my friend,u can be like jean claude van dammit!!!.....|`|a36d29bc542c3eab96eb2d9f44526aebaa	I too had problems to touch the toe but now I am able to do this with ease.

Then they clean your teeth really well with this other nasty junk, and then they apply the metal things onto each of your teeth, they put in a wire then put the rubber bands on. Dont' be surprised if one or 2 of your metal pieces pops off (it happened 2 me within the first hour) they just reapply it. After they put the wire in they clip off the back part where it feels its sticking you. You will probably have a whole bunch of sores, but ask for wax to put on.      The first couple of times you get your rubber bands changed it hurts when they remove them, and when they reapply new ones.

I went through the whole party thing when I was your age. Then I got pregnant, had a kid, and mellowed out. I used to wonder what my life would be like if I hadn't of gotten pregnant and had a kid, but my life is good with a kid and I wouldn't change it for anything in the world! I have meaning in my life. Going out, partying all the time, it's not what it's cracked up to be. You only set yourself up to get into trouble. Even if you're not the type of person to get in to trouble, you never know what's going to happen when you go out. Enjoy the quiet, peacefulness of your life and be grateful that you have the choice to do what you want. Why are you pushing your bf away? You could always invite somebody over and have a little dinner/movie get together.

acfba041cc5c34d0b29cd76270a6e143aa	Muy buena pregunta!! La soledad no es vivir solo sino sentirse solo como un estado de nimo. Se puede estar viviendo rodeado de mucha gente, pero sentirse solo; es no haber encontrado la persona justa en la vida para compartir todas nuestras esperanzas, dolores, afecto, alguien que nos entienda completamente sin necesidad de hablar, solo con mirarnos, no se trata de amor solamente, puede ser un amigo/a, un vecino/a , un familiar, cualquier persona que logre sacarnos con su carcter e inteligencia de la apata  que trae la soledad, el no tener proyectos, futuro, y si estamos locos de felicidad alguien que sepa compartirla con nosotros y nos escuche y aconseje( siempre que se lo pidamos), alguien con quien nos guste compartir salidas, paseos, viajes, comidas, cines, teatro u cualquier otro hobby qye tengamos!!  No confundamos la soledad con la depresin, depresivo es alguien que se va hundiendo en la desesperanza, que no le quedan ganas de vivir. Soledad , al contrario es una eleccin de vida, y se puede sobrellevar muy bien, depende del carcter de cada persona.

Eso es soledad.  Cuando me exigen consecuencia y las consecuencias las sufro yo.  Cuando me critican como defecto lo que me exigieron como virtud.  Cuando piden de m lo que no son capaces de dar.  Cuando no entiendo las risas si yo quisiera llorar.  Cuando siento la culpa de ser.  Cuando todos me dicen qu debiera tener.  Cuando ha terminado el da y al siguiente todo vuelve a empezar.  Cuando me dicen que hay que comer.  Cuando me hablan de conveniencia.  Cuando me saludan desde una 4 x 4.  Cuando descubro que no entiendo lo que hay que entender.  No tengo lo que hay que tener.

jO3rt1bTaa	i emailed you.|`|UfpLTtVPaa	The pattern for losing weight is easy - consume less and move more often - the issues surface when we actually try to put that into practice! There are lots of stumbling blocks in the real world aren't there?! The one diet that clearly delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Fox News and USA Today. I melted away twenty pounds, it clearly does produce results!

Now if this person through some future technique or through nanobots in their blood had more control than people do now - then in the book sure.

I used to be really pissed but what i learned is that i could enjoy things that did not have gluten in them. Also if you miss those food i would suggest gluten-free options such as bread, cookies, cake, etc there is so much out there you just have 2 find it. i know its hard, beleive me i was pissed 2 but you just have to trek through. I know you dont want 2 hear this but what got me through is seeing somebody that died from not taking care of this, that made me not care about food as much. I know its hard but you will feel so much better. You sound like you are doing a really good job keep it up|`|d11ac1603c7e53d874cecaa7631b2aa0aa	No, this is a big issue.

I have to say it's easier because I am healthy, and if you look at it like that, it helps!    Good Liuck to you! Stay strong.|`|IgztWp0uaa	Hi, welcome to the club! I know exactly how you feel. I really miss just being able to eat whatever, whenever as well. I think it is the stress of a total life style change combined with a new anxiety about what and how we eat that causes the feelings of depression that a lot of people get once new to the diet and lifestyle.   It's ok to be angry and bummed, we all feel like that at first. It gets easier, but to be honest, you just never know when something is going to trigger a "mini food related emotional crisis" as I call it. I still have them every now and then, and I have been diagnosed for years! I usually deal with those feelings by reminding myself how much healthier I am, and then try to figure out a way to make whatever dish I really wanted to eat gluten free so I don't feel so deprived. The other trick I use is to remember that I have it easier than people who are allergic (eating gluten will make me sick, but I won't need cpr immed. if I accidently ingest some) and of ALL the autoimmune diseases to have, this is really the one that you would pick if you could pick one... compared to diabetes, lupus, crohn's etc. this really isn't so bad after all! : )  Chin up, and please think about joining a support forum like the one here on Yahoo or Celiac.com. I found that being able to talk to people who are going through the same thing really helps me cope!  Blessings! Anama|`|sw2R5A9iaa	get some counseling -you have to grieve your old diet.  take cooking classes, host gluten free parties at your home, and avoid your trigger foods.  ask your GI doctor for a referral to a nutritionist.|`|aFK7yD4xaa	I understand. Bacon sandwiches are sadly missed, and cheese on toast. But the way round this is to get into cooking. There are ways to replace bread and normal cakes, so on.

My Dr. has me avoiding gluten, soy, eggs, dairy and shrimp because I tested sensitive to them. Yes, it's hard to find something to eat! The good news is that if we are careful and intentional in rebuilding our eating lifestyle, we can most likely resume eating these things. Check out the "four day rotation" concept (where you plan your meals around food groups) and concepts by Dr. Schwarzbein (and others) about healthy living. My Dr. is helping me learn the concepts. I feel better than I have in years, and the Dr. feels we can begin cutting back on Rx's and reintroduce the foods to which I am sensitive (one at a time). It's a process, but it's worked with other people.    (Incidentally, your moods are affected by many things, most of them related to what you ingest or your body produces. It gets easier when your hormones and biochemistry are in balance.)    Best wishes!

pISC6pphaa	I know exactly where you're coming from.  I still have problems thinking about being a Christian and having sex. I couldn't have done it (and what do you yell?  You can't say the lord's name in vain, and you can't cuss. :) ).  I used to be afraid to mast. during a thunderstorm (I might be struck by lightening).  I also feel weird walking into a liquor store, saying the f word, and talking bad about God.  We all have our issues.    Hormonal contraceptives can definitely lower your sex drive.  If you think it's related to this, you can ask your doctor for an alternative.    However, it is normal for your sex drive to change throughout your life.  We don't always have the raging hormones of teenage years.  also, as you get closer to a partner, it's normal for things to slow down, cool off.  You get comfortable. Sex drive is affected by your diet, and the amount of activity you do, too.  Vegetarians are known to have a bit lower sex drive (unfermented soy products make it worse!) but have stronger orgasms.  More meat or protein could equal more drive.  And if you're overworked (even mentally) you might just not feel up to it at the end of the day.     If you think things are messed up, you could talk to a doctor or psychiatrist, but I think you're going to be fine.|`|uiVEaxjqaa	No your fine.|`|AA12198724	testosterone? Are you a man or do you mean estrogen? You may be suffering from side effects from your birth control if you are having a decreased sex drive. But it does seem a bit psychological so I think that you need to see a therapist. There are some that deal with sexual behavior. But at least you know the psychological reasons to your sex drive.|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.    However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.    My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com    What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.      Well good luck and I hope this helps.

Basically, just about any exercise and diet can help take off the weight. What really matters, is keeping the weight off once you get to your target. so diet and exercise have to be forever, or as sure as Homer Simpson is a fool, you will put the weight back on and maybe even some more !|`|Cqe1uWtbaa	excersise, follow a food guide|`|lry4ncIBaa	ide like to do the same .. :) its hard tho! x|`|h31D5UDgaa	stop drinking soda and start drinking skim milk, orange juice, and water.    eat more fruits, veggies, and lean meats.    cardio exercise is a must. elliptical machines are great, as is running.    take a multi vitamin.|`|nD2zbkovaa	do a lifestyle change, not a diet.  diets are temporary and you will usually gain the wait back because of that fact.  the best way to lose weight is to exercise and watch portion size.  even too big of portions of healthy food will make you fat.  the best way to keep weight off is to lose only1-2 pounds per week, so that's 8 pounds a month, and you have 4 months to go.  going at that rate, that's 32 pounds.  it takes 3000 burned calories to lose a pound.  so, if you do a 30 minute jog (about 600 calories) and cut out 400 a day from your diet, you can lose 1 pound every 3 days.|`|8RmNOuRwaa	the thing is you should do exercise and eat 3 times a day drink lost of water and instead of eating junk food eat fruits and vegis|`|nLXfeQbpaa	ok. first of all. you probably DONT need to lose 30 pounds.

V0Tj7R2taa	Protein and carbs, protein and carbs, protein and carbs!!! 6 meals a day. Whey protein before and after your workout. Creatine after your workout, and on the mornings of your off days. Find a good routine that makes you lift atleast 4 times a week(different muscles each day, google the Brock Lesnar workout, its a good one) Do this for like 3 months. Dont worry if you gain a few pounds from fat cuz you NEED calories if you want to build muscle, not to mention have energy in the gym. After your 3 months shift into a conditioning routine and start cutting and before you know it you'll look like you're made of granite! And as far as fruit with protein, I have never heard of such a thing. But I know that fish and chicken are what the pro body builders feast on. Eggs, turkey, basically any lean meat. You need red meat, too. And now since your bodybuiding, if you ever have a moment where you're not sure if you should eat something, then you probably should. Hopefully that makes sense...

1j60dOgOaa	First off, for all the judgemental people out there who are going to say things like "well you should have thought of that before you smoked". If Obama and Clinton can smoke and still become Presidents, and if Michael Phelps can smoke and still become a superstar olympic athlete, then what is your problem with it? Oh yeah thats right, you never tried it before have you? You just label it as bad because that's what you were taught at an impressionable age. Nobody has ever died from marijuana in history, yet 30,000 people die each year from alcohol but I bet you wouldn't be judging him if he said he had a drink. There is no marijuana-cancer connection. Marijuana's THC actually slows cancer from growing, which is why they prescribe marijuana to cancer patients. Go to google and type in "marijuana cancer". 9 out of 10 CREDIBLE websites state that it is not dangerous and does not cause cancer. They used to think that it caused cancer, but 2 years ago researchers did the largest study ever with real patients and discovered that it does not cause cancer, and actually helps to slow tumor growth in people who had cancer already. Majority of people in California are successful (Silicon Valley for example) and as you can see from our medical marijuana laws, majority of Californians support it (don't fool yourself, 9 out of 10 people with medical prescriptions are 100% healthy and using it as an excuse). We have a new President in the office, times are changing and you guys better get with the times or life and society will pass you by.     Now, down to business. If you only smoked once, chances are its already out of your system if you are a skinny person. I'm 6"3 and 150 lbs (very skinny) and its out of my system on average in 3 to 5 days if I only smoke once. If you smoke everyday, then expect 10-15 days if you are skinny and 20-30 days if you are overweight. I used to process the tests. THC stays in your fat cells. It's released from your fat cells as you burn fat and passes to other parts of the body. A urine drug test is looking for these toxins as they pass from your fat cells to your urinary tract. THC clings to the urinary tract, so you need to not only get it out of your fat cells, but your urinary tract. Cranberry juice or AZO cranberry extract pills will clean the urinary tract. As far as fat cells, its too late now because you would need 3 days to get it out of those. Exercising and eating foods low in fat and high in protein helps, but you dont want to do that on the day before the test or on the day of the test, because if you burn fat now, it will be released too late and the test will see that. So start drinking cranberry juice and dont drink anything else but that and lots of water up until the test. Don't do anything on the day of the test or the day before that would burn fat, instead, start eating very fatty foods right now if you only have 2 days. Its probably too late for all that because you said this week and this week ends tomorrow. They sell synthetic urine in local head shops in most cities, call around to your head shops (The type of shops to sell the detox drinks).  Detox drinks are just like water, they dilute, they dont clear your system. The ingredients in detox drinks are just water, sugar, and creatine, because creatine helps dilute. Dilution can result in a failed test depending on where you go. Majority of the time they will make you wait there, drink more water, and take the test again if its diluted. And ask them if they have synthetic urine. Its the only sure way to pass a test, its basically someone elses urine, but its lab made, you heat it in the microwave for a few seconds to get it to body temperature, since it must test at 98 degrees, then you attach the warmer that comes with it to the bottle and that will keep it at that temperature for 6 hours. The people who said have a male friend pee for you are right too. You can pickup hand warmers at target and a thermometer. Wrap the hand warmer around the bottle the urine is in using a rubber band, and then test it out with a thermometer to make sure its at body temperature. It's not illegal to cheat on a drug test, you can't get in trouble with the law, but if you get caught, who knows what your school will do. I never heard of a school drug testing, must be a private one.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Nothing is going to help you now.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	http://www.detoxlabs.com/how-long-does-m...|`|PSyVB2UDaa	I'm sorry but you're an idiot for smoking. i can't help you with this but you need help and you need to STOP SMOKING NOW!!! i'm really sorry but you need to stop|`|8FLJueRjaa	get a clean male friend to pee in a condom for u  \  tie the condom up and tape it to your leg so it stays warm|`|a03839710389585e6d78d6e01faf9f91aa	lol pothead|`|15ZFMS9paa	don't go to school that day|`|MlmpBygxaa	this is kinda gross but u can use somebody else's piss|`|dvfeBZtZaa	Don't bother going in for 2-3 weeks.

ezI5HwRWaa	I haven't had it that bad but I do understand what you are saying.    Half of you wants to stop and the other doesn't. You aren't going to like it at first, but start making yourself get up earlier (if you go to bed sooner that will help). You don't have to wake up early, but set an alarm for you to wake up sooner and gradually make it earlier.     You need to find something to do and something to look forward to when you wake up. Start learning an instrument, cook, clean if that helps, sing, go to a friend's house, write a song, draw, take a shower even to wake you up. You need to get more motivation. Finding things that you enjoy doing will help with this. Even if it doesn't come at first, it might (like playing an instrument can be frustrating at times but you just need to be patient and consistant with it).     Next, you need to socialize more. Getting out really does help to lighten your mood. Thinking about the negative things is going to make you feel negative and less energetic. Think positive about life and know that each day can take you somewhere new if you let it. It sounds like you are getting very bored with your life, so find some new friends who will be a good influence on you, or join an after school program (idk how old you are), or better yet, volunteer somewhere. It will help you to feel better about yourself and like you are making a difference.    It might also help to find someone who you can talk to and confide in; someone who will be there for you. A healthy diet, even excersize will make a difference also.     That's what I did and it not only helped the sleeping but the depression.|`|3Fr2MHP1aa	If you are unable to take meds, you are going to have to increase your seratonin levels yourself. Find stuff that you really enjoy doing and make sure you do it every day (reward yourself for getting up).   It probably won't be easy, the fact that you're sleeping so much sort of indicates that you're avoiding something in your day-to-day life. If you know what it is, try to remove it and all other negative influences from your life.  Think about how you want to be, what your perfect life would be, then figure out the steps you need to do to achieve this.  IMPORTANT- make sure it is what YOU want, and not what you think that others expect you to be (trying to be someone you are not will not work and only make you unhappy).  Fill your life with fun!|`|G9VBTg47aa	Dont take pills or go to any doctors, do meditation|`|XhzvFAK2aa	Not really me personally, but i would say this to you:  How did it get like this, what are your triggers, life getting too much and on top of you. Do you have any family or friends you can talk to openly and in confidence? Try not to let it go on, i know, i am struggling with it every second of my waking day, and it gets to the point where you just cannot leave your bed never mind house.  You maybe need specialist input, such as it is, if you don't you will reach a time in life, in the long term when all this apathy and uneasiness will work against you.   I myself am out of work and have been over the most important years of my life, years of being instead of seeing and doing, you will regret it|`|CLcGxHpAaa	Yes, I have been there.  Unfortunately, it took medication.  Is there a particular reason you cannot take meds?  There are many types of antidepressants, so if you have tried a few and they didn't work, you may need to try until you get the right one.  If you are adamant about not taking meds, you will need to see a psychologist for therapy.|`|6MRcqskIaa	I go through bouts of sleeping to much, currently experiencing it for the past week. However, I normally only experience when I don't keep myself busy enough. I do not let it bother me as the body is obviously trying to recuperate from years of hard work. What do you do to keep yourself busy, if you are not working maybe try adding more activities in your life  (e.g. exercises, socialise and working). The only way you are going to stop the pattern of sleeping to much is wanting to break the habit (e.g. anything that goes on that long indicates it has become a habit). But on the other hand you say you are not taking medication for what ever reason, then are you seeking help. Don't expect to snap out of depression it doesn't work that way, you need to consider seeking professional help from someone, e.g. so they can help you look at the causation of your depression.

Most people who get this deficiency are usually older or are vegetarian and are not watching their diet right.  Some people have stomach or intestinal problem where they can't absorb the vitamin well.  So what they must do is take a supplement.  Remember though, most people absorb their vitamin b12 very well and don't need supplements.

Insulin is the first hormone to change production levels as a result of pregnancy.  Sometimes insulin does not go back to "pre-pregnancy" levels, especially as we age.  The purpose of insulin is to open the "cell's mouths" to let food and water in.      The food insulin tucks in cells is blood glucose.  If there is too much insulin (a condition known as hyperinsulinemia), it can result in there being too little blood glucose in the blood stream for the rest of the body to use during the day (a condition known as hypoglycemia).  This can cause the cramps and moodiness and nausea.      The insulin imbalance can also cause imbalances in other feminine hormones, that may shut your period off faster, or dry up your milk.  Ask your doctor for a fasting insulin blood test .  Ask for a copy of your results.  10 or higher is abnormal for an adult.    Also ask for a saliva test.  This test will tell you if any of your feminine hormones are not at the best levels.

However, its not the perfect solution because some of the calories remain in the body although you throw up.

The digestive juices aren't meant to come back up the esophagus and out the mouth.  Digestive juices are caustic like acid.  They will erode the tissue in your throat and the enamel on your teeth.     Acid backwash into your esphagus causes a condition called Barrette's Esophagus.  This is when the cells lining your esophagus change to a precancerous condition that requires constant monitoring.  If it changes to cancer you will either die or learn to feed yourself through a hole in your side.    And of course, acid eating the enamel off your teeth is very attractive.  If you don't have dental insurance, be prepared to go through a lot of pain and expense to repair your teeth.  By the way, the dentist will know that you are tossing your cookies on a regular basis.    Then of course, after training your stomach to heave after you eat, it eventually reaches the point where it can't hold anything even if you want it to do so.  That's usually when you will be put in a hospital and fed with a needle in your arm.  They will also have you seeing a psychiatrist.  All of which goes on your permanant medical record for future insurers and possible employers to see.    Last but not least, you cause stress to your internal organs most notably your heart.  After awhile the damage becomes permanent.  With a weak heart, you might lose your ability to ever have children as your heart might not be able to take the added strain of pregnancy.  Most men want kids.    So, think about it carefully before you decide to use throwing up as a way to lose weight.  Don't take a friend's advice - research it for yourself.
5a577d316e71b7762e66ea492256fd31aa	es afrodisiako!   ademas son musho los beneficios..    Las embarazadas que comen chocolate tienen hijos felices    Las mujeres que comen chocolate durante el embarazo dan a luz a bebs ms activos, felices y sonrientes, segn un estudio publicado hoy en la revista cientfica britnica New Scientist.     La investigacin, elaborada por la Universidad de Helsinki, en Finlandia, hall tambin que el consumo de chocolate disminuye los efectos negativos de tensiones y fatiga en el periodo de gestacin, informa EFE.    Los cientficos analizaron los niveles de estrs y el consumo de chocolate de trescientas mujeres embarazadas. Seis meses despus de nacer los bebs, estudiaron su comportamiento, y lo clasificaron en varias categoras como miedoso, tranquilo o contento, entre otras.     Descubrieron que los hijos de aquellas mujeres que consumieron chocolate durante el embarazo eran mucho ms activos y sonrientes que los otros.     Adems, en el caso de embarazadas que haban consumido chocolate para combatir el estrs de su estado, los bebs eran menos miedosos que los hijos de mujeres en el mismo caso pero que se abstuvieron de comerlo.     Los cientficos consideran que esta relacin podra deberse a que los bebs en el tero reciben la sensacin de placer que provocan ciertos productos qumicos que contiene el chocolate, comenta New Scientist.       El consumo de chocolate mejora la circulacin sangunea     Investigadores del Hospital Universitario de Zurich suministraron 40 gramos de chocolate a 20 fumadores.     Despus de dos horas, les tomaron tomografas por ultrasonido las cuales revelaron que los polifenoles, sustancia que contiene el chocolate oscuro mejoraron la circulacin sangunea en sus arterias con un efecto de ocho horas, lo cual disminuye el riesgo de infartos.       Un autobs de chocolate deleita a los coreanos    Un autobs de chocolate deleita a decenas de pasajeros en Sel, Korea. Se trata de un camin utilizado para que las parejas celebren fechas especiales como aniversarios o la entrega del anillo del compromiso.     Todo a excepcin del piso y los asientos est cubierto con chocolate, pero eso no es motivo para que los pasajeros se coman un pedacito.     Por supuesto el chocolate es delicioso y tiene una textura suave cuando lo comemos y quisimos dar esa sensacin de estar en un lugar donde el chocolate se derrite, coment Kwon Dae-Jin, promotor.     El autobs de chocolate no es permanente, as que las parejas que lo abordan son privilegiadas y desean guardar el recuerdo.         BENEFICIOS DEL CHOCOLATE    El chocolate ***** puede neutralizar el endurecimiento de las arterias en fumadores y evitarles problemas cardacos graves, revel hoy un estudio publicado en la revista "Heart".  "Un peque?o trozo de chocolate ***** puede aumentar de manera considerable el consumo de antioxidantes, lo que tiene un efecto benfico en la salud vascular", segn los autores.   Esa conclusin fue extrada en la comparacin de los efectos del chocolate ***** (con el 74 por ciento de slidos de cacao) y el chocolate blanco en el flujo arterial de 20 fumadores.   Segn los cientficos, en los fumadores se altera continuamente la actividad de las clulas que componen las paredes arteriales y de las plaquetas que intervienen en la coagulacin sangunea.   Esta alteracin hace que las arterias sean ms susceptibles al estrechamiento y endurecimiento caractersticos de las enfermedades coronarias.   El informe indic que se pidi que los 20 participantes en el estudio se abstuvieran de consumir alimentos con alto contenido de antioxidantes antes de comer 40 gramos de chocolate.   Despus de dos horas, los exmenes de ultrasonido revelaron que el chocolate ***** haba mejorado de manera considerable el flujo arterial, un efecto que se mantuvo durante ocho horas.   Los anlisis de sangre tambin demostraron que ese tipo de chocolate haba reducido a la mitad la actividad de las plaquetas.   Adems, los niveles de antioxidantes aumentaron rpidamente despus de dos horas.  Por el contrario, el chocolate blanco no tuvo efectos en las clulas del endotelio, ni en las plaquetas, ni en los niveles de antioxidantes, segn el informe.   El chocolate ***** tiene ms antioxidantes que cualquier otro alimento, incluido el vino tinto, el t verde y las frutas, segn los autores del estudio.      CHOCOLATE MEDICINAL    Por vez primera un estudio realizado en los granos de cacao descubri que ciertos qumicos contenidos en ellos pueden limitar el desarrollo de fluidos causantes de la diarrea. El cacao contiene un amplio espectro de qumicos llamados flavonoides, mismos que pueden ser utilizados para crear suplementos naturales para aliviar los sntomas de la diarrea.     El empleo de cacao para el tratamiento de la diarrea no es nuevo. De hecho data del siglo XVI, tanto en Amrica como en Europa. Sin embargo, hasta la realizacin de este estudio nadie saba a ciencia cierta por qu el cacao era considerado como un remedio para este padecimiento.     Otras investigaciones efectuadas por cientficos holandeses revelaron que el cacao es una buena fuente de antioxidantes del mismo tipo que los hallados en el t, conocido por su capacidad para proteger las clulas contra sustancias qumicas da?inas que se encuentran en el cuerpo humano, llamadas "radicales libres".     Adems, el grupo de especialistas afirm en dicha publicacin que "el antioxidante contenido en el chocolate es cuatro veces mayor que el del t". Al respecto cabe se?alar que el chocolate puro tiene una mayor cantidad de antioxidante que el mezclado con leche, pero ambos poseen ms que el t *****.   |`|AA10760130	Yo creo por que es delicioso...

9a040f55afc9dc260aa577c960d9fe8caa	A canker sore is like a wound, so it can get infected. There are glands in your neck (lymph nodes) that release antibodies to fight infection. In my experience, it gets sore similar to  the feeling of a stiff neck or when I slept the wrong way, when it is overworked. Once for a mysterious infection, I had to take antibiotics for two weeks and my neck felt sore all the time. Maybe your lymph node is just overworked from fighting off an infection in your canker sore. Afterall, the mouth is a pretty nasty place. Ask your doctor or dentist to prescribe you something.|`|1aee9196e19b183947c5fd70d396dd1daa	heck ya|`|db3d79a48f9a4df140f82783d25309ecaa	If you can't think of anything you might have done to cause sore muscles in your neck, then you might have some type of infection.

87e1c1ccce95fe9d0fe43e521b88b34faa	I DONT THINK YOU NEED ANTIDEPRESSANTS!!  This is a common problem that is partly to do with your age. It is often termed as "overthinking" or informally "thinking too much".  You need to take control of you mind. You can buy books on the subject that will outline excersises you can do to control your mind to stop yourself from thinking too much about the same thing.  Personally I have used these excersises and buddhist meditation(look up mindfulness) to help me from thinking too much about the same thing.  Also don't worry/focus on this too much; you need to also put it down to being a normal human being. All of us worry before we go to sleep if we have a problem sometimes. This is because its the only quiet time many of us have with it just being us and our mind. Further this isn't always a negative thing either. Its our bodies way of finding solutions, we mull things over, process thoughts, and come to solutions; this helps us to deal with stress.    So dont panic, you can learn not to overthink. And we all do this to some extent anyway...its actually constructive. But its when this thought process becomes destructive that you need to take action to stop and take control of your mind.|`|AA12346961	Infatuation and Hormones.    You'll get over it.

AA12026046	Growing up, takes different form, for everyone. Some are joyous, some are painful.     Different people handle stress, differently. You will have to learn to handle them YOUR way. However, you will have to decide what is the best way for you, without harming yourself, and others.    Stress is like an illusion, if you choose to let it be real and torment you, it will.. Ignoring it, won't make it go way, learning to deal with it will help you overcome many things in life. EVERYONE has some form of stress..    Perhaps, you should give yourself and your parents a chance to heal the 'pain' inside you.. Talking, helps, it provides a chance for others to hear you, and with that a chance for healing.    Take heart, and prayer doesn't hurt... try it.|`|AA10346776	How sad, whatever is going on in your family the decisions you are making now could affect the rest of your life and theirs. If you cannot talk to a family member try a friend or teacher. If that is not an option see if you can find a good church if you are not currently in one. There is a lot of good support out there but sometimes when you are at your lowest point you still have to seek the right resource. Good luck and know that people are there for you. Don't give up, there is always a solution and it is often in the least expected places.|`|a84812ba090ec68878594e3b5f16f045aa	Always remember that no matter how good things are going for you, it can and will change at any time.

I'm sure your a cool person and smart show everybody a new you .|`|3149cf22819e9d4066ac150533e8ac19aa	Instead of dealing with what you are or were doing, bulimia and the cutting, maybe you should understand what it is that is making you do that.  You are suffering from teenage depression and it is very common.  It is not easy being a teenager these days and you sound like you have a lot going on in your life.  A sense of helplessness, lost, sadness, crying are all clear symptoms of depression.  Your cutting and throwing up is not hard to understand.  These are things you can control.  You have the choice to do them or not in where you may not feel you have control in other areas of your life.     I don't know you so I can't say what has made you feel like you have lost control or sad.  Maybe you feel pressure from family about you, school, whatever.  Maybe the pressure isn't really there you just feel it is, or maybe it is there.  Maybe you don't feel good enough to friends or family or feel like you should live up to something or someone.  I don't know.  Only you really know.  What I do know is that what you are feeling is not right or wrong, bad or good, it is just how you feel and it is very common.  A lot of times it just goes unspoken.      I lived with a bulimic for a long time.  Being a bulimic is not the problem but why do you feel the pain that causes the bulimia is the problem.  If you feel you can, talk to your parents.  I know you think they won't understand and you know what, they may not at first.  Its not that they dont care, its just hard for adults to comprehend that their kids problems can really be that serious or painful because after all, you are just a kid...right?  You know different.  If you really cant go to your parents, try school and if that does not work for you, go to a site called "TeenCentral.net.    It is a great site dealing only with the problems of teenagers including cutting and bulimia. It even gives you numbers of teen help lines in every state.    I remember being 14 and at times feeling lost and unloved and even considered suicide.  Losing your life is not the answer. Hurting yourself, starving yourself is not the answer.  The answer is trying to make you like yourself again and understand the pressure is normal and you will get through it.  The answer is understanding that people do care and there are people who love you very much.|`|eb71f2ad5db5875a16c18c2fe726092baa	Hi,   Are you serious about losing weight & toning up?

First the additional weight in anyone put an additional strain on the heart,liver spine, and every other internal organ. Secondly,being more than twenty pounds overweight drastically increases the risk of many other severe health problem, diabetes, a number of cancers, heart attack, stroke, as well as others (there is some evidence that it is a contributing factor to Alzheimer's disease). While I don't know how old your grandmother is I am a little surprised that she is not already seeing a doctor,and if she has seen a doctor at her present weight I am sure that the doctor has already tried telling her that she needs to drop a few pounds.

AA11452268	She looks extremely thin, and certainly her weight/height distribution is underweight, but this may or may not be due to anorexia nervosa. If she is around 12 years old (which is about how old she looks), it's not uncommon for her to have hit her "growth spurt" and to have grown in height without having added weight yet. As long as she is eating normally and not skipping meals, it shouldn't be a problem.     See the links below for more information about anorexia nervosa and body mass index.

AA11981333	Absolutely understand that when you feel better you want to get back to normal as quickly as possible. Unfortunately your body wouldnt feel the same way. It has had an assault on it and it needs time to recover.    The reasoning isnt actually that you cant work out until the antibiotics finish.. it is more that you shouldnt go anywhere that may cause you to spread the strep. One of the quickest ways of spreading strep is through breathing and working out will make you breathe hard. By the time the full course of antibiotics are finished your period of infectivity is virtually gone. During this time your body is internally gathering its strength again. If you were to go today and do a full workout like normal... your progress would more than likely go backwards and you would be exhausted and relapse.    If you are desperate to go..then I tell my patients - dont!!!. But ok, like me if I was given that information I would ignore it... because I would be bored.. so the next best thing is to make sure I wouldnt relapse... which means..    If you were to go and exercise, dont be near people, go when there arent many around.....    Do half of your normal workout only, not the full one or even do something a bit different that wouldnt be as strenuous. Keep up fluids nore than you normally would and also take some good food or vitamins, especially Vitamin B which helps with healing in your body.    Instead of working out.... can you go for a walk or something, in a park or somewhere with fresh air? You dont say where you live so I dont know if it is possible but fresh air, a bit of exercise, not too much, will actually help.     Hope all goes well|`|4f81531c8f0cc829af1f634eca1f902daa	Even though you feel 1000x better, I would suggest waiting it out until you finish the antibiotics.  You definitely don't want to get back to the gym and then have a relapse.  I did that once with a sinus infection, felt fine after a couple days and went back to working out, had a relapse and missed working out for another week or so.  Besides, you won't lose any muscle mass in two weeks.|`|d3cc505956c9ecea5e2c081a692229dfaa	It's not the answer you want, but your local doctor who prescribed the antibiotics knows best.

EOM7tHxSaa	Well, Sometimes When your legs grow your joints will hurt. It depends how old you are, however this could be due to overexercising. This also could be- if you've just started the gym- due to lack of exercise before hand- which puts a strain on the joints because they are not used to this strain- and this could trigger some unwanted aching and hurting. Try Resting! It May Help :) !

qxrr69bnaa	A woman can have a hysterectomy at any age, as long as it is medically necessary.   If you feel like your gynecologist is giving you the run around, I would suggest you find another one, or at least get a second opinion from another gynecologist.  You can choose to have only your uterus removed in order to avoid "instant" menopause.  Depending on the type of hysterectomy that is performed, your recovery time can be as little as 2 to 3 weeks.  Some doctors will try to talk you into keeping your cervix because they believe it provides support for the bladder and your remaining organs, but in my opinion, it's just something that may cause problems later in life.  If you retain your ovaries, they will continue to produce hormones.  Occasionally after surgery they may go into "shock" and you may have to take prescription hormones.    Seek a second opinion.  A very informative website is www.hystersisters.com.  It is a website for women that have had or are considering having a hysterectomy.|`|rcdTluUjaa	Maybe talk to her about just having your uterus removed. Most of the problems that come with a hysterectomy are caused by removing the ovaries not the uterus. So if they only remove your uterus you shouldn't have the cramps anymore but won't go through early menopause. Recovery is generally 6-8 weeks, The major concerns are all the problems that are caused by menopause, ie bone loss, mood swings, hot flashes, etc. It can cause your bladder to prolapse because there is empty space, and that can cause problems with needing to go to the bathroom all the time, and incontinence issues. You might also seek out a pelvic pain specialist. Hope that helps.|`|m7putYGmaa	a hysterectomy basically throws you straight into menopause, even when they give you hormones, you'll be miserable for a LOONNGG time D=|`|oRzqWhsDaa	They wont do it the recovery period is about 6-8 weeks ask her about the best pain medication you are way too young to have this done|`|7qa2tMgCaa	why are you asking on yahoo answers regarding a hysterectomy? you should talk to your doctor about alternative solutions, and if that doesn't work, get a second opinion.|`|OjBY7eScaa	Yeah these people are right 29 is a very young hysterectomy. My Mother had one last summer, it takes about 6 weeks to recover and in that time you can't lift anything heavier than a cup of tea. And you will absolutely not be able to drive or work. Also the cramps will still be there while it heals, your mood goes down and you feel a bit crap for a while.     A lot of women say its the best thing they did however, but it can cause some women to start experiencing hot flushes etc.

FicyC2TXaa	Hereditary cancer is rare - fewer than 10% of all cancer cases, all types,  are due to hereditary factors.    Where there is a faulty gene within a family, it will not necessarily be passed on, and even if it is it doesn't mean the person carrying it will definitely get cancer.    For example, 5 - 10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary; so far 2 faulty genes have been identified as responsible for hereditary breast cancer - BRCA1 and BRCA2. If some one carrying one of these genes has a child, that child has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene and, if female, a 50 - 80% chance of developing breast cancer (males inheriting the gene have a much lower chance). If that child does inherit the gene, her future children will have a 50% chance of inheriting it. If she doesn't inherit it, nor will her future children.    Nobody knows the causes of cancer. Yes, smoking has  been shown to contribute to and cause lung and some other cancers, and alcohol is a risk factor (not a cause) forsome other cancers; but there's no scientific evidence that diet or other lifestyle factors like stress or lack of exercise cause or contribute to cancer.    It's often less frightening for people who haven't had cancer to 'blame the victim' - that is, to blame cancer on avoidable lifestyle factors like bad diet, stress, lack of exercise etc - than it is for them to accept that cancer is a largely random disease that can strike any of us at any time.    So, with fewer than 10% of cancer cases being hereditary, I'd say bad luck was the biggest cancer risk factor.    Me, I thought - if I thought about cancer at all - that my largely organic vegan diet, coupled with the facts that I've never smoked and I exercised regularly, would protect me from cancer. I got cancer anyway.|`|AA11020187	The bottom line is we do not know what causes cancer.  With some cancers we know there is often a faulty gene.  Less than 10% of all cancers are hereditary. With those that are and a person is found to have the gene it is an increased risk for the cancer, they do not always get it.  With others we know there is an environmental component as with mesothelioma.   In many cases we have no idea what could have caused it.  However, we do know the biggest and most common risk for cancer is aging.|`|or5LNjsTaa	Yes some forms of cancer are genetic. If its recessive and only one parent has the disease then the children of the parents will not be carriers of the disease. However, because cancer can effect your genes it can be transferred to an offspring. Cancers that are diagnosed as a result of smoking or alcohol are not genetic and cannot be passed to children.|`|AA10450066	Any cancer is deadly,but it all depends on what,where,and in what stage it's in.Even the ones that are known to be the easiest cured ( like skin ) is because it's seen by the open eye and almost everyone knows what to look for.Granted brain and pancreatic ca. are the deadliest because their symptoms mimic things besides ca.Pancreatic usually is the worst, because by the time the symptoms appear it's already in it's 4th ( deadliest ) stage, but even then it all depends on the individual.Are they genetic? I would tend to say to most no,but that again depends on the individual.As far as recessive genes,those you usually see in families that have diseases like diabetes and even some mental health issues.I hope some of this helps|`|ly0S73eaaa	i will support what by  Margo D said all but the fact that the cancer can alter your genes and can be passed on to your children. in reality it already in every one of your genes if it's caused genetically. so it'll always be passed on.
sPiwb8Hraa	OCD and depression or closely intertwined. When you go to the doc make sure that you ask for a patients bill of rights, and insist that you don't want to walk around like a zombie on real heavy meds. That can do more harm than good.    You can mix it up with self therapy, by keeping a journal and writing down your obsessions and the insanity of them and what you need to do to quit obesessing when that happens. You'll have to help yourself some, because really all these kooks do is prescribe meds.    And lastly, under no circumstances get in any trouble with the law whatsoever.

FCNAf6NTaa	The amounts you took are not particularly dangerous, but the fact that you took them is a bad sign.  These kinds of pills are addictive, and you're much better working through any pain you're going through with a professional (like a social worker, or a psychiatrist) than self medicating your mental pain with meds designed to ease physical pain.|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	yes pain killers can have a drastic affect on the body ,.. some cause liver, kidney,heart damage.  To the point that may someday require a transplant.  You should be really careful what you take and how much you take. All medications can be harmful if not taking as directed by a doctor. If your have a problem pain killers are not the solution. when the pain killers wear off the problem will still be there . You need to deal with the problem and stop taking painkillers to avoid it .|`|YxMh2aAOaa	no o fcourse not your heart is already screwed and next time u go to the doctors they will know even if u stop right now , so go a head take another 20 pills it doesnt really matter|`|xiFBN6aDaa	STOP!! yes its bad..really bad..and by the way pain killers only help you when something in your body physically hurts..not when you are going through a tough time.|`|ee1r8TuXaa	of course it is bad. Did you know you could overdose on painkillers?|`|XHvaws8baa	yes it is bad stop taking those|`|eWlyqlQtaa	not really.    i dont see how its bad, i take 8 painkillers when i've got period cramps..|`|eRESvnQ7aa	its a start of something taht could end up bad|`|D8R8an2taa	yes it is bad you are over doing it  i think what you need to do is find someone to talk too.
pcEJMHPMaa	sounds like your addicted to pain killers to me.Please get help before you end up going on to heroin.|`|lrBC1dxqaa	Do NOT take any more pain killers! If you are taking prescription meds you can become addicted to them and that is terrible in any situation, let alone with your age. It hardly takes anything at all to become addicted to them. http://www.opiates.com/media/warning-sig... Check out this site, they have the warning signs of addiction.|`|6NA2MXNPaa	You're too young to have all of those problems. Aside from the painkillers that you're taking, it sounds like you're depressed. You should really talk to a therapist about what you're going through. There's nothing wrong with needing someone to talk to. And if you can't talk to your parents about needing a counselor, go to your school counselor or school nurse, they'll help you. Talking about stuff is so empowering, it unloads it off of your shoulders and you don't have to think about it anymore, it doesn't have to be your burden anymore. Don't take painkillers to try and block out the emotional pain of what you're going through. You'll just set yourself up for an addiction and you don't want a life of dealing with rehabs and failures. Take pride in yourself and know that you can overcome your problems if you just get the help you need. We all need help at one time or another, there's nothing to be ashamed about when you ask for help. Please ask for help. Please take care of yourself, you deserve a good life and a happy one! Good luck and take care!|`|iOI2RT6maa	Sounds like you addicted to painkillers|`|suVispAAaa	Yes that those are signs you are becoming addicted or are very depressed. YOu need to go see a DR. or psychiatrist to get put on a anti-depressant as those are signs of depression.    You might not be addicted yet but you will be come addicted extremely fast.  Your throwing your life away..You could start other drugs or worse be homeless & poor..NOT GOOD. You are to young for this. Taking pain meds is not the answer to escaping your personal problems..getting help is the best opttion. PLEASE STOP the meds & talk to some one..Your mom, dad or some one..fast!!|`|gkqmrIAGaa	You can overdose on six prescription painkillers.  What you are doing is extremely dangerous and yes an addiction. You need to talk to your mom about how you are feeling there are a lot of symptoms make sure she knows everything and takes you to your doctor. You need a check up first to determine if you are suffering from depression or an addiction.  You are much to young to be taking the pills. Please stop right now. It is extremely hard to stop and if you are far into it you can't stop without professional help. Talk to your mom sweetheart or your school guidance counselor you need to see your doctor.|`|XQ8jiKteaa	I belive they are and you need to talk to an adult right away. This could turn into something serious and it could ruin your future. Tell you parent/gardiun or someone at school that you trust. Do not leave this unattended. Please help yourself because my older sister has a friend that is addicted and is now pregnant at age 16. Help yourself and tell somebody.|`|hfybWveMaa	yeah, quit taking the painkillers idiot and all your problems will fix themself|`|rUV2tMeFaa	yea it is a sign !!!|`|2bZMxMitaa	Some of these are just you being a teenager.  Stop taking painkillers.  They're bad.  Since I've hit teen-hood I lost all my friends.  Just hang in there, kiddo. You'll be fine.   You just need to realize that you have people that love you, even if you only have just that ONE friend, she/he loves and cares about you.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Sounds like you've got a few different things going on.  You need to tackle your need to take so many painkillers.  You also need to tackle your depression or other mental health concerns.  I would recommend talking to your doctor or psychiatrist about this.  Also I would recommend that you get a therapist to talk about things with.|`|GwmbrR3gaa	Possibly you do. It also seems like you are manic depressive. Don't think I am trying to insult you or anything, I am just trying to help. You should definitely speak to someone close to you. Maybe a teacher, or parent or guidance counsellor.     I reeally hope everything turns out well. =D|`|zPLza1dSaa	Uhm, i have been feeling like that but  i dont take painkillers lolz.

You should message  me im bored.  tristindanielle77@yahoo.com|`|ORonhAuvaa	No they aren't. You haven't taken them for long enough for an addiction to occur. However, some of the side effects of these drug are dizziness, severe depression and anxiety attacks. It doesn't help your mood to take these drugs, so consider throwing them out or saving them for a mf toothache.    However, I do suspect that you are very depressed or these drugs could not trigger feelings.  In your case, I think the drugs exacerbate your already bad feelings. You need to tell a trusted adult about this and see if you can get some help in the form of counseling.|`|qd6QQPn0aa	r u on coke|`|xKbPNK4vaa	Addiction, depression, and an anxiety disorder.    Get some help. You're not too far gone.|`|KGBBSsVfaa	Absolutely not, after only 3 days of use (if you're really only taken them for 3 days total) there is no way you've used them long enough to develop an addiction or a chemical/physical dependency. An addiction to something is the need to do something over and over again despite it's negative consequences to you and your emotional, physical, or mental health, or all 3, causing you to spend all of your time finding the ways and means to get more of what you're addicted to regardless of the consequences. Chemical dependency, however, is your body's dependence on a substance in order to remain healthy and avoid going through withdrawal (the absensce of the substance from your system on a regular basis that you've become used to). A lot of these symptoms indicate a chemical dependence on these pain killers, as nausea, depression, isolation (not wanting any social contact), weight loss, no desire to eat, desire for more pain pills, generalized pain all over your body including the backaches, headaches and stomachaches you speak of, general apathy, shakiness, blurred vision, mood swings, and feeling tired all the time are all indicators of chemical dependence on an opiate based narcotic. If you've only been taking the pain pills for 3 days, there is no way you've become physically, chemically dependent on them. It takes weeks of use to develop this chemical dependency, but it can take much less time (but still not only 3 days of use) to develop a mental dependency. If you're finding the use of opiate based narcotic pain killers the only way you can deal with your problems, then you are headed for a serious addiction problem as well as the chemical dependency issues that come with it. It's worth mentioning that opiate based pain killers are dangerous based on the fact that the have the ability to depress your respiratory system, causing death by stopping your breathing while you "nod off" from the medication or fall asleep. While the dose necessary for this is quite high in patients with a tolerance to opiate based medications, it is quite low for someone with little or no tolerance to them, such as yourself taking what I imagine is 5mg oxycodone pills or some equivalent. In essence, if you're not used to taking them, taking them on a regular basis without being prescribed a safe dose for a legitimate medical problem can be quite dangerous even resulting in death while you sleep or pass out.     Opiates are NOT the best way to deal with stress in your life, that kind of goes without saying, they simply make you numb to all kinds of pain, physical and mental, but strictly in terms of your health and safety, if you're taking 5mg oxycodone or oxycontin pills at the frequency your taking, the potential risk to your immediate health is quite low as this would be the dose prescribed for something like a tooth extraction or a pulled muscle in your back. If the size is larger than that, you're playing with your life every time you take them and fall asleep, potentially causing you to cease breathing and never wake up. Seeing a therapist is a much safer solution to dealing with the stress in your life, as is talking to friends or family. You don't want to develop an addiction to opiates, as they inevitably lead to using heroin as your tolerance increases and you are unable to find medication in enough quantity to satisfy your physical dependence to avoid withdrawal and keep getting high. And at that point, you have no idea what kind of crap your putting into your body as heroin off the street can be cut with all kinds of nasty stuff that's very harmful to your body, even potentially lethal.     As far as are you addicted to them after 3 days of use, no. As far as are you physically dependent on the after 3 days of use, no. Although you will experience mild withdrawal symptoms like a hangover no matter how short the use, it's just that the narcotic withdrawal will be very short and not very intense, while long term use at high doses will result in withdrawal that can last for weeks and is the closest thing to hell you'll ever experience on this earth. The physical and psychological torture is INTENSE and you'll pray and wish you were dead. Do yourself a HUGE favor, and stop using them for reasons not prescribed right now, before you dig yourself a good size hole you'll have a horrible time getting out of. It's also worth seeing a doctor to discuss your physical symptoms if they persist longer than a day or two after ceasing taking the pain killers, as at that point they are definitely not symptoms of withdrawal from the pain pills. Using opiate based pain pills for anything other that sever pain that cannot be managed with anything else under the supervision of a doctor is always bad, yes. The good news is that if you really have only done this for 3 days, you've caused no permanent harm that cannot be reversed in a couple days at most. I urge you to stop taking them ASAP and get some help for your stress in your life and potential depression problems. Please, stop taking the pain pills before you do indeed develop a serious addiction and destroy your life faster than you'd ever think possible. Opiate based narcotics are incredibly addictive and your body is VERY quick to develop a chemical dependence on them. Ask anyone with a former opiate addiction problem and they'll all tell you it was pure hell and beg you to stop now before you get into serious trouble. As one myself, I beg you to stop and seek alternative methods to dealing with your emotional pain and stress. You're too young to throw your life away now. Flush the pills and go see a therapist and talk to your family and friends about your problems that inspired you to start taking the pills in the first place and never play with them again.    Note: After reading other responses, you do NOT need detox after 3 days of use, you are NOT addicted to them after 3 days use, and you do NOT have a chemical dependency on them after|`|mHX3XaR7aa	Not addiction! I would say, STOP taking pain killers! please! and ask your family to set an appointment up for you with a therapist! You may have anxiety or depression, and they are easily handled! I live with anxiety myself. escaping your problems by numbing them is just not the way.|`|qRA0rA5Taa	dont take them anymore!!!|`|mtNpKxNkaa	wow you just described everything i used to go through  you are just a teenager  first off, this may not be what you want to hear, but definitelystop taking the pills. when i was going through this i took pills everyday, now my body is permanently screwed up. im not taking the pills anymore and  my body has these spells. the doctors said its because of the pills io used to take. they just make everything worse. especially the back pain. if you keep taking them it will get so bad where you start having muscle spasms and that kills.  everything else is being hormonal  you are just stressing out and you need to calm down  take some vitamins and it should help with some things  the nausea is from the stress  and some of the pains and anger can honestly be helped with exercise  i didnt want to when i was in pain and tired, but i finally had to and it has helped me tremendously   i hope this helps you|`|lPzoVwjXaa	Look, I know you don't want to hear this but talk to a parent or someone you trust. I had the same problem and after 2 months of most of those symptoms I found out I had a virus that had to be cleared out through antibiotic pills. Don't use painkillers it will only make it worse.  The tiredness,no appetite, losing weight, headaches, stomach aches, mood swings and being shaky are all symptoms of fatigue. It means you are mental and physically tired and unhealthy.    Try and force yourself to eat.It will make you feel better. As for the breakdowns, anger and the urge to yell at someone that can be stress or a few emotional problems that you keep bottled up. I still have a teddy bear to talk to.It sounds silly but believe me it works.  Please talk to someone.    Hope it helps.  Courtney
cp30vrVoaa	You have come to the wrong place to seek help. You need to talk to a medical professional who can help you in one-on-one sessions.     Please don't end your life. Please seek professional help.

No one on this board is truly going to get you what you need, what you need to do, is make it till Friday, and at the therapists office. DO NOT leave things out, do not hide ugly truths. Trust me, the therapists JOB is to help you, tell them all this, in fact, print it up if you forget how to word it.  Make it to friday, or not. But this online board may help in getting you there i suppose|`|3Fr2MHP1aa	Sounds like your parents need some parenting classes. You need to just wait this out, talk to your therapist, make sure they realise how serious this is for you. Are you on any meds? Sometimes they can definitely help get you through a rough patch.  You need to find some more understanding people to talk to, it doesn't sound like you have very much support at home.  I know it's hard to believe right now, but things WILL get better. Once you finish school your whole life dynamic will change. You will be strong and independant, and have control over your life. And most of all you will be happy.|`|1STWV53Aaa	Hi. Please... just take a deep breath. You are okay. We all have our own issues and we all have our time and place to get through them. For you it's now. Now is not the time to give up--it is a time to prove to yourself that you are both beautiful and strong. In life, you are never given challenges that you can't overcome.     With that said, the first thing you should work on is your food intake. You were dizzy earlier because you aren't eating enough. You don't gain wait by eating food--you gain weight by not exercising, and by eating foods that have a high caloric intake, like soda for example. You should be eating at least 3 times a day, if not five, but smaller portions and healthier foods, like steamed and raw vegetables, whole grains, and healthy juices. If you are not sustaining yourself correctly, your energy will plummet and of course you will feel more depressed.     I am so happy to hear you have looked to exercise as an outlet for some of your emotional stress. Continue doing it, but I wouldn't recommend joining a really competitive sport--do something that you enjoy, something that gives you peace of mind and helps you feel good about yourself.     Next, continue seeing a therapist. It is very popular to seek advice and support--many of my friends who are very "normal" seek support from a therapist. If you feel like you can't talk to your parents, then your therapist is a perfect alternative. Make sure you like your therapist and feel you can talk confidentially. if not, go for a new one.     And the last bit of advice, but one I think is the most important, is to stop taking yourself so seriously. None of us, not even your friends, are perfect. We are all stumbling through life. And we all need each other. I think you should really start to volunteer and try to think about others. Although it is important to think about yourself, its important to think about others as well--maybe you can work at a geriatric center and listen to the stories of the elderly. You may gain some perspective, or if you don't want to hang out much with people, try volunteering at the animal shelter after school. Volunteering will always make you feel better. My favorite is Habitat for Humanity. You can actually learn how to build a house! Just take it easy right now. De-stress by drinking a cup of tea or taking a shower and then go ahead and research some volunteer opportunities in your area. And for goodness sake, Eat!|`|BOqDeuDpaa	Hi, I was moved by your story.  Don't give up hope.    1 Do you have a psychotherapist you like and who is coaching and guiding you? It doesn't sound like you do, so that would be the number 1 thing to find.   2 Start taking responsiblity for your health and stop being a victim.  You have to take care of yourself, no one else will do it for you.  You must eat a diet that will nourish you.  That will help a lot with what is wrong with you.   I was sick for the last 2 years with chronic fatigue syndrome.  14 doctors couldn't help me. I was barely able to function and am a single parent.  I had to be able to continue to work.  I finally found someone to help me.  He prescribed a diet of  3 cups at each meal of cooked dark green leafy vegetables (Swiss Chard, bok choy, kale, spinach), protein the size of my palm at each meal (meat, fish, chicken, fish, eggs), a little long grain brown rice, or millet or quinoa and 8 glasses of water a day.  No wheat, no sugar, no dairy.  I have been eating this way for almost 3 months and am almost completely recovered! I can't believe it.  It is like a miracle.  It is the healthiest way for everyone to eat and especially those of us with a lot of stress and illness! The person who helped me charges $500 an hour.  I am giving you $7,500 worth of advice.  The other issue is to deal with your emotional issues and find someone who will help you stop being a victim and to take responsiblity for your self.  You will need professional help and guidance to learn what you need to do to change your victim stance.  You can do it!  I am hoping you will find the help you need and the courage within yourself to make dramatic changes in your life.  Good Luck.  (I am a psychotherapist).

vukRiS1Eaa	First off, congratulations for being brave enough to ask about this. It's easy to get embarrassed and then not find out what you need to know!    As for ways to do it, you have several options:    1. Fingers. They're the old standby, and they work. Focus on your clit--experiment with different speeds and pressures. Start by rubbing lying on your back, and then try lying on your stomach and grinding your hips to rub against your fingers. Experiment, and know this is how most women try it for the first time!    2. Showerhead/bath faucet. A favorite of many girls. If you have a detachable showerhead, simply adjust the water temperature, lie down in the tub, point it at your clit, and enjoy! Note that the lying down part is important, especially if you're new to this--don't want to slip!    3. Vibrator. No, you can't go out and buy one at your age from a sex shop. However, take a look at those "Face massagers" and "Back massagers" at Wal-Mart--believe me, they will do the trick. Again, focus on your clit (are you catching the theme here?).    Above all else, have fun!|`|uiVEaxjqaa	Go to www.mymasterbation.com|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	We cant give a 15 year old girl tips on masturbation!|`|AA12198724	We cant give you tips thats molestation I think but we can inadvertently say that http://www.clitical.com is a website geared towards female masturbation with tips for women by women...or so I have heard...hint hint|`|p5o5aTAoaa	your not ******* bi. thats all i got to say    idk watch porn and get rubbin    or just...i dont know... get a life and get a guy to do it for you

Some women find it's even better during their period.  There are some religious and moral taboos against it, but there's really nothing wrong or weird about it.    It is possible to get pregnant during your period!  And it's possible to get STDs any time.  So if you're concerned about these things, use protection.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	When it comes to having sex, there aren't any problems with having sex on your period.  As long as it's protected, which should be everytime you have sex until you're ready to get pregnant and you're in a monogamous relationship where you know neither you or your partner is infected with any STDs.      I read somewhere once that having sex on your period can actually help you, because when you orgasm, your brain releases chemicals that can help with cramps and stuff.|`|MhpccWpmaa	You can have protected sex anytime you want to.

veB7gJYcaa	The first thing that you have to do is to stop yourself from scratching. You may be able to relive the itchy feeling by washing the welts with antiseptic soap and applying cold compress or an ice pack. If the bed bug bite symptom continues, you may apply an antiseptic or antibiotic cream or lotion. If you think you are developing an allergic reaction take an antihistamine or see your doctor immediately.    Zinc Oxide is a good start.    This should work Sadie.
WN2SHklQaa	Brandon H is somewhat correct, surprisingly...I know you are probably too young to know this yet, but oral sex IS one of the number one reasons why the best female vocalists are what they are. As you perform the oral you are supposed to practice singing your song, it will sound muffled but it is how you get better. Once you practice while not performing you will be amazed at how simple it is and how free your vocal chords are to sing without being muffled by a giant **** in your throat. This many sound like a joke or something like that, but it honestly isn't. If you do not have any close male friends to practice, you can usually find willing participants at a family reunion.|`|UT5HS39Daa	You might try gargling with warm water, lemon juice, honey, and salt.  If you don't have honey, just try salt and lemon juice, before and after your practicing, and do it a few times a day. This will get rid of any bacteria you may have.    Also, try taking Ibuprofen, it will help with inflammation.    If you think you may have strep throat, or if you develop any other symptoms like a runny nose, ear ache, etc.  you should see a doctor, you may have a respiratory infection.    Good Luck with your performance, and feel better!! :)|`|fpADhvCxaa	brandon h is an asshole!!!!

kArEdAaTaa	I am the same way little things tick me off. Like for instance when I am doing something & my 3 year old is doing something that she knows is wrong just sets it off. I have yelled at her & got very upset many times. I have tried many times to stop myself before it gets too bad. My husband thinks that I am just crazy but he doesnt understand that it is more than that. Something deep down inside that I do not know what is causing me to be so shortfused. Its scary sometimes, all my kids know of me that Mommy yells alot. Its sad I know. I think I should start looking for help. Also, Ive tried many methods i.e. (slow breathing, counting to ten, going to sleep earlier), many things nothing seems to help. Something is really bothering US deep down inside weve just got to figure out what it is. Sometimes I will be very happy next thing you know I am in a manic-depressive state.     I think its the start of a clinical depression. or something simular-Maybe Id try seeking medication that might help calm the nerves as well as any tempermental issues. I am a chicken, so therefore I havent looked further into medication, I heard its addictive. Good luck with your everyday battle, its very hard I KNOW!|`|3Fr2MHP1aa	Have you had your thyroid levels checked? Sometimes pregnancy can affect your thyroid production and whilst most of the time it settles down a few months after birth, in some people it becomes more permanent.  It can cause mood swings, physical symptoms like excess hair fall and dry skin, and really effects your energy levels.  If any of these things sound familiar you can get a blood test to check (it's treatable).|`|pISC6pphaa	A few ideas:    If you're using hormonal birth control - depo, the pill, etc. you may be experiencing side effects.  You may be able to find an alternative with a lower dose of estrogen.  Estrogen causes the bad stuff - mood swings, depression, anger and sadness for no reason, etc.  I was on Depo for a couple years, and it was way too strong for me.  I was constantly sad and angry, with suicidal thoughts.  I'm not off of it and have it cleared out of my system, and things are much better.    Other medications can also make you feel like this, so check the side effects and ask your doctor if you think you're reacting.    Some foods can make you feel "off" as well.  Try eating whole foods (fruit, veggies, rice, potatoes, pasta, lean meats), not so much processed junk, high fructose corn syrup (in coke and a lot of other stuff), hydrogenated oils, additives, preservatives, and artificial stuff (including artificial sweeteners). Make your meals from scratch and eat raw, unprocessed foods when you can. Try this for a month or so and see how much better you feel.    One thing that has helped me (I've had almost exactly the same problem in the past) is to keep a journal about what you eat, what you do, and how you feel.  Keep it with you all the time, and write down things when they happen.  Also write when you feel "normal".    This will help you to write down things and get them out without yelling for one.  Also, it will help you see patterns.  If you're always cranky after drinking coffee,  or eating sugar, it's a problem, and you should fix it.  If you tend to be moody before your period, it's probably hormone related.      It's important to see that you're not being yourself.  something is affecting you to make you this way (hormones, food chemicals, diet, other body related things).  You are not a bad person, but you need to take care of yourself.  Give yourself a time out when you feel really angry.  Go to the bathroom, lock the door and take a deep breath.  If you want a friend, advice, or just a place to vent, feel free to e-mail me.    If you ever feel that you are in danger of hurting yourself, or others, get help from a counselor, or doctor.  These feelings are serious, and shouldn't be brushed aside.|`|G9VBTg47aa	You need to focus your chi.|`|EZt7ZHIiaa	If you are interested in speaking to a professional, I am a therapist and do provide safe and confidential online counseling for issues such as this.

Even though you say you don't want to do water-related activities, I would recommend aqua aerobics.  Are you available during the day?

Best of luck.    XX|`|fwpu4jL3aa	Experts recommend that you accumulate one hour of physical activity every day to stay healthy or improve our health. Obviously this is also good if you are trying to lose weight and keeping it off.    The rule is the more intensive the activity is, the shorter the duration of exercise. As you progress into activity with moderate intensity, you can cut down to 30 minutes a day for four days per week.    There are 3 types of exercise that your body needs to keep healthy - cardiovascular, flexibility and strength. Cardiovascular activities are those ranging from moderate to vigorous exercises.    Here are some of the light, moderate and vigorous activities:    http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/2008...|`|D8WM8Dk5aa	Exercising helped me to lose a pile of weight once I joined it along with taking acai berry.

If that is the case, the best revenge is to have more courage and not let people make you feel victimized.   Imagine your self in control of your own emotions and behavior and that no one can make you feel anything unless you allow it.  It means being courageous and powerful; to be a person who sets limits with others.  People will know they cannot take advantage of you by your demeanor.

Some women do not have vaginal orgasms, but the stimulation of the clit works really well.|`|JovxU43qaa	There's nothing wrong with you.   You don't get them every time you have intercourse or whatnot.   :)|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	No, there's probably nothing wrong.    It can be very difficult for a woman to orgasm, and some women never have one.|`|pISC6pphaa	Vaginal orgasm is hard to achieve for many women.  Some women never have one during intercourse, and need to get that manually (ahhhh).  Clitoral should be fairly easy, if you get your technique right.  It's often easier to get yourself off than for a guy (especially a young, fairly inexperienced guy like you probably have at 18) to do it for you.  I would recommend experimenting yourself to see what movements and spots are good for you.  Then show your guy (or whatever).     I've found it's easier to have a vaginal orgasm after lots of stimulation elsewhere, and foreplay. And it usually takes a lot of rhythmic thrusting to have a vaginal.   So if you're trying to get one during intercourse, he needs to be able to last a long time and go the speed and rhythm you want. It may help to have clitoral stimulation at the same time, too.    as you get older, you will get to know your body more, and will be more able to figure out, and tell others, what you want.

It could be more than a yeast infection. If over-the-counter (OTC) meds aren't helping you, or are making your condition worse, you need to see your doctor.    It's possible you have an STD or something more serious that just a yeast infection.     Mentholaum is used for cough and cold medication - so no it is absolutly not safe to use in or on your vulva/labia. A yeast infection is INSIDE your vulva.

One or two days treatment is normally required to get over most yeast infections.|`|vB5cTqrzaa	1) NEVER DO THAT AGAIN!!!  2) Go to a doctor and make sure it IS a yeast infection and not something more serious.  3) Go to a health food store and get some probiotics (the kind that need to be refrigerated - I personally find those work best rather than the one just off the shelf and start 3 pills twice a day still symptoms clear.  You will notice an increase in discharge (that is normal), DO NOT use a tampon, use pantyliners and change them often.  4) Go to the library and check out books on Candida and Yeast Infections and try to implement some of the dietary changes - I'm not saying you have to become a total convert - but I found cutting back on white flour products and eating less processed food made a HUGE difference.  5) Some people use stuff like Monistat, it never worked for me and I'm not going to say ya or nay (everyone reacts differently), but I prefer the more natural approach of Probiotics (or just eat a hell of a lot of yougert).  6) Take care|`|AA12198724	Go to your GYN or doctor and let them give you a perscription for fluconazole (diflucan) and some metronidazole .75%.

The chocolate tastes GREAT in the smoothie but not so great by itself; that way, I don't eat the whole bag.    If you want real food, you can try this:    Whole wheat pita bread: 90 cals  Spinach  Feta cheese: 90 cals  A tomato, onion and seasoning mixture (also from walmart)  A squirt of lowfat balsamic vinegarette: 25 cals    I also recommend tea for late night hunger pangs.

8Xbc4ok1aa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.    Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.    ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.    Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.    To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth    It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.    During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.    Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.    Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.    Carrots Fish Liver  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat  Milk Cheese Apples  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas  Peanuts Chicken Beans  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day    If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.    Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth http://www.super-growth.com or http://www.super-growth.org with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .
KPtrfsEYaa	Don't give up.  I get hungry too after I work out.  You are burning a lot of your calories and energy while you are working out.  This is good!  Your body just wants to refuel.  Try eating some protein after a workout if your hungry and drink an extra glass of water or two.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Lol nothing is wrong with you. When you exercise you burn calories, and so obviously your going to get hungry since your depleting your energy. eat before you exercise so you have energy to work with|`|WhxlBEMAaa	Don't give up the exercise, this is much better for you than any of the con's. You are probably hungry because the exercise speeds up your metabolism. Your body is increasingly active, therefore it is trying to get all the energy available. After the workout try to wait 10-15 min's without eating (some experience nausea if eating right away), and eat some veggies (any way you like them, fresh or steamed), this way you won't snack and gain back the lost-due-to-hard-workout pounds. :)|`|SYDaRM11aa	That's perfectly normal. It's just that your body is burning the calories, making you feel hungry.|`|SeKR3zncaa	That's odd I thought feeling hungry after work outs was a normal reaction.

Don't worry too much about it just have fun.|`|BF896wpwaa	Don't give up, you are hungry after you workout because you are burning calories and using energy, this is normal, i think. What i would recommend it having fruit or something before/after you work out.|`|PeCm21meaa	i get really hungry at the end of my workouts too, and this is because you burn off the calories you eat during exercise.  especially for you, if you're trying to lose weight, you probably aren't eating as much as usual, so the calories will burn quicker.  instead of eating after working out, before you work out, eat a good serving of protein.  that'll help you burn fat and calories you don't need, but will store and keep you full!  hope this helps :)|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	No|`|RaV7SidDaa	your hungry cause you are burning calories and your body needs more.. just eat something small and healthy and you wont undo all your exercising|`|CFSfyXCbaa	its quite common to get hungry after exercise...|`|7i1rPTPwaa	it just depends on the person. you need to eat something light with carbohydrated before you work out and within 45 minutes of finishing your work out, eat something with more protein in it. this will give you the energy to work out and then the food you eat afterwards will go directly back into giving your body energy and nutrients rather than having your body store it as fat.|`|6PaGQaqKaa	Why would you be worried?

Something healthy! You have to eat healthy and exercise to lose weight.|`|oezTDqm5aa	Feeling hungry after you exercise is perfectly normal, especially after hard cardio, your body uses energy and sugars in the blood to fuel the exercise so needs replacing afterwards. In the cases of very hard cardio, ie triathlon and distance running it's essential to eat after training, as nourishing the body helps the body repair itself, develop and grow. Eat a healthy balanced meal within an hour after training, that's the 'window' when your metabolism is highest and your body can get the most of of the meal. Don't eat sugary rubbish after though!
9CHjZ8sBaa	It would be unhealthy to lose weight any faster given the workout you do.

ATKCpzW4aa	i had that its not dangerous or anything but it left a scar on me..nothing big dont worry :) just shave around it haha|`|y8HyP1bzaa	It was probably just a pimple.  It's normal to get pimples "down there" too!  Don't worry about it.|`|Qy9nZgBhaa	It is a boil/abscess.  Keep it clean and it will go away on it's own.|`|USt4MZSBaa	you can get blemishes anywhere don't worry about it :D|`|1CphjZmjaa	herpes definatly you can get it off a toilet seat or used toilet paper thats how i got mine.you can peirce it or when you do decide to have sex just say its a skin tag they will never know;0
qIaBOtltaa	slow. they die|`|AA10404097	Most people who go out this way take enough pills or alcohol so they pass out before the bag does it's job. Without something like this most people do not have the willpower not to pull the bag off. So I would not say they suffered. The problem is that often people do not quite get it right and throw up and pull the back off or inhale some of the vomit and have major lung problems. There is not really a good clean way to kill yourself.|`|i88MbPB3aa	kind of fast like 2 mins without a breath you will die he might have over dose his self first if not it was painful|`|mzkfSwLwaa	You run out of breath i guess start feeling light headed and faint before you die|`|D4jdJl7Oaa	the correct answer is that they die!
sKmQVwQMaa	could be a lack of iron or calcium
f61c6ad75081d1de726d4e9737429211aa	Probably age, they still have enough growth hormone to keep it going without the vitamins and protein.  I think the endangerment of their health they endure to be "skinny" is stupid.  Good health is the best gift a person can have.|`|IhlwGvVJaa	Good question! :)|`|PeCm21meaa	cuz they're naturally skinny, they aren't starving themselves.  besides, they aren't all skinny.
rVnTnuU1aa	I have heard of that happening before due to changes in birth control or alot of stress. Hair falling out like crazy is not normal at all. I would recommend Googling this issue and research this a bit to see about finding a vitamin supplement maybe.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Please go see a dermatologist.    If you were a cat or dog, I'd wonder if you had a mite infestation.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	There are a lot of reasons hair can fall out - but it shouldn't in young healthy people.  Do you have allopecia? That can make your hair fall totally out - there's nothing to do about it and you just have to get a good wig and eyebrow pencil.  Good luck.|`|o4tblEZaaa	Do you have any major stress in your life? If so, then it may be a condition called alopecia, where hair loss is caused by stress in your life. You should talk more to your doctor, and ask him about it.|`|nLXfeQbpaa	you need to buy a new shampoo. Thats most likely the problem.   If you have well water then you have hard water. Buy a shampoo that reverses the effects of hardwater damage.   some thing like Malibu 2000
PSyVB2UDaa	Close your eyes and breathe. Also picture a long flowing river. that always helps me. Try and picture the river with anything that helps comfort you by it. listen to the sound of the flowing water in your head and don't listen to the idiots who want you to smoke weed|`|fdtB4XHtaa	xanax|`|7gL9laqLaa	don't thik about it|`|DuSvfGDLaa	SMOKE WEED!|`|wTBMD5R0aa	yeah have some weed.|`|a8wrGXQAaa	Breathe for me your diaphragm. When doing this, your stomach should get bigger when you breathe in, and smaller when you breathe out. If you are doing it correctly, your shoulders should not move. This reduces stress levels by almost 75% ! Good luck.
jw6Lpt37aa	it is between the range of  0.5 - 5.0 it means that your  thyroid hormone is normal because it is within the range best of luck
dNtJ9Ob9aa	First of all pop is garbage.  Second your still growing.  Why the hell would you want to diet so you can see your abs like brad pitt in fight club.  C'mon just focus on eating healthy to provide your body the nutrients it needs to continue to grow. Stay active play a sport focus on building muscle these next couple of years then worry about building abs when you actually have muscle all over your body.  Girls love a guy with nice big legs, shoulders, chest and back.  They could careless about abs if the rest of your body is weak looking!
GBZQP5pAaa	It could be from different thing...    The beginning of a cold or strep throat  From allergies-mucus drainage  Smoking  Dry air-dry throat  acid reflux|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Gargle with some hot salt and water. Or drink hot tea...I had it for a few days and all i did was drink tea and took some cough medicine..Hope you feel better.|`|Uiew8yuCaa	Take ibuprofen and gargle with warm salt water. Keep an eye on your temperature if it goes up and stays up for any length of time go see a doc.|`|a8wrGXQAaa	If the pain is on a designated side of your throat, then there is a high probability that you may need your tonsils out. Especially if it comes and goes.
f8mLpPXlaa	You should be alright.  Is it for urine or blood? Urine you can forget about it. Blood you should be alright.|`|0Mj9b0Aoaa	I passed a drug test 5 days after I shared a joint with my friend.  Really depends on the person, metabolism, and frequency of smoking etc.  Also depends on the depth of the test.    25 days should be ok.    6ft 1inch, 190lbs
In1UqryNaa	yes it is!|`|4CyXKudJaa	Yes it can! Salmonella can be spread from person to person by the fecal-oral route, which means by pooh. This is why babies are more likely to catch it from person to person because other babies faeces can get in their mouths or if you touch someone who doesn't wash their hands and then you touch your mouth... its hard to explain, but this is where I read it:    http://www.drgreene.com/21_1088.html|`|UZxeBrxQaa	No!    Its a stand alone bacteria.  I wouldn't be kissing anyone who has an active infection at this time.  The bacteria can still be present on her lips.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Technically, salmonella IS an infectious disease.    You can contract salmonella by ingested contaminated fecal/vomit particles.    You can also get it from cross contamination/contaminated surfaces.|`|jlZZbdIjaa	Yes it is. Salmonella can be spread from person to person by the fecal-oral route.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	No.  You have to eat infected food, or get it on your hands and transfer the bacteria into your system.    TX Mom|`|Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi shawn,    Yes salmonella is DEFINITELY contagious.    Love Mel.X|`|uTF5yAsyaa	yes cause i had it on christmas day for 2 weeks and still recovering and i cant go back to work as i work in a old peoples resthome and got to wait till im clear
AA10766729	If you're THIS paranoid about pregnancy then I strongly recommend not having sex at all.      It doesn't matter if you use 1, 2 or 5 methods of contraception, sh*t happens and the very rare pregnancy still sneaks through.  This is just a fact of life and reproduction.    And the nuva ring, just for edification's sake is about as effective as oral contraceptives or about 95%.  The condom is about 85% effective.  Combined, your average level of efficacy would probably be about 99%.
Tc23KWgzaa	Yes, that's the flu.  Go see your dr. NOW.  If you catch it in the first 24 hours, your doctor can give you a shot that helps you have a short, easy case of flu.    TX Mom|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Go to bed!!!    Drink lots of fluids and treat the symptoms.  This has to run its course and time will take care of it.  Meanwhile, don't panic.  Just rest, and stay hydrated.    Get off the computer and try to sleep.
tpZwcYLQaa	google it??    better yet ask your nurse|`|BIlDIRNCaa	The formula for losing those unwanted pounds is simple - eat less food and move more - the difficulties arise when we really try to put that into practice! There are plenty of temptations in the real world aren't there?! The one diet which clearly delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I worked off twenty five pounds, it clearly does work!
kvLWTTlhaa	Glutamine is one of the twenty amino acids synthesized in the human body, coded for by CAG and CAA.    Glutamic acid, or glutamate, is a different amino acid, coded by GAA and GAG.    Hope it helps =]|`|AA12208063	Don't know if this is what you are looking for, but here's what I dug up.    "The carboxylate anions and salts of glutamic acid are known as glutamates...Glutamate does not easily pass the blood brain barrier, but instead this transport is mediated by a high affinity transport system.  It can also be converted into glutamine."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_ac...    So I am reading that glutamic acid=glutamates, and these can be converted to glutamine.    I also found this rather scientific page from an MS site:  http://www.mult-sclerosis.org/aminoacid....
zDeEaja0aa	Just Curious what is your exact reasons for a body fat analyzer? Typically you do not really  use these efficiently in less you are extremely athletic or into body building. Most gyms keep on site and if you are a member they will  calculate the body fat percentage for you for free. Plus it is just as accurate to measure fat percentage by taking measurements and taking the numbers and putting them into an equation.    Here is a site that can help you calculate your fat percentage by your age, height, weight, and measurements of different portions of your body.     http://www.healthstatus.com/calculate/bf...    If you are just trying to lose weight or become healthy this isn't really a good tool. There are a wide range of acceptable body fating on body tones and proportionsypically if you are in a healthy range for your weight, you will have a healthy bmi as well, and in return your body fat percentages are in a healthy range.    If you are really interested in still purchasing one here is a website that gives reviews on the right hand side under the the prices.     http://shopping.yahoo.com/s:Scales%20%26...|`|UaOxV97waa	mirrors are cheap  :D|`|UfpLTtVPaa	The best way to burn fat is to eat less food and move more often, the issues surface when we in reality aim to put that into practice! There are loads of opportunities to fail in the real world don't you think?! The sole diet that definitely delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials remaining, it was highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I worked off thrity pounds, it definitely does work!
AA12208063	I don't think it will react, no, but those pills are just a scam to lighten only your wallet and not your weight.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	It shouldnt, since those pills are just a pill form of the actual berry. As always, go to the pharmacy and ask or call your doctor to ask.|`|km2rYhTcaa	ask a doctor i mean i could give u an answer but i know nuthing and ure kinda slow for askin a medicinal question on yahoo and dont use yahoo answers when it comes to asking medical question for your kid okaaay|`|gT3dIKiFaa	Harvested in the rainforests of Brazil, acai tastes like a vibrant blend of berries and chocolate. Hidden within its royal purple pigment is the magic that makes it nature's perfect energy fruit. A?a is packed full of antioxidants, amino acids and essential fatty acids. Although a?a may not be available in your local supermarket, you can find it in several health food and gourmet stores (often in juice form). A new product featuring the unsweetened pulp is now also available, and I highly recommend that you choose this form of a?a.  It has amazing properties to heal and to help you lose wieght.
cdb58ec09082c219d5a820928a9f856aaa	Well...there could be a myriad of reasons for your situation.  Birth control or Plan B is not 100% effective but normally does work.  The best thing to do would be to calm down and just wait it out to see your doctor or until your period does come.  Many things can cause your period to not come and your current stress could be one of them.  You can't change the situation you are in now, no matter what, until you know what is up.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	You took plan B on Monday Jan 26.  You should expect your period on February 23.    TX Mom|`|Uhx444QSaa	Don't worry it will come soon, i promise|`|3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	That's normal. Periods aren't always regular. I highly doubt you're pregnant--especially if you took two pregnancy tests.   Stress also causes periods to be absent for months at a time.|`|fL6jNee5aa	It could be a number of things.  No one on here is going to be able to tell you anything that you cannot think of yourself.  wait for your dr. apt  and dont have unprotected sex.|`|Cha4lyL9aa	first of all stop worrying. this makes it worse, stress is major factor on hormones. Dont panick. forget the 28 day cycle, its rubbish. Very few a lucky enough to be regular as that. You can upto a 40 day cycle and be perfectly normal! If you've taken test ur unlikely to be pregnant.  If its more than 40 days since ur last period  c ur GP. It could be PCOS. I was told i had it last summer. But since losing weight my cycles have gone from bein 50-70 days to a 29-33 day cycle.|`|rctDnhO1aa	plan b only works within 72 hours of unprotected sex, so maybe u waited a little too long but the sooner you take it the more effective it is, also a pregnancy test wont show up positive until your like a month along, so the most you can do is wait for the drs appointment. sorry|`|7Bjvmfyiaa	well you do know that even the pregnancy tests must be done the way it is prescribed on the box like: in the morning, clean urine and so and so....since you took the plan b, you shouldn't be pregnant! I will pray for you; just try to relax you shall see, you are not pregnant!
tvQStwpGaa	I had cancer when I was in 5th grade, beat it, and then it came back in 6th grade. Don't worry about that. Chances are very low. There are roughly 300,000 childhood cancer survivors in the USA. Chances very very low. Go ahead and live a normal life.
y8HyP1bzaa	Haha... why are you freaking out?  That's what is SUPPOSED to happen!  Calm down.  Of course this is normal.  If your period starts out totally regular, you are very fortunate and should be grateful!|`|lry4ncIBaa	yea thats good your a lucky 1 lol xxxx|`|b3MtlxSEaa	Lol yeah that's fine.  Everyone's cycles are different.  It may start on a different day next month.|`|PSyVB2UDaa	awesomeness. that's sooooo lucky but also reallllly normal. good look with the dot|`|ojEkgJoqaa	everyone is different and it was regular. lucky for you. i would keep a chart from now on|`|7Bjvmfyiaa	usually you count 21 days from last day of the period and that should be the first day on your next; that is for when it becomes regular! Now, since you just started, you might experience regular months and also irregular ones too...no reason to be inpatient as long as it still comes...in time, it will be regular!|`|2UfEnYQMaa	that's super normal =) i know a girl who has her period the exact same day every month, and usually around the same times hehe.|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	That can be your normal. I am really regular on my cycle and start the same day each month.    But you should write your periods down on a calendar and make note of how heavy or light it was. I did this and it better helped figure my cycle out.
ed6f99e6575c9cec31b59c2c164358a8aa	Don't panic it's my dad. He'll just take what he needs and go.

He's probably originally from the far east and he's just showing his hospitality by removing his shoes at the door.     Now, if you are seeing this being way out in the woods I have one question for you: How the heck are you getting internet access out there?!
9tyaBnAJaa	Does the medicine contain naproxen or ibuprofen? If so that would most likely be the cause. Both drugs can be extremely hard on the stomach. I would talk to your doctor about it to be completely safe.
AA11352641	It could be because your mouth gets dry|`|L6YL8Wi2aa	u can chew chewing gum, i happen for everyone. But if it smell very bad maybe u have some problem same as a rotten tooth or an upset stomach.
7149XmBqaa	Somewhat.  Did you get the jerks?|`|v5XYluuFaa	bad trip?|`|DtNG81h9aa	y r u smoking weed u freak??!!|`|4VcTd3eCaa	smoking that,causes all kinds of weard things to happen next time that happens try sitting down and breathing slow but deep breaths.
Ua3l7OXpaa	No, it means you're hormonal like many other women. I don't have an anxiety disorder or depression, just around the time of my period I get anxious for what seems like no reason. It's hormones.
42f524fe9c1830a2ded7f9dd4152a9a4aa	Do not lose weight. You are healthy at your size. Your BMI (body mass index) is 21.61 and anything between 18.5-24.9 is considered a healthy body weight. You should just exercise and continue to stay healthy!|`|42EGqo4zaa	The pattern for losing weight is easy - eat less and exercise more often - the problems surface when we actually try to put that into operation! There are loads of temptations in the big wide world don't you think?! The sole thing which definitely showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a few free trials in stock, it has been featured in Fox News and USA Today. I melted away 30 pounds, it definitely does produce success!|`|2GMF9iKvaa	no! You are a perfect weight for your age and height.  trust me!      you might even be too skinny

sJIt2cJFaa	your belly will keep decreasing in size the more you exercise  so dont over do it!!!|`|f9J0UvYIaa	Ok no your stomach will not get smaller, cus this is an internal organ, if you mean the the skin and flab then yes it will excersicing, drinkin and eating correctly and also wearing appropriately fitting clothing, (ie dont have a muffin top go a size bigger if you have to), but it is vital that you exercise as in aerobics, treadmills, etc... suck in your stomach as you exercise and also as you walk around in general, it strtengthens the muscle, do minimal stomach crunches, cus you will just turn the flab to muscle, for every 30 mins exercise do 20 crunches..    good luck and remember have fun, if exercise isnt for you try a dance class, or something fun and exciting... eat right, move and have fun...
twuxLLzZaa	It's quite natural to have irrational fears, but fears for things that aren't even relevant, are perhaps a bit more uncommon!    I advise that you talk to somebody, a councilor perhaps or even just a good friend. Talking about your fears and anxieties is really beificial, it can help you get them sorted in your own head if you let them out!    A councilor is likely to be better, because they can offer advice that is more reliable, having had training.    Maybe you could even try a phone helpline, like the samaritans.    I hope you're anxieties go, and you feel better again :)|`|bELqEsdOaa	I know how you feel. A few years ago in high school (still a little today) I would get anxiety for going to school or even going to a basketball game in the gym. I would get extremely stressed out and very paranoid. I was going to a vacation with my girlfriend to Wisconsin Dells to go to Mount Olympus (water slides rollercoasters) and I just got absolutely stressed out on the way up. I had no reason to be at all. I just let things bother me like that and I am getting better just by telling myself that I have nothing to worry about. As long as I try my best I'll be fine. Maybe it's something different for you. Maybe you should think more about the positive things that would occur if you had your own family and your own restaurant. Maybe that would help.|`|nTDlqdHIaa	Well they are not silly. Some people might say that having a fear of heights is silly but to someone who has that fear it's anything but silly. As for being robbed I think anyone would be afraid of that but it's not something to think about all the time. As for not being able to feed your baby and wife before you even have a wife or a baby...just make sure that before you get married you have a steady career. The restaurant thing...ummm...I've worked in restaurant for 3 years now and I don't own one but I know that mistakes happen and messing up a few orders is going to happen especially if it's a busy place. Slow down a bit and cross that bridge when get there don't worry about the bridges you can't even see yet. Don't be so hard on yourself.
5j1Uhg2Gaa	I had fractured my growth plates in my arm and I'm normal. The doctor said the same thing to me, but my arm still grew like my other one. I guess it depends on how badly you hurt it. I also dislocated my shoulder and they said it would pop out easily and it never has. Personally I think they try to scare people so they will take it easy during the recovery period. haha
11d28a719b061143141cbe5fe883288caa	y would u want to its fun and feels good|`|ZII6YCk1aa	I want to ask how but I won't. Two simple answers, 1) turn over,duh 2) stop masturbating.|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	why and how do you do that?!|`|581AaVoJaa	try force urself to masturbate face up or in a chair but seriously how u u jerk off face down?????
7D44tO9Daa	yes, it is defiantly and sure sign that your period is on its way, but it may  not come right away, could be week or even months!|`|TxV2DRpNaa	its possible. You would have other signs as well. Moody, Cramps and do you have tenderness in your breasts??|`|Xc9KZ4Fxaa	It's possible.|`|AA12185077	either that or you have gas. are your breast sore? that's another sign.|`|XElaAuHHaa	Hello,    it certainly sounds like it my happen, this is a typical symptom of period pain.     Do you also feel more cranky that usual and a bit low? Back ache? if you do its more than likely going to happen.    Don't be scared though, its a hard time when it first happens - but you will be fine! Just maybe get yourself some supplies, just in case - so panty liners and mini-tampons.    Typically for me period pain happens a couple of days before, if it lasts more than a few days have a chat with your mum as she will know what is best!    It may also help you to know that typically girls/women are on a similar wave length and for some weird reason if women live together their cycles happen usually at the same time, so if your mum is also about to start her period this could also be a sign.    keep smilling!|`|ehMOlypTaa	It could be a sign. Other signs to look for are tender breats, bloating, irratability, backache, and head ache.     Try taking Midol or Pamprin to help with the cramps and bloating.
0XY7d8lOaa	The only thing I have to say, is that someone should really call your school up if they want you to injure yourself for a project.    I'm honestly not buying that it's for a school project, it really doesn't sound all too realistic.    You might as well get a failing grade if it's really for a project.    Chances are that anywhere on your body where you bleed a lot, it's either because you hit a vein, or you made a deep gash wound, honestly neither are worth an A+, or a trip to the hospital.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	donate blood, can't guarantee you won't faint though|`|ocK1s59baa	what kinda project is that? doing a little self mutilation research?|`|8HDQMkSBaa	Wow...I cant wait for your parents to SEE that project...They'll be so proud|`|gqi2a4yqaa	emo much?|`|qFOdHHCDaa	Go and see a psychologist
YUg8GHAEaa	Get a Wii the games are fun and good exercise.Do you really need to loose that much weight? As you are young and still growing you are better maintaining your weight until you grow to the right height for your weight.If you are that overweight just make sure you eat plenty fruit,veg,lean meat, potatoes not chips,wholemeal bread. a treat of chocolate evey week.Don't starve yourself as the brain thinks it's a famine and slows down the metabolism and you won't loose weight.|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	The only thing i can think of is the Wii fit, it may be wise to invest in one

224cm8qtaa	VIBRATOR!|`|AA12198724	do some kegels and try to space out your masturbation sessions. You have stronger orgasms when you have longer gaps between them. Like go a few days without masturbating and doing at least 100 kegels a day and then masturbate at the end of the week and you will have a pretty intense orgasm. Also if you hold in a kegel while masturbating it improves the intensity of the orgasm.    http://www.clitical.com    Kegels are exercises that help strengthen the pelvic floor and tightens your vagina. You squeeze your pc muscles in and out. Just follow the link above for more masturbation tips and there is a spread on exercises.
YEd9Q5KZaa	I really think you should just leave it. If you're comfortable with how it is now, keep it that way. Shaving is a waste of time in my opinion and I hate the fact that women are expected to shave.|`|838VJJGvaa	It's okay.  If you buy a razor buy something like venus.  Nothing cheap because you can cut yourself easier with them.  A sharp blade is a safe blade.  Also you have to press really hard to get cut. Buy some shave gel or use soap.  Never shave dry.    Good luck.|`|xzZfzkZMaa	you feel so much cleaner when you shave. and you can't feel hair when it grows out of the skin. i mean how would you know anyways if you never shaved. anyways its so much easier you feel so much fresher and cleaner.|`|ocrnjukoaa	Well maybe you could shave your underarms only if you are uncomfortable. Legs aren't really a big deal. =]|`|vSmop8Vhaa	It is all personal preference.    I'm 27 and I shave my legs about five to six times a year. I have very thin hair, so it's hardly noticable. I always wear cargo shorts or skirts...so that's how confident I am that my hair is that THIN and that I don't need to shave.    As for the underside of my arms, I like to pluck my hair when I have time. If not, I do shave. Once every two week or so.    It is up to you if you wish to stay 'au naturel' or shave.|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	As long as you are comfortable with not shaving, there is no reason for you to do so.    I wish I had as much confidence as you and could give up shaving.|`|rcdTluUjaa	That's a personal preference, you could try it, and if you don't like it quit. Shaving has nothing to do with being clean. It is a socially excepted norm. If you don't have a lot of hair, and you aren't bothered by it, then I personally wouldn't bother. I shave my armpits regularly, but I rarely shave my legs. Mine is more of a lazy issue, I really don't like doing it, so I don't, and my husband doesn't care, I also don't have a lot of hair on my legs either. Generally you don't cut yourself, you just have to be careful, and use a shaving cream, Get a razor with 2 or 3 blades. You kind of have to experiment with which razor works best for you,|`|MhpccWpmaa	I would try it... you never know, you may like the smoothness.  This way, you don't have to be embarrassed if someone sees your armpits.  People can be really mean about things like that.  Try Bic Soleil disposable razors.  I've tried many different types and these are by far my favorite... they work wonders.  Using lotion everytime after you shave can help to prevent irritation|`|60mDEusiaa	You could try it. I shave my armpits more than anything, especially in the summer. Buy a 3 blade razor and get a good shaving cream(the gel kind) . Don't press down hard on the razor, just move it across the hair. I usually don't cut myself. Really,the worst is that you'll nick yourself, and the deodorant will sting a little. It's really only necessary if you're wearing a swimsuit or tanktop. Good luck!|`|JovxU43qaa	I think it's your choice, but I shave.    -You won't cut yourself if you shave slowly and with shaving cream.    -It will grow out but you will have a cleaner look and be able to wear tank tops and short shorts.      -Yes, buy a razor. I recommend any razor by Venus. There are several different kinds. I have the Venus Vibrance which I like a lot it has vibrating technology which helps get a smoother and closer shave.    -If you don't like the feeling, shave everyday so you don't have that feeling.|`|L2cg59QQaa	Its totaly up to you. I know a couple of people who are lucky like you and can get away with not shaving their legs, as theres not much there anyway.   As for razors, i tend to just buy a cheap multipack of them! Not great but i go for the cheaper option. They can be fairly sharp at first, so you need to make sure you buy some shaving foam too. Or at least lather up some soap before shaving. Or, if you check online or somewhere, you can buy dry shavers that you don't have to use in the shower/bath, and can just shave right away.   But ive been shaving for a few years and have never cut myself, so as long as your careful, you should have no problem.   Also, just take care of your skin if you do. Like maybe use baby lotion afterwards or something so they dont go dry or anything.   But again, the choice is yours. Hope i could help. x|`|MXRXG62oaa	im 18 and been shaving since about 12 or 13... i HATE shaving and i wish i never started. gradually ive been shaving less...   well to answer your reasons...  -no you wont cut yourself if you do it right and use a new razor  - it will, your right  - venus are the best  - thats HORRIBLE, i agree. it feels itchy and prickly and just awful.      Should you shave? Up to you. I'd say if your comfortable not shaving, then dont. if you feel like youd enjoy having smooth legs or armpits, then shave. but remember, there only smooth for that day! then they get prickly. And if you shave once, it appears to grow back darker and "sharper"/    Whatever floats your boat.|`|teK6BHgzaa	i hate shaving coz im scared of cutting my self too i use nair hair removal cream it takes 10 mins and its really good no cuts or anything and it doesnt sting wen u put deodrant on hahaha   hope this helps xxx|`|AA12198724	If you dont want to you dont have to.

My wife has never shaved for me.  So not every woman does.|`|oXXFo2ATaa	what in the heck.   You're 18?|`|cQNOWMktaa	I began shaving at age 11, due to peer pressure.  I'm glad I did it though.it feels so weird to have all the hair off your legs. It's kinda easy at first. You have to shave like every other or two days. It gets annoying, but you never have to shave in winter. It grows in black, no matter if you were blonde or not.    Knicking[cutting] yourself isn't that bad. It burns a bit, but the scar goes away after a day. Shaving underarms is hard, because you have to shave in all directions to get all the hair. You only have to shave underarms like once every two weeks, luckily. If you have alot of underarm hair, it IS noticeable. Especially if you ever wanna go swimming. You can see underarm hair even when you're wearing a t-shirt sometimes.    You don't even feel the hair growing, haha.Trust me. It feels prickly on legs, but not underarms.    Go after pink razors, or anything that is Venus[Shaving Brand]. You are less likely to knick yourself if you use shaving cream, never use soap. So, I recommend shaving.

Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.  Hope this helps :-)|`|Gx1CbI56aa	Yes, it's a great natural product. The acai berry is high in anti oxidants and other things. They are a really great way to help augment a solid an exercise and diet program if you are looking to lose weight.    The Acai berry is gaining popularity because of being featured on such TVs shows as The Today Show, Rachael Ray and Oprah. What are some of the other reasons why acai berries are healthy?  They also help combat fatigue and other things. I have been using them for a couple months now and I have noticed a difference. The best bet in my opinion is to take advantage of the free trial bottle offer that many companies selling the acai berry offer that way you can decide if you really like them without having to buy.    Thats what I did and I used them along with a diet and exercise program and it worked for me. I found that the acai berry was very good at curbing my urge to snack which really helped since it can be so easy to blow that workout right out of the water for naught if I gave in to my urges and had that mid afternoon snack.    I got mine from here|`|QDl5owvNaa	No. It's a scam for your money. Just eat lots of healthy food and drink lots of water.

rT7BDLpxaa	Actually, circumsion lessens the chances of STD, cancer, HIV and AIDS.  In the late 70's-90's doctors said there really wasn't any benefit but over the last decade most have refuted that decision.|`|TsjqzanQaa	Circumcision is genital mutilation, and how could a partial, mutilated and scarred penis be better than a whole, natural and normal one?    Those who were circumcised usually aren't aware that their sexual sensitivity has been diminished, by an average of 50-75%, and since sex still feels good, they don't have any concept of what was stolen from them along with their foreskins.    I have restored my foreskin, and can attest that the sexual sensitivity is wonderful, and orgasms are far more intense, the way that nature intended.    There are no benefits to male genital mutilation, it doesn't prevent infection or disease, these are all lies and rumors promulgated by those who make money from circumcision, and frequently are members of the religions that try to impose circumcision on all males.    80% of the men in the world are intact, that's normal and natural.  Circumcision is unnatural and abnormal.    Very few males ever choose to be mutilated, most are victims of circumcision in infancy, and didn't have any choice in the matter.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.    ERIC|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	Nothing.

yF8F9k27aa	hey you,   if you call 911 and tell them you're feeling suicidal, they will come and you will be treated right away. Even if you aren't actually suicidal at the moment, it might be worth it to say you are so they take you to be treated soon, ya know? your doctor should be controlling your dosage,  and you shouldn't mess with that. i'm sure if you wanted to talk to your doc on the phone then even that is better than changing your dosage yourself because they will tell you if you can up it or not before your actual appointment. also maybe you need to change your type of medication and you need to ask the doctor for other options. you might even want to talk to a herbalist to give you natural medicine. make sure you research the medication you are given thoroughly and try to get the most natural one possible if you can because a lot of the pharmaceutical ones have negative side effects. don't get me wrong, if you have to take that one because it's the only one that works then take it, but always ask about other options. from my experience, exercise helped my recovery a lot. there are many types of exercise you can do and maybe you want to make your workouts more intense  or fun or even get involved in a sport because they give you natural endorphins which make you happy. if that doesn't sound very appealing at the moment, consider getting into art. Many famous artists suffered from depression and used art as therapy. even if you aren't proud of your first pieces, keep going or look at other pieces for inspiration. maybe you are an artistic type and don't know it. i always liked drawing but i didn't take it seriously. then i started selling painting for cheap on the beach for some extra cash during college just to see if i had any luck and i sold ones for $165 dollars eventually and now they're up in galleries. if you don't wanna do that, try to dive into a good book and get lost in it. although i don't do yoga a lot, something i've learned from it is that when you are doing a painful position, you are not supposed to see pain as pain, but rather than a sensation that is new that your body is not used to, so it is best to accept the sensation as a sensation and not as pain and just endure through it passively. i kind of use this idea when i'm feeling under the weather. when you're depressed, your mind plays tricks on your and makes you feel inadequate, and that is painful. instead of buying into it and listening to that, separate your voice and tell yourself that it is just an episode and you are feeling unhappy and that is okay and it will pass. kinda like when you were little and scared of noises and creaks outside but you thought they were ghosts, but when u knew better and grew up you know the creaks are actually just wood cracking in an old house or the wind. right now, your chemicals are fluctuating, but they aren't all of  you, they are just chemicals playing tricks on your feelings. you yourself are a great person with a human brain that has the capacity for a lot of potential and creativity. just like you know 2+2=4 everytime, know that you are an important person with a lot of potential for greatness even if you are in a rut right now and that is as sure as 2+2=4 100%. just because you don't see the solution now, doesn't mean there isn't one. so, with all that said, i hope i awakened you to a few things and take care of yourself and reach out to people if you feel you need help. it is great that you are doing that already, but definitely call your doctor and ask for their opinion on what to do until the appointment. things will look up soon. take care, friend.|`|YtR2CB4oaa	Try and get another appointment with your doctor as soon as you can and tell him you're not feeling any better. I strongly recommend not upping your dose without medical advice. Given that I don't know how old you are or your medical history upping your dose could be very dangerous. You may want to suggest trying a different kind of SSRI (antidepressant). Also I wonder whether you are in any kind counseling or cognitive therapy. Depression is a bit more then just a neurotransmitter problem and really effects cognitive processes (how we think).

Men get yeast infections and its called jock itch, babies get yeast infections and its called diaper rash.  Diabetics can get them anywhere on there skin, when its in your mouth it is called thrush.

In that aspect it may be a good idea to get the pills.     The pill doesn't eliminate the period, it just puts it on a dedicated cycle. It would probably not change your cycle dates the way you want them to. You would start a cycle of the pills the first day of your period and take them for 21 days.

If you usually start on the 5th, after this month, it should start coming around the 3rd since this month is shorter.     If you end up going on the Pill, it takes abouta month to kick in. it also makes your periods much shorter (like 2-3 days) and the cramps aren't that bad. There is a catch though, lots of girls gain weight on the pilll so make sure if you get on it, you get the right kind.    There are other ways to make it more comfortable though. If you don't eat as much sodium-filled food right before your period you won't be as bloated. Try taking Midol, Pamprin, or Advil. Those work a lot too.

If your not sexually active I wouldnt do it. You dont know how it will affect you. Periods are a normal part of life. You may just have to deal with having it while your at camp. I think you should just deal with it rather than messing with your hormones.

Simply say 'okay i made a mistake, after all i am only human, it is not going to rule my life though. I am stronger then this.' i'd also suggest finding a different way to express yourself. I for one sing ( i sound terrible but i find it comforting ;) ) but do something you can take comfort in and make that the thing you depend upon instead of cutting yourself, k?|`|n8nhjmfraa	i know how hard it is to ive up cutting and going back to it. it has been the story of my life for a few years now and i understand how frustrating it is to go back to it when you really don't want to and you feel like you're a failure.  the best thing you can do know is understand how terrible you feel for doing it and when you get the urge to do it again, think about that time and then do something that will let you relieve your stress and pain like a stress ball or running around the block a few times.

wdzKF70maa	You reevaluate What you are looking at. Things will go on around you but that doesn't mean you have to let them consume YOU.  Instead of looking at the wrong look at the good.   1. you are Breathing and ALIVE  2. you are blessed to wake up   3. We are all blessed with the ability to choose.   4. You have FREEDOM  Some cards are dealt to us that are out of our control and we can not change that but ther are things we can change. And taking that step will help you. Make small goal to make change in your life someone said if you are at rockbottom there is no where else to go but up. You have to change your thoughts.  When you start to look at everyone else and what they have more than you . Take a step down to the MISSION in your area. or Look at the homeless in your area. There is always someone worse than you. Or go to the hospital and look at the mental patience who cant make their own decisions. When your world looks hopeless, REEVALUATE how you perceive things.If you see that things are hopeless Find hope.. Its all over, everywhere you look.

b3MtlxSEaa	Sounds healthy to me!  Only thing, don't eat for 1-2 hours before you go to bed as that is when your metabolism slows down so any food you eat becomes fat.  Hope I helped!|`|vB5cTqrzaa	It's pretty good however I would increase you caloric intake (moderately women can need anywhere from 1200 to 1500 a day).  For breakfast, 70 cal is not enough.  Try adding some oatmeal and fruit in the mornings (or a hard-boiled egg (not the fried kind) with whole grain toast, if you like the creamy yokes learn to make soft-boiled or poached eggs).  Also, instead of pretzles how about a handful of nuts (almonds, walnuts) or some hummus and whole grain crackers, or sugar-free peanut butter on whole grain crackers for your snacks, it's low calorie but I find gives me a 'full' feeling that lasts much longer.    I would also switch that meat every night for some fresh water fish (salmon is great), it you hate fish look into some meat alternatives (tofu, lentils, beans).  Meat is fine but I'd really only have it 2-3 times a week (Tofu has come a long way baby).    Looking back over your plan, it's seems a tad low on carbohydrates, they are the building blocks for cells and you NEED them to be a part of a healthy diet.  The trick is to eat healthy carbs (whole grains) vs unhealthy carbs (white flour based breads, pastas, rice).    I would recommend you get the book "Eating well for optimum health" by Andrew Weil and stay away from books having to do with zones, beaches or atkins!    Good Luck!    ps. you mentioned exercising, I hope you are doing a combination of aerobic exercise and weight training as in my experience only a combination of the two keeps those love-handles at bay :)|`|lry4ncIBaa	ya i agree just try to eat the evening meal a little earlier  and avoid the late night snack x
vMByDy1raa	Yes it seems healthy, I would add a little 50-100 calorie in the afternoon .  Why don't you eat in the morning or is this when you wake up? Make sure you are drinking enough water.  Are you trying to loose weight ?  This sounds like a weight lose diet.|`|WPVpOfuwaa	You should not eat past 7:00 pm.|`|PZ9OSv9naa	It seems healthy, yes.  But I would add some fat into your diet.  Your diet seems composed of just carbs and protein.  Remember fat isn't bad for you. You need it to live.  Instead of the fruit before bed perhaps have some nuts for a snack to get a little more fat into your diet.|`|qy7C8Ybvaa	yup seems okay, dont be afraid to eat more, though :)|`|VUIEnZpnaa	Just one peice of lettace a day, its sure to work

This is how most adults work out their problems...either by having the dialogue with ourselves in our head, or with a spouse or friend.  You are teaching yourself self-control...one of the many things that show maturity...and by verbalizing it, even internally, I'm sure you have worked out a good many of any problems you may have.

I taught my second wife how to meditate and she never stopped thanking me.  It clears the mind of all negative thoughts and matter.  I teaches you to do this at other times as well.  Two: Get up and do something different than what you are presently doing.  Get involved in some community activity and start to help others.  We help ourselves the best when we are helping others.  Third:  Go to church and pray for God's intervention in your life.  Good luck buddy.|`|G9VBTg47aa	These "mental health" freaks think they know everything...

NvPD6VBoaa	Just because you carry a mutated gene doesn't mean you will get cancer, it just means you are at a greater chance of getting it.                             Please Read this from the National Cancer Institute    Our genes affect virtually all aspects of how our bodies grow and function. Alterations or mutations in certain genes may increase a persons lifetime risk for certain types of cancer. While a mutated gene does not cause cancer, it can increase an individuals risk for cancer. A persons risk for cancer, however, has many factors besides genetics including diet, exercise, and exposure to environmental influences like cigarette smoke. As a result, some people who carry a mutated gene their entire lives never develop cancer while other people, who do not carry a mutated gene, may develop the disease. While increased risk for breast, ovarian, colon, prostate, and other cancers has been linked to specific mutated genes, scientists are still working to understand the specific interaction genes, behavior, and environment play on cancer risk.     We inherit our genes, including those with mutations, from our parents. A mutation may also occur during a persons lifetime, and the mutated gene may be passed on to his or her children. Gene mutations linked to cancer work in the same way as those linked to other traits or disorders. Some are autosomal recessive, meaning that a person must inherit the mutated gene from both parents in order for the gene to affect them. Others are autosomal dominant, meaning that a person can be affected by a single mutated gene inherited from only one parent. But even if someone inherits two copies of a mutated gene, the gene must be expressed, or turned on, in order to be effective. Behavioral and environmental factors can help to determine whether or not the gene is expressed.|`|vVfH8yBYaa	It only takes one... a very lucky one, perhaps, but only one.  If that mutation happens to alter apoptosis, increase the frequency of reproduction, or in some other way affect the replication rate/life span of a cell, it can cause cancer. But first it has to survive the mutation. The vast number of mutations cause cell death. The little buggers never have a chance.

el8yX5q3aa	Yes, blind people do dream. What they see in their dreams depends on how much they could ever see. If someone has been totally blind since birth, they only have auditory dreams. If someone such as I, has had a measure of sight, then that person dreams with that measure of sight. I still dream as though I can see, colors included. For people I've met since, their faces are just blurs or how I imagine they look.    (1). Who are blind by birth : These people do not see colors in their dream. Their dreams includes only noises & emotions.    (2). Who became blind due to any happening in life: These people see colors in their dreams but the intensity of the colors is associated with the time when they last seen the colors in their original life before being blind.|`|ZIUDcqfmaa	don't know, never been blind|`|6p5IK0kcaa	yes, you use your mind to dream|`|DFFADqjraa	it depends. If they have seen colours and objects then yes as they can still see the memorys and picturs in their minds. If they were born blind then no as they have never seen colours for their brain to process the image for a dream|`|oihouY7Naa	If they are blind since birth then I say no.|`|7xmr5R6qaa	excellent question, I figure they can but only if they have had sight.   What I would like to know is what color it is that blind people see, for example I've heard people say it's dark, but does that mean it's black or what.  I haven't had the courage to ask the question cause there's always people who come up with stupid answers.|`|Q887qawLaa	omg that is a really good question!!!  haha cool  (sorry i didnt give you an answer...lol)|`|iEVEfPaVaa	people who had sight at one time know what color is and will dream in color.  There is no way for someone who never saw color to  dream color.|`|XmPNoraWaa	if they are born blind, they dream in lights and shades and thoughts.  if you are born with sight and become blind, you can dream how you did before the blindness
7s5OU7Sxaa	i think you diet and exercise is fine except you need a little upper body exercise to keep it toned and not lose any muscle while losing weight. if you don't have any equipment you could just do some form of pushup which will work your chest back and arms at the same time. negative pushups are an excellent type. just get in the up position and lower your body slowly. about 10sec. then use your knees to get back in the up position and repeat til you can't control speed. one set is all you need to do and only about every other day.  also, body for life has a good cardio routine too. below is a link if you'd like to look at it. takes 20min. and a good alternative to change things up and also if you are pressed for time.  food wise. just check your weight weekly and you can tell if you need to make any adjustment. add or delete just a little amount from each meal dependent on if you are losing or gaining or staying the same.|`|dNtJ9Ob9aa	Why so much cardio?  You training for a running marathon?  You really only need to hit abs maybe 2 times a week at the end of a weightlifting session.  Oh yes why aren't you doing any sort of weight lifting?  Do mostly dumbbell or barbbell work and some machines.  Lift at the minimum 3 times a week(no you will not get "bulky" guy muscles").  Diet: Make sure you're getting protein at every meal/snack.  Lean meats, raw nuts.  Extra virgin olive oil on salads.  Eat moderate/low complex carbs      Use fitday.com to track how much you burn in a day and eat about that much then burn calories so it puts you into the negative.  This way you'll be feeling healthy looking healthy and a fat burning machine.  I'm like a freakin furnace why because I lifted hard 4-6 times a week and do lots of long walks for cardio everyday.    Visit figureathlete.com  there is some real knowledable women there with bodies that will blow your mind and some lift pretty heavy for their size GASP!!|`|kc68BXwTaa	First off, I'm not sure you're eating enough protein. A general rule of thumb is your weight in kilograms (118/2.2) times .8, meaning that you need 53.64 grams of protein a day. One serving of chicken (which is about the size of a deck of cards) is 21 grams of protein, and the chicken is the only large source of protein that you listed.    Also, don't get hung up on numbers so much. I'm the same age, weight, and height as you, and I'm a size 0 (although my bodyfat percentage is low, and I'm fairly muscular, in a toned way, with "abs").    Do other exercises too (lunges, push-ups), so that you gain muscle everywhere: I've never seen someone with "abs" and arms that had no definition.
Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Zbignew,    An ECG is simply a test just like taking your blood pressure. It shows the rhythm of the heart. After the ECG the doctor will have a look and see if there are any problems. A report will be sent to your GP.    From what you say it doesn't sound as though there is likely to be anything wrong in the ECG at all.    If there was anything they were not sure about she would probably have an echo cardiogram. This is just another simple test where the run something which looks like a microphone over the heart to hear as well as see what is happening.But from what you have said I doubt that this will be necessary.    If there were to be a problem, she would just be put on medication. We are certainly NOT talking surgery here because if she required surgery she would be having many many more symptoms and discomfort.    I know it's your mum and you love her, but really darling an ECG is nothing to be worried about. Also when the doctor referred her for an ECG, if he/she was that concerned he would have had her go and have it immediately and certainly wouldn't have allowed her to wait.    I hope this has helped you.    Love Mel.X|`|0lCnu1g2aa	an ECG is simply a 12 view tracing of the heart over about 10 seconds.  What the dr will do is based on what he finds on the ECG. He may order a stress test, which can be done by walking on treadmill or several medications can be given to make the heart work. They are looking to see if she has chest pain or changes in the heart tracings. Both would be considered a positive stress test and would need further testing. See what happens with the ECG first. Many things are treatable with medications.|`|WKF1DqAAaa	Look here...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echocardiog...|`|567c6b249f5eaa8b96d284566ebe653faa	The gold standard for heart muscle testing will be a stress test either treadmill or chemical using radioactive contrast media to get a good picture of the heart muscle blood supply. If this test shows a problem then the Cardiologist will want to do an Angiogram while injecting dye to visualize any artery blockage.

Its almost as effective as accutane but way less expenisive and w/o the potential negative side effects. I started taking the pills right now, I'm on my 3rd day so I really cant evaluate it now but will post my results after a couple of weeks.

Too many young ladies want to crash diet, and it really messes with their bodies.    There's some really good online tools at the USDA food pyramid website. It will give you calorie intake goals and break down your goals by food group. There's also a system that figures out your complete nutritional intake when you enter the foods that you have eaten.    It's a little tricky to figure out this whole system at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's soooo much easier than trying to add everything up by hand, or guessing at what your totals are.      Edit: I forgot to mention - since these calculators are standardized, they are meant for an average person. If your frame is especially large or muscular, or especially tiny, you may need to adjust their goals a bit. They are pretty accurate for most people though.

I have that same fear.  I am engaged and we are going to get married in September.  It would financially devastate us to have a baby.  Because birth control and condoms aren't completely trustworthy, it's going out on a limb.  But instead of harassing my boyfriend about it, I am trying to sit down and come up with all of the potentials of what we would do if I did get pregnant.  Almost like a fire-drill plan.  Unfortunately, having sex comes with the risks.

If3jPUrkaa	How tall are you? What do you weigh?  Just wondering. I would eliminate salt, sugar, and white flour.  And soda...assuming you have already done that, just increase your cardio/aerobic activity and you should be kissing those pesky love handles and pouchy tummy goodbye!!   Don't forget to drink a lot (8+ cups, more if you are exercising a ton) of water, as this will help keep you feeling *full*, and help your body eliminate some of that toxic fat from your body.  Good luck!|`|v4MyOrTZaa	Well dieting at your age is not healthy. You need to really wait and see how your body develops as an older teen. When I was 15 I weighed 145 pounds and pretty dang chubby. By the time I was a senior in high school I weighed 120. This all happened because my body was not done growing. You really should wait. But as a normal teen you probably can't. Try cutting out ALL sweets and carbs for a month. It will work! SWEAR it!|`|IY9gqPUAaa	At 15 your metabolism should still be quick. Start exercising, and it doesn't have to be a lot. Simply start with a few short walks and build up to jogging, 15-20 minutes everyday. Also, for a 15 yr old, start endurance weight training. The shock to your muscle system will super-shock your metabolism and you should start firming up within a few weeks. you lbs. may not decrease that much, but you will drop some fat and tighten up your muscles.|`|AA10408696	pouchy belly you are going to have to diet,  and exercise, there is no easy answer for that,, you can do all the situps in the world and tighten the muscle under fat,|`|AA10698098	Burn fat-get your heart rate up,do crunches.lower your fat and carb intake|`|AA11416836	I am a health instuctor and I cant stress it enough.

The information is easily accessible to anyone who wants to know.    I would rather get the vaccine, than die of a disease that could have been prevented.  Most people would, unless they did not believe in vaccinations to begin with.
zQiwHJV6aa	It could be unrelated to the fall completely.  Sounds like you might have had a migraine headache.  Maybe it was related to the fall.  Either way, talk to a doctor.
Q4ggnG0waa	I know a young guy that's had a small tumor in an inoperable area for years. He's monitored, but that's about it. I had my tumor growing for many years without realizing my small problems were symptoms of the tumor growing. Def. grew longer than 4-5 years. Everyone is different.|`|VCIZJQCJaa	why don't you go see another doctor.it's been 6 years,and it's time to put it to bed.brain cancer is what ted kennedy has and doctors only gave him 6 months to live.(it depends on the type and how long it's been since first diagnosed)he is not doing well.when the doctors checked his symptoms they look for about 25 symptoms like headaches nausea vomiting,dizziness.loss of appetite,visual problems weak arms and legs,trouble walking,speech problems,memory difficulties,balance difficulties to name a few.you did not list any of these. however it may be another problem,but go see the doc.it will stop the worrying.|`|AA10563860	You would likely have died by now.  Also if the tumor grew you would have significant head pain fi it got to be of any size.  Tumors would also create symptoms that get progressively worse..such as my vision is blurry >>>I can't see ****.  The twitches are probably from lack of oxygen in the muscles probably from being out of physical shape.  I have read that odd things happen to your brain and you can have odd sensations if you drink tooo much diet sodas...good luck|`|tnEIPjccaa	I doubt it is possible to live that long with untreated brain cancer. My mother had brain cancer and died after two years, while being treated. Without treatment she would have died in months.     the thing is, with brain cancer, When you leave it untreated, the tumors continue to grow, and put pressure on your brain which will cause brain swelling, which causes more pressure on your brain, and it will suffocate because the swelling wont allow oxygenated blood in.    You would be dead if it was brain cancer.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	What you are describing is more likely anxiety. You should get a thorough check up firstly with your GP, then possibly a specialist such as a Neurologist. My father had brain cancer, this did not kill him, he suffered a major heart attack which took him. In a way it was better that he went sooner rather than later, at least he did not have to suffer any more. BTW many people live much longer now due to advances in medicine. Good Luck.
NzuV7dQLaa	You know you're getting old when you see landmarks and remember what USED to be there.
AA11991489	It may give YOU better balance as you perceive it to be of assistance. in fact, if it's the ear opposite the leg that you're standing on, the act of holding the ear could physically be helping to balance the body out --much like an animal's tail keeps them in balance. Probably more so in your case, as you've noticed holding the ear helps, you're concentrating on that and not being distracted--thus, better balance.|`|AA10859291	Are you over there laughing your rear end off picturing thousands of people on one foot.........grabbing and releasing their ears?......And trying to note if there is a difference?  LOL   Well, I just want to let you know we ARE out here in one big long wobbly line across the world, balancing away!  I have no idea WHY that would work.  It didn't make much of a difference when I did it.  Good luck on your research.  :)  Thanks for making me smile (just before I almost feel over).
XhIYAH6Laa	you could take a cool washcloth and put it on your forehead and the back of your neck, that should cool you off a little bit. Take a warm bath, not hot, as cool as you can tolerate. Just relax and rest as much as you can...|`|7d92fea894a319f966b40ae7494fa5a5aa	Do not take medicine for a fever that low.  It's best not to take fever reducing medicine unless your fever is over 103.  Fever is helping cure whatever the problem is.  Fever makes your immune system work better.  If you start to get chills, go to bed and rest.

58d34da1292dde1e2adf19fa22f4fdbeaa	I got increased discharge when I was pregnant.      Tips to get rid of discharge:  Sleep with no underwear, wash underwear in fragrance-free detergent, use conditioner on your pubic hair.|`|AA12337032	Soap, the kind of underwear u wear..|`|AA12345516	It could actually be caused any of the things you mentioned, but even if her pregnancy test comes back positive, I wouldn't take for granted that the pregnancy is what is causing the discharge, she should check in with a doctor either way to make sure it's nothing serious that could cause harm to her or the possible baby if left untreated.|`|c7538bf63f0a029a07eca2aaadb67b9baa	It doesn't have to smell to be an infection.  So many things can cause a change in discharge.  She should really make an appointment with her gyn to be sure.  A lot of women self-medicate thinking they may have just a yeast infection when it could be a sign of something else.  Also, if she thinks she is pregnant, I am guesisng she had unprotected sex.  Many STD's can cause a change in discharge.  Again, she should see her gyn and get tested.
Y63Q4bnOaa	She needs to go to the Dr.  I don't understand why she would not wear it. I play hockey as well and it does not slow me down. It's thin and you can hardly tell it's there. It's a rule, everyone has to wear one. I don't like helmets either, but I wear a helmet.|`|AA12198724	Yeah she seriously needs to get that looked at. The GYN is not going to make fun of her, they take an oath to help people not ridicule them. If she doesnt then it is going to get serious.|`|G37z5ldaaa	if that was a dude it would be a bigger problem but she will be fine..just let it heal a lil bit for a few days|`|UrH2SSvUaa	She should definately go to the doctor before she gets any permanent damage.|`|87pV5lvZaa	First of all, I would recommend her going to a female gyno.  A female DEFINITELY would not think that this is funny and would certainly take your girlfriend's concerns seriously.  If she is self-conscious about seeing her current doctor, then she should get a new one.  What help is a doctor whom you feel uncomfortable going to?    I highly doubt that your girlfriend has caused any permanent damage, much like there is very, very rarely permanent damage when a guy gets hit in his scrotum.  However, a doctor may be able to ease her mind, or--if nothing else--give her a numbing gel, such as lidocaine, to decrease the pain.    If it were me, I would give the pain and swelling three to five more days to decrease.  If I saw no improvement, then I would seek a doctor's opinion.|`|AA12185077	i'm sure she's just bruised. but should still go to the doctor and be seen. i'm 43 female. do you know how many times i fell on the bycycle bar when i was a little girl?A few times. and mines not broke and still works fine! Good luck and don't worry. help her so she doesn't have to get up as much untill she starts healing.bless your heart for being sweet like that. your a good man!!  lisa|`|cJRFbZUaaa	She should get checked at the gyne's.  She will probably recover on her own, but she needs to be sure there's no lasting damage.|`|uiVEaxjqaa	Yea she really needs to go to the doctor.
wxzeKh4Iaa	She said that because of the 2 lbs.  A pound of fat is equal to a pound of muscle. The difference is that muscle is more dense, it takes up less space.|`|KPtrfsEYaa	she made the comment cause if you lose weight it will show up on the scale.  You don't just gain muscle.  At the end of the day the scale is not going to lie to you.  I used the whole muscle thing as an excuse before to make myself feel better.  As you "gain" muscle you burn fat around it.  Some say the muscle is always there, but if have to make the small micro tares for it to grow. I hope that made since|`|AA11746917	Muscle does weigh more than fat, but the contestant was at the beginning of her weight loss journey. If she only lost 2 lbs in 30 days, it isn't because she built muscle, it's because she didn't lose the fat. That is why Jillian was so disgusted with her. Jillian and Bob were basically saying, "Look, you didn't do the work. Own it. Stop making excuses." If this had been someone who had been working out and losing weight for quite sometime, I think their reaction would've been different.
bXGgFhRjaa	It may be hormones or some other disease like bipolar or depression.|`|jPlUycx0aa	you might be bipolar|`|m7putYGmaa	im the same way... i think i only have one GOOD week out of the month    even if you're not on your period, there is a shift of hormones a week before AND after it|`|3Qh9QDXCaa	bipolar disorder?|`|By1DJAUOaa	im the same way...|`|VWO9tW5eaa	you could be bipolar. or since you're a female you're period might throw your mood off. if you're a teenager thatll make it worse|`|66jX06Onaa	Lots of women go through this.

wNBb2kbVaa	It does sound like an eating disorder.    She needs to get help before it gets worse. And if she doesn't get help, it WILL get worse. When she does eat, do you know if she makes herself throw up afterwards?     She says she's not losing weight? Not eating can actually make you become fatter because of the lack of food, her body will eat away at the fat already stored in her body.    Hair loss is just the start of it, my friend has permanent blue nails now because of anorexia and bulimia. You need to do everything you can to get her to stop before it's too late.|`|8yygCf9Yaa	yes she does, i suffer from an ED myself. and this is def the start of one.  talk to a trusted adult about this.|`|XSTjyO1naa	Definitely, she needs help. As a friend you should take responsibilities and approach to her parents about this. As you don't want to see her suffering from this problem. Anorexia is a serious health issue and need to be addressed with caution but early for it is in the benefit of the patient.   Here are some informative sources on this.|`|Zz1HI5VHaa	Go to this website. it has all the answers you need. it even tells you what signs to look for. How to approach her and who you can turn to for help.
Lq1OjNfeaa	No it's proven that you wont loose weight if you do or dont snack after 7p.m it all depends upon what you choose to snack on. If you do decide to snack, eat something small around 100-150 calories so that it will maintain your blood sugar levels. Eating huge snacks or high calorie snacks after dinner make you not hungry in the morning which ruins your whole day of eating.|`|rH3ylNuYaa	how big is your ***?|`|bmoCpcdraa	yes do not eat after 7 drink lots of water 8 glasses a day no soda pop|`|TCwf6HXNaa	doesn't matter how late you eat it's how soon you fall asleep after you eat|`|uXWvDjWHaa	Yes... stop eating 3 hours before you go to bed. If you are STARVING, then just eat 1/2 an apple or carrot sticks, something small and healthy. It'll help you shed the last few pounds quick.|`|x9MhuJg4aa	I don't really know but, If u think about it, It does make sense.  b/c if u eat right b4 going to bed, u r going to accumulate that food that u ate.|`|xT6TQvElaa	Yes it's true! Stop eating 3 hours before you go to bed because when you lay down and get ready for bed, your body doesnt digest the food, so it just stores it in your body as "fat." your body typically digests food in 3 hours so if you go to bed at 9, be done eating at 6. and if you go to bed at 10, be done eating at 7 :)

Tell her not to worry but she's a teenager and she will obviously keep worrying about it.  But no being 125pounds and 5'2" is right around what it is recommended.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	I'm 25 and have the same dimensions (for lack of a better word) as her. I don't think that I am fat. It definitely depends on how fit she is though. Someone can be thin on a scale but heavy in looks. I think that is a good size for her though.|`|dNtJ9Ob9aa	My sister is a 106 and 5'4 and she is very slim.  Honestly it's hard to say cause everyone has a different body composition (some have a higher bf then other people)  So how a person looks varys greatly.  A picture would help alot!  Im guessing she looks a bit chunky if you even have to ask this over the internet.  So help your sis get active and do something.  Play a sport in the park or gym do something please.  Tell her to stop being lazy and wasting time asking strangers questions.  It's obvious she doesn't feel good about her weight.|`|CcxqcyH4aa	no|`|mYGbxuCAaa	im 5'5 and 104 lbs, but i have bulimia/anorexia, she prbably is a good weight it sounds a lot to me but shes 4 years older than me so her bod is probably fully developed, so my answer is no shes not fat|`|ca7oHPHZaa	no|`|1O9jE4P2aa	omfg. you got to the kidding me. NO SHE IS NOT FAT> tell her to sit down and shut up.     Im sure some of this has to do with a low self esteem and what society makes girls think of what they should look like. Shes not fat! Not at all. Shes at a healthy weight.|`|0RMI5Ln2aa	i'm 14, 5'3 and 125-130 lbs    i havn't weighed myself lately    so nawww, she ain't fat|`|G3uTp7dpaa	noooo way.  shes perfect! (:|`|h8VymQlTaa	no way. not at all. Super Skinny!|`|Jf2HI6nMaa	NO. not fat. But she is a girl so she could maybe lose about 5 to 10 pounds to be in shape. Also check her body fat percentage. For an average girl it should be around 14 or 15%. But as far as weight compared to height she is about average.|`|iQ3yEnSpaa	not at all|`|qBkDnX6Paa	No she is definitely not fat. Granted, I don't know what she looks like so it all depends. You can be small and have more muscle and look very thin and weigh more than a girl who is taller and looks heavier because muscle will make you weigh more. If shes really worried her size then toning up is always an option, but I am sure she is plenty thin :-)    I would advise her not to lose ANY weight :-) so screw the people who said she could lose a few. And do the guy who things 150 is big for 5'5", you're an asshole too... although thats not what i'd like to say :-)

Sozc3MyFaa	Use a over the counter steroid (1% hydrocortisone) 3 times a day: but NOT daily for ever!.  You should be able to clear up the rash in 1-2 days.  The rash could be due to several things:  irritation from using a deodorant right after shaving (change to shaving at night); or allergy to the ingredients in the deodorant. In which case, change to a hypoallergenic one.  In any case, try to not use it while the rash is still present for the few days you are treating with hydrocortisone.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi sweetheart,    It is not going to have changed too much in a year.    I get the impression that you had your physical somewhere other than your own doctor or hospital. In other words, with someone who didn't know you or anything about your medical history. if this is the case they are simply covering their backs.(No pun intended)    Usually anything below 20 - 25 degrees is considered mild and will require no treatment other than monitoring.25 - 70 is still only considered moderate!    I think if you pluck up courage to have another x-ray it will put your mind at rest that there isn't much change.    X-rays won't give you cancer darling, it is prolonged exposure to radiation that would cause problems, certainly one X-ray a year isn't going to hurt you.    I cannot comment on insurance because I am in the UK and I don't understand how it works.    Is it your own GP who said he thought it had got worse? I am not too clear on that point.    Try not to get too stressed out about it, you know what the procedure is as you have had it done before so you know that there is not going to be any pain or discomfort involved.    Take care and good luck.    Love Mel.XXX

Q4ggnG0waa	Whatever the word is, no it's not true.|`|716335ab6ea56965d0cb4b7367b650edaa	You might find it here; Chewing gum is a type of confection traditionally made of chicle, a natural latex product, or synthetic rubber. For reasons of economy and quality, many modern chewing gums use rubber instead of chicle. Chicle is nonetheless still the base of choice for some regional markets, such as in Japan. Chewing gum is a combination of a water-insoluble phase, known as gum base, and a water-soluble phase of sweeteners, flavouring and sometimes food colouring.[citation needed]  Contents  [hide]        * 1 History      * 2 Types      * 3 Manufacture      * 4 Use in military      * 5 Possible health risk      * 6 Chewing gum ban      * 7 See also      * 8 References      * 9 External links    [edit] History    Chewing gum in various forms has existed since at least the Neolithic period. 5,000 year old chewing gum with tooth imprints, made of birch bark tar, has been found in Kierikki, Yli-Ii, Finland. The bark tar of which the gums were made is believed to have antiseptic properties and other medicinal advantages. [1] The ancient Mayans used chicle as a base for making a gum-like substance. Women in particular used this gum as a mouth freshener. Also, the Florentine Codex refers to the use of chicle by women.[2]    Forms of chewing gums were also used in Ancient Greece. The Greeks chewed mastic gum, made from the resin of the mastic tree.[3] Many other cultures have chewed gum-like substances made from plants, grasses, and resins. The American Indians chewed resin made from the sap of spruce trees. The New England settlers picked up this practice, and in the early 1880s attempts were made to commercially market spruce gum. Around 1850 a gum made from paraffin wax was developed and soon exceeded the spruce gum in popularity. Modern chewing gum was first developed in the 1860s when chicle was imported from Mexico for use as a rubber substitute. Chicle did not succeed as a replacement for rubber, but as a gum it soon dominated the market. Chicle gum, and gum made from similar latexes, had a smoother and softer texture and held flavor better. Most chewing gum companies have since switched to synthetic gum bases because of their low price and availability. According to their website, Glee Gum is the last gum manufacturer in the United States to produce gum using all-natural chicle.[4] In 1848, John B. Curtis developed and sold the first commercial chewing gum called The State of Maine Pure Spruce Gum.    William Semple filed the first[citation needed] patent on chewing gum, patent number [5], on December 28, 1869.    [edit] Types    Chewing gum is available in a wide variety of flavors, including mint, wintergreen, cinnamon and various types of fruit. Mintier flavors are often chewed for fresher breath. There is no standard type of gum, as it can be formed in many different shapes and sizes. Some examples include:        * Ball gum - shaped like a ball and coated. These are most often sold in gum ball machines. In the United Kingdom, these are often referred to as 'Screwballs', as they are found at the bottom of a 'Screwball' ice cream treat. In the US, they are known as "gum balls".      * Bubble gum - formulated with film-forming characteristics for blowing bubbles.      * Sugarfree gum - made with artificial sweeteners.      * Candy & Gum combinations - predominantly bubble gum found in the center of some types of lollipop, such as Charms Blow Pops.      * Center-filled gum - Pellet or ball gum formed around a soft or liquid centre.      * Slab gum Cut & Wrap gum - refers to the name of the machine that wraps this type of gum, usually in the form of a chunk, cube or cylindrical shape.      * Drage gum or "pellet gum" - a pillow-shaped coated pellet, often packed in blister packs.      * Functional gum - a chewing gum with a practical function. Zoft Gum, for example, specializes in herbal chewing gum products using gum as the delivery system for vitamins and minerals among other substances.      * Medicated gum - a chewing gum acting as a delivery system to introduce medicinal substances into the saliva and thus into the bloodstream faster than pills.      * Powdered gum - free-flowing powder form or powders compressed into unique shapes.      * Stick gum - a thin, flat slab of gum.      * Ribbon gum - very similar to stick gum in shape, but much longer, coiled up in a cylindrical container often shaped like a hockey puck. The chewer tears off a piece of the desired size. (See Bubble Tape)      * Tube gum or Spaghetti gum - very soft bubble gum which can be squeezed from a tube.    [edit] Manufacture    The approximate manufacturing methods are fairly constant between brands. The gum base is melted at a temperature of about 115 C (240 F), until it has the viscosity of thick maple syrup, then filtered through a fine mesh screen. Then it is further refined by separating dissolved particles in a centrifuge, and further filtered. Clear base, still hot and melted, is then put into mixing vats.

mhLaOFZRaa	I have had sinus problems for years and I get that taste when I have drainage.  Try using a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water and using a medicine dropper, a turkey baster, or just crease the edge of a paper cup and put some of the water into each side of your nose letting it drain out the other side. If you don't have any of those things just put some of the solution in the palm of your hand and suck it into the right side of your nose letting it drain out the left side, then repeat with the left side.   The salt is a natural antibiotic and will help clean out your sinus area.   Next about 4 times a day gargle with some of that warm salty water to help clear up the discharge in your throat.     This is one the best things you can do for a cold, sore throat, sinus drainage, sinus infection, soreness in the sinus area, sore mouth, or sore teeth in case you have any of those in the future. (Great to use after dental work or after having braces tightened)    Hope this will help you.|`|LnCMtkiUaa	Drink lots of fluid, it is the bodies way of telling you that you have dehydration, to make you drink.

AA11101044	All the other answers which speak about sleep are right on. Good food, lots of fluids and so on. The stuff your Mom taught you will make you feel better. However something to consider. Sinus infections in multiples are often the SAME infection just coming and going. You can have bacteria colonized in your sinuses and without taking antibiotics for a sufficient  period or taking the wrong antiB's it just reflares after time. Your doc can prescribe specific 3 view x-rays or a CT which will show the colonization or if there is some other reason for recurring infection. Once the proper diagnosis is made and the proper therapy initiated keep it up to completion. True sinus infections don't respond very well to OTC treatment. See the doc, do the time and you will feel better soon. Best of luck.|`|yAoldffKaa	I have one right now, and I've had it before too. My mom says it's because my sinuses won't let any mucus flow (??) which is kind of like a cold except it makes your head hurt.

FT2dOlZEaa	Here are the basics:    The average length of an erect adult penis is about 5.5" - 6".    Its worth remembering that the average adult penis is 'designed' to fit the average depth of the adult vagina which is also about 6".     There is no normal or average size for a soft/flaccid penis because they vary enormously. Some guys shrink a lot more than others when soft. You can NEVER judge how big a guy will be when he is erect from his soft penis size.    The average girth of an erect adult penis, that is the distance AROUND the penis measured at the thickest point, is about 5". Anywhere between 4.7 and 5.2 is normal.     Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18. Sometimes up till about 24 or 25yo.    Approximate lengths for under 18s are:  At the beginning of puberty 2.4   12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0    To convert to cm, just multiply the number in inches by 2.54cm. For example, 5 X 2.54 = 12.7 So a 5" penis is 12.7cm|`|E64juLwJaa	Depends on your genes  Planets.|`|5sSjx4GXaa	Sure it will, You will continue to grow in that area up too age 21. I gained another inch between 18 and 21 years of age|`|nx8lxAJdaa	Yes it probably will. Your peak in size will happen when you turn around 18, so that means that you have a good two to three years of growing left to go. And if you are wondering by how much, first your penis gets longer and then when it stops lengthening it will start to grow bigger.|`|LX0EOsCHaa	if it isnt a foot long yet id be worried|`|dkoGI9nfaa	The times given by medical information organisations are all estimates based on averages.  That does not mean it will happen like that for all people.  Taken this approach one should say that you still have a good two years of reasonable rapid growth of you penis ahead of you.  After that it will in all probability still grow but at a slower rate until in your early twenties it will stop growing.  A mate of mine, whose dick was probably smaller than most of us in our teens, grew about 4cm from 20 to 24.  He ended up being the well hung one of the lot of us.  So your penis will most probably still grow a lot more.|`|sndBzQzAaa	Maybe but don't expect anything drastic.|`|UdeUrTCSaa	dont listen to chunk he is a idiot|`|4Z5dr8ABaa	Yes, but so will the rest of your body.

iHkbrJF1aa	Try surgical spirit and if the ear ring is still in, you need to give a turn so that skin doesn't grow around it, it might be painful due to the swelling but if that doesn't do it then you would have to see a doctor before the infection spreads else where.|`|TgJZ9XJFaa	Warm salty water or contact lense solution works.

Obviously it isn't gold - Wash the ear lobe with methylated spirits soaked on a cotton ball. do this every hour for 4 hours. Do again before you go to sleep and apply some clean Vaseline. Again as soon as you wake up. If after 24 hours if this has not improved you will need to see a doctor, you can't afford for it to go septic - too close to the brain.     Go and buy yourself some pure gold sleepers, (when the infection has settled down) wipe your earlobes and earrings over with methylated spirits and vaseline, keep your hands clean and twist the earring through.
HyknHVV5aa	You could possibly have Celiac. Common symptoms are anemia, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, cramps and bloating, irritability. You have described the fatigue, cramps with pain throughout the body, and not being able to eat as much. Celiac is a medical condition in which the absorptive surface of the small intestine is damaged by a substance called gluten. This results in an inability of the body to absorb nutrients: protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals, which are necessary for good health.  Something to try is to cut gluten from your diet. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, triticale, barley. In the case of wheat, gliadin has been isolated as the toxic fraction. It is the gluten in the flour that helps bread and other baked goods bind and prevents crumbling. This feature has made gluten widely used in the production of many processed and packaged foods.  It's worth a try. Here is a link of foods you can eat and food to avoid to eat gluten-free. http://www.celiac.ca/EnglishCCA/egfdiet2...

zQiwHJV6aa	You can't get rid of a cold virus because it is a virus.  Your body needs to fight it off.  Colds usually go away within a week or so.  If they don't, talk to a doctor.    What you CAN do is treat the symptoms.  Go to the pharmacy and look for some cheap over-the-counter cold medicines to treat your headache or congestion.|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	Adam is correct in that there is nothing a doctor can prescribe to help a cold, it is a virus that only time will cure. You can use medicine for the symptoms...over the counter meds for the sneezes, sniffles, aches.     I have also found taking vitamin C helps. AND THE BEST THING IS taking Echinacea WITH Goldenseal. I buy it at Wal-Mart and take the maximum allowed on the bottle and I take it everyday and a few days after my symptoms are gone. Usually my cold is gone very quickly. Since you say it's your daughters who are sick and I don't know there ages, I don't know that I would do this for children.   But, if you get sick it's great. For the kids, Vitamin C should help!     Good luck!|`|SmF9yU2Eaa	chicken broth is good but if u can somehow get garlic into thier diet, thats the best ive used naturally...a doctor could perscribe a antibiotic tho...but garlic is a natural antibiotic...pasta sauce is good for that...especially if u add extra garlic to it...or roast the clove and add butter and the butter will sweeten it and they will probobly like it...i know it can be sour raw...i usually take a raw clove when im sick and it knocks out symtoms like stuffy nose, sore throat within like 20-30 mins.

You have to take extra care of any kind of piercings you have. Many people will tell you to put rubbing alcohol or peroxide on it, don't. The place you got it done, if professionally should have gave you some ear car product. Have you been using this twice a day at least? I would try using a Q-tip, and wash it out with antibacterial soap for awhile until the bump fades. If it doesn't, then I would suggest taking it out, and letting it heal.|`|YxWQ0KMZaa	You should go back to the place you got it pierced and see what they say or the bump could be from just they way your scar tissue heals. and the pain could be because it might be infected, the bump doesn'ttnecessarilyy have to do with it. just be careful nothing irritates it and clean it regularly

AA11434633	Unfortunately, dear lady, some complications can be quite personal and people won't feel like talking about them on an open forum.

Risk for Travelers  The risk of exposure to mumps among travelers can be high; thus all travelers leaving the United States should be immune to mumps. According to the current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations (8), acceptable presumptive evidence of immunity to mumps for international travelers includes:    documented administration of two doses of live mumps virus vaccine, or  laboratory evidence of immunity, or  birth before 1957, or  documentation of physician-diagnosed mumps.    Southern Africa  Vector-borne infections are common in parts of the region. Access to clean water and sanitary disposal of waste are highly variable but are poor in some areas (especially some rural areas). Vaccine coverage is high in some populations, but vaccine-preventable diseases, such as mumps, persist in parts of the region.
KoOasFpmaa	As other answers, adrenaline is good for giving a quick boost, but it's not really an 'energy' boost.    If you want to avoid energy drinks, then your next best best is sugar - chocolate etc. However, all that happens to the sugar is it's turned into glucose, which your body then uses for energy...and it's glucose that's in the energy drinks, so you're not really avoiding much...rather just having to wait slightly longer for the 'hit'.    If you're looking for a pick-me-up when tired, rather than an actual energy boost, try a small bit of exercise (I find a vigorous burst of air-drumming is good), a brisk walk in the cold air...basically, anything that will get you moving a bit and isn't what you're currently doing should serve to give you a bit of a kick.|`|nfOxiQ2zaa	Amphetamine.

CMjSkDOMaa	Don't think too much. The key is to just enjoy the sensations. He, more than likely, should take the lead and won't expect a sex goddess on her first time. But, if you think and analyze everything going on- which not doing is easier said than done, you will be beside yourself with worry and completely unable to enjoy any part of it. Definitely use a condom like one of the other posters said and realize it will probably be a bit uncomfortable your first time.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	Don't worry.  It's not a performance.  Trust me, no matter what you do, it will feel good to him to be inside you.  If he is such an 'experienced' sexpert than tell him to talk to you during it and help you become more relaxed.  The first time often hurts.  So, he needs to go slow and gentle and make sure that he either makes you wet or you use a lubricant.    Best wishes to you    PS IF he has had a lot of sex, than definately use a condomn~!|`|8FLJueRjaa	it will be good for him no matter what    proly his best because of how tight u are    and make sure he knows u r a virgin  and just relax  go slow  and have fun|`|d2zGNPUoaa	if he knows your a virgin, he will help you out and tell you what to do. most likely he'll tell you to do things the way he likes it, so every time you'll do what he likes. don't worry, everyone has a first time, and your guy should be helpful.|`|IYip0ttiaa	Use a condom :) Relax, and practice makes perfect *Lol*|`|mzkfSwLwaa	First thing if you dont want to do it when time comes its ok to say NO. Just try and relax is the best thing you can do. Start off with four play meaning make him horney by kissing him on the neck touching him etc..and most of all give him head

f8mLpPXlaa	It's probably not a good idea to exercise that much so soon. You really need to let your body rest in prder to heal properly. I'm not saying you should vegetate but get back into exercise gradually. Let your body be your guide.  And where r u that you can play soccer at this time of year? I live in florida and it even too cold here.
RzilBdJdaa	http://www.runningdeersoftware.com/produ...    This site's great for telling you how many calories you should consume in order to loose however many lbs you put in :)|`|fqnmZ23taa	noooo eat 2000 calories and burn 2000 calories. What goes in goes out.|`|fAI3E5qeaa	i think 3500 calories equal a pound. so you need to burn that many more than your body consumes.    that would be about one pound a week.|`|qy7C8Ybvaa	you never know how much you really burn because you body burns calories just by living so you would burn more than 500 i think. :)|`|c059nXPfaa	If you're male, you need 1637 cals to sustain your curent weight. That means you can eat 1637 cals and not lose or gain weight, with no exercise factoring in.  So if you eat 2000 calories a day, you need to burn 863 cals each day to lose 1 lb each week.  If you consume the 1637 cals and no more, you would still need to exercise enough to burn 500 cals to lose 1 lb a week.    If you're female, you can eat 1481 cals and not lose or gain weight.  If you ate 2000 cals every day, you would need to burn 1019 cals each day to lose 1 lb a week.  If you consume the 1481 cals and no more, you would still need to exercise enough to burn 500 cals to lose 1 lb a week.    (3500 excess calories burned = 1 lb of fat lost)    Use the tools below to help:|`|ZTPn4nRSaa	If your 15 you shouldn't be worried about it! Now the way it goes, your body actually needs calories to run so there is no way of telling how many it burns.You just need to expend more than your taking in.  So you wouldn't know on a typical day how many you did actually burn. Don't stress about it! If you are going to lose weight do it the right way eat right, take a multivitamin,and exercise for 30 minutes day. I lost weight eating right and doing cardio 30 minutes a day. Hope this helps! :)|`|ZmUgUl65aa	if yer a guy...   No. yer still growing.     if yer a chick... then you need to be a little more active in order to not gain weight and to lose it!!!|`|d8271459f70b3aecab5652f96ec7ab70aa	Maybe.  The average person burns 1400 calories just by breathing and living, therefore an additional 500 will be close.  Bear in mind that an average female's recommended intake is 1500calories/day, while the male's is 2000-2500.  Also, any muscle gained increases your metabolism which ups your daily burn rate.  If 500 calories worth of exercise is what you can manage then go for it.  It's better than sitting on your butt because you don't have the time to burn 1000.
QvIqTiaxaa	I am diabetic and if I cheat on my diet and eat sweets it gives me sudden high bloodsugar which causes my spit to get thick, it's because high bs causes very quick dehydration. you need to get a blood glucose test if you are worried about it.|`|8YhITQ7laa	It seems to be normal. I know it happens to me. Your saliva has a lot of sugar absorbed in it which makes it sticky. Probably not healthy because eating too much sugar obviously isnt healthy

B2K7NRuHaa	Sometimes colds can just be like that - they're all unique :)    I tend to get heavy colds too and what I do is take decongestant tablets - go to your pharmacy to get it over the counter.  It works by drying up your nose so it makes it less runny.  Also use something like Olbas Oil/Vicks rub to help open the passages to allow it to pass freer. Simply inhale it and you should notice a difference.      Also make sure you drink plenty of fluids as you're obviously loosing lots by blowing your nose all the time.    It will pass.|`|KZQyCeawaa	sinus infection and mabey something evan worse go see a doctor as fast as you can|`|e7I0PXBNaa	Soup, Sleep, and Strawberries. That's all you need If you haven't tried a decongestant that might be smart to try. However your symptoms sound kind of like allergies. You might see if your allergic to anything. Sneezing and a runny nose are the biggest symptoms of allergies. Now get offline and go to sleep!|`|88CcmApSaa	Drink some orange juice have some vitamin C.|`|K0iFV73Gaa	Go see a doctor HURRY!|`|t7rCYuNlaa	Ok, easy there. If your mucus in yellow or green colored you def. have a sinus infection. Simply go the the doctor and get antibiotics, you will be fine, it will go away then.     Otherwise sounds like a bad head cold, flu, or allergies.    You will be fine, but see a doctor incase of sinus infection.|`|AA11809403	that's pretty bad. you might have a cold + a sinus infection.    or you may have an allergy to something you are around all the time. same symptoms.    Colds tend to last about a week. But with your symptoms being so intense, i think going to the doc on the 3rd or 4th day would be reasonable.
kxyR9e57aa	You don't mention your ethnic or racial background, but the most common cause of what you have is something called thalassemia minor.  This is an inherited defect in the production of hemoglobin.  It will not affect your general health, you longevity, or your ability to have a normal, healthy baby.  The red blood cells are smaller than normal because of the hemoglobin defect.  The red cell count is elevated because your body is compensating for the smaller red cells by making more of them.  There are a number of other defects in the production of hemoglobin that can lead to small red blood cells.  The most common of those are sickle cell trait and Hemoglobin C, but both of these are usually associated with some degree of anemia.|`|K0iFV73Gaa	No just go see your doctor!

f8mLpPXlaa	Antibiotics is a broad subject. In general they chemically alter the bacteria's cell membrane so that it will either kill the organism or make it vulnerable to your body's immune system. Survival of the fittest is the key to resistance. if all the bacteria are not killed,like when you don't finish a course of antibiotics, the bacteria that survive develop a defense against the antibiotic. It's a mutation andif that particular mutation survives it could be resistant to the antibiotic that was used in the first place.   An example would be Staph. aureus which was a common infecting organism up until Penicillin came along. Now after all these years the Staph has become resistant to penicillin or any of it's derivatives.So they call it Methicillin Resistant Staph. Aureus or MRSA. The pharmaceutical companies have come up with different antibiotics that work with MRSA but they have problems keeping up with the mutations. Of course that's just one example but it does illustrate how resistance can develop.  Tb is caused by a bacillus that when coughed up and swallowed it isn't effected by the acid in your stomach. So they call it an acid fast bacillus. Back "in the old days" I used to pass a catheter into a patients stomach the first thing in the morning just after they had woken up and coughed and swallowed. It was the best time to get a sample for culture of the TB bacillus. The body forms a capsule around the TB to prevent it from spreading to other parts of the lung. On x ray it looks like a little white spot. So it used to be said that the patient had a "spot" in their lungs and you associated it with TB.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	An antibiotic is a medication used to kill an infection.  Antibiotic resistance develops when people stop taking or finish a medication and the infection is not completely killed. It causes the bacteria to mutate and become resistant to anitbiotics that once were efffective.     TB is short for tuberculosis and is an infection that is spread by droplet or through the air. It can be found in mulitple areas of the body, but most commonly the lungs. The concerns I have as a nurse would be not having antibiotics that will treat and kill the infection. The new strains may not be susceptable to INH and Rifampin.    Look up MRSA and VRE, and C diff for interesting reading.
RTY5VahLaa	Proteins produced by your cells are chopped up (processed) into small fragments by a proteosome.  These fragments are then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are mixed with MHC-I proteins.  If the MHC-I proteins can bind to the fragments, they are then transported to the plasma membrane where they are inserted and displayed on the cell surface.

hSC0s8MMaa	It could be because of stress or hormonal changes - you sweat more, harmless microbes on your skin (everybody has them!) feed off it and produce the smell.     Sour odor can be caused by diary and coffee in your diet.|`|R534McNOaa	.... It's possibly woodworm.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Maybe it's something you're eating.

My mother  said she gets it from just sweating...you will hve to increase you showers and use either an antipersperant powder after showering on the body as the sweat glands in your head just may sweat more than the rest of the body.
FMGyIkAjaa	I don't know where you live. but if your home has very low humidity, this can cause you to get some pretty bad nosebleeds. The low humidity will cause the membrane in your nose to rupture and bleed. You can help the situation by increasing the humidity level or if that isn't possible, get a small jar of Vaseline and a box of Q tips. Put some Vaseline on the Q-tip and insert it in your nostril, coat the inside of your nose, this will help keep the membrane in your nose soft and pliable and should eliminate your nose bleeds. You may have to do this a couple times a day and always before bedtime. My daugherty and I have to do this every winter.    melmaglobal@gmail.com|`|1pNfMUKaaa	You need to go see a doctor or buy a humidifier.

fh9QBfXpaa	I know you're probably looking for a woman's perspective, but all I've got is a guy's perspective.    Firstly, it sounds like an understandable situation.  Us guys have very simple hygiene.  I'm sure he understands that.    Secondly, he's joking about it and you've been together for 2 years.  I don't think your situation is in jeopardy.    Thirdly, tell him that he's hurting your feelings.     Lastly, your sex life won't suffer and he'll always find you attractive -- he's a guy.|`|224cm8qtaa	Oh wow. That has never happened to me. Hopefully he will let it go soon. I guess you could try to explain everything to him. If he doesn't let it go he isn't being very mature about it. Tell him to grow up. I get how he might find it funny but he doesn't have to keep going on and on and on about it day after day. Good luck honey. If he doesn't let it go he isn't worth it. He has some growing up to do. Next time.. be careful :)|`|82023d32c67aacffdd25314a33b1ea50aa	I'd be calling you poopy, nasty and every other negative synonymous word.|`|AA12198724	Tell him that it really hurts you when he makes comments like that and it was an accident and you dont normally do that.

It sounds like he is pretty immature. The fact that he continued to make out with you afterwards suggests it didn't gross him out as much as he claims. Although, I suppose, after all the distractions and chaos, your boyfriend does deserve a thumbs up for having a male organ still in a sufficiently turgid condition to give a BJ to!    About the only thing you can do for something this embarrasing is make light of it, the next time he comes over, let him know you did a thorough root cause analyisis of the "poopy incident" and made procedural changes to insure there will be no repeat occurrences. Then show him a sign in the bathroom that says "Don't forget to wipe yourself"|`|IulXRMV4aa	LOL dont worry it happens to everyone, I'm sure you will both forget about it 50 years from now.|`|cSOpcKOWaa	oh my god weren't you itchy and gross?

buU2w7dTaa	700-1000 calories a day?  Bad call if you want to lose weight fast.  Anything below around 1200 will cause your body's basal metabolic rate (i.e. the rate at which you burn calories) to drop significantly, into what's referred to as "survival mode".      It's just going to slow you down in the long run, and as soon as you start eating again your body will build up fat fast.    To figure out how much you want to eat, figure out how many pounds you want to lose.  To lose each pound, you'll need to cut about 3500 calories from what you're already eating.    Go to prevention.com/caloriecalculator to figure out your starting calorie intake (prob. around 2000/day), and cut by however much you want to lose.    Ex.  You want to lose 8 pounds in two months, or 2 pounds a week.  Cut 7000 calories a week, or 1000 a day, through diet and exercise!    Good luck!|`|c733cbdd7bdb701e2b7cc842b6d4e0d8aa	You need at least 1600 calories a day.  A young man your size needs the vitamins and protein to help develop your body properly.

Here's a basic daily menu (ask your mom for help):  Breakfast: a cup of yogurt or a bowl of low-sugar cereal and milk, piece of fruit or glass of juice  Lunch: broiled fish or chicken, or a can of water-pack tuna; 1-2 slices whole-grain bread; piece of fruit or one oatmeal cookie; glass of milk  Dinner: broiled meat, two sides of veggies, tossed salad, sugar-free gelatin or fruit salad|`|lWEWhyTtaa	If you're working out you shoul be taking 2500 to 3500 cals    dont go for losing weight    go for losing fat|`|TCwf6HXNaa	you should take in way more calories. like at least 1800|`|UfpLTtVPaa	Actually, you don't have to diet as such to lose weight, the sole diet that really showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials in stock, it was reported in Fox News and USA Today.

iqGaNZTtaa	Renal cysts...extremely common ..and benign.    Fibroxanthomas are benign, the xanthosarcomas aren't.    Calcified cervical nodes are no problem if they're histologically benign.    Isolated and not related.
iEVEfPaVaa	The interesting thing about your diagnosis is that all three can be related to calcium.  In addition to your lymph nodes being calcified, a renal cyst can be a calcium containing cyst, and Fibroxanthoma can be related to a problem with Calcium deposits and may contain calcium.  I don't find a major disease that contains all three but really feel that you should talk to your doctor about what relationship the three have, If there is (as your excellent Question has asked) a relationship of the three problems and whether you should be concerned about there being a disease as the bigger picture that is causing the three, and what measures you should take to keep yourself well in light of these diagnoses.  Hope this helps.
af4PkuU1aa	I really wouldn't suggest smoking too much your first time.  Definitely don't smoke an entire joint!   It won't hurt you, but you might get paranoid and freaked out.  Just have a couple of hits and watch a funny movie or hang out with friends.  And like others, I would suggest a glass piece, since it doesn't keep burning.  You know, for educational purposes only.|`|LCMCrmQTaa	Smoke a bong|`|mdyuUjDxaa	Invest in a bowl. (a glass pipe found at headshops...they are so cool they change colors after awhile when the resin builds up in your pipe, you can scrape the resin in a desperate time and get high off that also, but you have to make sure there is plenty resin to scrape, about after two months use) rolling a joint can be a little wasteful right now. Make sure that you have a full glass of water with you, as you will get cotton mouth.     A joint probably last about fifteen hits.     Get a glass bowl never use aluminum bowls.(pipes) (the metal ones) if possible as the aluminum builds up in your brain and causes alzheimers.    make sure you are in a safe comfortable place    there's nothing like getting high and watching Southpark. Here is a link to watch free episodes.     http://allsp.deltavid.com/    Also, make sure you clean out your body of the THC it takes about thirty days. Otherwise, you will build a tolerance and you will waste a lot of money and weed.     I would say after a week of smoking, clean out for a month to keep tolerance low and brain healthy    Be sure to take Omega-3 fish oils tablets/capsules so you can keep your brain healthy    Your gonna be hungry too so get a snack like beef jerky    I wish I was with you!

What I do to conserve the Joint is wet down the part where your burning the joint as your taking the hit. It will slow it down... My joints usually last around 10 mins.. But with friends... 4 or 5..We've been smoking around 3 years now. We haven't noticed any change in our Respitory system.. Our lungs are still healthier than most people... Running/Jogging for long distances still come easy.. Anyways.. If you have no Joint Wraps or a Bowl... You can make a Bowl out of a tissue roll... Cut open a Hole on the Cardboard..(About the size of a Nickel) Place tinfoil inside the hole and poke a hole into the tinfoil(Best done with a pen. Only the tip though) After you pack the weed in and hold your palm over the other side. While lighting the weed suck up and everynow and then take your palm off the the hole(The Smoke Will shoot up into your lungs) And you will get BLLLLOOOOOWWWEEEEDDDD.

I would suggest you use a pipe, they are easy to use too. If you don't have a pipe, use an apple. I don't want to explain how you make an apple pipe, but there are videos on youtube that explain it really well and make it super easy.    Have fun :)|`|IR0PSCG5aa	I Highly suggest using a bong. This is because it filters out the addictive ingredient in it. You will always get a good breath of smoke. Lots of people who use joints dont breath in right and result in not getting high. Using a bong saves you weed because joints are constantly burning even if you arent inhaling and the bong stops buring your weed as soon as you stop inhaling, saving your bud.           Search homemade bong on youtube and you will find a bunch of ways to make bongs out of the simplest of items. I myself make a living selling homemade bongs. Costs me: $3 to make. I sell them anywhere from $5-$20. Made over $200 so far. Great legal business.         PS: DONT USE SODA CANS. THEY WILL BRING METAL INTO  YOUR LUNGS.|`|vg1WARiIaa	YOUR GAY!  smoking is for lozers!  thats why i dont smoke cuz im cool ^ _ ^    SAY NO TO DRUGS!!!!!!  thats what SONIC the HEDGEHOG sais!|`|DBAQ4794aa	It is a known fact joints waste a lot of weed.   You should eat a special cookie. Cookies last for around 5 hours...   Bongs... That's the traditional way...    I suggest,  Buckets...   Your pumping approximately 2L of chronic at a time into your lungs, and very simple if you give it a chance.    heres a diagram  ------------------------  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...    Probably practice filling it up with any substance (tabacco),  lighting it... you don't have to smoke it.. you can just get a feel for how it works.    It's easier than it looks. Get a 2L drink bottle and cut off the bottom.  Grab a large container of water filled to just below where the cone piece is when the 2L bottle is in the bucket if you push it up and down you will notice it should suck and blow air from the top. Make sure the bottle in as low as practical. Put weed in cone (make sure not to push down or it will come out), light the weed and slowly lift the bottle.   You should have 2L of big fat juicy smoke.  Before the bottle comes out of the water, take out the cone piece, put your lips over it, and push right down...     (Don't suck the last bit just yet, you may get a mouth full of water)    To not get a mouthful of water  a) you slow suck it and make sure you don't swallow water  b)you just breathe in without creating a vacuum with the bottle  c) shot hole|`|2U8F93g1aa	If you want to conserve it you absolutely do NOT want to smoke a joint or a blunt.  Those have got to be the two most wasteful methods of smoking there are.  If you have access to one, I highly recommend using a vaporizer.  Its not as bad for the lungs and is great for conserving weed.  If you don't, I recommend a bong.  Use ice cold water because it'll cool down the smoke making it less harsh for your lungs.  To conserve it, just load small amounts at a time.  Small enough so that you can smoke the whole bowl in one hit. This prevents smoke from trailing up from the bowl into the air.  Most people really underestimate how much weed is wasted this way.  To answer your question about joints though... It really depends on the joint.  How long it lasts can depend on, how tightly it is rolled, how long it is, and how dense the weed itself is. I would say an average sized joint probably lasts about 5 minutes.  But don't take my word for that because I very rarely smoke joints because of how wasteful they are.
RXI8ImdIaa	DO NOT take whatever antibiotics are laying around. That is terrible advice, and it could end up making your infection worse.     If your throat is not better tomorrow, and/or it's accompanied by a fever, you'll need to go see the doctor. If you get a prescription for antibiotics, make sure you take it exactly as prescribed, and take the entire prescription - don't stop taking it until all the pills are gone, even if you feel better sooner.     To help prevent these infections, first don't share drinks or anything else that goes in other people's mouths. Also don't put things in your mouth in general, besides food. Don't chew your nails, chew your pencil, that sort of thing. Keep your hands off your face and eyes. Wash your hands before you eat - every time. If you can't do that, carry a travel sized hand santizer solution with you.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	gargle with hot to warm water and salt this will kill any infection in your throat and will ease the pain and drink hot lemon with honey this will reduce the cold and if you have vitamin C + Zinc  with antibiotics will be great to reduce and kill the cold before it get worse best of luck and stay warm|`|VqPfXf2Xaa	You can get strep throat again. Most likely you caught it from your friends, considering it can be transmitted through the air.    It's not bad. If you have any antibiotics laying around, take those. Else, just go see your doctor.|`|Xc9KZ4Fxaa	You can get strep throat over and over again. You cannot take anything that will stop it. But, you should go to the doc and get tested for it, then you will go on antibiotics. You should wash your IPod with rubbing alcohol after someone uses it, same with your phone. You can get those little alcohol pads from the doc's office and keep them in your purse.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	yes, you can get strep more than once.   If your friends were just around you, you may have caught their cold. If you didnt completely get rid of the strep infection with antibiotics, then it could be reoccurring. You need to do a strep test at your doctors office to tell if it is strep for sure. A sore throat is one of the most common symptoms of most colds and viruses.     If you have any trouble breathing go in ASAP. If your throat is red and inflammed for more than a couple of days, you should go see your doctor.  Seeing as how you just got over strep, I would make an appointment anyway just to make sure its gone.     Hope you feel better soon    EDIT: replying to the 1st comment - DO NOT just take any antibiotics laying around. when you get on an antibiotics from your doc, they are prescribed in certain doses for a specific time...if you do not take them as prescribed they will not work - even if you think you feel better, most likely the infection is not completely gone and it will come back worse than before and possibly resistant to that antibiotic.

You can put Preparation H on it.  "It shrinks swollen tissue"     Weirdest thing you ever heard, am I right?    My boyfriend got into a fight once, and had a swollen, black eye. (you should have seen the other guy!)  Anyway, we put Preparation H on it, at the advise of a friend of ours and it worked like a charm.  The swelling was gone by the next morning, and all that was left was the discoloration.    If yours is a deep tissue bruise, I'm not sure how well it would work, but it sure wouldn't hurt anything to try it.    Other than that, I can only advise you to use ice, on and off, and see how that feels.    Hope you are better soon!

Fat is lost throughout the body in a pattern dependent upon genetics, sex (hormones), and age. Overall body fat must be reduced to lose fat in any particular area. Although fat is lost or gained throughout the body it seems the first area to get fat, or the last area to become lean, is the midsection (in men and some women, especially after menopause) and hips and thighs (in women and few men). Sit-ups, crunches, leg-hip raises, leg raises, hip adduction, hip abduction, etc. will only exercise the muscles under the fat.  http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/Myths...|`|enOL04OIaa	well my grandmother taught me this really funny excercise ....

The early symptoms of mononucleosis resemble those of the flu, including:    Severe fatigue.   Headache.   Sore throat, which sometimes can be very severe.   Chills, followed by a fever.   Muscle aches.   After a day or two, these additional symptoms of mono may occur:    Swollen lymph nodes.   Jaundice (a yellow tinge to the skin and eyes).   A measles-like skin rash anywhere on the face or body; sometimes the rash develops suddenly after taking amoxicillin for a severe sore throat.   Tiny red spots or bruise-like areas inside the mouth, especially on the roof of the mouth (palate).   Soreness in the upper-left abdomen, from an enlarged spleen.     Call Your Doctor About Mononucleosis If:  You have been experiencing mono symptoms -- especially for longer than 10 days -- or you have a severe sore throat for more than a day or two. You need to be examined by a doctor to rule out other illnesses, such as strep throat or -- less likely -- leukemia or lymphoma.   You develop swollen lymph nodes all over your body, which may be a sign of tuberculosis, cancer, or HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).   You develop abdominal pain, which may indicate a ruptured spleen. Seek emergency medical treatment immediately.   You have both a rash and headache together, which might be signs of meningitis.   You develop a rash consisting of many tiny red spots (called petechiae), which could be a sign of a low platelet count or other serious illness such as meningitis.

The best way to start losing weight right away is hard cardio!  This means running, jump rope, anything really physical that gets your heart pumping.    If your heart starts pumping, working double time to move the blood around your body and limbs, it'll start burning off calories!  But hard cardio only works for a little while.  After you've gotten the cardio under hand and you stop losing instant weight, start doing 25 minutes cardio training and then 15 minutes of weight training!  Making muscle is the best way to burn calories.    =] Good luck!  Stay confident and know that your friends like you just the way you are!

Aerobic Activities  ? Do at least 10 minutes at a time.  ? You can combine moderate and vigorous activities.  ? Slowly build up the amount of time you do physical activities. The more time you spend, the more health benefits you gain. Aim for exercising twice as long as the minimum times below.   ? If you choose activities at a moderate level, do at least 2 hours and 30 minutes a week.   ? If you choose vigorous activities, do at least 1 hour and 15 minutes a week.    Muscle Strengthening Activities  Do these at least 2 days a week.  ? Include all the major muscle groups such as legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms.  ? Exercises for each muscle group should be repeated 8 to 12 times per session.    From the U.S. Federal government: http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/a...

Also, make sure you're drinking enough water. Eight glasses a day is commonly recommended, so make sure you're getting at least 64 oz of water a day - and, if you drink a soda, diet or not, tea, coffee or juice, (basically anything other than water), add another 8 oz to your water for   the day. Also, this may not help for the month, but for long term you should start doing some weight training. When you're body has more muscle mass it uses more calories.

Keep in mind that the two are different conditions and as such, require different ways of treatment. For cold sores:   Use antiviral medications. If you use an antiviral medication such as docosanol during the first signs of infection, then you can decrease the healing time of the sores. Docosanol is not oral; it's topical. Apply it five times a day until the sores are healed.   Avoid picking at the blisters/sores. It might look ugly and it might look inviting but don't pick or squeeze the blisters and sores that form around your mouth. Doing so will only worsen your blisters and maybe even spread the virus.   Take pain relievers. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers to alleviate any pain you may have. Aspirin, ibuprofen and and acetaminophen are good choices.   For canker sores:   Rinse with mouthwash. Tetracycline suspensions may be prescribed by your doctor in order to reduce pain as well as expedite healing time, as are mouth rinses containing dexamethasone.   Use topical solutions. There are also over-the-counter topical medications such as amlexanox and fluocinonide. Debacterol is a good topical solution designed specifically to treat canker sores.   In both cases, the sores should disappear even without the aid of medications. However, if your sores persist for more than three weeks, then consult a physician. It may be more than a normal mouth ulcer.|`|2appxifoaa	You can't use toothpaste but try chap stick|`|8UcMR12haa	try orange juice, vitamin c is really good for these things|`|tMdXnnRQaa	Dab of pepto-bismol

2sycPf8Daa	Topic of pacemakers.?  A while ago as I wandered the inter-webs browsing a variety of articles, I came upon an article that closely resembled this. That is not the original article I encountered, but it is the same report as I had earlier read. In short, the discussion briefly summarizes that an internal pacemaker can be hacked, and either one's medical information can be stolen or a fatal shock can be delivered.     I forgot where I was going with this, but it is interesting...  I've thought about this before. If cyber-punk fantasies ever pan out and we all have embedded microprocessors inside of our body, it's only a matter of time before bio hacking becomes a favorite script-kiddy pastime.     People are now hacking all sorts of things that you'd never expect: cars, cell phones, home automation devices, video surveillance cameras, etc. PCs are really just the tip of the ice burg, but the truth of the matter is if it has a network connection, it's entirely open to poking, prodding, and outright assault.    Maybe it should be in medicine instead of computers.    Take care as always!

I hope you can connect to the link okay.  good luck|`|DtG4zpM2aa	There can be genetic factors in depression, but often it can be result of a combination of other things, including social circumstances.       Based on what you're saying, I wouldn't rush to pin a diagnosis of clinical depression on you and I wouldn't trust the results of online quizzes about depression but I do think you should make an appointment with your doctor to talk about how you're feeling and see what they can do to help.   You do have some symptoms of depression in terms of low mood, not feeling bothered about things in general and the thoughts of self-harm, but most people feel depressed to some degree at some point in their life.  Sometimes even just having someone to talk to about it can help a lot...anti-depressants and other medication are only used in a minority of cases.  If these problems are disrupting your normal life you should seek some help for this.|`|mY19PPlIaa	Well you are obviously concerned and doing research about is making progress. Alot of people go through a stage of severe sadness after a breakup. Breaking up is one of the hardest things ever its pretty close to having somone you love die. But the thing is there is hope and you will someday be happy again and your heart will no longer be broken. Trust me I have been through some pretty hard breakups and there was times when I thought I was never going to be able to get over that person but I did and you know what the longest it took me was about over a year. It just takes time to heal. What you need to do is avoid all contact with him. If your friends are really your friends they should not put you in situations were your in the same place as him. I would just do this for a while since you still can not stand seeing him or him with someone else. You need to stop thinking about him and the past. Its time to move on , you need to focus on yourself and doing things that made you happy before you even knew him, start doing these things again. You need to remember that this break up is not the end of the world and there is more to life out there then just him. Trust me you have to go through alot of breakups until you find your prince. I dont think your depressed I think your close to slipping into a depression. I would also recommend you seek professional help if you feel that its getting worse.|`|aMdLmbRwaa	You want help, call on God. I should be Depressed. I weigh 350lbs. with a 5'10"  medium frame, Nobody loves me, no one cares if I live or die. I'm always alone. But I have God and Jesus Christ as my personal Savior. I never get depressed, ever!|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	Go to the Dr asap.
FT2dOlZEaa	Here are the basics:    The average length of an erect adult penis is about 5.5" - 6".    Its worth remembering that the average adult penis is 'designed' to fit the average depth of the adult vagina which is also about 6".     There is no normal or average size for a soft/flaccid penis because they vary enormously. Some guys shrink a lot more than others when soft. You can NEVER judge how big a guy will be when he is erect from his soft penis size.    The average girth of an erect adult penis, that is the distance AROUND the penis measured at the thickest point, is about 5". Anywhere between 4.7 and 5.2 is normal.     Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18. Sometimes up till about 24 or 25yo.    Approximate lengths for under 18s are:  At the beginning of puberty 2.4   12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0    To convert to cm, just multiply the number in inches by 2.54cm. For example, 5 X 2.54 = 12.7 So a 5" penis is 12.7cm|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Anywheres from 4 to 6 inches.|`|8NSzw9Boaa	Well I dno wats average (but If sum 1 could state)  But I turned 15 recently and I am bout 6-7 inches wen erect  Hope it helps (is that big, average, small?)
rMk4jKNBaa	My grandmother suffered with back pain for a while, until she found this product called M-m-m-Muscle Rub, made by http://www.tip2toeessentials.com/M-m-m-M... It is an Essential Oil Rub. It is quite strong, so don't use too much. Have someone massage it onto your back. It is an all natural product, and can be used as often as you need. My grandmother said the pain was almost instantly relieved with this product.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	If you have not already seen one you need to see a doctor and find out the cause of the pains and get treatment for it. You need a doctor because no one on this site can examine you and run any tests necessary. Until you see a doctor a few tips that might help the pain Over the counter anti inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen Use a heat pad/ Hot water bottle on the area or a TENS machine. Sorry I can't help more(I use a TENS machine a lot) or get a friend to massage the area perhaps using an anti-inflammatory gel if you are not taking it in tablet form|`|46827e1fada67be5dddf23d61ecc3c2eaa	I would recommend a massage, tell them to concentrate on your lower back & hips. Tight muscles are usually the culprit if there was no injury. Best Wishes!

Take out everything... go on effexor xr and abilify. Effexor is an anti depressant and an anti anxiety med. Abilify is an atypical anti psychotic. You should try these two things mixed together to get help. if your doctor won't do it, then find a new doctor. Putting you on all these meds has probally made you worse, i don't know what you are diagnosed with but if it is bi polar then you are on way way way too many drugs.|`|BqXSymxjaa	You should consult your Dr., not Yahoo answers.|`|aMdLmbRwaa	I pity you.

One of the complications of diabetes is dry and/or cracked skin, and itching is certainly a symptom of that.

wTmGTmC4aa	Definitely consider pregnancy.  With the pain you are describing, call your OBGYN and let him/her know.  Ectopic pregnancy can cause extreme abdominal pain, so until proven otherwise, this needs to be in your thought process.  Call your OBGYN ASAP.  If you can not reach them by phone, go to the nearest ER.    I hope this helps!    Me|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I would be looking into the fact that you could be pregnant. But I wouldn't wait to test at home if the pain is as bad as you are saying I would go to the doctors just in case there is something else going on|`|BNAzjSO1aa	Just because you have unprotected sex once or twice and you escape getting pregnant it does not mean that you never will. You need to get a pregnancy test done and if it is negative you need to see a doctor as it is possible that during your unprotected sex sessions you may have picked up a STD. It may be something else entirely but without examining you we would be unable to tell I suggest that you stop playing russian roulette with your health and start using a condom when ever you have sex. Make sure any visitors to your vagina are wearing a rubber jacket to protect both you and your partner|`|Wch2WybQaa	congratulations, you are now.
l05exvJvaa	Its wrong wrong wrong|`|tDaU7eYXaa	AWESOME!!! Cloning is good. It benefits us. Clone a human, take their  heart or something. Use it for a life-saving transplant. Blood to save lives. However, these clones might have emotions. Therefore, the government would probably ban it. Watch the movie, "The Island" Great movie about cloning. You could probably clone sheep or cow or something. It might work an give us more food.
CLcGxHpAaa	I've been where your partner is, and it is pure hell.  You are correct that it is a viscous cycle.  If he has already seen a gp and refused medication, he knows he has a problem and he is choosing to let the depression destroy your family.  Not to make excuses for him, but he probably thinks he is not worthy of treatment.  You need to make him aware that his refusal to treat his illness is destroying your family and it is selfish. Let him know that his recovery is important to you and you will support him through it.  Beg him if you have to to see a psychiatrist or other qualified physician.  If he does not want to take meds, he could try therapy-maybe you could go together.  Clinical depression can be caused by chemical imbalances or environmental factors, unfortunately, he has both factors working against him.  If he is able to treat the chemical fa corr, it may increase his self esteem and the way he presents himself to others.  His depressed personality can play a role in the way potential employers view him.  I don't know how my husband coped with me when I was at my worst, he must love me because there was no other reason to stay.  In beginning I did not know I was depressed.  Gradually I just lost interest in everything, I was irritable and could not sleep.  I began to understand I had a problem when I knew the only way to feel better was end it all.  That was my breaking point.     I wish the best for you and your family|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	That is a really tough situation to be in. I greatly sympathize! Unfortunately, there are no easy answers. Your husband needs to get help, and quick. All you can do is sit him down and explain to him how his poor choice of coping mechanism for his situation is putting tremendous pressure on you and him, and suggest that he get back into the doctor for a medication adjustment and a referral to a therapist. There are plenty of therapists that work for small fees, and considering the options, the expense should not be an excuse. Your husband is not going to find a job in bed, that is for sure, but the depression is the CAUSE of the problem, not the SYMPTOM. He needs to further address this cause, or nothing is going to get better. It is that simple.     It would not hurt the two of you to get marriage counseling, too. You two need to relearn how to work together through these troubled times, and some new strategies for coping would be of great use. It is never too late to learn some new tricks! Again, the cost may be an issue, but failure to resolve this serious issue will almost certainly result in the failure of your marriage. Your children deserve better.     All that said, I do realize that it is all an "easier said than done" situation. The biggest obstacle: your husband. In the end, there is nothing you can do to MAKE him choose to get better, and it IS a choice. You need to talk to him and make him see how his depression is impacting everyone and that he MUST do something about it. If he refuses to do anything, however, there is nothing you can do about it.  And if your husband is going to choose depression over his family, you may be forced to part ways. That is the sad truth of the matter. But I wanted to be honest about it, so there it is.     But talk to him and try to get him to get more help. Depression is not just a headache. Popping a pill helps, but it is not that simple. Do whatever you have to do to get him in to get some more help. If you can make him see the light, you may be able to save your marriage. Again, your kids deserve better. So do you! So does he.     Good luck!
7YeGJHQqaa	Neither did I until I went to the dentist and he told me I had gingavitis. Plaque builds up between the teeth and the gum line. By flossing it helps to keep it from building up, which can cause infected gums. It's also important because bits up food can sometimes get caught beneath the gum line and causes your gums to get swollen. Really you only need to  floss once a day, and you'll have happy gums and teeth.|`|D4GHgDl4aa	You're making a big mistake unless you have huge spaces between your teeth . Neither brush nor mouth wash can get the particles stuck between the teeth or under the gum line. I suggest you floss well, then use a mouthwash as hydraulic pressure to flush out the particles which were loosened by the floss and then polish with a brush and toothpaste. A few years ago Listerine had a label on their mouthwash which said " As effective as flossing" The FDA  gave them a choice: remove the labels or pull the product.|`|rGdf04Fkaa	well, flossing actually get the plaque in between your teeth off much better than a toothbrush or mouthwash can..    Here is a great website:  http://www.saveyoursmile.com/healthartic...|`|c9c6728a1851854f18d400e7f8246eecaa	Try getting a strand of floss and run it between your teeth, then look at all the cr@p that's on it, if your brave enough smell it, IT STINKS and that's all the junk that gets wedged in between your teeth.  Flossing is just as important as brushing as it removes a multitude of sins that your average toothbrush just cannot reach!
d2a3834786860b34ae904f14b9d846faaa	Yes,   a fizzy  drink  contains phosphoric  acid.   Every  time your body takes in this acid,  your  body excretes calcium from your teeth and bones.     This  leaves your teeth with not enough calcium to remain strong and healthy.|`|gat4KThKaa	Yes, they can wear away enamel. You, will have problems later if you don't take care of it.    Go to your Dentist as soon as possible.|`|f25136f77bb8e33b645c3b0896a24e5baa	Yes. The acid wears away the enamel, and caffeine leeches calcium from your teeth. If you must have that coke, then follow it up with milk and take lots of calcium supplements. Brush your teeth with Sensodyne pronamel after drinking.|`|kUkyTCFyaa	Yes, they can wear away enamel.|`|qwK27ntGaa	Yes, the acid used in diet colas and such can wear at the enamel. Limit your intake and brush your teeth and rinse with a good rinse like ACT after having them.

It doesn't sound like glasses would be the solution for you. I'm curious as to whether the prednisolone and hydrocortisone are something that you've been prescribed or that you've taken over the counter, as this is something that's been going on for years now. If you have been prescribed these meds by an optometrist, then I suggest that you get a second opinion.|`|BgOkiBRbaa	I've known people who had something wrong with their eyes where they had to wear sunglasses inside.

iRKV3j6Gaa	you shouldnt be, as long as the salt you've been consuming contains iodine.  if not, then it might still be the iodine.  i'm pretty sure iodine allergies are rare, considering it is a necessary mineral for growth and health...such as, not consuming enough can lead to goiters(tumor-like growths)...which can be fatal if left untreated...thats why most salt contains iodine nowadays...to prevent iodine deficiency...but i'd still have it checked if you can.|`|mdwyZpyHaa	Regular table salt you buy in the grocery store comes in two types iodized and noniodized.  Look at the salt container in your kitchen.  If you are eating iodized salt, it is unlikely that you are allergic to iodine.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Shellfish are bottom-feeders and have a lot of toxins, and that makes it more allergenic. I have to be careful with iodine specifically, too much irritates my thyroid gland and breaks my skin out (scarring and slow-healing acne). Since I don't eat shellfish anyway, that is not a problem, but even kelp can break me out and try to avoid additional iodine in iodine-enriched salts and vitamins. Plain salt does not contain iodine.|`|00fSfCdFaa	You cant be allergic to iodine :)     Iodine is a molecule which every human has inside them, essential for basic metabolism and life. The most important example is in the thyroid gland. Iodine deficiency causes hypothyroidism.     The allergy you have with shellfish is from a protein in it called tropomyocin.     I cant comment on the other things you feel you are allergic to.     I hope I can reassure you that nothing inside that multivitamin could be an allergen to you, you can take them safely as per instructions.
RhXugkTtaa	cvs|`|tDaU7eYXaa	Rite aid, pathmark, shop rite|`|MERgQTRUaa	any grocery store with a pharmacy should have them. if you go to the pharmacy counter, they can take you right to them|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	yes lots of places sell cough drops. if you can't find them down the cold and allergy isle, ask a clerk to tell you where they are.

tVF9O1Olaa	You can't get rid of them straight away, you need to challenge them and change them. This takes time.  I can't help you much as you don't say what they are about, yourself,life friends, self esteem etc?   You could look at cognitive behavioural therapy on the internet, this is to help change your negative thoughts into positive ones.  If you need anymore help then feel free to email some of the negative thoughts and i will help you get coping techniques!

tDaU7eYXaa	It's probably an allergic reaction. Upset stomach and that stuff. Ask a doctor. Or even a pharmacist. It's hard to know what it is and how to cure it.|`|H9RTbhKYaa	There is a dark truth that religious leaders don't want you to know. You see, everybody has a demon that lives inside of them that provides them with unimaginable power. The religious leaders have brainwashed innocent people into eating too much fiber because fiber kills demons, thus, causing innocent people, such as yourself, to give up their powers. The pain that you feel is the demon fighting for its life. You can save the demon by drinking more water. Be aware that the demon must release itself from your body after awhile or it's children won't have a place to grow. It will release itself with the means of a vessel that has a foul odor. It is designed so that they are left in peace, while they release their souls into the netherworld.
Rk46lIBwaa	I am not the greatest fan of Implanon and still less of doctors who use it on patients without giving them fair warning what to expect!    All patients should be told that almost all of them are going to get dysfunctional, erratic and often continuous bleeding for at least 3 months and in some it can persist for up to 6 months.    True with the passage of time more and more women do become ammenorrheic ( lose their periods) and by 1 year this reaches 70%.    Exactly as Rhianna suggests Cyklokapron is probably the best drug to reduce bleeding, the other option is of course to have the bloody thing removed.    I have also seen many doctors incorrectly give more oral progesterone, such as norithisterone or the mini pill to reduce bleeding in my view this is plain daft!|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	You can stop or at least reduce progestogen induced bleeding with Tranexamic acid (Cyklokapron), however this can't really be taken long term. Many women have issues with Implanon- sometimes the erratic bleeding will settle down after awhile, unfortunately for many women it often fails to subside and many women end up having it removed.    If the bleeding continues, you have it removed and  seek an alternative form of contraception. Have you considered the Mirena coil?
RXI8ImdIaa	Nope, I bet it's actually brown/red inside your body as well, but it's more noticeable in the tank.    You need to get to a doctor quickly to have this diagnosed :/|`|IYu3bBFqaa	I would say you need to seek medical attention.  It sounds like more than just a chemical reaction.  The urine may look yellow while you are urinating because the blood crystals are too small and spread out to be noticed until they are sitting in the toilet bowl where they are closer together and reflecting off the water.|`|1QLp7iC5aa	sounds like you are passing blood in your urine, the stream of urine will still appear yellow but if blood is coming out it is going to mix with the toilet water and spred.

This could be a severe infection either in your kidneys or your urinary tract. Please, go get it checked out!

7TdG2vTCaa	Very frequently, when girls get their periods at a young age, they'll have it once or maybe twice and then they don't get it again for a year or two.  Hormones are weird that way.

Stress will make your period late,short,and early but I've never heard of it making you spot for 2 weeks.If you take a test and you aren't pregnant it could be something more serious,but I would test first,even before you go to the doctor so you have a little more of idea what your dealing with.

But, do know that every day life changes.    We all want the unconditional love and approval of our own families.  Sometimes that just isn't what we get.  We can't pick families, but we can pick friends.  Try to find something that you can get involved in and meet people.  First, because you need a distraction from your family life, and second, because you need to meet people and have them get to know you for who you are.      You haven't done anything wrong and you're not terrible.  It's just what life has dealt you at this point.  Think about how you can change someone's life by loving them the way that you want to be loved.  You'll find that.  Maybe not today or tomorrow, but when you do find it, it will be so well worth the wait.    I want you to make a list of things that you are good at, and the good things about you.  Keep the list to yourself, but open it and read it to yourself every morning.  Look in the mirror and smile.  You're a great person.  Those that don't realize that yet are really losing out.    Hugs..|`|sbcJMtG5aa	Hi sweetie. I want to start by saying that I understand how you feel. Many of us do feel that way at some point in our lives, so you are not alone! I am sure you will get tons of advice on this one, so I will try to be brief. Try to stay busy. Sitting around thinking will only make you more depressed! And accept yourself as you are, you may be a quiet person, and that is perfectly okay! Love yourself anyways, do not wish you were some other way. Try to find one day a week where you can go volunteer for a cause that you feel strongly about. Service to others will make you feel better about yourself. This will also help keep you busy and focused on things other than yourself! If you want others to love you then you will have to portray to the world that you care about things other than your own feelings. Having been through this before, being depressed I just brooded and felt sorry for myself all day and night. I didn't want to talk to anybody or do anything. I tried medication and counseling (this may work for you though). What really helped me, years ago, was getting an active life. I volunteered, I exercised, I got a full time job, I took night classes. I believe that if you figure out what your passion is (try taking different classes until you find something you are really in to) and follow it you will find that you are not feeling so bad everyday. Good luck to you! Let me know what you decide to do and how life is in a few months!|`|twuxLLzZaa	I care!    I promise, you're not alone. I can totaly relate to almost everything you've said!  I feel like I've iscolated myself, because I, like you, can't even bear to face people every day. It's like I'm tired of pretending to be normal, painting a smile on my face.  My mum and me don't get on at all, because I seem to have all the traits she hates about my dad. My sister however, is a top student, beautiful, popular. She's always pointing out my negative traits, and goes out of her way to patronise me and put me down. What's even worse is that she's younger than me, so I feel even more of a failure since she's already 'better' than me.  I try not to get upset by it though, because my mum is sick with chronic depression and can't even work it's got so bad. I can't stand myself when we fight, or when I let her down (which is often) because I know it makes her feel like a failure too.    I could go on, but I know it's not helping you me saying all this! I've just ended up venting - I'm sorry :(    I hope knowing you're not the only one out there who feels this way, helps you in some way.    Talking helps though. Share your problems with someone -  seriously. Whether it's a friend you trust, or a complete stranger. Whichever you feel more comfortable with!    I don't want to ram it down your throat or anything... but try going to a church? Many offer FREE, confidential support and advice to people feeling low, and it can be great to have a non judgemental ear to hear your problems.    Sorry I couldn't offer more constructive advice,    Hold on and stay strong.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Start goin' to the gym and excersising, and the next time your mom gets disrespected, put ur brother and/or your dad in their place. They are treating you like a pushover man! Well, as long as you're living in that house, he has control over you, so you can either put up with it or move out basically. Can you move in with your mum? That would be a better idea IMO, and also, the cops can help if there's any violence, I know the cops can be a bunch of pricks, but man you gotta protect ur mom, and this **** just ain't right how they're treatin' you! Seriously... Man you gotta do something, and if you are being attacked, you have a right to defend yourself, don't be afraid to, your'e a warrior smash a baseball bat off their heads and drive fear into them bastards!
WMpnScHuaa	To gain weight an be healthy you need to consume more calories every day from healthy foods and choose the right types of exercise. In other words you have to eat more at your meals and eat more than 3 meals a day.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	no eating lots of protein wont do anyting. it is rly good for u.  jus dont take over 50 grams at a time. ur body can only process so much. its not bad for u to take more ur body jus cant use it all at one time so its wasting it.  them r good gains in weight an strength. keep it up. an remember 6-7 reps almost failing on each set.  -also whey protein works great for me-|`|LVDoQ1Kaaa	i don't think there is a great deal in eating right  but it is said whatever your calorie diet is you should add 3500 to it each week and gain 3-5 pounds a week as long as you lift somewhat after you eat it doesn't have to be heavy lifting eather|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	you are gaining fast.....dont gain too fast, then you will lose it as quickly as you gained it.  too much protein will damage your kidneys, but you are still young.  lift heavy, low reps for size and strength.  stay away from steroids.  drink lots of milk to gain too.  good luck|`|9Avg7Oetaa	Well .. That's a huge improvement going from 130 to 155 benching 170    Over taking protein isn't good .. the best thing to do is to be patient & just keep working out like you normally do & keep taking the supplements your taking (protein) don't over do it though    165g of protein is more than enough especially at what your weighing ..    & how tall are you?|`|067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	First keep working out, do 3 sets of 6-8 reps for football. As heavy as you can lift, by the middle of the 3d rep you should NEED a spotter. That will increase your mass.  As for protein you can consume 1.5g of protein per body weight pound. So at 155 you should get around 200g of protein AT LEAST!  Before you go to bed however you want a slow digestive protein (unlike the quick absorbing kind in shakes). Eat some peanut butter/cottage cheese.  Just eat healthy, but get alot of protein, especially through fish, turkey, and chicken.   You should notice big gains. 190 is a little much to want for mostly muscle by sumer time, but i wouldnt doubt you making 175ish...if were mostly muscle.|`|3emS6MDmaa	There is absolutely no reason to eat that much protein, or take supplements.  If you are from the US you probably get more than enough protein. .88 grams per kilogram body weight (divide your weight in pounds by 2.2) if you plateau at a certain weight then you probably should increase your carbohydrates.  The problem is if you don't get enough carbs your body uses whatever else it can find for energy, protein is next in line so you use your protein for energy instead of building muscle mass.|`|yfrZowkfaa	Eat a couple donuts every 5 days|`|R34etqXNaa	Exercise|`|RdjyNxHlaa	As someone who lifts weights you probably know that it's better to do less reps and more weight, but I've also read in several health and fitness magazines that seafood like shrimp or lobster is a good protein/meat to eat for building muscle. I also feel like it takes more time to build muscle than to lose weight. It sounds like you're off to a great start! Just be patient. If you haven't seen anymore muscle gain in a years time, then perhaps talk to a nutritionist and trainer.|`|v1JI2Ldhaa	dont worry about eating too much as long as its healthy, 4 protein shakes a day, and eat lots of bread, and pasta, lift heavy low reps, and stay away from cardio.
KzcDt8V9aa	Strattera is a very addictive drug.  Please do research before  using it.  I used to have a student in my class that was using  it and the adverse effects he was having because of the medication  were worse than what he had before.  I would rather tell you to  seek proffesional attention (a psychologist or a pastor, etc.) than  a psychiatrist (that prescribes medication) or a doctor.  Besides  you don't have ADHD!!  Using that drug will not benefit you at all!|`|AA10236979	I did a quick Yahoo search for "Strattera side effects" and the first thing that popped up was: "FDA Issues Suicide Warning on Strattera"    Maybe you should seek a second opinion before taking it.
mvDKnRB3aa	a good friend of mine is actually in college to be a dental hygenist in CT right now. what she had done is went to community college for two years and got a degree. you could get two years of basic college credits elsewhere in a university instead, its just more affordable and convenient in a community college. from there she had looked into school with good dental hygene programs and found one that she likes. shes now taking two years specializing to be a dental hygentist, but i beleive you could train for 4 years instead of 2 if you choose. i could imagine the more education you have the higher salary you will recieve
553c27203d06a734ee6db4154b6d5b2caa	Go to the dermatologist!!!! I had been using Proactiv for the past 3-4 years, thinking it was helping my face... HAHAHA!! I went to the dermatologist and the nurse practitioner put me on acne topicals (Differin and Duac- they're prescription only) and they told me to wash my face with CeraVe Cleanser and apply CeraVe lotion. I love that cleanser!!! It keeps my face from drying out. You can get it at most pharmacies and Walmart. You may have to ask for it behind the counter at some places. After I did a course of acne topicals and my face still wasn't getting much better, the nurse practitioner sent me to the dermatologist to be put on Accutane. Accutane is just a pill that you take for a couple months straight and it gets rid of your acne. It is a very annoying medicine though. It completely dries out all of your skin so I have to constantly apply moisturizer. Also, it has really nasty side effects such as depression and birth defects. You have to visit the dermatologist every month, and if you're a girl you need to be on birth control and get pregnancy tests every month. Its highly regulated, but it's definitely worth going through all the trouble if it clears up all your acne. Currently, I am almost done with my Accutane treatment before the dermatologist puts me back on topicals. My face is very clear. I hope that all this helped and you are not too confused. Oh... another topical I used in the beginning until insurance wouldn't cover was Tazorac. Good luck with your acne!!!! It really can get better, believe it or not!!|`|Y0O6971laa	Um, witches hazel?  use something for swelling.  I'm guessing you shouldn't pop your zits.  It might have been one of those deep ones and you probably pushed the puss further in, making it swell.  Don't pop zits unless you know what you're doing :)    I hope it goes away, that really sucks!|`|LmicIEOxaa	Open the pores with steam or warm water. Then, with a cotton tip, apply lemon juice to the outbreak. It will kill the bacteria that caused the acne. Apply witch hazel to reduce the swelling and help the outbreaks to heal.|`|0uvgAKSZaa	The proactive might be making it worse, you might still have more puss in it. If it hasn't bled then you might still have more in there that's why it hurts. But if its right by your nose you don't want to mess with it too much because you don't know if you might have a small vein around it. Go to the dermatologist and have them check it out.|`|7i1rPTPwaa	it sounds infected to me. how long has it been pussy and hurting? i don't want to scare you, but if it is infected and isnt clearing up, you need to go to the doctor because it could turn into staph.

For the dryness, I would get Biotene Mouth gel or gum.  Its like syntheic saliva that will keep your mouth from drying and works very efficently.  I use it personally.|`|0uvgAKSZaa	try some honey and tea,or honey and lemon to soothe your throat, when you sleep rub some vicks on your chest and put a small towel to keep it warm. it will stop you from coughing at night. hopefully it will help out a bit
UT5HS39Daa	You are probably taking some form of penicillin (amoxicillin, etc).  With any antibiotic, especially those, you should eat something before you take it.  It doesn't have to be much, just maybe something with carbohydrates, like crackers with peanut butter.  That should help.  If it doesn't then you should go back to the doctor, you may be having a reaction to your medicine.  You would be surprised at the number of people allergic to penicillin!     Good Luck!! Feel better! :)|`|AA10622097	Eat first, take them on a full stomach.|`|7i1rPTPwaa	you are supposed to take your antibiotics with a meal or it will upset your stomach.|`|2b076701991fe0ec4cefa9fc66914174aa	If the stomach ache is really bad, like unbareable, I would ask the Doctor for Zithromax, SIG: 500mg Q.D. for 3 days. You don't et stomach aches from it and its fast acting and you only take it for three days compared to something like Amoxicillin 500mg T.I.D. for one to two weeks.
Vp1Wzu07aa	Disposal concerns. Some cardboard applicators break down quickly in water, thus making them flush able and biodegradable if thrown in the trash. Plastic apps obviously do not break down, should never be flushed and will remain in the landfills for a long time.|`|AA10356847	Cardboard is cheaper, and that savings gets passed on to you. Some people think the plastic is more comfortable to use, especially if the plastic applicator has a rounded tip. Cardboard applicators usually have a blunt tip which can be a bit uncomfortable during insertion.|`|jeDtvychaa	lol  sorry i dont know, ive never used a tampon, (im too scared to use it...)|`|1H3IsHmLaa	Plastics just more "comfortable" to insert.|`|tGcNmDUZaa	Applicators help you to insert tampons.

KPtrfsEYaa	actually if you eat at least 1200 calories throughout your day, you will lose weight more quickly.  Food actually speeds your metabolism and help you burn more calories.  So if you eat every 3 to 4 hours and at the very least 1200 calories and combine it with exercise you will get results.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	around 2 months. your body will start adding on fat meaning you will gain weight, not lose it since your not eating.|`|AA10608549	I'll give you the scientific answer - then you can decide -- There are 3400 calories in a pound of fat.  If you weigh 130lb  (9x14+4) and you want to lose 14 lb - you have to give up 3400 x 14 or 47600 calories.  The average person burns approx. 14 cals per pound per day - so your caloric requirement to maintain your present weight is - 14x140 - total is 1960  - by restricting  each days caloric intake to 500 cal that means it will take you 2.3 days to lose one pound - the numbers get worse as you loose a lb you must increase the days needed to lose the next pound.  If your faithful, and don't land in the hospital - it should take no longer than 50 days to loose 14lbs.|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	How many pounds are in a stone?|`|dkoGI9nfaa	Not long as you are going to kill yourself with just 500 calories a day.  You need to be realistic about weight loss.  You did not gain the weight in a hurry so you are not going to lose it in a hurry.  Plus people who go on such rapid reduction diets gain the weight again as fast when they stop.  Go on a sensible diet and you will be in a much better position with long lasting positive results.|`|uOHf7rSlaa	I hope you don't have nice hair.  Robbing your body of that many calories won't leave your body enough nutrition to produce hair and yours will start to fall out.

KPtrfsEYaa	well if you eat enough of it sure.  If you want to gain weight eat yogurt high in calories and fat.|`|gERaZGZeaa	Sure, yoghurt is good.  Have it with some fruit or almonds, and that's a pretty good snack.  You don't want to try to gain weight by eating more at every meal.  You want to gain weight by simply eating more meals and snacks - but make each one of those meals healthy and meaningful.  That means don't eat things low in nutritional value, such as things high in sugar.    Eat lots of chicken, cottage cheese, oatmeal, turkey, tuna, eggs, whole grains, potatos, veggies, fruit, yoghurt, nuts, etc.|`|vEGkSHMsaa	Just like any other food, yes if you eat enough of it. The yogurt your talking about probably is loaded with sugar though. In my personal experience, the easiest way I gained weight was drinking a lot of whole milk.|`|JshtWS94aa	If it has sugar in it|`|wc2OyTHpaa	well yeah, but a cup of yogurt to me resembles a little cup of fat...   maybe my mind's just weird.  but like if you want to gain weight i would eat something that won't add only fat to youself.  or maybe it wont.  just saying what i feel.

I would trust what your doctor said - there are loads of things going around at the moment and although it feels awful, you're just going to have to ride it out.  If however your symptoms worsen, for example you get a headache, can't stand the light or develop a strange rash that won't go away when you place a glass tumbler over it, I would suggest going back to the doctor just to get checked.    In all honesty I'm sure you'll be fine.

Dont forget lean red meat and eggs for protein.|`|8RmNOuRwaa	u should exercise too not just eat man come on|`|nD2zbkovaa	just eat lots of fruits and veggies and drink a lot of water along with what you are already doing.  don't deprive yourself of "cheating" once in a while as a reward to yourself.  if you deprive yourself, you might get the urge to binge on the bad stuff one day.  also just as important is portion size.  too big of portions of healthy food can make you fat, too.|`|xlgx7Aonaa	I would say what you are doing is good, eating healthy and cutting back on fatty foods is the best way to loose weight and keep it off...Fad diets help you fit into that dress by a certain date, but they never stick...you normally end up gaining the weight back after you go off the diet.    Also, I find the best way to stick to a diet is to have one day off a week, where you still eat sensibly, but you aren't as strict with yourself :)
qdw3ZOYFaa	So it happens every few months..but apparently then your appetite comes back..is this right? Tell me...do you feel like this only after eating breakfast...or does it happen after lunch and dinner too..sometimes? If it only happens after breakfast..then are you changing what you are eating for breakfast from time to time..or are you eating the same all the time? If you are changing...then what you are changing to (from time to time)..may be causing you these symptoms without you knowing.

What is scarlet fever?  Scarlet fever is a term used for strep throat with a rash. Scarlet fever is most common in children ages 2 to 10, but it can affect people of any age    What causes scarlet fever?  Scarlet fever is caused by streptococcal (strep) bacteria, the same bacteria that cause strep throat. There are many different strains of strep bacteria, some of which cause more serious illness than others. The type of strep that infects the throat and causes scarlet fever is called group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABS).    How is it treated?  Scarlet fever and the strep infection that causes it are treated with antibiotics.    What are the complications of scarlet fever?  Complications of scarlet fever include infection of the middle ear, sinusitis, and pneumonia. In rare cases, a more serious infection may develop, such as rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease. Most cases of scarlet fever can be cured without any permanent complications.|`|AA11809403	it used to be a VERY feared disease, because it was so contagious.   so it used to be serious, but assuming that your nephew, niece and there parents are treated with the proper antibiotics, no problem.

vB5cTqrzaa	PMS affects all women differently and generally last for two weeks, a little before, a little during and a little afterward.     I know it's hard for a man to understand but please realize she is not doing this on purpose.  Ibuprofen can help her for cramps, drinking a lot of water helps for bloating, and good quality chocolate can help for the moodiness (I'm serious!!).  I'm also a strong proponent of tea, try green tea, peppermint tea hell any tea!    Good luck!|`|QJHE3z1raa	PMS is on going for 2 weeks.    its not postms    it will happen the 2 weeks.|`|ryDUX5ukaa	They are just mood swings most girls get'um. Its best not to piss us off during that or we can sometime go over board cuz we're moody. I get moody during mine but my best friend gets moody after hers too. Its just a girl thing, its nothin to worry bout.
kc68BXwTaa	I lost a decent amount of weight, but was also miserable.    I'd say to add in some whole grains and fruits and see how you do.    And FYI, whatever tea the first poster is talking about is pretty much the same thing as green tea. And no tea will make you lost weight (besides water weight, but you'll gain that back as soon as you drink some water).|`|hAsgWs9Xaa	All the medics and nutritionists say targeted weight loss is unlikely, specifically in the waist and belly zones, but I managed it with acai berry.  I know they say that pills don't work, nevertheless they sure worked for me, and they have been featured on CBS News too. There's a free trial going on right now at http://silinang.g3nius.net , why not check it out, what is the worst that could happen?
dNtJ9Ob9aa	This happened to my brother for one whole day.  I believe he slept real messed up and put to much strain on his neck all night.  Try getting someone to massage your neck real good and apply hot and cold pressure with a towel to it.  If it's still like this after a day go see a physical therapist soon!|`|77a6f94018eaab3cf1e42502c3817012aa	Depends on what caused the pain.  I would recommend some tylenol or ibuprofen.  I once went to those massage place in the middle of the mall.  I told the guy my neck hurt, so he then started punching my buttocks.  I was like, WTF?  But yeah just get some rest and take pain killers.|`|SxsXnvwiaa	it is probably whiplash.    go see a chiropractor, and they'll give you the best treatment.  that's usually pills or physical therapy.|`|cp7regataa	Go to  the, chiropractor....the treatments  gives the fastest results ...if you go to a doctor you have to go to physical therapy which can take weeks or months and lots of $$$|`|3NjXyl5Eaa	With out knowing what you did to your neck it is probably muscular.  I broke mine a long time ago and have had problems.  What has helped is warm heat.  And warm moist heat. Take a towel and make it wet....not dripping just wet.  Put it in the microwave. Be care-full because it will get very hot.  Don't burn your self.      Also, you need to relax your neck and shoulder muscles. Time will help.  Skiing may need to be put put off.    If it continues to hurt, check with chiropractor.|`|c44dIboDaa	u probably slept in a bad position.hurts right? well when u wake up u should immediately turn ur head fast towards the pain....it will be faster than waiting..but it will hurt..good luck!|`|KVZ1a9azaa	i had this condition 2 weeks ago. Its a condition called torticollis. Its when the muscle in your neck has a spasm which causes either shoulder to be higher than the other. you probably got it when you were sleeping. my treatment was my doctor prescribing me valeum and i had to wear a neck collar i felt better the next day. i hope this helps you a lot. sorry about the pain. i had it too :/ i know how much it hurts
AJBR5P9daa	try a good foot cream as a massage cream then wear socks.Do it before going to sleep every night for one month.    I have tried it before and it works for me.    Good luck|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	yes, do more walking barefoot|`|v02ZYVcvaa	Alpha Lipoic Acid    Great stuff!|`|f9f27Cmhaa	Over time you'll grow thicker skin on your feet, and it'll work itself out.  In the meanwhile, you can always try wearing two pairs of socks.  It helps with similar problems I have when I go hiking for the first time in a while.
LCMCrmQTaa	Yeah typically yellow means a virus. Just drink a lot of water, eat vitamins and rest. It will run its course, my mom AND brother AND friend have the same thing, so im being cautious hehe
kVyCrVyHaa	He's right. Cutting is no the solution to any problem. Who cares if she cuts. YOU STOP! Cutting just makes things worse. Talk to a counselor or school adviser and see what you can do. Try to befriend another person who does not cut and can make you feel better about you self. I wish you the best. ;)|`|faj6WSL8aa	Both of you need to get help.  Tell you parents, or a trusted older cousin. Im sure they love you and will want to help you. Talk to your friend about how much she hurt you, but cutting really isn't the answer and wont help with whatever is wrong with either of your lives.|`|huNpyxV7aa	calm down, its gonna be okay.    i've been cutting for two years,  but i havent for about 2 months know.    it makes you feel better to resist cutting,  then to actually do it because then you  feel like you've actually acomplished  something.    its the first step to recovery baby, you can  do it.      join the to write love on her arms street team,  it saved my life.,|`|LCMCrmQTaa	Seriously, why are you cutting yourself? what is the reasoning behind that? Stop doing it now, who cares if your friends doing it, it doesn't matter at all. Talk to your parents or a councilor at school, Dont mess your life up, you only have one. Why would you even want to hurt yourself, jesus    Stop now, and get help|`|Og4Ab2dSaa	what the hell is your problem?|`|K2icX1Ozaa	god im so sorry that really sucks. when you guys started cutting together you made it a social thing which is a bad idea. you need help you should probably talk to someone. please stop cutting yourself i dont care if you think you are weak you have to be strong cuz youre ******* yourself up.  just because she cuts herself still doesnt mean you should like thats terrible logic. even if it pisses you off just stop.|`|zzfCVwgqaa	you can talk to me, and ill try to understand, send me an email
1BbnyTfBaa	About your breasts: No, it doesn't matter.  (Are they really that big?)    Experts recommend, "Slow and steady weight loss. Depending on your starting weight, experts recommend losing weight at a rate of 1/2 to 2 pounds per week. Weight loss may be faster at the start of a program." http://win.niddk.nih.gov/publications/ch...  And, "Men and very active women may need up to 2,500 calories daily. Other women and inactive men need only about 2,000 calories daily. A safe plan is to eat 300 to 500 fewer calories a day to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week." http://www.fda.gov/opacom/lowlit/weightl...

Aerobic Activities  ? Do at least 10 minutes at a time.  ? You can combine moderate and vigorous activities.  ? Slowly build up the amount of time you do physical activities. The more time you spend, the more health benefits you gain. Aim for exercising twice as long as the minimum times below.   ? If you choose activities at a moderate level, do at least 2 hours and 30 minutes a week.   ? If you choose vigorous activities, do at least 1 hour and 15 minutes a week.    Muscle Strengthening Activities  Do these at least 2 days a week.  ? Include all the major muscle groups such as legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms.  ? Exercises for each muscle group should be repeated 8 to 12 times per session.    From the U.S. Federal government: http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/a...

9877c8d2b38919e62582db25a1fc2bb2aa	The biggest excuse "used" is: A) Lack of money. But i think that thats not the real problem, they just dont admit their laziness.     But, ya kno, the life in this world would be soooo boring if our goals were just 2 easy. At least, thats what I think.    What u think?|`|64a6ec9bcb441fbb37164ec97dad4182aa	A, C, D, & because of society negatively using it against us & not giving us jobs becaus of our mental illnesses.|`|AA11401988	Your reasons are all negative, so it makes me think you are setting impossible goals.

Understanding that the tortoise won the race can help with lack of money. The best way to reach a goal is to take small but steady steps. You won't trip yourself up that way.     Laziness is one indicator that you are not ready to tackle a goal because it's not in your heart. The passion or devotion is not there.     Family and friends opinions shouldn't matter to you because you are YOU. You have your own life to live and your own idea of happiness.    Also remember that you can be your worst enemy or your best friend. I suggest being a friend to yourself. Having that attitude breeds lots of self esteem and that really helps with everything in life, including conquering those goals.    DarkLio, I agree with you. If we just pressed the easy button for everything in life, we couldn't grow as human beings. What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.|`|d611e6ba51d486b4efd99137d3bcdf30aa	E) Other.

fypgDK53aa	It may mean that you have an underlying urinary tract infection or an interstitial infection of the bladder.     By culturing the urine, they are trying to "grow" the bacteria from the uine. This can be very helpful in diagnosis, because sometimes it's hard to pinpoint the source or type of infection. In addition, this will allow them to do a sensitivity, which is challenging the bacteria grown with certain antibiotics to see which they are sensitive to (ie. which "kill them"). It also may allow them to determine if the bacteria are resistant to any antibiotics. This is especially important during pregnancy, when use of antibiotics should be done only sparingly and with caution.     Good luck!

Whey protein is good , but it has no carbs in it.    Every time after you work out , you have a 90 minute window to replace or replenish your body with the key nutrients you lost during your workout. The cheapest drink that does the job ....grape juice. Drink one 8oz glass of grape juice after you work out and you will see that soreness disappear.

I have PKU :)|`|ScLAUvYfaa	You haven't asked a question....|`|l7Q5tCpbaa	PKU phenylketoneuronis?  Diagnosed by Guthrie or "heel stick" test shortly after birth. It's an inability to digest a protein called phenylalanine that's found in everyday foods (cheese leaps to mind and prominently in cocacola).     If it's going to occur it'll be present at birth. If someone with PKU persists in ingesting phenylaline (or rather parents keep giving it to them) it causes brain damage that significantly lowers IQ irreversably. Other than that no symptoms, and treatment is to avoid phenylalanine!     Best I can do for now without a question!

Depending on where you are and what your schedule looks like, you should try to go midday (might be impossible).     Think about picking up some cold weather running gear (all you need are tights, gloves, a thick non-cotton shirt and ear muffs or a hat). Running outdoors is a blast.

ubkBeUh2aa	The amount of calories you eat depends on what your healthy BMI range is . This is different for everyone. It is highly recommended by the American Dietetic Council that a woman should consumer an average of 1800 calories a day to consume the proper amounts of vitamins and nutrients we need to stay healthy.     Anything less that 1800 , you will lose weight , but you may also lose bone mass and muscle mass.     Just be careful and know what your caloric intake should be.|`|89be3247ab55840992eda1217a17a088aa	Your daily calorie intake depends on your age, sex and life style (activity level). For example if you are a young female that dose not exercise much you need about 1800 cal per day to maintain your weight.  Eat less or exercise more and you will loss weight.    Read this it will help with all the details.    http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/...

YLYAo2zmaa	I never heard of PCOS until I was diagnosed with it, but I was so relieved to learn it was something and I wasn't crazy.  I take 1000 mg of metformin as well, they told me I would start to feel better in six months or so.

pfm0wcEIaa	I have been told that your body actually feels the consequence of lack of sleep 2-3 days later.  So this is about right.  2-3 days later you are exhausted from just sleeping one hour.|`|3jNp3fzUaa	Well, 1 hour of sleep is definitely not enough.  If you are having trouble sleeping, try to go to bed earlier so that you have more time to fall asleep.  But yes, trying to stay awake on that many hours of sleep will be very hard to do.  Hope you feel better!|`|e21NzZ6Qaa	Could you be pregnant?|`|i2LatBdiaa	It's possible if you're under stress that you can't focus on sleeping properly or just as likely that you are going through a phase of mild insomnia where sleep won't come regularly.

Green-gray phlegm is the sign of an infection. Perhaps you need an anti-biotic.

If they call, be nice, if you run into them, again be nice.   Be there for them if you are needed.  Give it some time and they will come around.  Actions, your actions speak louder than words ( promises),.  I know it hurts alot, but we just cant force people to accept us, love us, like us, or to marry us.|`|AA11110732	When you forgive and accept yourself, others will follow. Just relax and move on.    As I told my cousin the other day, once you hit bottom, there's no where to go but up.
ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	There's not much you can do except for rest and plenty of fluids. I suggest going to the pharmacy and buying sudafed (or generic brand), the stuff you have to present identification for (pseudoephedrine). Take that with some tylenol or advil during the day, and at night, make sure you have enough time to sleep and try NyQuil.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	the flu?  eat oranges & soup.  Stay warm.|`|mPSekOURaa	I think you have the flu. Get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids and take Vitamin C.     Feel better! :)|`|0PkFuZMwaa	sometimes medication just don't help.but you should drink tea and vitamin c juice.try tylenol cold tablets.and get plenty of rest with lots of pillows especially at night that's when everything bother you right.
ReHd1IlYaa	Eat healthy, excerice [if you can ... but eating healthy is the main thing]    For most people losing fat on their face/neck comes first so I'm sure you don't even have to go extreme into eating healthy, just have smaller portions and don't eat unless you are STARVING,  and after two weeks see results!    Good luck :]  I'm trying to lose weight too ...|`|9Avg7Oetaa	I think everyone has a double chin .. There's no getting rid of it  If it shows to much then exercise, eat right & play sports
cKSbZBt8aa	There are many protein shakes available on the market.  They are all potentialy good.  Choose one that you can afford.  Protein will help with muscle recovery and feed the muscles.  Weight training will help grow muscle, but you must be lifting 85% heavey to gain it.  Dont ignore protein foods (fish, eggs, nuts, meat) as they are also needed by your body to provide food for muscles.  Remeber to break 3-4 minutes between weight sets to allow the muscle to recouperate before the next set.|`|T4uZeVXjaa	No shake will grow muscles.  Only exercise grows muscles.    See the link below for a fuller discussion|`|cgXX13YVaa	Whey's protein shake is a good alternative to drink after or before that core-strength training routine!    Adding fruits like bananas and strawberries add a better flavor!  More vitamins  and more protein!  Which is what muscles need to grow and expand!|`|EJ0Fvm2Naa	Ahh a long asked question that has yet to be answered there is no one best shake...there is what people say the best shake that helps them...and there are better quality of protein shakes than others...what most middle of the line shakes use is whats called Whey Concentrates...its cheap to produce actually only contains about 80% protein the rest is fillers such as carbs and calories cholesterol...but the best type of shake is a protein that is called Whey Isolates...Isolates contain atleast 90% protein and have a better absorbtion rate than concentrates...therefore you gain more muscle in theory...go to bodybuilding.com and find a protein shake that contains PURE Protein ISOLATES...they are more expensive than proteins that contain concentrates but you see better gains... a good one is called AST VP2...that is pretty much one of the best proteins you can buy...but its also a dollar a serving...which gets expensive after awhile...well good luck
JP2h62qiaa	You should take it with food, but to be safe look on the side of the bottle and see what it says.  IT should have a little car Sign that says no driving. and to take it with or with out food..|`|EQydFhzmaa	Yes, you should. Taking it in the morning is fine.|`|YPNIbZrTaa	Make sure that you take your Zoloft (sertraline) with food or milk.    If you take Zoloft on an empty stomach, you may get a painful heartburn.    Take your medicine first thing when you get up in the morning. Just don't take it on an empty stomach. Eat a little something then don't be afraid to take it!
dadbf491299b240fa671de983330e8fcaa	Yes you can as movicol is a very gentle, and is often prescribed in large doses because it  gently softens your pooh, unlike other laxatives which would give you severe bowel spasms if taken in such quantities.  However if your constipation lasts more than 4 days, then you must go and see your GP has there may be an obstruction of some sort|`|pXPdO2I8aa	Just be sure to drink lots and lots more fluid after taking Movicol or you will get seriously "bunged up"|`|W7qmkVFxaa	yes. I have used it and you can have up to eight sachets. although water per sachet = 125 ml (x6) = 750 ml    so you need to disolve the six sachets in 750 ml of water or individual sachets 125ml|`|S0Clu20aaa	LOL!!!

You must follow the guidelines on the leaflet.
DtG4zpM2aa	It's a severe form of constipation where a lot of faeces has built up in the bowel, which can be seen on an X-ray of the abdomen.  It can cause quite a lot of pain and the normal treatment would be strong laxatives and/or enemas to clear the bowel.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	This is potentially serious and can result to a perforated bowel if not treated carefully and properly.  Impacted means the poo is completely backed up and fills the rectum and colon etc.    (severe constipation that can result to a bowel obstruction)|`|73U1wJmnaa	a fecal impaction is when you hold your poop in your rectum way too long. And when your body sends more digested food to your rectum it compresses the feces that is already in your rectum. Or it impacts it. After this happens, the feces is to hard to be pushed out of your body. and you'll have to go to the doctor to get it out for you.|`|RhI0ndT2aa	constipation.
atmDaT61aa	go to the doctor you could have pnuemonia
2z3oCkWCaa	When your testosterone goes down, through a negative feedback loop your Hypothalamus will be told to release more GnRH.  That realeses more LH, and FSH from your pituitary which tells the testes to produce more testosterone.    Your testosterone might go down for a but but it'll come back up.    Physical activity like performing squats, and deadlifts,  actually increases testosterone.|`|AA10320530	In some ways, you might say that, but a normal, healthy body will produce enough testosterone for those activities, unless of course done in abnormal excess.   Hey, maybe that is why the coach wants guys to stay away from their girlfriends the night before a big game.  From Wikipedia:  A 2003 study[3] showed that serum testosterone levels reach a peak seven days after abstaining.....
1FdChAzCaa	actually, your question was kind of answered on a recent episode of House.  lol    It was an aside mentioned by House and I believe it was an evolutionary theory of sorts...basically there is a correlation between the number of nipples and the number of offspring that a female mammal can have at one time.  Humans usually have one baby at a time; but twins are a definite possibility and are more common than most people think, so women need to have 2 nipples in case there are twins.  That's why female animals that give birth to multiple babies at one time (i.e. dogs, cats, etc.) have multiple teats/nipples, so that they are able to feed all/most of them at once.|`|f1s5MpvHaa	because 2 are better than one|`|B0gNr6ghaa	It is nice to have two because then you can switch off. You also have more milk this way.|`|A7miTF4taa	then why do you have 2 nipples being a man? you don't have babies so why do you even have them? something to ponder on.|`|UIDfTmbcaa	ummmm probably because the amount that a baby drinks is usually more that what a single mammary gland(or wherever that milk comes from) can hold. If they only had one the baby could become malnourished and the nipple would be a lot more sore if they couldn't switch. God made us perfect.|`|AA11806516	one breast is not always enough for proper milk production to feed a baby|`|RaSDfDHBaa	well babies do drink alot of milk and do you not think girls would look very weird if they only had one breast ? well i know for sure that my bf wouldn't be happy if i had 1 boob =^_^=  >.

There are many viral infections similar.    Regardless of what it is, stay bed ridden even if you want to get up, sip plenty of fluids. (10-12 - 200ml glasses a day) and eventually you'll feel fine.    The glands being up sounds like a viral infection so it could well be tonsilitus.    Take Care    FX|`|nlIGl2emaa	Probably, but i would go to the doctor and check it out.

I am stronger and able to keep up with what I need to do and I like to shop for clothes again. I find those things, as well as eating right and moisturizing and taking care of my skin actually take my mind off the wrinkles and help to minimize them. I know a woman who's only 4 years older than me and looks at least 15 since she doesn't take care of herself.     Maybe that will help motivate you to try. Who knows, you may find that taking care of yourself actually makes you look and feel younger. That was motivation for me and I know I don't look my age any more.

It pays to go to a psychiatrist who knows bipolar well.  If he lives within an hour or 2 of a specialist he should do it.  Most bipolars can be treated with medication and live happy, relatively normal lives.  Many bipolars use drugs and alcohol, and typically, the use of drugs or alcohol diminishes the effectiveness of the medication and makes the disease much harder to control.  Another problem is thinking they don't need the meds anymore- it's lifelong treatment.  Basically if the patient can come to terms with his disease and take the meds as ordered by the specialist, the prognosis is good.|`|GO5QHt3Uaa	Go to the doctor.

A doctor is the only one who may diagnose Bipolar and the appropriate medication(s).    Here is some information that may help your friend.    Hi:    I suffer from Bipolar 1 Severe, anxiety, depression, and more. Bipolar is not a diagnosis that should be taken lightly. It is a serious diagnosis and can at times, be lethal. It is a serious condition.    Here is a quick overview of what Bipolar is.    Years ago people suffering from Bipolar Disorder were diagnosed as "Manic Depressive".     The best way for me to describe Bipolar is:    Imagine you are looking at a globe of the world. There are 3 specific areas to keep in mind and those are the North and South Poles and the Equator.    Equator respresents a "Normal" range  North Pole represents "Mania"   South Pole respesents "Manic Depressive"    The Equator is the normal mood/behavior range and this is where people are stable.     The North Pole or Mania phase of the cycle can be described with symptoms of restlessness, energetic, talkative, reckless, risk taking euphoric, grandois, spending sprees, impulsive/risky sex, BUT Mania can also have a dark side to it maybe things like irritation, confusion, anger, rage, and so on.    The South Pole or Manic Depressive phase are the opposite moods of Mania...sadness, crying, feeling worthless, no energy, no pleasure, either too much sleep or too little sleep and so on.    People with Bipolar Disorder will "Cycle" which is leaving the equator, visiting the north pole, south pole and back home to the equator. The completion of this is what is known as a cycle.    People who have Bipolar will cycle ar different rates and there are different degrees of bipolar. So depending on your degree of Bipolar will depend on the route your cycle takes. People usually cycle in days to weeks, others cycle in a few months and yet others as in my self, I can rapid cycle or long term cycle. I will cycle for long months in Mania and suddenly drop for mong months into depression and finally hopefully the out come will be that I get back to the equator safely.     Here are some links that May help you also:    www.medicinenet.com    www.webmd.com    www.bipolar.org    www.HealthyPlace.com    I hope this helped and should you need anything, please contact me, my information is in my profile please feel free to use it at your choosing    Be safe and be well|`|r8lSW7Qwaa	A family doctor can help with diagnosis, which is very important.  All the medications to help with symptoms have to be prescribed by a doctor.    I'm bipolar, and I had symptoms in my late teens, but I was in my 30s before a doctor figured out what was wrong with me. Help seldom just shows up on your door--but lots of problems do when you're bipolar.    Being "moody", over-talkative, and needing lots of sleep (or at other times almost no sleep) are kind of usual behaviours for teens.  Is your friend in the habit of being very sad, and then being perfectly happy in ten minutes?  That's a bipolar symptom.    I'll leave you with some links for you to read about symptoms, and about self-tests your friend can take.  If your friend started taking fish oil vitamin supplements, it might help a little--and it wouldn't hurt because it's just a health supplement.  Omega fatty acid fish oil pills are also good for skin, hair, and brain functions.    If your friend needs help, encourage him to get help.  He could talk to the school counselor about his concerns if the family doctor isn't where he wants to start.  Somebody is usually in the school's buildings during summer.    I had a lot of major problems I could have avoided if I'd realized why I acted the way I did.  I had no control over my emotions or behaviour, and it's scarey.  I tried to commit suicide when I was in college.  About 80% of bipolars attempt suicide, and far too many succeed.  Getting help, taking meds, and seeing a counselor regularly is my best advice to pass on.    I would also suggest your friend start writing a journal about life's daily trials and rewards, and how he feels on a 1 - 10 scale (0=depressed, 10=manic).  A bipolar diagnosis is pretty serious stuff, and your friend may just be going through a tough emotional stage.  If he can document half a dozen mood changes in a day, or afternoon, or hour, he should seek medical help.    Good luck to you both.  You're a good friend, and that's real important in anybody's life.

If your body has no calories to burn, it will burn up it's own resources (fat).   The only problem you can not remain on a liquid diet for the rest of your life.  Your body will be starved of basic nutrients it needs from a variety of foods such as fruits, veggies, lean meats and carbohydrates.  So in all liklihood you will lose inches.  But I promise you the minute you begin to eat again (and you will) you will gain the weight right back at a shocking speed and then some.  It's the nature of a crash diet, sorry.|`|lmaFgvxlaa	If your looking for a liquid diet have you tried Green Tea?

If you add some exercise it works faster. and you can still eat your chocolates.|`|3f938a1ffcd84afe57de9879e26aba19aa	Weight.........buy a pair of 2 kg or 3 kg dumbells............then work out core muscle groups........chest/shoulders/legs etc...........focus on form and reps....................many reps that is.............or you you try cycling.....................cycling is great.............and its all round fitness!!|`|0EmjQjf7aa	don't eat for a year. then show me how thin you are|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It doesnt really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.|`|yDadok18aa	For losing weight, diet and exercise are most important. as long as your energy intake  is less than energy consumed, you will easily lose weight. see the weight loss website: http://www.breaknewpaths.com/|`|3fQ1eIMqaa	OMG you do not need to loose weight everyont loves you as you are:D prom will be great, no matter what size you are x x x  love you babe x x x|`|75dcab971ceba2cd6dbcaf1678fc128daa	JOIN A DANCE CLUB OR A MODE;LLING SCHOOL AND TAKE IT SERIOUS|`|r7VXD0cpaa	well you can eat chocolate but i think you should buy a work out dvd. you can get one from wh smith or somwhere and do that every day after the chocolate. have a pint of water whilst your doing the dvd.|`|XCHZSutoaa	I had a load of unwanted fat in all the embarrassing zones until I tried acai berry, I understand they say that pills will not work, nevertheless they definitely worked for me, and they've been featured on the Rachael Ray Show too.

Im only 15 and no personal trainer but i will give it a hit :)    When you wake up get your skipping rope and do that for as long as you can until you feel you have to stop.  At least 5 minutes.    swap;  walkers, mcoys etc crisps for snack a jacks  chocolate bars for fruit bars  toast for muesli  white bread for brown  even bread for rice crackers  any kind of drink for water, and LOTS of it    Try not to fry food, steam or boil it instead.    Buy a new piece of clothing in the size you want to be. This will really keep you motivated because you will want to fit in it so bad!    go for jogs, do situps press ups, run up and down your stairs.    stand at the bottom of your stairs and step on the first one, step back down and repeat this process fast. -personally this helps me, i noticed after a couple of weeks doing this for 10 minutes each day my legs looks noticeably different.    i really hope this helps you xx

JPssvCAvaa	You can brush with bicarbonate of soda and there are tooth powders. Few people have naturally perfectly white teeth any way.    Avoid drinking tea or coffee and do not smoke for one hour after using a mouth wash. Those things can cause the teeth to get discolored.
pLkeooJ1aa	You sure can.     My brother put cement in two of them once, filled half way. Not a good idea (just so you know). Water, on the other hand is a good idea, they're just not that sturdy if you fill them any less than full (the sloshing, you know).|`|UIDfTmbcaa	there will be a minimal gain. certainly not with low reps.

Fill those bitches with concrete son!|`|56415cd786692379c9afc5baefcd0e37aa	using them as weights is only HALF the problem. you also have to take amino acids (L ornithine and/or L-arginine) and eat protein shakes while working out.  Give yourself 6 months doing it. The results are quite amazing.|`|7fl1T1k5aa	yes! you can use anything as weights

Thats slightly underweight, Don't worry about it, I'm 12 and like 100 pounds, and I'm also 5 foot, Just remember eat more at breakfast than you do at dinner, don't overeat at dinner, also make sure to drink water when your hungry, wait 30 min., because you may have mistaken thirst for hunger, trust me I did it yesterday and it really worked!~
xJzT2uEfaa	In order to maintain, a person at your size and weight should eat.....  1) sedentary: 1630.5 calories   2) lightly active: 1868.28 calories  3) moderately active: 2106.06 calories  4) very active: 2343.84 calories  5) extra active: 2581.625 calories    Now if you want to lose or gain weight, you should just figure out how much a person at that weight and size would eat by using the bmr calculator and the harris-benedict equation (what i used to figure the above out)...below is the site i used to figure this out.    good luck :-D|`|Mf2f7uU9aa	you're ok where you are now...|`|k0VfyBrBaa	just eat right and keep exercising....i don't understand y u wud wanna lose weight
ijduNTgyaa	Ok for eating, dont eat junk...duh, thats easy a lot of people know that. Try to not eat a lot of salty things, it traps water in you and it doesnt help you lose weight. Drink lots and lots of water, stay away from slim fast/vitamin water/energy drinks, some might be good the energy drinks are horrible for you and water beats them all out for quality and its FREE! Water is the bodies oil. Drink more and youll feel great. Try to eat small but more portions of good food throughout the day, it speeds up your matabolism.     To burn fat, you need cardio and lots of it. Go running, biking, swimming, jump rope is pretty good and fun sometimes and rowing.     But if your serious about losing FAT you need to forget about your scale and just look at your body. Muscle weighs a lot more than fat so if you start working out and get discouraged because your gaining weight its because your getting toner, and thats a good thing!     Ok then, some good work outs for ya...These are gonna be good for ya because you dont even need a gym or any real equipment, just mostly dead weight exercises.    For the buns  Plie  Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, arms at sides, toes turned out.  Tuck tailbone under and contract glutes.  Lower body into a plie squat as low as you can go without allowing knees to creep past toes.  Simultaneously raise arms to shoulder height in front of body, palms down. Hold for 2 seconds, then return to starting position.  After 20 reps, pulse at the bottom for 20 seconds.    Hip-Lift Progression  This is an awesome way to relieve tension in your lower back and work your butt at the same time. (A cushy mat will keep your tailbone from crying afterward.)  Lie on your back with your arms at your sides with your knees bent and your feet on the floor.  Lift your hips toward the ceiling. Hold for 1 count, and then lower back down.  Repeat the lifts for 60 seconds, squeezing your glutes and hamstrings at the top of the range of motion. Be careful not to overarch your spine.  To make this exercise more difficult, extend one leg at the top of the lift. Keep your thighs parallel and hold the lifted position for about 5 seconds.  Keeping your hips up, place your foot back on the floor and then lower your hips.  Repeat this exercise for 30 seconds; switch sides and do the move for another 30 seconds on the other     Dumbbell Squats  A simple way to kick off even a quickie workout, these squats are powerful little moves. Over time, increase reps and dumbbell weight to amp them up.  Start with your feet shoulder-width apart and 8- to 10-pound dumbbells by your thighs.  Squat down as if you were going to sit in a chair, keeping your weight over your heels.  Squeeze your glutes as you return to the start position.  Do 15-20 reps.  As you continue, keep the weight in your heels, making sure your knees do not past forward of your toes.  For a bigger challenge, try it without the weights, jump explosively, and land in the squat position.    Legs  do lots of squats. also do leg lifts on your side and your back (lay on your back and SLOWLY lift you legs up and down, if it doesnt hurt, do it a lot slower. shoot for 25 lifts, if it doesnt hurt, go to 50)    arms  Bicep Exercises  Standing Barbell Curls   1. grab your weight with an underhand grip with feet shoulder width apart  2 . allow the weight to hang in front of you, keeping your elbows close to you at all times.   3. moving only your forearms bring the weight into your shoulders.  4. hold for about 5 seconds and then repeat.   Dumbbell Concentration Curls  1. sit on the end of a bench with your legs spread  2. reach down in between your legs and pick up a light weight with one hand.  3. place your elbow on your knee and make sure your arm is fully straight.  4. place your other hand on your other knee so the upper body has some support.  5. using your forearm only bring the weight to your shoulder and hold for a few seconds.   6. repeat and then switch arms  Triceps exercises  Lying Barbell Extentions  1. lie on a workout bench with feet shoulder length apart on each side.  2. grab the weight and hold it above your head with your arms straight.  3. using your forearms only, lower the weigh until it is about one inch above your forehead.  4.then push the weight back to starting position and then repeat.  Tricep Dumbbell Extensions  1. grab a light weight with one hand with feet shoulder length apart  2. lift the weight so your arms are straight above your head  3. slowly lower the weight behind your head  4. then slowing lift the weight again above your head until your in the starting position.  5. repeat for one set of 10 times and then do the same for the other arm.  Forearm exercises  Barbell Wrist Curls  1. grab a weight with your wrists facing down.   2. sit on a workout bench with your arms resting on your legs and your wrists hanging over the bench.   3. using your forearm strength, curl the weight using only your wrists  4. hold the weight

igI5yX0vaa	There is nothing wrong with your immune system.  You build up antibodies with every cold you get.  The problem is that it is a different cold each time, and viruses mutate.    The only thing I noticed when I was your age is that you should get enough sleep.  When I didn't I always got what was going around.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	don't be a germ-a-phobe.  if you don't expose yourself to germs your immune system won't know what to do when it encounters them|`|LkOcJRRWaa	Vitamin C...you could drink OJ or take Vitamin C tablets.|`|5G5uStzMaa	vitamin c tablets  vitamin d (sunshine)  lots of sleep  5 fruit and veg a day  fresh air  not smoking, drug taking etc..

Good Luck|`|Dhq3BfBbaa	Obviously, tons of Vitamin C (Orange juice gives you the 100% daily intake in 250 ml serving) but Ginger also helps (try it in stir-fry). These two things jolt the immune system. Cold FX pills offer a massive dose of ginseng which reports immune system boosts, although, these over-the-counter pills are expensive! (Ginseng is pretty cheap)    My advice, aside from the old adage of sleep well, is drink plenty of water. As your system flushes out impurities in your cells, it decreases the work your immune system has to do and allows it to combat the income of bacteria, viruses, etc.     If you keep getting sore throats, speak with your doctor about your tonsils. If you cold symptoms are nasal (sinus congestion, infection etc.) inquire about sinus surgeries that can remove excess tissue, diminishing the likelihood of infection and/or sickness.|`|7fl1T1k5aa	vitamin C!|`|V5PABmjoaa	daily vitamins/vitamin C|`|DD2smgNIaa	try vitamins...Get the Flintstones tablets or drink orange juice

y8HyP1bzaa	I once read that all women tend to be bisexual by nature.  I think, in a lot of ways, that's really accurate.  It doesn't necessarily mean that YOU want to be sexual with a woman... but you can look at other women and find them attractive, or in this case, find lesbian porn to be a big turn-on.    Normal!    ETA:  Anything that is sexual in any way, can be arousing.  That doesn't mean that you're gay, or that you're a pervert.  You can't control your body's reactions to things.  So, seeing anything remotely sexual gets your hormones going.  It's perfectly normal.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	I'm straight, but I think lesbian porn is hot.  I think you're fine.  That's the great thing about fantasy, it doesn't have to reflect real life at all.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Loads of girls watch lesbian porn but consider themselves straight. Don't worry about it. If you wanted to actually have sexual relations with a girl then maybe you'd want to question your sexuality, but this just sounds like a normal fantasy.|`|224cm8qtaa	Don't worry about it.

jzE6FMawaa	I think it's really a simple thing of mind over matter.  Cigarettes are very hard to quit - harder than many might think.  They are legal, and because of that, they're easy to obtain.

I've seen many simply put their cigarettes down and never go back, because they put their mind to not smoking anymore.|`|pt6wIlS1aa	Hypnosis works well for some people. Be sure to get someone well known for smoking cessation hypnosis, because quite a bit of the success depends on the skills of the hypnotist.

Stay away from caffiene.     I had watch myself all the time to get fit. I did it and lost ten pounds. I rode my bicycle to work and did not drink alcohol|`|6Xbz5AOlaa	Ok well here it goes!! Maintaining a 'keep fit' lifestyle doesn't have to mean slogging it out in a sweaty gym. Just boosting your levels of general daily activity will reap big rewards in improved health and energy. Now here is how to get fit in ur big hectic life!! For many people, the same computer-based jobs that have taken the physical element out of work also take up so much time that exercise is the last thing they feel like doing when they get home. The key to finding time to exercise is to realise two things:    It doesnt have to take very long  just half an hour a day, in ten-minute bursts if necessary.  It can be built into your day-to-day life - it doesnt necessarily have to be found as additional time.      If you're in employment  Despite advances in technology, many of us still spend more - rather than less - time at work. However, there are ways in which you can be more active:    Go for a walk in your lunch break. Try to find at least three different walks and vary them throughout the week. It might even be possible to find an indoor walking route, incorporating stair climbing, for those inevitable bad weather days.  Talk to your employers about promoting health at work. If they don't already, ask if it's possible to provide showers and cycle racks to encourage people to cycle to work. You might even be able to encourage them to provide subsidised membership at a local gym where you could go at lunchtime.   Walk to and from work. If you live too far away, park further from the office or get off the bus or train one stop earlier  even a ten-minute walk will help as long as it is hard enough to get you slightly out of breath.      If you look after children  Having children can change everything about your lifestyle. Some parents find their activity levels drop and their weight increases as going to the gym or playing sport become more difficult. Here are some positive steps you can take:    Exercise with your child. Take them to the local swimming pool or play in the garden or local park.  Find out which local sports and leisure centres have crche facilities, so you can exercise while your child is being looked after.  Walk your child to school. Not only will this help you to be active, it will also help your child develop an early pattern of physical activity that might stay with them into adulthood.  Find out if there are activities available at your child's school for the local community. Many schools use their facilities for sports and exercise classes in the evenings and at weekends.      If you're based at home  Plan your week so you have to walk to the shops frequently. By going often you'll only have to carry light bags of shopping back.  Look at ways in which you can be more active in and around your home. Use the stairs to exercise, work in the garden or  if you have the space and can afford it - install some gym equipment, such as a mini trampoline or rowing machine, for example. Failing that, invest in a skipping rope.  Look for community-based activity programmes in your local area. These don't have to be fitness classes, just anything that gets you moving. Conservation groups can be a great way to get involved in improving your local environment and being active at the same time.       The early bird  If your normal day really doesn't let you incorporate exercise, one option is to get up earlier. If you normally set the alarm clock for 7.30am, set it for 7am instead and use the extra half-hour to go for a brisk walk or even a swim if you have a pool nearby. We all experience exercise differently at different times of the day because of our individual biological cycle, and you might not be a 'morning person', but it's worth a try as exercise first thing can really wake you up and leave you feeling invigorated for the day ahead.    Night owls  Alternatively, if you're not an early bird, consider looking at how you could use any free time you have in the evening to increase your activity patterns. Most of us spend a lot of time sitting watching TV in the evenings, but you could buy some home exercise equipment and work out while you're doing it.    Experiment to find a time for exercise that suits you best.    Maximise your exercise time  Make an appointment to exercise - and write it in your diary. You could also record what you did in your workout, so you can keep track of your achievements.   You can extend this idea by making a real appointment with a friend, colleague or relative to exercise together. If you've arranged to meet someone, you're a lot less likely to skip it.  Keep some exercise kit handy in the places you spend most of your time. This might mean leaving clothes at college, work, with friends or relatives, or in the boot of your car. By having the right clothes handy you can exercise whenever you get an unexpected free 15 minutes or a sudden burst of enthusiasm.  Consider taking active holidays such as a cycle tour or walking holiday. You still need to get
6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	Butter has a small amount of milk solids, so lard has marginally more fat.    And I do mean marginally    ----edit----    I just looked it up.    Lard has 1849 calories per cup and butter has 1628.   Since the calories from each of these items is 100% fat, that means that lard has 12% more fat than butter by volume.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Lard, isnt lard just pure fat?|`|99hfFssXaa	pound of lard.  lard=pure fat  butter=mixture of fat and other goodies|`|RSEp960aaa	Fat is fat. I think it's the same amount.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	I would assume lard because well, it's lard|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Each has the same amount of fat (one pound).  There may or may not be 'salt' and 'food coloring' added to the pound of butter, but not enough to be 'measured' on a scale until you are trying to measure it in tons (2,000 pounds = 1 ton).|`|EQydFhzmaa	Lard is animal fat....|`|jeYL4S5Zaa	Butter has a bunch of crap in it.     Lard is straight fat.     So I would say that lard has more fat in it.|`|5DECiHGTaa	l;ard|`|OLTjkS4zaa	Lard is FAT!|`|RY1xuwzoaa	they are the same...  both are animal fats...|`|BIlDIRNCaa	The obvious way to burn fat is to consume less food and exercise more often, the difficulties appear when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are plenty of opportunities to fail out there don't you think?! The sole thing which definitely showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a few free trials left, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I shed 20 pounds, it definitely does produce success!
UZxeBrxQaa	Actually your question is quite intelligent.  Therefore I shall provide you with a correct answer in lieu of the gibberish you have received so far.    The pectoral muscle tissue behind your breasts, the same as chest muscles on a man, are what you tone.  The breast is fatty tissue and mucus glands necessary to feed babies.  However, if your pectoral muscles are fit and firm, this will produce the effect of enhancing your breast profile, making you look larger and "perkier"!    Here is a site for you to read.  Good luck with your new profile!  http://www.womenfitness.net/pectoral.htm      If you can read, thank a teacher.  If you are not dead, thank a doctor.|`|oadMJWOCaa	push ups|`|feUMAvgLaa	You boobs aren't muscles, You don't exercise them. Sorry|`|VgE6HSdtaa	Lol your breast consists of just tissue, no muscle|`|H9RTbhKYaa	Why do you want bigger boobs?|`|MOWFjKIjaa	breast implants.|`|Hbfc8TIpaa	i like booooooooooooooooobs|`|dd5f7ac6c2748280ff3f8a594a17b9d0aa	Incline flies or bench presses.|`|9EW08emXaa	Well, pushups and bench presses can tone your pecs, which is the muscle under your breasts, so...that's my answer.|`|goe3y4FPaa	if ur a guy and want to loose ur man boobs.. do ''dumbell flys'' if ur a girl.. just exercise.. the fat.. around ur boobs.. will melt|`|9Om1GN5Vaa	i dont know the name of it but its like where u lay on a bench with weights and uno lift them arggh im soo rubbish at explaining basicly using weights but layed down and like u raise your arms in the air with the weights soz i couldnt explain it propley lol|`|hNShT9yhaa	All the fags saying you can't work them out are wrong,    WHILE you CAN'T work out the boob it's seld you can tone the muscles under the fat layer of boobs and the muscle around them. Working these muscles can help life them up, and make them look a little bigger ( your not going to get a cup size or anything sorry. )    So get some 3-5 pound weight ans hold them in your hands. lift the arms up parrelel to the shoulders and lightly bounce them ( wave them a little. ) for 2 counts repeat 5 times. Work your weigh up.    The only real way to tone your boobs is surgery but working the muscles around them being toned may help them appear fuller, and lifted.|`|1X3fvm16aa	As previously stated, your boobs are not a muscle. My best advice would be to lose weight overall by doing cardio. You can build your chest muscles underneath, but thats about it. For appearance, wear a better bra and flattering clothes. If you want them bigger youll have to settle to surgery.     Unfortunately, we cant change our genes.|`|Nyzb6cLraa	Yeah, you can't really tone your boobs. They are mostly fat tissue. However, you can tone the muscles under your boobs, your pectoral muscles, but sometimes that can just make girls look more masculine. I would just be happy with what you have. Maybe find a good bra that gives you the support and shape you are looking for.     You can make your boobs move by flexing the pectoral muscles. That is what you were seeing on TV|`|yfrZowkfaa	there is no way. just wear a bra|`|lD3RQhYiaa	you cant tone or ecersize your boobs at all they are just fat deposits NO MUSCLE so there for not toneable   :p|`|i2Cki53Waa	Most likely your boobs will become smaller if you exersize your pecs but muscle will form under :S|`|U6C4Bywwaa	since there is no muscle in your boob, you cant tone them. There are chest muscles behind your breast and so toning those will help your boobs appear perkier. Think chest presses and push ups. Also, make sure you wear a fitted, good sports bra whenever running or being active. When yor boobs move and jump a lot, the skin stretches more making them not as perky and a little saggy. Good luck?|`|z7hWblT7aa	send me a picture of them and I will tell you if they need to be toned

EDXh0tk9aa	Yes, Planned Parenthood can help with your possible infection.|`|KAwHCSW4aa	It is most likely a yeast infection if it is THAT clumpy. If it itches and burns too, then it is. Check with your gyno and she can prescribe a special antibiotic for it. Have you seen those vagisil commercials?  that is good too.if not, planned parenthood could probably help you too. Good luck!
igI5yX0vaa	Only the viral type can spread.  The other kinds (fungal, parasitial, bacterial)  means you all have to be exposed it to get it.|`|AA11503678	These (Haemophilus influenzae) bacteria spreads with a cough, sneeze or even breathing the bacterious air.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	As the name implies - through the minge - either you touching someone's or they touching it themselves and then touching you.|`|yNGWA678aa	Enteroviruses, the most common cause of viral meningitis, are most often spread through direct contact with respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person. This usually happens by shaking hands with an infected person or touching something they have handled, and then rubbing your own nose or mouth. The virus can also be found in the stool of persons who are infected. The virus is spread through this route mainly among small children who are not yet toilet trained. It can also be spread this way to adults changing the diapers of an infected infant.     Hope this helped~

What is bad for your health is gazing at this computer screen and sitting bent. Keep with the exercise.|`|EJ0Fvm2Naa	no...if all your doing for PE is jobbing...then its no big deal...most people before lifting weights will jog for 10-15 minutes anyways to warm their muscles up to get ready to lift weights....so you should be fine..

8RQCa3SXaa	sadly, if you have bigger hips than your waist it will always be this way. but you have a more attractive body shape.    if you lose weight, you will lose it both off your hips and waist, but your hips and waist will always be the same size in comparison to eachother.    my advice is to learn to love your body, guys will find your feminine shape much more attractive than a straight up and down shape, which is more masculine.    i hope this has helped (:|`|9wGz6ySNaa	running, jogging, hula hooping..|`|8Y9timR4aa	run baby run lol|`|gSwobfujaa	big hips are nice. why would you want to get rid of your hips? and really its your bone that makes your hips larger. you cant work off your bone.|`|dhEvs07waa	Well hips are the hardest thing to loose. Your best bet is diet and excersize and it will slowly go away. HOWEVER. if your hips are the biggest part of your body it will almost always be the biggest part of your body no  matter how small you get *ratio wise*. Either way, if it makes you feel better bigger hips are whats "hot" right now. Look at Eva Mandez as someone else mnetioned, Kim Kardashian , Beyonce, belly dancers lol, and the most beautiful girl in the world Angelina Jolie WANTS bigger hips. Hips are gorgeous my dear. If you want to work on your body, maybe work on your waist and that will give u a very pretty curvy look. good luck :]|`|8SRjELNBaa	You obviously failed to do your research, big hips is your body type, accept it, it's biological, your born with it, blame your parents & ancestors for your genotype and phenotype.     Fat is stored all around your body and there is not one particular exercise that will target the fat stored in your hips. What you need to do is start on an aggressive cardio program and your body will use the fat stored around your entire body. Eventually you will notice shrinkage around your entire body, including your hips.    But if your hips are really jiggly, there are exercises you can do to firm them up (not eliminate fat exactly, but FIRM).  I suggest a google search consisting of "hip exercises".  Do some research!|`|PbESvbu6aa	I am in the same boat I was a size 0 before I had 4 kids now I work my *** off at the gym and am losing every week.|`|jKF58jmTaa	Beautiful Eva Mendes used to feel that way, at the end, she says she is proud of them.

DxR8Aoxdaa	Abscessed teeth can cause serious health problems. If there's a chance it is abscessed, ask her to see a dentist. Don't blame yourself (or me) is she gets sick and dies. The reality is while she likely won't pass on because of it, death is a possibility.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	It is hard to tell if it is her teeth or gum. It may even be sinuses. If all her teeth hurt. She may be distrustful but if she has an infection (which is probable) she needs something to kill it. C and tea are nice but not effective.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	She probably has some gum disease if she doesn't want to go to a dentist she should clean her teeth really well.|`|ZMWjdKfraa	It sounds like an abscess and will  need an antibiotic.|`|CAAcoqtYaa	She has to see a dentist. I believe it is testrosterome desease.(something like that). My mom has it. She has to see a dentist for it.|`|2c3rcQRbaa	Motrin for the pain.  But it sounds like an infection and needs to be treated.  Screw not having insurance.  You mothers health is more important.|`|1nINGDC7aa	It is not gum problem. It is infected tooth pain may be an abcess. In infected tooth, the pain is especially more when you lie down whereas in gum problem the pain is constant.

Whether or not she trusts dentists, she needs to go to one right away to prevent the spread of infection through her gums which could lead to blood infections or rotten teeth and weakened gums.|`|xZMoaqRSaa	abscessed tooth i know for a fact same thing happen to me like  amonth ago. i went to the er bc i woke up and my face was swollen they told me i had tonsilitis but my teeth and ears were hurting to . so i then went and saw a dental hygentist and turns out it was an abscessed tooth|`|XTBsXy17aa	Look to me she's got a teeth infection...    There is probably a lot of pressure in her tooth right which makes the cheek swallow and put a lot of pressure on the other teeth..

If you have them in your area, Aspen Dental, does their own financing so she could make payments instead of paying all up front.|`|ib2HAGIEaa	if she didnt get her wisdom teeth pulled it might be an infection there because its easy to accumulate bacteria there, since its hard to clean.    i dont know which area you are from and dont know why your mom doesnt trust dentists but i think its still best to have them take a look before the condition gets worse|`|3cf54b98aab3159bdd02ab505ad9368eaa	Not good for a lot of reasons:    1)  If it is her gum, she could loose the teeth as the gum receeds or (even worse) dies.   If thats the case she needs to really be cleaning them, (floss, etc.) get some antibiotics and use an antiseptic mouthwash and MAYBE it will heal  .. BUT  because of the inclination thing i would put my money on....    2)  It might be an abcessed tooth.  That is where the nerve and the tooth die out at the jaw.  The resulting infection causes pressure on the nerve which, to put it mildly, hurts like hell.  The pressure builds highter at night when you are doing less.  Motrin or things like that will ease the pressure but not solve the problem.  As the infection grows it will eat away at the jaw bone (which will not re-generate itself very well) if the infection migrates into the bloodstream you have a potential for septic poisoning which can be fatal  (blood poisoning).    3)  Less likely but also possible:  Oral Cancer... also a nasty possibiility.    Bottom line here.. call around and find out what options are available, but get to a dentist... at least for a checkup/diagnosis.   Tea is not going to help.    .|`|I12CqmD0aa	I would go see a dentist they are not that bad.|`|ImeMT0Zlaa	Has she had her wisdom teeth extracted?|`|AV8iecoKaa	it sounds serious i would highly recommend seeing a dentist but if she is that distrustful of them  i would say get some oragel and hope for the best .

General workout layout  Mondays: Weights  Tuesdays: Cardio + 1 hr of yoga  Wednesdays: Cardio  Thursdays: Weights  Fridays: Cardio  Saturdays: Cardio  Sundays: Rest    Weight days consists of: (15 reps x 3 sets with a 20lb weight(s))  Inclined flies (chest)  Declined flies (chest)  Flat flies (chest)  Leg lefts (abs)  10 lb. weight in-between my legs.  Bicep curls (biceps)   Tricep extensions (triceps)  Declined sit-ups (abs)  Shoulder shrugs (traps)  Pushups (upper body)  15 x 3 sets  Shoulder lifts (shoulders)  Bent-over shoulder-blade squeezes (back)    Cardio days consist of:  20 minutes of treadmill  20 minutes of the stair-stepper  20 minutes of the elliptical  20 minutes of the stationary bike  20 minutes of jumping rope    Diet:  Breakfast (same as Lunch):  -1/2 cup oatmeal = (150 calories), 27 g carbs, 5g protein  -3 egg whites = (17 calories each, 51 total), 12g protein  -1 chicken tender = 75 calories, 16g protein  3+ Cups of water  (1 multi vitamin with breakfast only)    Dinner:  Some sort of green stir-fry vegetable thing, Ive got dinner covered & it never reaches more than 400 calories. Plus, Im also drinking 2+ cups of water.    So for breakfast & lunch, Im getting a total of 276 calories, 33g of protein & 27g of carbohydrates per meal.  --------------------------------------...|`|pM6kJg3aaa	Breakfast:  -16 ounces of ice cold water  -A cup of coffee (every third day)  -1 cup GoLean cereal     AM Snack:  -60 calorie cheese stick  -1 handful of walnuts  -8 ounces ice cold water    Lunch:  -Roasted chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato on wheat bread  -Any green Vegetable  -Fruit of your choice  -16 ounces ice cold water    PM Snack:  -Fruit of your choice  -8 ounces ice cold water    Dinner:  -Grilled Wild salmon  -Squash  -Whole Wheat dinner roll  -16 ounces of ice cold water    Dessert (every other day)  -1 cut of banana with lowfat chocolate syrup drizzled on top.     This diet plan is only for one day, but i suggest using this exact diet plan every day but subsituting foods from the same food group in for these. For example, instead of salmon every night, enjoy talapia one night a week.    EXERSIZE:  Without exersise, you will most likely not lose much weight at all. Try walking at least 3 miles each day on a teadmill or outside. Then, gradually move up to more. Soon you can start jogging. This will get you looking great in no time...    Good luck!|`|947a0dc92dd1bc409cf80a04f33e48e0aa	I know you're a chick, but read Men's Health TNT Diet.

It's a good idea to set off at the beginning, and determine whether you are in reality overweight for your size or not, by working out your BMI (Body Mass Index). To be honest, the only diet that really delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a handful of free trials left, it was featured in Fox News and CNN. I worked off 25 pounds, it really does produce results!

AA10782938	I had gained weight and lost allot now I was over 200 pounds at one point in time and now under 160 I went and started to eat small meals all day. I went and put snacks in sandwich bags for work so I wouldn't really need to take a lunch. What lunch I did take I walked around and up and down stairs. I even got a friend of mine at work to do this with just so I wasn't alone all the time. On my off days I did the same thing but for my kids as well just to make eating fun for them. My daughter still loves her cereal in a little baggy of her own. Make sure you get enough vitamins so you don't miss out on the few things you need through the day. Remember to eat proteins you should have a intake of half your body weight ( I read it somewhere and do it myself) you also need to drink allot of water. I make a weekly goal of waking distance or running if I have the time. So keep hanging in there and you will end up eating this way by habit. Oh I almost forgot I cheat once a week to keep what I really love to eat in my life a bit but sometimes I really didn't want it after a bit of time.|`|CjmdKPrFaa	stop smoking marijuana|`|wfCKC7lMaa	eat more frequently and healthier,  instead of fried foods, get a sandwich or some fruit. just eat smaller and more through out the day  or  when you do get the munchies eat healthier...  baked chips instead of regular one, fruit in stead of candy,   a salad to your liking...|`|t21acFpZaa	Drink lots of water to keep you stomach full...That might help u.|`|zu9Mn3Y6aa	To be honest I don't think there is anyway to stop the munchies.

AA11549667	I would agree- anger management would be a consideration. Not only are you not enjoying life, but neither are the people around you whom you presumably love. As for church- more than 'going' to church I'd recommend praying, and reading something like the psalms book. Try not to dwell on the things that you see wrong with your world, but that which is not wrong, while searching for viable ways to improve that which can be improved. I know... all this is easier said than done. Most of all remember you're not alone. Plenty of people in this world are fed up with the status quo and are filled with toxic anger and/or deep depression- and... each are loved, even if they do not realize it. Peace to you, and may God guide you, and HIS love fill your mind and heart.|`|0e73daa69b43783bfcb6f6cb1515b02faa	I recognise myself in what you say.      Not only did I try and kill other people, but myself as well - I would purposely play chicken in the traffic - I have crashed so many cars that I can not get motor insurance.  I would not get help because I had this image of Woody Allen type people laying on a shrink's couch spilling their guts out in a flood of tears - that is not my style.  One day I realised that I was drinking exessively and my job was on the line. Guys at my age don't do that kind of thing thing.  I had to see a counselor, who was a psychologist - she put me on chronic med's and diagnosed me as depressive.  She had me stoned but at least she cured me of drinking - but the moods were still there.      Another place, another job on the line. I had give up on the pills.  A caring boss referred me to a psychiatrist this time.  I was really skeptical.  Doesn't matter what I was diagnosed with - I am now on new med's, being monitored, I understand my symptoms and triggers, know what the warning signs of my moods are and when to seek help.      One type of pills made my **** drag, they were changed.  One type of pills made me impotent, they were changed.  Simple questions.  No soul searching searching, saving the whales and feeding africa crap.  Just me and my problem.    You think you need to see a psychiatrist.  I wish I knew that much years ago.|`|KbbnCoWYaa	No Real answer to that one .Most of the time I wish the man upstairs would thin the herd a bit on this planet.|`|368803644f5cb10ac0dc1b6b1625ac16aa	music. scream out all your anger|`|834fa78e6e75fb34ae28e51916e6546baa	To be happy see this video;  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4P5Pmdvg...

If the general practitioner or councelor believe you need medicinal help controlling your anger, they will know to whom to refer you.    Your anger could stem from any number of places and depending on that, the treatment or help may be tailored to you, which will have the best chance of helping.|`|AA10192101	You need to uncover what's making you angry. Sit down with a piece of paper and a pen and write down what comes to mind, when you're feeling angry.  Have a look at it. You may be frustrated, or feel exasperated in some situations.  You may be under a lot of stress and not realize it.  Or, you may have to learn how to control your anger better.  I'm the opposite--I'm frequently fearful and skittish.  Different personalities.  Practice having more patience in trying situations.  And when something goes wrong, attempt to see the funny side of a situation.  Maybe you're taking things too seriously.  Hope this helps.|`|275405a012e6255e1b61b8bfb5d78d07aa	Accept responsibility for your actions and choices.  Then perhaps the world you see what start to change!

qsRuwn6Aaa	Sounds like allergic rhinitis.  Schedule a visit with an ENT physician who specializes in these types of illnesses.  He may or may not put you on Prednisone to take the swelling down, but chances are he'll put you on a allergy medication and/or nasal spray to combat the symptoms you're experiencing.  If it turns out to be a sinus infection, he'll place you on anti-bitoic therapy and you should begin feeling better shortly.    Be sure to drink plenty of fluids to keep the secretions in your nasal passages thin so they're easier to excrete.

XxRDG0Luaa	hmm this is a hardd one. well i feel like its up to you- do you eat way to much because of your hunger or because of emotions? its something you need to decide. if your eating because your upset and angry or bored then theres a chance you may have a compulsive eating disorder. if your eating because your just hungry and your body never stops being hungry then maybe its not an eating disorder. in your case, it looks like you eat a lot and that your eating because of emotions. so i think you may have a disorder. if you really think you do, see a doctor. theyll help.      hope this helped. |`|AA12345516	It does sound to me like you are using food as an antidepressant and it would probally be in your best interest to check into a doctor, even if the weight gain doesn't bother you think about the long term effects of your diet,  all the sugar, fat and cholestorol is horrible for your heart.

Maybe you should look back closely at what you did for the past year. Were you eating less(and more healthy) foods EVERY DAY? Did you count your calories before you ate anything? Did you do exercise 4-5 days for at least a half hour every day each week? Do you have any idea what your BMR or RMR is?    If you don't have honest answers for these questions, then you should talk to a professional or at least learn about how weight loss works in general. On the other hand, if you answered yes to all of the questions, then it would be best to talk to a doctor.    Remember: Diet and exercise aren't done only to lose weight.

You should proceed on exercising and limiting your intake of foods. One thing you might not know is that when losing weight you don't do muscle building exercises til after you are at your ideal weight. And when you lose weight, you start seeing signs at the feet and legs first. Then the face...your neck and last of all your belly/midsection and thighs. Don't give up after 3 months. Keep at it! And walk 4-6 days a week  for 20 minutes at a moderately fast pace. One thing to keep in mind is not to invite someone to join in walking cause they slow you down. If you do..keep your own pace even if you leave them behind. You can do it! Give it months..not weeks. I'm rooting for you! Take an ipod with you and listen in to your favorite music as you walk. You can do it! You can do it! Now, get out there and start walking...*hugs*

There are a number of reasons for this.    With age there is some degradation in our brain activity and this is accelerated in those people who eventually grow to suffer from any of the various forms of dementia.    However, there is another reason for the forgetting of things...nothing to do with mental activity or health...each year we learn so many new things.    Imagine you are at Junior school, you will know probably all of the other students by sight, and a lot of them by name, others more intimately as they become friends (or enemies!) There may be 3/400 students at any one time (or more) plus all the teachers, etc.    When you reach the age of secondary school (high school) you start all over again, with some of the same friends from the earlier school, but several hundred others, plus all the existing students who are a little older than you...each year there will be approximately the same number of students join.  You will begin remembering all of them.    But not just the students, all the way through school you will be assimilating the facts given to you by your teachers, experiencing games, sports and 'trip' days, etc.  All these facts are retained in your brain.    Then you start to meet boys (in your case, not mine!) and you have a whole load of new experiences to remember.  Plus hundreds of music tracks, films, television programs, vacations, accidents you see on the street and thousands of other inconsequential things that occur throughout your life.    By the time you are ready to leave school and take up the task of earning a living, or maybe another school (college), where again you'll need to remember another bunch of names, faces and experiences and, of course, start to assimilate another huge bunch of information, you will have 'retained' an absolutely vast amount of 'knowledge'.    As you go through life some of these facts and some of these people will constantly be needed...you won't ever forget these.  Other things, however, will be stuck at the back of your mind and not used...these you 'forget'.  Sometimes it is possible to recall, after a few moments thought, some of this, but often (as you have obviously found) some of these facts and items of knowledge have slipped away and you just can't recall them.    It is said that the brain never forgets...I'm not sure that is true, and certainly it is not true in practical terms, as there are people I honestly cannot recall the name of who, at school, I spent a great deal of time with.    I believe it is the sheer weight of information that allows some things to slip backwards in  your mind.  As each year passes you get more and more information packed into your head.  Eventually you will 'lose' some.    Think of it like a computer...you start with, say, 50 Gb of memory, the first day you switch it on you start to store a million facts, and each day that goes by you store more...then more...eventually the hard drive gets full, so you 'zip' some of the facts to release a little more space for the information that comes at you daily.  Eventually your body will 'start emptying your recycle bin'.    That's not a perfect analogy, but pretty close.    So it is perfectly normal for people to 'lose' information they don't use regularly.  The stuff you do use, you retain at the 'front' of your mind.    Your age does have something to do with memory loss, but the biggest problem is the sheer weight of information your brain is forced to carry.  this can happen at any age.    Mostly the 'loss' is a very suitable loss, as it is only the stuff you don't really need that gets lost.    Hope that explains it reasonably well...    Now, what was I doing...?    Cheers,    BobSpain.|`|AA11091977	Because the older you get the more you experience, hence the more you need to remember. You'll find you remember whats important and not trivial crap.

AA11124184	From what I've heard, the amount of fat calories burned from your total calories will be higher when walking compared to running at a faster speed. The percentage of fat burned will be higher than the percentage of carbs burned. However, you burn more calories by running. So, in the end it is actually better to run than to walk.
ROxGqrefaa	This is a very common issue dealt with especially by bodybuilders...The answer as to "why" could be a lot of things, but is more than likely genetic.  The good news is, you can even them out if you want.  Do you lift weights?  Have you ever considered it?  If so, here is what you do.  Many weight lifters use this technique for arms, but in your case, use it for the pecs.  First of all, you aren't going to even them out using a barbell...you must use DUMBELLS.  Since your right pec is smaller, load about five more pounds of weight onto that dumbell (get the adjustable kind)...make sure you flex the chest as you press upwards, and really emphasize the right side.  Hit the chest at every angle...incline, decline, and flat.  Use more weight on the right side, but not TOO much weight...you don't want to pull a muscle...just enough to notice the right pec is being worked harder.  Do flys, presses, inclines...etc  Remember, pushups, bench presses with the bar, they will only keep things the way they are.  You need dumbell isolation.  It will take time, but you can get the look you're wanting.  Be well.|`|AA11174334	Maybe youre half women and half man. The women part of you has bigger breasts. Ping.

eIyFz2tQaa	To become certified in CA does not take very long. Check out Regional Occupational Programs in your local area. Many of those programs run for about 7-9 months with some internship hours required. There are offices that will also hire you with out ANY dental knowledge at all. All on the job training. But you will need your x-ray license and you must get certified for that. the classes are not super expensive if you do them through the ROP. Private facilities may be more and then they may offer financial assistance. Some programs train you directly to be a REGISTERED dental assist. Which will mean more pay and more job duties.
934eb0a5e90379e9a2423a320f379249aa	No.. I am about to get braces for the second time this month also. I had them when I was 14, and now I am about to turn 25. Your mouth gets sore for a while, and again each time they get tightened, but its not really 'painful' just sore. I always liked pink bands, but this time maybe I'll just stick to clear bands. lol Good Luck.|`|WATEFEvVaa	A little bit of discomfort, doesn't hurt that much.  Everyone is different, but for me I would sometimes get a headache.  When I had braces I didn't have any color options.  I would say get whatever color makes you happy.  Make sure you always carry a toothbrush with you, after you eat you'll always end up with lots of food in your braces.  So, get in the habit of brushing right after you eat.  Also, I would buy a waterpik by Teledyne.  The waterpik works great at getting food out from in-between your teeth & braces.|`|BGawOH0Iaa	it hurts a bit, not much whilst getting them put in, but after it feels weird and hurts a bit cos it's pulling on your teeth. it also catches on your gum sometimes, and that hurts. :) they're not the most comfortable of things, but they're not the worst, you'll get used to hem.  As for colours, just don't choose green, it looks like you have spinach in your teeth. or yellow or white because they both make your teeth look a bit yellowy sometimes.  i suggest red (i have red), blue, pink or purple.    :)
JPssvCAvaa	On the grounds that alcohol kills germs it sounds like it would do that. Some mouthwashes do contain alcohol.    I should think that on a cost basis, it would be cheaper to buy a mouthwash than booze but you are not going to spit it out right?    Hard liquor is flavored and also contains sugar so that would not do your teeth any good.|`|pexxZB8Daa	probably not!|`|YqCpJ3PIaa	That would be a big NO!|`|aVFyG1n7aa	Probably not because liquor can tend to have sugar, artificial stuff, and things that just stick on to your teeth

oog7eBnHaa	Xanax is a prescription medication used for anixiety and depression.  It is taken orally.  It should NEVER be abused to get high.  Over abuse of this drug can lead to psychical dependency as well as seizures if you stop taking it right away.  NEVER ever use a drug that is prescribed to you or someone else to use as a recreational drug.|`|AA10287830	I would think that that would be the very least drug you would huff to get high!  It doesn't work that way.
VB76LCmSaa	for your chest to get bigger in the inside do close grip bench presses, make sure to keep your forearms parallel with the bar for the inside pecs, if their parallel with your body it will target your triceps instead of what you want.  also do incline bench press and the classic bench press for build mass in your pecs and deltoids.                for your trapaziods do upright rows, stand with feet together, back straight, head up, hands on the bar about 6 inches apart, lift the bar up about 5-6 inches from your chin.  your elbows, and neck should be in line with each other, slowly bring it back down.  inhale when bringing it up, exhale when bringing down.                for your lats do chin ups, wide grip med grip and close grip, the farther apart you make your hands the more it will widen your lats and closer it will add more mass to your back.  chin ups are pretty basic, with your palms facing out cross your legs and slowly bring your self up, if its wide grip lift yourself until the back of your neck touches, or nearly touches, the bar.  if its a close or medium grip then lift until your your chest just above your nipples touches the bar.  make sure to stretch your latissimus dorsi a lot, these muscles need to be stretched to properly form.    For you lower back i suggest dead lifts.  place a barbell on the floor in front of you.  bend your knees, lean forward, and grasp the bar in a medium-wide grip, one hand in an over hand grip, the other in an underhand grip.  keep your back fairly straight to protect it from strain.  If you curve your back you risk injury.  begin the lift by driving with your legs.  straighten up until you are standing upright, then throw the chest and shoulders back as if coming to attention.  to lower the weight, bend the knees, lean forward from the waist, and touch the weight to the floor before beginning your next repetition.    eat lots of protein!    Buon Fortuno!    Bruno Talina|`|I83sYbARaa	It takes knowledge to work out the right way to gain muscle, to eat right to gain muscle,etc.... It takes a lot of work...  So go to a gym and start asking questions, and research things for yourself...|`|CvRscCrjaa	inhale.|`|EdMfJqA5aa	steroids|`|JQZzI49Paa	Benching and triceps|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Stick to big, compound exercises. People tend to over-isolate and get into all these crazy machines and weird positions. You really don't need all that, especially when you're starting out.     The core of your chest routine should be bench press. You can make a lot of progress with just that, but you won't get too far without it. Dips, flys, cable flys, incline, decline, dumbbell pullovers...all are good supplemental exercises. I prefer dumbbell bench press to barbell; it's a greater range of movement and it ensures that you can't favor the strong side of your body.    The best single back exercise is pullups. Start using an assisted machine if you have to, then transition to plain pullups, then weighted pullups to increase the challenge from there. Bent-over barbell rows are a great exercise, too--you will make a lot of progress with just those two. Lat pulldowns are okay, so are cable rows. Deadlifts will work your lower back and legs and, along with squats, are probably the best overall exercises you can do. They work a huge portion of your body in one movement. Do a few sets of deadlifts, at a challenging weight, and tell me you aren't exhausted.
wXKs94nDaa	10 days|`|N9nJWYa5aa	You really think a diet of water, sugar and acid is good for you???????    Technically you could survive on this for a couple of months but you'll be doing yourself long term possibly permanent damage.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Please don't do this to yourself. It's potentially harmful and it will not help you in the long run.    Make sensible changes to your lifestyle; eat a bit less, exercise a bit more. You will see progress. Patience is key.    We all know how to take care of our bodies; we managed to survive for hundreds of thousands of years before diet gurus came along and sold us this junk. It's just that the temptation of the "quick fix" or "secret" is so great that we will try everything before we try what's proven to work: sensible diet and consistent exercise.    EDIT: To answer your added question: honey has some nutrients in it, but the main reason that these "crash-diets" advocate it (or maple syrup) is that it provides just enough calories and glucose to prevent you from keeling over. That might make it slightly more bearable than a water-only fast, but not any better for you. It is still completely devoid of essential macronutrients like protein and fat, and most vitamins.    Please educate yourself by finding information not published by people trying to sell you something. A modicum of nutritional knowledge reveals that this is both radical and pointless.|`|Mumfvpuzaa	i would estimate 2 weeks.    good luck!|`|0ca6f6ce6afa279f3ccc449197fd3d7daa	id say about three weeks, youd be really weak though probably just have to lay there.|`|niZBsn9Qaa	ah you're talking about the master clense detox arent you. This is normally only recommended for a maximum of 21 days. Honey does have a lot of important vitamins and minerals that are healthy for your body, but dont do it to lose weight, do it to detox. Chances are, the only weight you will lose will be stored feces and water weight, its excellent for purging toxins (add some cayanne pepper to the mixture). But the honey must be organic. Grade B maple syrup is good too (its organic as well).    just dont be discouraged if you gain some weight back when you start to eat again, it always happens.

AA10815212	What you describe are probably either PACs (premature atrial contractions) or PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) neither of which are particularly concerning and do not lead to or put you at risk for more serious conditions.    There are probably two issues at play:    1.  Electrolytes.  Your heart's electrical impulses (natural pacemaker) is controlled by the right amount of electrolytes flowing in and flowing out of the cell, at precisely the right time.  Alcohol is a diuretic (makes you pee) thereby often loosing both fluid and electrolytes, striking an imbalance.  Too few or too many of electrolytes in the wrong place will alter the function of the cell.  Solution - be sure to remain well hydrated.  Consider adding a big glass of (specifically) orange juice with calcium to your regimen before turning in at night if you have been drinking - or switch to a drink that has orange juice in it.    2.  Stress. Any stressor - getting a cold, too little sleep, poor eating habits...and heavy drinking can all affect the physiologic functioning of your body, including how your heart beats.  After all, talk with someone who suffers from panic attacks - when they are stressed, they definitely will report changes in their heart rate and rhythm.  This is just on a much smaller scale.    In sum, not everyone is cut out to drink alcohol.  (Asian people often have a naturally very strong flushing reaction to alcohol, for instance.)  If it doesn't agree with your system, the easiest thing to do is not drink very much.    I hope this helps.  Good luck.

GRHDRvqcaa	I went through the exact same thing. For YEARS and YEARS.     I won't give you a drawn out lecture about self-esteem and loving yourself the way you are because you won't listen. But what I will say is that what you don't appreciate at 14, you will at like, 21.     That said, if you are dead set on gaining weight do it the healthy way. Don;t eat junk food, try things like pasta and banana based shakes. They work. Also, are you an athletic person? My friend began running track and exercising helped her put on a few pounds.|`|5xmH6HDeaa	wow!!!!  that is the exact oppisite of most 14 year olds um.....ask ur doctor or look it up on line...GOOD LUCK   =D|`|mA59dkjXaa	wow i dont know many people who want to gain waight but well maby try eating three BIG portions of food every day and then snacks in between like fruit or chocolate|`|hoI9CwWLaa	If you wanna gain weight you have to increase your calories intake eat more chicken, turkey, beef, tuna, lots of milk.. ATLEAST eat 4-5 meals a day with high calories.. If you increase your calories by 500-1000 you'll gain 4-6lb in 2 weeks|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It sounds like you have a really fast metabolism, which will slow down with age. If you want to slow it down yourself, I dont recommend it simply because you are very young and you shouldnt worry about this yet because 99 percent of the people you hang out with now you will probably lose contact with, within 8 or 9 years.  But if you still want to slow it down. Try to eat one or two large meals a day. Skip breakfast and only have maybe lunch but better yet just dinner. But make sure you workout too. Or else it will just be fat that you gain. But If I were you I would take a look at a healthier diet plan that might take a little longer to gain some weight but it is going to be muscle weight and not fat weight.    It doesnt really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.
pISC6pphaa	Are you pregnant?  If there's a chance you could be, get a test, it could be ectopic (tubal pregnancy).  How severe is your pain?    If you are pregnant, and having symptoms like this, especially with severe pain, get to the emergency room.    It could also be gall bladder, stones, etc.  Syptoms are similar.

45hecz6laa	I have only been getting my periods for a year as well. The clear fluid is vaginal discharge. It's like egg whites because it contains mucus.|`|zLGOQQs5aa	discharge. its fine. normally you get a lot before you start your period in the month.|`|6qsocyK3aa	You can expect your period to take up to three years until it's regular.    As long as the discharge doesn't smell funny and is not green or yellow, I think you're fine.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	This should help you decide:    Once you start puberty a white and/or clear discharge is normal. The vagina is self-cleaning. This same discharge increases the closer you get to ovulation and when you are sexually aroused. Trust me, you don't ever want it to go away. You will also have your own scent - musky - and it will smell stronger to you than to others.     You can have this normal discharge for weeks, months or even years before getting your first period and it will also continue after you get your period. You can wear a pantyliner if it bothers you.   .  Different Types of Discharge:    White: Thick, white discharge is common at the beginning and end of your cycle. Normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching. If itching is present, thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection.    Clear and stretchy: This is "fertile" mucous and means you are ovulating.    Clear and watery: This occurs at different times of your cycle and can be particularly heavy after exercising.    Yellow or Green: May indicate an infection, especially if thick or clumpy like cottage cheese or has a foul odor.    Spotting Blood/Brown Discharge: May happen right after periods, and is just "cleaning out" your vagina. Old blood looks brown. This may occur when you are ovulating/mid-cycle. Your first period can look like this also.    Different types of infections:    Signs of yeast infections:  White, cottage cheese-like discharge   Swelling and pain around the vulva   Intense itching     Signs of bacterial vaginosis:  A white, gray or yellowish vaginal discharge   A fishy odor that is strongest after sex or after washing with soap   Itching or burning   Slight redness and swelling of the vagina or vulva
qMwjrQbOaa	About one week. Do it consistently.
46c7cd50cfcdfc3b34f278651df37872aa	Add a couple hundred.  You're dangerously close to "starvation mode" with that number.  If you're exercising daily, eat about 1500 calories, 1200 if you are not exercising vigorously.  Of course you are right to cut sweets, but it's okay to plan for eating stuff you enjoy as long as it fits the calorie count and is kept to a minimum.  I plan for one cookie or maybe a low-cal latte every once in a while, but i stick to 1200-1500 calories.  You'll stick to it much more easily if you aren't too harsh and allow yourself to eat some things you enjoy.  Just cut pizza, fries, and ice cream, etc. And of course fill up on veggies and fruits; don't forget a little calcium.  Protein is good for filling up.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	1000 calories is not enough.  Try 1500, that's much healthier.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	you wont babe as this is too few to lose weight, go for 1500 and you'll lose more quickly|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It doesnt really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.|`|kiKB7tdaaa	I think it's way too little and you're going to end up gaining weight. Weight loss isn't just about who can eat the fewest calories, because if you eat too little it slows down your metabolism and causes your body to store fat. If you really want to lose weight, eat 1,500 calories a day with exercise over a period of a few months, but give yourself a break every Saturday.    On Saturdays you should satisfy cravings by eating a few sweets, to keep yourself motivated and keep yourself from doing it on other days.|`|oGFNIQdIaa	actually i was to a doctor and he give a diet plan of 1000 calories per day but he also told me if i start this it should be come in time a life style.. cause if return to the old habits the pounds will also return and alot more then the ones lost... as some say here its not so healthy , but honestly i keep for about 2 weeks and i already lost 6 kilos ( i dont know about pounds ) and the thing is i feel great. at 1st u will lose like 2-3 kilos, dont get excited that is just the water from ur body after these 3 kilos u can say u are really starting to lose weight, in this rithm u can lose like 1-1.5 kilos per month. good luck|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Everyone is unique.  The body adapts to the survival and subsistence circumstances of the individual.  For some 1000 calories per day would be immediately noticeable.  Another person might  take 10 to 30 days.    Activity, daily routine, and exercise will fit into the dynamics that determine the rate of weight gain or loss.|`|zWagsiIeaa	You need more than that. Plus look at the quality of food. Stay away from packed crap. Look for whole foods, that spoil fast or you have to cook.
MhpccWpmaa	I've heard that breast enhancers work but that once you stop taking them they go back down and sometimes get even smaller than before you started.

T16Zmtc3aa	Here's some websites on hematuria (blood in the urine).  It could be a kidney stone, or an infection of your bladder or kidney or possibly cancer.

IDgSVPBxaa	Treating Naturally  - Eat or apply plain yogurt directly to the vagina. Alternatively, a tampon soaked in yogurt can be inserted.    - Garlic has antibacterial and antifungal properties. Garlic can be taken internally or can be applied directly on the vagina.    - Use calendula herb to reduce the inflammation.    - Herbs like tea tree oil, black walnut, Echinacea and goldenseal are effective in treating bacterial vaginitis.    - Use boric acid douche to acidify vaginal pH.    - Douche to reduce inflammation Add 12 tsp of calendula to boiling water, steep the mixture and cool it before use.    - Soak a tea bag in water and cool it in refrigerator and then apply it to the vagina.|`|5ypdHLtGaa	i don't think there is one, you need antibiotic to kill a bacterial infection.... and yogurt isn't a cure for a yeast infection either, probably your last yeast infection didn't clear up completely and has now caused the vaginosis. If you are allergic to the medication.. tell your doctor. Also, what are you judging your allergic reaction by? because any antibiotic can make you sick sometimes... but if you swell, get really really sick with a fever, or get a rash/hives, then yes that's a serious reaction...but nasea, diarrea, headache, that's pretty common.|`|awuEWKnmaa	Pour 1/4 cup of vinegar into your bath and sit in it until it is cool. Do this every day for a week. You can buy larger bottles of vinegar at the grocery store for cheap in the salad dressing sections usually. The vinegar helps restore the vaginal pH because most bacteria can't survive in the more acidic environments (this is why their by-products cause you're vagina to become more basic rather than acidic).|`|gSo4dR7oaa	There is no home remedy for bacterial vaginosis.  The ONLY cure for bacterial infections is antibiotics.

Not getting enough oxygen will cause weird things like that to happen.|`|BsDv3k5iaa	I would say to seek medical advice.  You are not getting enough blood circulating to your feet causing them to become tingly.  Try moving your toes more while exercising to help circulation.  I had the same problem.|`|iExuvF5Vaa	probably you have bad circulation. this sounds stupid, but they actually make socks for people with poor circulation, and they actually seem to help. sometimes they are labeled for diabetics (they tend to have poor circulation in the feet).     i would bet that it's just poor circulation, but you should check with your doctor to make sure it's not a more serious problem like blood clots|`|mp0OoSYgaa	Many questions but the most important are how well controlled are you and what is your blood sugar before you begin exercise?    it sounds like blood circulation problems and could certainly be associated with the diabetes. A facet of neuropathy. Don't panic though, I'm don't think it's necessarily advanced neuropathy. When I was in the first few years of diabetes this was often an issue for me - aches, tingling, numbness. It's not my advice to ignore it at all, you should follow it up with your drs. BUT, in my experience, with sustained good control and health it will go away.|`|SZNHvHohaa	Ask the doctor.

tDaU7eYXaa	Thank you!!! Finally, a person who wants to be HEALTHY, not THIN, and weak and frail. If you really want to get healthy, eat lots of veggies and protein, but DO NOT eat many carbs. In your house, do a couple of push-ups. Then gradually do more. It feels REALLY good. It feels awesome to know that you are actually becoming stronger and losing weight in a healthy way. DO NOT try diets or any of that crap they try to sell to you on tv. I tried dieting and I now have a eating disorder. Also, there are a few thing you can d to burn excess calories. Stand up while at work. Pace while talking on the phone. Watch an action movie and pretend to be the guy running around killing people. (haha don't try that) Take a dance class when you have confidence. Then at college parties, you can look awesome and lose weight. Congratulations on actually making an effort.|`|K8QRRp2Oaa	"dear yahoo" lol    I know that this probably wont make you happy but.... you have to listen to what your friend said lol. go on a diet and dont exercise. doesnt have to be a MEGA-SUPER-ULTRA diet but just cut back a little bit =)|`|wic0XXx7aa	I am very obsessed about my weight.

Your body cant eat muscle, you just loose muscle mass after you build it, and stop using or exercising them.    All you need to do is watch what you eat, not stop eating, or eat less. The trick is in burning more calories than you intake ( eat/consume).|`|YFi64qyeaa	Unfortunately there is no magic cure for weight loss....  Every body reacts differently to diet and exercise. Your jogging three times a week is good, but you will need more than that to get fit. Decide on a routine that you will stick with even after the weight has come off otherwise it will come right back. Try this...  *Walk-jog-run every day at least for one hour.         I find that morning workouts like this give you more energy throughout the day. On your walk make sure you have  plenty of water to hydrate yourself. Do not use a sweat suit. I don't mean sweats, but those God only knows why they exist unhealthy plastic garments that cause you to sweat more. You will only lose water that your body needs.  *After your walk have a simple breakfast of fruit, yogurt, or even toast.        What ever you do do not starve yourself. It will only backfire!  *On your lunch break at work or school grab your lunch and walk to a nearby park to eat.         If you have an hour than walk for at least half of that time. You will be amazed at how much this helps release the stress of work.  *Have a healthy dinner  *Just before bed do some stretches         Simple and relaxing stretches help release any stress that you acquired throughout the day and helps you sleep better.  *Brew yourself a nice warm cup of chamomile tea. Sip, relax and drift away to sleep.    As far as not seeing any results from your current workout plan...  One, you may not have been doing it long enough to increase your metabolism  Two, you may be eating to much  Just remember in order to lose you must eat to give your body energy and so your body does not start reserving fat and you must exercise. I mean a lot of exercise.  Once you find a routine that you are comfortable with than stick with it even After you lost your weight. There will be times that you will go a week or two without any results, but be patient. It will happen if you have discipline and the will to really lose it.

3b687116ebd91e437816db8e4f34fb0eaa	I have the same issue. Every time I go to the ER they say my potassium is way low. I am a 28 year old female who started with seizures at 23. The only other cause was low blood sugar so I now have to carry around a monitor!    I'm also on Seroquel for when I have that awful, panic stricken gut feeling that one is coming on. Not a fun disease but what can we do?    Sorry I couldn't help more but I wanted you to know you're not alone!|`|a8IRxC4raa	It's easy to find out if your problem is related to low potassium.  Increase your intake of potassium.  For example, eat several bananas a day.      Hoping this is easily resolved for you.    All the best.
6qsocyK3aa	You could always try and make sure you get that seat. Or, if there was another class in there after you, then it could well have been someone else.    Be thankful you have such a nice friends, some people would have teased you!|`|45hecz6laa	if others use the room nobody will know who it was. someone might have cleaned it already. don't go out and say it was you it could have been someone else, just stay calm.|`|3jNp3fzUaa	Awww, it's okay.  Maybe you can switch around the chairs so that nobody will think it is you.  That happened to me before too, but no one noticed because the chairs and my pants were black.  If they do find out it is you, don't worry.  People who tease you are just doing it because they are insecure and they feel better when they tease people.  They just have to accept the fact that we are women, and at some point that will probably happen to everyone in your class, well the girls at least!  Good luck, and sorry that I couldn't help you out better.|`|kep1iGHpaa	If it is possible to get that seat again before anyone that would be your best option  If you can bring a wet towel from the bathroom and clean the seat. Then use your hoodie/jacket/long sleeve shirt to dry to seat.    If you can't get to that class early. Before anyone else. Come to school early.  Teachers won't judge you and won't make fun of you. Don't worry about telling them anything. They want to help. Whether it seems like he wants to help or not he does. Trust me. He wouldn't stay there where he gets paid enough to pay the bills and buy some bread and butter every week. He wants to help. So don't be afraid to talk to him.  At my school I wouldn't be allowed to actually get to my class before anyone else. So what I would have to do is go to the principal office and ask [a female employee] to go to that class. I'd tell her it was ergent or an emergency or something. If they wouldn't let me go I'd try to explain what the whole deal was. I'm sure they'll let you go.     Then when I got to my teacher I'd explain to him and I'm sure he'd let me clean the seat.    If you have a hard time talking to your teacher, which I understand how you would feel weird, write it all in a note. Put everything on a piece of paper and just hand it to your teacher and office worker lady if you need to. Maybe you could even write down to write back to you on the note instead of saying things out loud.     Email me or comment if you need.     Best wishes.|`|QCj4QA4yaa	Try to clean the chair before the teacher arrives. Second, if that doesn't work, use that blood for coloring your lips.

Good luck!!!|`|bfNDLbVqaa	if anyone even noticed, they wouldn't point their finger at you even if they cared or knew it was you. if you do feel uncomfortable, try to get in that class before anyone else and remove it do a different classroom. or cover it in black ink!|`|BnT16FVLaa	Could you just not go to school tomorrow? Or skip the class?  But if you have to, just don't make eye contact with anyone, remain calm, think of your happy place!   Or! You could even sneak in there and clean off the chair before class, or make sure you find the chair and sit in it.   Good luck!|`|CPDQQeS1aa	Aww, yeah I have been there too, I know how embarrassing that can be! If I were you I would go back to school or call someone at school and ask for the person who is head of that department (if they are a woman) or if they happen to be a male then ask for another teacher or even office attendant that is a woman and tell her your situation. I'm sure that she will understand and replace the chair right away. Good luck and don't be afraid to talk to an older woman about it - I am sure they have all experienced the same situation or one like it! They know how your feeling and they are most definitely not going to hold it against you!|`|NhF9sM5jaa	To avoid future embarrassment, wear a thicker pad with wings or a tampon and a panty liner at the same time. Wear dark pants to help cover a stain if it happens. Booty shorts also helps pads stay in place really well.    Try getting the same chair and wipe the blood up before class starts if you can. Or try to get one of your friends to sit there if you cant.    Go to the doctors as soon as you can too! Soaking through is never a good things. And remember to change your pad or tampon atleast every 8 hours.     Best wishes|`|Icwz678Qaa	Calm down Zelda, I've been there and done that and it isn't as alarming as you may think.    Two tips for you are first, when you go to the class with the 'chair' just bring along a wet-one and wipe it off.  Second, keep an extra pair of jeans (dark) and maxi pads in your locker for just such an emergency.    And don't panic if this happens again, just remember that you aren't the only one this happens to.      Think like a girl scout: Always be prepared:-)    Hope this helps.|`|Dkg7sqxIaa	No-one will know that the blood id yours, so if someone does say something don't react.
uJKTR4d2aa	Depends on how much they weigh. If they are already normal weight they might not make it past a month. Over weight can last more, but not always. Not eating causes your body to digest your organs so its basically suicide.     In a prison in germany prisoners went on a hunger strike for reasons i dont know of, the guy that started it last 63 days, then died. his other members died the next couple of days. Their body had used up every pound of muscle and fat and began digesting its own organs.|`|q9BItD25aa	About one week before they are sent to the mental hospital for being a threat to theirselves........|`|72539f045c1cb0033be4c3ddc2982477aa	If your goal is to lose weight by not ingesting any calories, you're more likely to lose a couple initial pounds in mostly water weight, and then gain more than you had lost.  Starving rewires your metabolism to burn as many calories as you ingest, so when you're happy having lost whatever pounds and start eating again, you'll only be burning so many calories and end up gaining more weight.

Once inside the body of an unsuspecting person, the worm thrives in the lymph vessels and tissues. As it grows, it causes marked swelling of the limbs and other extremities. Elephantiasis is a skin disease that is most common in the tropics. It gets its name because the affected skin becomes rough and thickened usually causes the disease. Mosquitoes carry the worm. When the mosquito bites, the worm enters the body and eventually lodges in the lymph vessels.     It most commonly affects the limbs and can occasionally move to the scrotal areas and outer genitalia.     please people, you might think its funny, but this is a serious and painful disease, its not right to make fun of these people, most of them live in areas where good medical help is hard to find so they can't get relief from this curable disease until its too late and its gone into later stages(when it is incurable). And you all seem to think its a joke.|`|Q3nslL6Daa	a parasite that causes inflamation of the limbs|`|QCj4QA4yaa	Oh dear, u got some bad disease aint ya???

In some cases, the disease can cause certain body parts, such as the scrotum, to swell to the size of a softball or basketball.[1] ("Elephantitis" is a common mis-hearing or mis-remembering of the term, from confusing the ending -iasis -- process or resulting condition -- with the more commonly heard -itis -- irritation or inflammation.) Its proper medical name is lymphatic filariasis.|`|bdVTyvlyaa	Elephantiasis is where you have parts of your body that swell up and they are over sized. They are extremely over sized usually. However I would recommend looking it up on Web Md. they are very knowledgeable and can give you more help with your question.

It effects everyone differently.|`|yXlKRuItaa	You can't make it come any quicker than nature intends, but stress can make it later so try not to worry. If it's over a week late take a pregnancy test because depending on how quickly you took the morning after pill, it's not 100% if you take it straight away, but if you take it 3 days afters you've had unprotected sex its only about 40% effective so just take a test! You shouldn't miss your period because you've taken the morning after pill.
wXaGIPSPaa	well, it could be alot of things hon.  How old are you?  Do you have heavey cramping too?    Anytime there is a big change in your period, its a good idea to see your gyn.  He/she is the only one who can really answer your questions.  There are so many things that can cause this:  tubal pregnancy, fibroids, cysts, cancer, endrometriosis, pms...etc   Dont panic.  Just be calm, it could also be a one time thing due to stress or homones.    good luck.

Make sure to wear some kind of hat or earmuffs, thick socks, maybe leggings or long underwear under your pants, gloves. Also, they make these little packages called "hot hands". Through some kind of chemical reaction in the powder that is inside them, they get and stay warm for quite a while. Put them in your pockets.|`|bEQptDpoaa	they make hand and feet warmers that you can hold and put in your shoes . they usually last like an hour or two i thinkkk . you could try those . wear a looooot of layers , a scarf , a hat , a few pairs of socks . even wear leggins under your jeans or sweatpants .

Pill cutters can be found at the drugstore and will cost you about 5 bucks. I wouldn't recommend using a knife or anything because you might cut yourself or lose a portion of the tablet. You can try swallowing with juice just in case you are taking a pill that dissolves fast to offset the taste. But check with your doctor or pharmacist first because some medication cannot be taken with grapefruit or orange juice.|`|JdxJ40kLaa	Put it on your tounge, take a huge gulp of wat ur taking it witth and itss down.|`|GrFGsrLGaa	They come across this a lot in senior's homes.

If your mom washes her hands well after she goes  2, you have very little chance of contracting Noro or even rotavirus.      Lysol doesn't kill the noro virus.Bleach does.      Prevention tips:    Norwalk virus  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.

Sozc3MyFaa	Probably not.  Protein in the urine is due to kidney function/anatomical abnormalities & does not always reflect protein elsewhere. It is important that she get god nutrition and protein is involved in that.  Why don't you speak to a cancer nutritionist about her diet.  Also, you do not want to try over the counter home remedies with some one with cancer on powerful medications because severe interactions can occur as well as profound physiological imbalances. You should talk to her oncologist about your concerns & may be they can explain what is going on better to you.  I hope your mother recovers.
iNBLWIFKaa	I would recommend that you join a sports team. That way you can make great friends, keep in shape and have fun, too.

FNeCDm3raa	Tampons are not for discharge. They are specifically designed for blood flow, and it will be painful to wear them and take them out. Yikes. Plus, you are wasting money having to buy them so often.    You don't want discharge in your undies? Buy pantyliners from carefree. So small, you don't feel them, and they protect the underwear. They are not pads, and I, and many other women wear them everyday.|`|lcxyOS7uaa	Tampons are meant for menstrual fluid, not discharge. You are at a high risk for TSS for doing this. Use liners|`|6qsocyK3aa	Don't use a tampon just for normal discharge, it's not what it's made for and you could end of with an infection or, at best, a sore vagina. Use panty liners instead.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	that's why they made panty liners.

Its your hormones.  If you are very young its not a big deal...it takes a bit for your body to get "normal", but if you have had a period for a while, I would definately see a dr.  It is usually easy to fix!|`|krI2fziJaa	Yes, it is actually happening right now. A week after mine stopped, it started again. Now I am still spotting a week later. I have an appt for tomorrow so I have no idea what the cause is. Good luck!
UbvBIDy6aa	A lot depends on where you live because some states require you to sit in and get information 24 hours before you get the procedure done.There's 2 ways,medical and surgical.The medical is a pill they give you and the rest is done at home,but painful and if you don't want your parents to know I wouldn't reccomend that way.The surgical is very short and painless.When you go in for the procedure,they first make you pee in a cup.They take you in what looks like a normal gyno office,you sit in the chair with your feet up,they do an ultrasound on you but you don't get to even see the computer screen,it feels like one of those cold clamps they use in a regular pap smear.You're free to go sit back into the waiting room and then when they call you in they explain the whole procedure to you and you make the payment.Once you get into the actual office it's going to go down in you are asked to wear full back panties and a maxi pad,which you place on while you're getting undressed for the operation.The doctor injects some anethsia that doesn't make you completely out but your eyes close and you have no idea what the hell is going on.I'm guessing I was in there for maybe 10-15 minutes.You hear noise from the lack of better words vaccum but you really don't feel anything.When it's over the nurse that's in with the doctor and you the whole time will help you get dressed and transfer you over to another room where you are given some juice,crackers,and your persciption for pain meds,birth control,and anti-infammatory pills. you basically sit there until the anethsia wears off.You immediately start your period and the cramps are painful but the loritabs help with that.You'll probly want to take a nap afterwards but you feel just like a normal period after that,the cramps are the worst part.You will also have a follow-up appointment 2-4 weeks afterwards.I never went to mine and haven't had any complications yet but it is very crucial to go to it to make sure you don't have anything still inside of you and no infection is present.I was also only 6 weeks,I was in there with a girl who was already showing and she was in a LOT of pain.So once you find out go right away to do it.|`|mBlhKNPVaa	There are two types of abortions. Medical and surgical. Medical is the pill and surgical is the actual suction cup they use. I got the surgical and the pain was unbearable. It hurts like hell. I will never ever get an abortion again!    The surgical is very short and painless. That is a lie!!! At the same time it all depends on the person.|`|6qsocyK3aa	I think you should be taking a pregnancy test before even considering this sort of thing!    If you ARE pregnant, I think if you have the abortion before about 9 weeks (something like that anyway, don't hold me to it), you can just take a couple of pills. If you leave it later than that, they have to do it surgically. I expect there would certainly be some pain!|`|6KZA7D97aa	as said above, there are 2 types, if your no more than 8 weeks pregnant then you can have medical which includes taking 2 pills at 2 different intervals, then surgical which if you go to your doctor they will refer you to a clinic and you firstly have a talking session to make sure you want to go ahead then you have the surgical procedure, which you will be put to sleep for so you will feel no pain from the procedure but you might feel a bit groggy after but i dont think you will feel pain, it is something you can bring up with the counseller at your first session. also they do these procedures as day patients now, so you go in and out on same day. you should definatley think carefully about what you want to do if you are pregnant and confide in someone you trust. good luck!!    p.s. this is how it is if you live in uk not sure if same anywhere else in the world
UbvBIDy6aa	I wear thong pads everyday of my period.They are kotex brand,and mine's usually pretty heavy first 2 days.I have to change them every couple of hours at the beginning and I can usually tell if I'm about to oops by standing up too quickly or walking.The kotex ultra thin with wings just regular pads are very thin and comfortable if you feel safer using normal ones.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	I'm sure wearing a thong on a heavy day would be a recipe for disaster as I'm sure it would leak or have to be changed every 20 minutes.  Try tampons.
e2muGSbpaa	Yes.  Gum- It keeps his mouth busy chewing, and also he won't want to ruin the good taste in his mouth.  Stress balls- so that he isn't tempted to light up when he gets strung out.

I had the same issue with my grandmother, I tried forever to get her to quit, but she never would, so finally I just gave up.  If he won't try on his own, tag along to a doctors appointment and ask the doctor to talk to him about it, or call the doctor and ask him to talk to him about it at his next appointment.|`|LkOcJRRWaa	There is no way...my dad has been smoking for all my life and has tried to quit over a hundred times.

E8k3sERAaa	hi, i had the implanon for 4 years just had my second one removed yesterday.i couldn't cope with it anymore,the headaches depression,and my moods always changing not to mention the weight gain and irregular periods,my hair even started to fall out! i thought i was going nuts! since it come out my period has come back today i dont feel completely normal but its only been a day, i feel so much better just knowing its out! it give me nothing but hell. i would say get it out, im using condoms and having a bit of a break, i know some men dont want to wear them but why shud us women have to keep experimenting with different stuff to put in our bodies. your obviously in a stable relationship so just use condoms for a while give yourself time to get back to normal and get that stupid match stick taken out.    good luck.|`|krZ8RJZzaa	If you want to, or you can switch birth controls.  I had to do that, I was on YAZ and have break-through bleeding, and would cry myself to sleep every night for no good reason.  I switched to Loestrin and feel great!|`|TTaLB4kdaa	Sure. Try them out and see if it works for you. If not talk some options over with your doctor. There are other kinds of birth control.|`|m7putYGmaa	i just use regular old condoms... thats perfectly fine unless you have latex allergies and stuff like that... it doesn't feel as good, but then again,  its probably more important that your feeling good being yourself again =)|`|RFOf5dw0aa	The biggest drawback to Condoms is that most men hate wearing them, and they decrease the sensation during intercourse. However, as long as they are used properly they are pretty much just as effective as Birth Control. So, if your husband doesn't mind wearing them there is really no reason to use Birth Control. Although, I would have to think that your husband would eventually get tired of using condoms (based on personal experience). You might want to look into an IUD. An IUD would be as effective as Birth Control, and should have significantly less side effects.|`|PjbAGtrEaa	I would say go for it. Condoms work very well when used correctly. If your current method of birth control is that taxing on your body, it would make sense to try something else. Since you are married and already have one child, I get the idea that it would not be the end of the world if something did go wrong with the condom and you got pregnant again, although it is very rare that this would happen.    Try it out for a few months, see the pros and cons. You can always switch to something else.    PS-- I am on the Yaz birth control pill. It has a very low hormone dosage so it didn't make me lose/gain weight, have mood swings, etc. I highly recomment it if you are willing to try the pill.
9pLdhuBnaa	Hemorrhoids can cause rectal bleeding too.  The hemorrhoid is a type of varicose vein that can occur from pushing too hard when we have a bowel movement.    The hemorrhoid will look a certain way when they do the colonoscopy that will be different from the fissure which is a type of crack.
YGeGhuQAaa	Take it easy with the keegel.  U need to relax the muscle now, so learn to let go slowly.   The only thing u can do now is to drink alot of fluid and it will eventually with the bladder pressure come out.      Keegel can be done without haveing to pee..u can do it evn when ur sitting in ur chair.  All thats needed is muscle contraction.  prolly a safer way to do it too..

When you smoke them, exhale the smoke just down into your throat and then talk and scream the smoke out.

6PETwI7Taa	*  Sore throat      * Fever      * A cough that may bring up yellow or green mucus      * Chest congestion      * Shortness of breath      * Wheezing      * Chills      * Body aches  Acute bronchitis is almost always caused by viruses that attack the lining of the bronchial tree and cause infection. As your body fights back against these viruses, more swelling occurs and more mucus is produced. It takes time for your body to kill the viruses and heal the damage to your bronchial tubes.    In most cases, the same viruses that cause colds cause acute bronchitis. Research has shown that bacterial infection is a much less common cause of bronchitis than we used to think. Very rarely, an infection caused by a fungus can cause acute bronchitis.|`|RP5NnxgUaa	I'm thinking that I have acute bronchitis which is a virile infection.

I hope you can find the answer.   My symptoms are weight gain, fatigue, anxiety/depression.    I am glad you asked this question.  Yes, I have freinds in my support group for people with Addison's disease and most of them are on medication.  They are the ones who have been telling me I have symptoms.  Type in your search engine, support groups for Thyroid   conditions.  Your question, and me thinking, well I have a support group for Addison's, maybe I should search for support groups for Thyroid conditions.  Thanks for asking the questions and maybe we can both figure out what is going on.
VZPiLBVgaa	i don't know but when i was 10 i heard somone calling my name ghostly like [i was 1/2 awake and 1/2 asleep] it was going 'jaaaammeesssss' and i looked everywhere, everyone in my house was sound asleep. and i kept on hearing the voice all night. i woke my mum up and she said she couldn't hear anything. but the voice was bluring into my ears.    i think it might be somthing we have done in our past that has pushed its way back into our head.|`|V6r4RPI5aa	i'd say it was pretty normal, it could have been someone walking past outside, or just a noise that you had heard in the day that your brain is relaying again, i was broken into once and was convinced i could hear someone downstairs for weeks after. its like when you dream that you've tripped off a curb. dont worry bout it, if it does happen again try cutting out things like caffine etc after 6pm which will help you wind down.
q3gM6J76aa	I am guessing you continue to use meth to cope with your depression you have when you are not using. If you want to stop using you will need to completely cut off ties with your current friends. You will need to seek treatment once again as well. Remember once you are an addict you are an addict for life. Only your decision to stay clean can keep you from using this drug.     After a person uses a drug for a long period of time it becomes routine. When he or she stops using the drug they run into the problem of not being able to cope with life without being high. This drug will continue to destroy your life unless you make the decision to seek help. It may take 6 months or even more before the depression subsides. Methamphetamine creates changes in your brain chemistry. These changes will reverse after awhile but it takes time.     The first step would be to look for any narcotics anonymous groups in your area which may be able to provide you with help. If you live in a larger city there are often homeless shelters which provide treatment for drug addicts. Good luck. I hope you find the help you need and are able to stay clean.|`|TPfFpotWaa	What you need is to talk to your really close friends, close ones that i hope aren't on it or addicted to it... Tell them that you want to... Be social... Go out and keep your mind off of it... If you happen to stumble on it, just do your best to turn around and run until you can't anymore... Chew on tooth picks whenever you think of it... When it's on your mind, you start to twitch, chewing on constant tooth picks will always help... Don't ever be alone and if you are alone, make sure it's not possible for you to get it... Lock yourself in a room if you have to... Meetings meetings and meetings... If not into those, just have a close friend you can pour yourself to... Letting out those emotions will always help...    I don't know what else to say to you help you man... I used to be a meth user, these were my ways of getting off...|`|ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	Maybe depression is one of the main problems - meth might not have as much appeal if you felt good in the first place.  See if you can get a public health doc to write a prescription for an antidepressant such as Wellbutrin, and see if that helps.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	sell your computer, get yourself a hooker.|`|EA5IN1BQaa	We have no advice for you...

LeaUjOoUaa	Try sitting still, take in as deep a breath as you can and hold it for as long as you can and then breath it out slowly. This may help slow down the heart rate.  I would recommend going to an ER. Heart/chest pain and difficulty breathing are not symptoms you take lightly. You could be having a sever asthma attack or having heart trouble. Women do not feel heart trouble the same way men do. It is always better to play it safe.|`|Aq60v8w7aa	See a doctor.  I'm 52 and thought it was heartburn.  I ended up with a stint.  Do not play with this.|`|1xHTeIqaaa	Im not sure what that is but if you are having chest pains, and have difficulty breathing then i would definatley advice you get yourself down to the emergency room asap..   Even if it is something as simple as heartburn, it would be better to be safe than sorry.   Hope your feeling better soon! :)|`|fXj2kVpPaa	I have the exact same symptoms....I went to the ER and had all sorts of tests.  I have bronchitis, and I still am not feeling much better.

pcEJMHPMaa	It hurts because it's working.These muscles have not been worked this way before.Take a day off to rest your muscles then go back to it the day after.Don't go through the entire set of reps, if it says do 20 then do 15 and work your way up 15 reps the first week then 20 the second week.You will still feel some pain but not like the first time.stick with it and you will see great results.|`|iXt3erseaa	Make sure you are doing a beginner level. Get the technique right and build up some stamina. 20 min every day may be too much at this point. Some aching is normal as your muscles get stronger, but you shouldn't be in serious pain.     Also, consider working with a trainer - someone who can watch you as you work out. Esp with Pilates, it is hard to self-assess on the technique. You might be doing something wrong and never know it - you need someone to watch you who knows Pilates and can monitor.
GGqh73iWaa	I don't like going to the gym but i do enjoy swimming very much and it exercises the whole of your body. I ditch the car whenever i can and walk and if in the evenings i'm bored and the weather is ok i go for a walk, i find this helps me to sleep too. But if you don't want to go out then get yourself an exercise dvd,or a home gym,or hula hoop or a skipping rope,do sits up ect. Things like house work, running up the stairs help to and even if you are just watching the T.V. do some leg lifts.
qsZPkbF2aa	I know exactly what you mean. LA Fitness is a lot like that as well. What I usually do when the gym is too crowded is strength training at home.

XhIYAH6Laa	No it won't. I have a hole in my eardrum that was cause by getting tubes in my ear when I was a child. I have been told that I can get surgery where they basically patch up the hole with tissue from behind the ear. However, there isn't a high enough success rate for me to consider this option but maybe it could work for you. The best advice I can give is to talk about this with a ear, nose, and throat doctor.

I joined a place that has a food diary (nutracheck).  You put in what you have eaten and it tells you how many calories were in it and takes it off a daily allowence.  I dont' know why, but it really helped me not eat so much.    Good luck with it .|`|ZZHFemQfaa	alot of the people below have mentioned most of the important factors when it comes to losing weight e.g. diet & exercise.  it seems that diet is a very important aspect for you, all i could recommend is that you buy low fat/sugar/calorie versions of the foods and drinks you like. that way you can still be naughty and eat something you really shouldnt but it wont affect you as much  Also, try eating with your weaker hand. It will make you eat slower which will allow you to get full up quicker :)|`|vWEu8GxNaa	Slimming World!
ZZHFemQfaa	The best way to lose weight is do burn the fat off and keep it off. This is done by performing cardiovascular exercise and having a healthy diet.  Cardio wise there a many activities treadmills,bikes ect but if thats too hard due to your weight,you need to do swimming. Cardio must be done for atleast 20 mins for it to have an effect and burn fat.     For your diet, reduce saturated fats, complex carbs, more protein, more fibre, more fruit & vegetables.    If you need supplements have a look on www.lupe10.tk they have a link for a good supplement store|`|UGnyqnjWaa	Targetted weight loss is quite hard, some would state impossible, nevertheless the one thing that clearly showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a few free trials remaining, it was featured in Fox News and USA Today. I lost 20 pounds, it clearly does produce results!|`|0m7kEIDiaa	Hi,   I'm in the same boat as you having given up smoking a year ago.. Well done for doing it!!    I think it's impssible to target weight loss, but I have been calorie counting and doing loads of aerobics, jogging (indoors just on the spot) , stepping (you could do it on a step with music in the house) and Yoga.  I use my Wii fit but you could do it with a dvd or just with music.. and I'm losing the weight slowly, but more to the point I'm losing inches.. two inches around my thighs since January 1st. Just exercise hard. It works.
OBwqjS8maa	I think it's a good idea to eat a bulk of your calories in the morning, though that might be a little extreme. Are you saying you'd only eat 230 the rest of the day, or 230 for each remaining meal? If it's 230 the rest of the day, that's a little low. I would definitely try to eat more calories than that.     Here's what I would eat if I was motivated at all (lol):    Breakfast:  Egg White Omelet with light cheese and the veggie(s) of your choice  Coffee (yes, I LOVE my coffee)    Mid-Morning Snack  Cheese or nuts and a piece of fruit    Lunch  Salad with light dressing, grilled chicken, lots of veggies, and maybe some almonds (yum!)    Mid-Afternoon Snakc  Cheese or nuts and a piece of fruit    Dinner  Lean meat (chicken, fish, etc) with veggies   whole-grain bread if you must.    I always feel really good when I eat that way. I tend to eat too many empty calories (especially carbs like bread and starches) when I'm not paying attention. Drink lots of water too! If you want more carbs in your diet, eat whole grain cereal. Potatoes are OK too in moderation. Oh, and I might sneak in a small piece of chocolate or something else sweet after supper.|`|OaniQuqpaa	that is a lot of calories for breakfast, i would go with more like 500 for breakfast and divide the other 200 calories to the rest of your meals
EzxeHsLHaa	Go running. I believe it should be as simple as that.  Maybe some spinning, but riding your bike to school if you don't live too far away might be a cheaper alternative.

ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	I think that is pretty normal. Especially when I was a teenager, I felt this way a lot.     It's still good to eat something in the morning. Dry toast if you feel queasy, maybe a fried egg. Getting the early morning metabolism going is really important to have a productive morning and to make sure you don't overeat in the afternoon.|`|AA12384954	If you're like me you're not hungry as you have been snacking the night before!  If you find you are feeling queezy (nauseous) it could be a symptom of nervous dyspepsia, basically a nervous reaction - See if it only happens on work days, or every day.  Try a slice of toast and honey; that may pick you up.  Your doctor should be able to provide an answer for you.|`|70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	You ate late the night before. Plus you probably ate too much. Breakfast should be large, lunch should be medium, and dinner should be small. If you can try eating 2-3 hours before bedtime. Make sure you eat mostly protein so that when you sleep your body can repair your muscles from the days activities. Good sources would be chicken and fish. Try eating it with a baked potato and broccoli.|`|OWoOYry0aa	I am the same too.    Sometimes it may be because:    you over ate for dinner  you ate dinner really late                   or  maybe you just dont eat that much|`|hhRDjIvZaa	Ugh. I'm the exact same way.

It's somethinig that happens after a bit of time.|`|8vWwX8SXaa	Me too, interesting question...|`|bELqEsdOaa	I get that too. You feel kinda sick in the morning and you feel like you'd be better off if you didn't eat. I'm not quite sure what the problem is yet.

W4whHKmxaa	Some people can drink alcohol all their lives  and never have a problem. Other are so   sensitive to it, that just mild drinking can cause  a problem.    Alcohol is considered a drug.  Almost all drugs  are metabolized through the liver to be   broken down before going to the rest of the  body.  The liver also handles toxins and tries  to convert these toxins into a non toxic form  to be disposed of by the body in the urine.      The liver takes alcohol and tries to convert  it into acetaldehyde.  Most of the time,  with just a slight amount of consumption...  it can do this.  However, when there is  an high consumption, it cannot do this well.  Some of the alcohol doesn't get converted  because the liver isn't able to handle that  amount and then both the alcohol that  isn't change and the acetaldehyde, made  from some of it being changed, can become  a toxin to the liver cells and cause damage  to them.  Usually, it starts out as fat build  up inside the cells...then as it progresses  the cells do become damaged.  When this  happens, the immune system responds to  this damage and tries to clean up the area  and help the area to heal.  This causes  inflammation to develop in the area then.  If the inflammation is treated and the  alcohol is stopped in time, then the liver  cells may heal.  However, if this is not  done...the inflammation will lead to the death  of the liver cells and the forming of   scar tissue (fibrosis) inside the liver.  This  is then a disease known as Cirrhosis.  The scar tissue blocks the flow of blood  through the liver on it way back to the heart,  and it also blocks the flow of blood to the  other cells of the liver and then they lack  the oxygen and nourishment...and they  die also.  It is a progressive disease that  the doctors can only try to slow down.    Here is a article that explains what happens  as you drink alcohol and what takes place  as it goes through the body.    http://www.amsa.org/resource/natlinit/al...    Alcohol is one of the drugs that can cross the  blood brain barrier very easily.  The blood  brain barrier usually blocks out things so   that the brain isn't injured or affected.  Most  drugs cannot go pass this: street drugs,  Alcohol, depressants, and some chemicals can.     Hope this information has been of help to you.     If you want more studies on what alcohol can  do.  Taking the drug: acetaminophen  (over the counter pain medication) with  alcohol...can cause immediate damage to  the liver cells.  There are other drugs taken  with alcohol that this happens with also.  You might want to look that up on the internet  also.     If you are really interested in finding out what  happens to a patient with cirrhosis of the  liver caused by alcohol...here is a site  that will explain the Liver Transplant process.  It might be a wake up call to all those who  "abuse" this drug.  A Liver Transplant can  cost over $250,000...that is a low estimate...  the anti rejections drugs are very expensive,  and they have to be taken the rest of their  life.  Also, they will be stuck with the medical  profession the rest of their life.  There is  no turning back once they are diagnosed  with cirrhosis of the liver.  There are no  guarantees that they will be placed on the  transplant list after a long evaluation process  of much testing and seeing different doctors.  It used to be that a patient had to be free  of alcohol for a period of 6 months before  they would even be considered placement  on this list...now they are taking it on a case  by case basis.  If cirrhosis advances fast,  many die before even being placed on the  list because of this.  There is no guarantee that  an organ will be available for them when they  are suppose to be transplanted or that the  organ will work once placed inside of them or  that it won't go into rejection after the operation  is over.    http://www.surgery.usc.edu/divisions/hep...    I hope you do well on your project...|`|7d92fea894a319f966b40ae7494fa5a5aa	Alcohol-Induced Liver Disease    What is the liver's role in processing alcohol?    The liver breaks down alcohol so it can be eliminated from your body. If you consume more alcohol than the liver can process, the resulting imbalance can injure the liver by interfering with its normal breakdown of protein, fats, and carbohydrates.    What are the types of alcohol-induced liver disease?    There are three kinds of liver disease related to alcohol consumption:    Fatty liver is marked by a build-up of fat cells in the liver. Usually there are no symptoms, although the liver may be enlarged and you may experience discomfort in your upper abdomen. Fatty liver occurs in almost all people who drink heavily. The condition will improve after you stop drinking.    Alcoholic hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Up to 35 percent of heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis. Symptoms may include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, fever and jaundice. In its mild form, alcoholic hepatitis can last for years and will cause progressive liver damage. The damage may be reversible if you stop drinking. In its severe form, the disease may occur suddenly, after binge drinking, and it can quickly lead to life-threatening complications.    Alcoholic cirrhosis is the most serious type of alcohol-induced liver disease. Cirrhosis refers to the replacement of normal liver tissue with scar tissue. Between 10 and 20 percent of heavy drinkers develop cirrhosis, usually after 10 or more years of drinking. Symptoms of cirrhosis are similar to those of alcoholic hepatitis. The damage from cirrhosis is not reversible, and it is a life-threatening disease. Your condition may stabilize if you stop drinking.    Many heavy drinkers will progress from fatty liver to alcoholic hepatitis and finally to alcoholic cirrhosis, though the progression may vary from patient to patient. The risk of developing cirrhosis is particularly high for people who drink heavily and have another chronic liver disease such as viral hepatitis C  http://www.liverfoundation.org/education...|`|wVJYc9PQaa	Alcohol abuse can do extensive damage to the liver.  It is because when a person drinks alcohol, it mixes with the blood and then it initially goes through the liver first.  Moreover, the liver has enzymes which breaks down alcohol into other chemicals, and then broken down into water and carbon dioxide.  The final result of the breakdown would be in the urine.  If the liver is abused due to alcoholism, many illnesses would then settle in like impotence, hepatitis, alcohol addiction, nerve tissue damage,. stomach disorders, cancer, and hypertension.  In order for a person to avoid these diseases and to prevent liver damage, is to never consume too much alcohol.
o1Qmp8Hhaa	hemophilia is when you bleed and the gene is only carried in women and only boys and rarely girls get the disease you dont have enough vitamin k in your body wich is what clots the blood and can be found in green leafy vegetables it causes frequent nose bleeds,bleeding into the muscle,blood in urine,and easy bruising for this disease you would see a doctor called a hematologist    hope this helped!|`|4CyXKudJaa	It's a hereditary disorder where your blood doesn't clot properly because your body has little to none of the protein which the body uses to clot your blood. I think only boys suffer from the disorder, but girls can carry the gene and both parents have to have the gene for someone to inherit it.|`|Ak9YaBzTaa	Its when  you are missing a clotting factor in your blood, so when you start bleeding, it is hard to get it to stop.|`|VE7bULDeaa	Hemophilia (heem-o-FILL-ee-ah) is a rare, inherited bleeding disorder in which your blood doesnt clot normally. If you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time than others after an injury. You also may bleed internally, especially in your knees, ankles, and elbows. This bleeding can damage your organs or tissues and, sometimes, be fatal.    People born with hemophilia have little to none of a protein needed for normal blood clotting. The protein is called a clotting factor. There are several types of clotting factors, and they work together with platelets to help the blood clot. Platelets are small pieces of blood cells that are formed in the bone marrow. They play a major role in blood clotting.    When blood vessels are injured, clotting factors help the platelets stick together to plug cuts and breaks at the site of the injury to stop the bleeding. Without clotting factors, normal blood clotting cant take place. Sometimes people with hemophilia need injections of a clotting factor or factors to stop bleeding.    There are two main types of hemophilia. If you have hemophilia A, you have little to no clotting factor VIII (8). About 9 out of 10 people with hemophilia have type A. If you have hemophilia B, youre missing or have low levels of clotting factor IX (9).     People are usually born with hemophilia.  It is a sex-chromosome-related gene, which means it is carried on the X chromosome.  Thus, men are more likely to be hemophiliacs, while women are more likely to be carriers, as men will display the gene if their X chromosome is a carrier and women will only display the gene if both their X chromosomes are carriers (if both the father and mother had a carrier gene and passed it to the daughter).      While you can develop hemophilia, it is very rare - in order to do so, your body must develop antibodies to the protein in the blood that controls clotting.  How serious your hemophilia is depends on how little protein is present.

So it was most likely the fever.|`|ZJWVHMh8aa	It is possible you had a fever with the flu.  It depends how you got the flu-like symptoms as well.  Food poisoning from certain seafood and marine life can cause these symptoms.  You should check your temperature and see a physician if these symptoms persist.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Having influenza IS a nightmare!      High body temperatures also could contribute.|`|iy0OSRTFaa	Yes, it can. The combniation of the fever and you're body under stress can make you're brain a little... restless :D. Don't worry about it though - keeping yourself cool, but not too cool!, will help with the nightmares and they pass after a couple of nights.
0uvgAKSZaa	They actually had an episode on the tyra banks show yesterday about people who had a type of OCD i guess you can say. And there was a girl who picked her scabs on her head and would eat them. Try going to the tyra banks show website and see if there's any information about what they did to help her.|`|aAjpk4ylaa	Try to replace it with another not-so-icky habit.  Maybe even go to the extreme of wearing a hat or something for a couple of days.  When you reach up there, you'll feel that hat and remember.  Then again, I bite my nails so maybe I shouldn't be giving advice.|`|7wkHVaNyaa	Mind over matter hun, you need to catch yourself and tell yourself not to do it. maybe instead of picking, grab a ball of silly puddy and squeeze on that vs picking.

First, start washin ur hair with dandruff shampoo but when u put the shampoo in ur hand, put baking soda, yes baking soda, on ur hand to and mix the two.  The baking soda will get rid of all the stuff that doesnt belong in your hair.  Trust me it works.|`|jdeL3txxaa	bite your tounge or wear a hat alot|`|UOxWSkGsaa	actually i have the same habit and the way i had tried to stop is by putting neosporin on them and then i will hook up my hair so i cant pick at them that easily. so the neosporin heals some of them.|`|8quE5WIfaa	Well i had that problem a while ago, i'll give you a few suggestions. First if u can, try to at least wear something over your head like a bandanna or something. Second, try to find a way to prevent your hands from touching your head. Or lastly, when you touch the scalp, just say in your head like "Wait! i should stop!" lol|`|xNkmK0SHaa	It is a fairly common response to stress, and it is not gross.    I'm far too smart to tell anyone to avoid stress.  That will happen only when we have stopped breathing.    I have had periods when I did that several times over the years.  I now know that these times come and go.    In terms of treating the scalp, dab hydrogen peroxide on the scabs/sores twice a day or more.  Shampoo hair frequently and use dryer. The heat helps the lesions heal faster.    Try to notice when you do it most - when reading, watching TV, whatever.  Then make it a point to be using your hands for something at those times.  If you can't keep hands "busy" wear some gloves. They will make it a bit difficult to scratch and that will remind you to not do it.    Above all, don't worry about it.  The stress of worry will just cause you to do it more.|`|8RyX43hcaa	Sounds to me like you need to find something to do with your hands, Buy a couple of stress ball and you can sit squeezing them instead of picking at your scalp.    I hope this idea helps.|`|QCdpBqhHaa	If it's dry scalp that you have which is causing the build up dandruff, you may want to start using Head & Shoulders.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Sounds like a normal habit people get into.  Some people bite their nails, crack their knuckles, pick their acne, etc.  You may want to get your scalp checked for seborrhea or psoriasis which would cause your scalp to itch.  I have it and it seems like scabs on my head but it's really a skin condition.  It's not contagious or gross, just like dry skin kind of.  You could get a special shampoo.  Otherwise clip your nails really short so you can't scratch.  Every time you go to scratch do something else like play with a squishy ball.|`|09zVUMBRaa	I would see a dermatologist.  There's probably a reason you have recurring scabs on your scalp.  Get that checked out!|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	It sounds to me like you have psoriasis on your scalp. Go see a doctor and get it treated. It may not be psoriasis but if it gets infected you will be in a world of hurt.|`|mgo4resgaa	everytime you want to pick the scab, bite your finger|`|WQ4UO2W3aa	your scalp isnt healthy if you've had scabs there for a looong time. go check it out. wear tape on your fingers.

Obviously this is also good if you are trying to lose weight and keeping it off.    The rule is the more intensive the activity is, the shorter the duration of exercise. As you progress into activity with moderate intensity, you can cut down to 30 minutes a day for four days per week.    There are 3 types of exercise that your body needs to keep healthy - cardiovascular, flexibility and strength. Cardiovascular activities are those ranging from moderate to vigorous exercises.

I've helped many people this way using Diversified upper cervical care.

yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.    The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.    And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|mBlhKNPVaa	It's going to take all of your money and ur not going to see any results.|`|S730dpLfaa	Jamie, read this blog before trying Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...

1u6QiHCTaa	I am 4 weeks into my efforts to lose weight and I'm already at least 8lbs down (I haven't weighed for almost a week), so you should definitely be able to do it by June...    I came up with all these things while trying to find an effective way for me to lose weight, that wouldn't interrupt my usual lifestyle. They are totally working for me and they're really easy to implement!    First, take a look at your diet. Some simple things to do are:  - Quit drinking soda. If this is too hard for you, like it was for me, drink no soda on weekdays and limit yourself to the equivalent of 2 cans per day on the weekend.  - Start eating lots of fruits and vegetables. The first benefit is that you're getting healthier nutrients. The second is that you're less hungry for the "bad" food. Craving desert? Eat a banana or an apple instead.  - Drink lots of water.  - I discovered that I ate too much every meal. I started eating about 1/2 to 3/4 of what I usually ate and I wasn't hungry at all afterward. If you are really hungry soon after eating (1-3 hours) then you didn't eat enough. Treat yourself to another apple...  - Don't take the eating less to an extreme. Starving yourself will make your body hold onto every fat molecule it can, which defeats the purpose. Plus, it's just not healthy.    Now, for healthier activities...  - Set aside 45 minutes 3-5 days out of the week to get in some good exercise. This should include cardio! I take boxing and kickboxing classes for this... it's really fun.  - Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep every night. Everything you do during the day will amount to nothing if you don't get good sleep. Your body needs sleep to recover from everything you did during the day.    Some tips...  - Don't weigh yourself more than once a week. When you do, weigh yourself at the same time/ same situation. For instance, don't weigh yourself on Monday after breakfast one week, and then on Tuesday before dinner the next.  - Don't worry about the pounds. What matters is that you're happy with how you look.  - Don't count calories.    These are all things that are just healthy habits that should stay with you forever.|`|1Hg0TzqCaa	Foods I lived on and lost weight:    -Nonfat milk and Fiberone cereal  -80 calories Light -N- Fit yogurts  -strawberries with splenda  -banana smoothies with nonfat milk & splenda  -25 calorie diet hot coco (by Swissmiss)  -plain broiled/grilled fish and steamed veggies  -sugar-free jello  -nonfat cottage cheese (follow serving size) and pineapple  -massive salad with grilled chicken pieces  -cucumber with some salt  -carrots  -frozen grapes  -Oceanspray diet cranberry juice  -no sugar added apple sauce  -diet cream soda  -low-carb wheat wraps with turkey, lettuce, tomato & mustard (grilled)  -massive fruit salad (oranges, mangos, etc)  -blend decaf coffee, nonfat milk, ice & splenda     YuM|`|8SRjELNBaa	You can lose 10 pounds easy by june, just cut your calories, i recommend low fat, low calorie high protein foods.  Just exercise an hour a day, 5 days/week, and every week from now until june increase your cardio by 5 mins.|`|9ddprBrPaa	The best foods to eat are low calorie/low fat foods that are "whole" (meaning they have minimal ingredients) which make them easier to digest and contain more nutritional value. I would try to stick to lots of fruits and vegetables and lean meats. Take it easy on carbs and sugar too. Also, drink a lot of water... I've heard drinking water can actually burn calories. Drinking alcohol also adds a lot of calories that many people are unaware of, so cutting back on that should held immensly if you consume a lot of it.     As far as exercise goes, cardio exercises (running/jogging, walking, swimming) are the best way to burn fat quickly and shed pounds. Incorporating light weight lifting exercises in with cardio helps to build lean muscle mass and helps you tone. Yoga and Pilates are great exercises too that can be fun and also help with your flexibility and balance.
