Everybody has a "little child" in themselves -- and we should try to take care of it -- nurture it. You should stop what you are doing and listen to what your little child wants. Your little child does not want to be fed all the time if uncomfortable. You should take time out and spend quality time with your little child.<br>  <br>  To speak and be at peace with your "little child" -- try doing meditation or yoga before retiring. If you are spiritual person, it greatly helps.|`|XUkYVp3Uaa	Blood sugar issues, I would say. Too much blood sugar makes you feel hyper at first, but destroys your inner organs which could lead you to being anemic. You could be anemic, which means there is less iron in your blood and you have less red blood cells. Try drinking orange juice and eating red meat. <br>  If that doesn't help, it could be low blood sugar and you need to eat more and not stay up late. Staying up late makes you gain weight and become more tired. <br>  There is also chronic fatigue syndrome, but that is very unlikely. Just try changing your diet, and have you changed beds recently? That could also be a cause, in that case wait it out.|`|nkTKIXcBaa	I would blame the blood sugar issues before anything else. Both high and low blood sugar can cause tiredness and the alcohol effect (maybe cataplexy? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataplexy)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataplexy)</a><br>  And if all you had typed was that first sentence, I would tell you to look into narcolepsy, as those are two classic symptoms.|`|nM2k6geEaa	high blood sugar, could be the problem. Have a blood test.|`|izTOuLz5aa	im sorry, my sympathies, that stinks.<br>  maybe you are stressed...and you just don't realize it.<br>  have you ever lost someone you loved and never gotten to greive properly?<br>  are you holding one thing it and you just want to cry?|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I would first of all drink water (not if it is late at night though) but first thing in the morning have a bottle of water by your bed & drink it all. Then make sure you are eating well. I think blood sugar problems can cause a person to feel like they are having the other problems. So focus on steady (blood sugar) for a steady mind. I would also see if I had allergies. It took me a long time to get myself straight & I am so careful. I eat a salad for breakfast. I get salad bar food such as spinach, broccolli, califlower & put it all in a bowl then I have a jar I add olive oil & red wine vinegar (be careful if you need to watch alcohol) I don't know if it is a problem for that or not. I put walnuts in the toaster oven & they make the salad so goooooood. But if you start you day this way it helps....I try to eat several vegatables & a little fruit but watch the sugar but to have a cut up strawberry in the salad is great....then about 10 am I peel an apple & dip in some peanut butter & eat the other half about 3, so I eat a good lunch at noon & dinner about 5 & then something else healthy at nigh to help me sleep. Get some calcium so you will sleep well......what is your weight? divide that number by 2 then the number you get is how many ounces of water you need...this is probably what is wrong you need to be breathing well so exercise if you haven't been & get that water in your bod everyday preferably early so you aren't up at night peeing...get a book "You Can Heal Your Life" by Louise Hay so you can understand your mind body connection. Don't put it off I know you are not feeling like it now but you have to do what you can now. If someone can help you get them to read this....If no one can help you, you really have to do this cause you have to be OK. I would be very careful not to drive if you can avoid it cause it is like driving while intoxicated. I have been there & it took me a lot of work but I got it figured out & just gave you the answers. Make sure you bring water with you when you go out & throw & jar of peanut butter & cut up apple in a bag & eat at the same time each day. You could be allergic to wheat, eggs, milk, etc. so get that stuff out of your diet if you can.|`|LoXvNBEmaa	well i'd definitely say a combination.<br>  if you are having issues with one or the other or both at the moment, call or see your doctor/psychiatrist; they will be able to help you more than anyone,.

There's nothing wrong with it as long as you don't insult people deeply or start a physical fight, but that might have been what you meant when you said the video was shocking. <br>  <br>  If it gets worse, you might want to try sitting back and just watching your friends play. That way you'll get to still have fun, but it will give you free brain space to think about how you would react to the other person if you were playing. <br>  <br>  I hope I helped!

Just because somebody is weird by social standards doesn't mean a damn thing besides they're a little awkward.

AA12360662	Not sure why you want to remember your dreams.  Dreams are from subconscious mind.  If dreams are important and significant, you will automatically remember them whether they are good or bad.<br>  <br>  However, to force yourself remember portion of the dreams, you can set your alarm to wake up every 15 mins or 30mins. That has been tested in dream lab, but then you won't have a good night sleep.  <br>  <br>  I know lots of people want to do it the other way because they kind of suffer from bad dreams or nightmare.  In that case, remembering dream is not a good thing.   Even for good dream, when you wake up, you still have to face the reality, so that good dream will ultimately be a dream anyway.|`|XxZQ72J4aa	The stress is what's causing it! Stress usually results in anxiety dreams or no dreams at all because your body is working too hard. Relieve your stress first, then you'll be able to dream again. <br>  <br>  Some people don't have the brain capacity to remember their dreams ever, but the fact that you used to be able to means that you can if you relax, eat healthily, and get enough sleep. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

T389Yzi3aa	Psychologists say that 85% of our personalities are formed by the time we are 6 years old.  The majority of that is done by the time we are 3!  UNBELIEVEABLE! <br>  <br>  the other 15% is like you say manners....society....learning to express yourself as an adult...etc.<br>  <br>  I have 4 children and let me tell you I doubted the facts when getting my degree.  After having my kids...I must say, I agree.  My oldest is still so compassionate, sensitive and affectionate. My second is so strong willed its amazing.....now he's "driven" and aims for the best grades  in stead of just demanding his way.  My daughter is so mature for her age and articulate.  Just like when she was little, she is very very organized and neat.....super detail oriented (nothing like her mother)  And my 4 yr old....we are still developing but he is proving to be quite a leader....and really funny....he just has this great sense of humor.    <br>  <br>  So, based on my data.....and my degree.....your right....i agree 100%  <br>  <br>  :~)|`|K7N0pkU8aa	Yes, I think your personality changes throughout life, depending on your experiences. For example, if you used to wear your heart on your sleeve and be really kind to everyone,  but then people took advantage of you or stabbed you in the back, you might become less trusting of people. Or if you used to be quick to fall in love, but then you got hurt so many times, you might become emotionally detached, or afraid to get into intimate relationships.  On the other hand if you were insecure and shy, but people always complimented you and talked to you, you may have come out of your shell....etc..|`|TDBpYyuPaa	It is possible.<br>  <br>  If you have an accident and your brain is injured, your personality could change.<br>  <br>  There was this case about a man named Phineas Gage who had an iron go through his skull, so he had severe brain damage.  Before the accident, he had a diplomatic and calm personality.  After the accident, he could function normally, but his personality had completely changed.  His friends described him as out of control and animal-like, very different from his cool and collected personality before the accident. <br>  <br>  If you're interested and want more info about it, here's the wikipedia link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gag...</a>|`|V5GtTrtsaa	A "change in how you express yourself" is a change in your personality, in my opinion.  Personality is just the way that you choose to interact with others, however I think we all have natural tendencies that we rarely overcome -- such as, for me, being sarcastic and probably too overly goofy -- but I also think that there's other parts of our personality that mature and change over time.  When I was younger I was cutting when I used my sarcasm without realizing that what I was doing was hurting others, but the more I interacted and understood, my personality morphed to fit my understanding of interaction.<br>  <br>  Things alter and change in the way you act, but I don't think you completely throw away who you are to take on a new way of life automatically.
sZvvYlihaa	except for the family situation and being "almost" killed every other day.. i think your life is mostly normal<br>  I think the bad experiences in life makes you a stronger and smarter person... for example never get in the car with the same person who almost got u killed (life lesson well learned) lol<br>  And the freinds thing- happens to everyone- Years ago i asked about that too and someone had told me that "Freinds come and go... but your real freinds are the ones who fight to stay" i never understood it at first but after reading about your situation i can fully say that that statement is completely true and you'll figure out your own meaning to it in due time<br>  Your young and your smart, just focus on the positives and stay in school, Im sure you dont wanna stay in that household forever<br>  Theres 2 options for you (that i can think of off the top of my head), stay in school, work hard and get scholorships to go to college and get a job doing what you will by then are sure you will love<br>  the other option is to call social services and get yourself outta that disfunctional family- but idk about that cuz i hear that once your in the system its pretty hard to get out and it causes alotta trauma emotionally..<br>  Your only 13 if your still alive after all these incidents then god definately has sumthing good planned for you<3|`|6CAsx3jaaa	your at an age that definitely sucks. when my parents started arguing my grades went from a to d. the truth is that almost no one is normal at that age must less any other age. the beauty of it is that it passes. when i was abused it really sucked but i got passed it. i find it hard to feel sorry for myself because my sister and brother had it worse. let me ask you a question though . would you rather have a sucky time now but a great adult life or a great time now an a sucky adult life? most big successes became that way because of early hardships. you are smart moore mature than your age  and creative . which means you are going to have a great adult life . you need to develop a vision of your  positive future|`|nkTKIXcBaa	Awww sweetie I'm sorry :(<br>  I hope venting made you feel better<br>  I'm not sure how to respond... from what you typed, it seems that you have really bad luck, but I'm sure there's a ton of stuff you're leaving out.

It will do nothing for you. <br>  <br>  Believe it or not, at the time of the test, the reasons for picking the wrong answer or doing poorly was far from your fault. There could be a number of distractions, perhas you had a bad day, the room might've gave you an uncomfortable feel, you didn't have time to study - there is no reason to punish yourself with the bad grade.

LLq9uPi4aa	$30-60k, depending where.  4 years of college (BSW degree) will make on the lower end.  BSW's are in demand as discharge planners at nursing homes and hospitals, but MSW is considered practice-level social work and usually required for hospital social work, esp in an urban area.  Hospitals tend to pay a little more than other settings... here in Oregon, about $25-30 an hour, and a few bucks more in CA.  In a hospital, you might do group therapy, discharge planning, NICU planning, cancer support, ER support... lots of different types of roles.  Usually hospitals prefer experience in medical settings.  You can get this in a field placement during your BSW or MSW schooling.  Field placements are required in CSWE-accredited programs, and you want to make sure your school is CSWE accredited.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	the amount of pay depends on the area where the social worker lives & works.  it is a field in high demand -state/county jobs have the best benefits, but the toughest work.

I don't agree with the focusing on slavery at all and see no benefit in this.  But I can see how it's good to remember and celebrate the major contributions that African Americans made in history.  Their efforts opened windows of opportunties for other ethnic backgrounds to come to America and have rights.  And it deserves it be remembered.<br>  <br>  I personally don't like the whole black history month maybe because I'm not African American.  I wonder why does it have to be just in one month to think and focus about the African Americans' history?  How about the other 11 months?  And I think there's also too much focus on negative past of the African Americans.  No other ethnic background that has had an oppresive past does that.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Edit: @ King:  Great link!  That's exactly what I think!|`|vijGOcPCaa	Mostly black history month is to teach people about black people in american history, such as the man that created the water gun, was black etc. those kinds of people here in america, it is not all about slavery. And there is no white history month because we have been in pretty much all history, just pick up a history text and that is learning about things that white people did. Blacks are a minority so there history is not as wide spread, so we give one month to let people learn a little bit more about what they have done.|`|7Ac07xH1aa	WTF, why?

But as far as the laws go, minorities got just as much rights as anybody else now, if not more. You can do anything in the United States if you put your mind to it and you work hard. Generally, at jobs and such there won't be as many black or mexicans or whatever as there are whites because they are the minorites.

Well I know I can do just as good a job as anyone else.

You feel good because you do, because things are going well for you, and there are not major problems in your life.  It probably also means that you have handled well your childhood abuse experiences.  "Am I wrong for feeling this good feeling?" Absolutely not.  On your career, it depends on what you want.  It is your life, really.  Figure out what you want.  Sit down with a tablet  an pen and write down any ideas that come to you in answer to the question, "If I could do anything with my life, what would that be?" Write down ANYTHING the comes to mind.  You can easily cross it off if you decide to later, at any time; it's all up to you.  Work on your list for a few weeks.  Then look at where you are and where you might go and decide what seems the best idea for YOU.

If you haven't decided on a career yet you could maybe check out counseling, psychology, or social work.

Things don't work like that. Think very specifically about what encounters you've had where this feeling comes up. Taken on the very specific case by case fashion you can choose to feel bored or curious or lazy or anything else in place of "anxiety". Establishing what kind of person you are does nothing to help you, how could it?    Anxiety is being TOTALLY unwilling to be confused. Confusion is incredibly awesome. Confusion is adaptation.

They like acting as "saviours" who run to rescue the lady in distress.  I think women have a natural capacity to fix things too.  Often they are put down by males who expect them to be incompetent or clueless in those areas.  I had a wife who was a far better plumber than I was.  She grew up learning from her dad who was a plumber.  So probably it a matter of exposure and outlook.

Men tend not be overly analytical about things, allowing them to focus on what's in front of them. Women, on the other hand have this amazing ability to analyze the crap out of everything, and lock it away in a bottomless filing cabinet in their brains, so should they need to, they can pull out the file and slap some guy in the face with it (metaphorically speaking of course).    I guess what I'm saying is, that since women use up a lot of their brain power remembering, analyzing, and being well organized in general, they're not apt to do as well as a man when it comes to say, mechanics. I think the more empty-headed (or maybe less clouded is a better term) brain of a man is more capable of focusing on things like logical problem solving (determining and fixing a problem) where a woman faced with the same situation will be wondering what to do for dinner, what she's gonna get her friend for her birthday, and why some woman at work said the things she said... With all that going on inside her head, how can she focus enough to see what's wrong with that carburetor?

They will ask you why you're there or what are the things that you want to work on.  They will ask you about your medical history and the history of your family.  They will ask you if any other person in your family has a history of mental illness.  If some one hasn't asked you these questions by at least the 3 session than think about going some where else.  Someone should have done a total medial and psychological make up to get a idea of what you're dealing with and what might be in your families history that might lead to the things that you're currently dealing with. If someone hasn't done that I would wonder how completely they would treat me not knowing my medial and family history.|`|1wDkKyLCaa	I happen to like it.

jTh0Vf7saa	There are a few differences in the biological contructs of each race but these are very small differences. Examples include our pigmentations, obviously. I dont believe, however, that people could ever be racially biased literally because of the colour of people's skin alone. I think The reason why black people were (and still are in many cases because of the troubled history between ethnicities) treated differently by white people is because of cultural differences. In essence, The question to ask would be this: If slavers travelled to africa with the intention of taking these people back to western society (as they did), only to discover that African culture had become as industrious as Western culture, would they still have taken these people as slaves? I think it is unlikely because the African natives were seen as primative (which technologically they were) and therefore inferior. Then again, had the People been as technologically advanced as the western world at the time, it is likely that they would have been better equipped to defend themselves in the first place. But in this hypothetical situation I doubt that the people of africa would have been treated differently had they been as advanced as the western world. Therefore I believe that race is more a social contruct than a biological one.|`|vqZD2TzLaa	Race is a social construct based upon physical variation.  That's it.|`|3AcDeiuFaa	Do your own homework.|`|AA11662840	It's culturally-constructed. There is no basis whatsoever that races are biologically different. The only difference biologically is the phenotype. So when people say, "White people are like this..." or "Chinese people are like this..." it may have SOME truth to it, but any truth it has will be culturally-based. Nothing at all to do with biology.|`|BMxNOJ39aa	We humans did start out in Africa, and we were all black.    The out of Africa migration was done during the first half of the Pleistrocence period. It was a time of ice ages, when sea levels dropped significantly and there was increased rainfall in many regions. At the same time Homo erectus was making stone tools and was able to use fire. The question of his being able to create fire has not yet been answered. Given the favorable climate and the increased skills to control his environment, Homo erectus spread out of Africa.    As for skin color:  "In their analysis of human evolutionary history, Jablonski and Chaplin concluded that modern humans most likely evolved in the tropics, where they were exposed to high UV levels. But as they moved into regions away from the equator, where UV levels are lower, humans became fairer so as to allow enough UV radiation to penetrate their skin and produce vitamin D, the "sunshine vitamin," also obtained from eating fish and marine mammals. Vitamin D is essential for maintaining healthy blood levels of calcium and phosphorous, and thus promoting bone growth.     Skin color, according to Jablonski and Chaplin, basically becomes a balancing act between the evolutionary demands of photo-protection and the need to create vitamin D in the skin.    One of the important implications of Jablonski and Chaplin's work is that it underlines the concept of race as purely a social construct, with no scientific grounds. DNA research has shown that genetically all humans, regardless of skin color and other surface distinctions, are basically the same. In an April 2001 article titled, "The Genetic Archaeology of Race," published in the Atlantic Monthly, Steve Olson writes "the genetic variants affecting skin color and facial features are essentially meaningless they probably involve a few hundred of the billions of nucleotides in a person's DNA. Yet societies have built elaborate systems of privilege and control on these insignificant genetic differences."   http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/02...    "Before the mass global migrations of people during the last 500 years, dark skin color was mostly concentrated in the southern hemisphere near the equator and light color progressively increased further away, as illustrated in the map below. In fact, the majority of dark pigmented people lived within 20 of the equator. Most of the lighter pigmented people lived in the northern hemisphere north of 20 latitude."  http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_4....

Your feelings sound like a romantic involvement or a want to be romance.  Perhaps his current girlfriend demanded he cut you off and he decided to indulge her. Some ladies can be very jealous, especially concerning a gal he was close to, would consider her a threat.  At any rate, he did not treat you decently at all.  He did owe you at least an explanation.    Do what ever you can to distract yourself, get occupied with other things. An all consuming interest would be good.

I think that you're more hurt by the way he dumped you.  It hurt your self-esteem and the confidence you have in yourself.  Anyone in your position would feel the same.  A boy I once knew claimed to have loved me & wanted to marry me.  Being the naive person I am, I fell for it.  I was ready to uproot my plans & my life in order to be with him.  It turns out, however, that he was just kidding around.  He didn't mean any of the things he said.  I was shocked.  I couldn't understand how the hell he could think that this was a joke, or even remotely close to funny.  Consequently, I went in to a severe depression.  I felt used, stupid, and I would cry.  Just like you: cry at the thought of him, what he said to me, etc. etc.  This happened for more than a month.  And then my friend told me to thank God that I found out the truth before things got really serious & there would have been no turning back.  When I think about it, it still hurts.  And I still see him once in a while at gatherings or I will hear about him.  And each time I realize that the pain is a little less than it was before.  So, my advice to you is to take one day at a time.  And thank God that it ended this way - rather than you married to him & mother of his kids.  Because then if he did this crap to you, it would have hurt even more.    It hurts now, but things will get better - trust me.  And you will move on - it will just take some time.|`|PCGYll8Waa	Learn to hate people and life gets alot better.

Did you lead him to believe that all you wanted was friendship?  If you really miss him like you say you do then you're in love and you need to make him aware of your feelings otherwise he'll think all you wanted was friendship and us guys tend to not care about friendships as much as women do ( I mean we do care but like on the same level as women).  If he found someone maybe that person is jealous and doesnt want him to talk to other women and he just wants to make them happy.  Anyhow, just call him and tell him its been really bugging you why he just gave you the cold shoulder and ask him whats really going on and then tell him how you really feel about him.

Its something that happens to so Many of us and its something that Ive been through lately, but it was all my fault. If you believe that there is no chance of you ever being together after this point, and you have thought about it for long enough, you have to let go. The though of it might hurt so much and I understand, But once its done you will feel better. I know what its like to have your heart set on something then it get snatched away. It hurts alot if you have had a goal and a dream in your head to be with this person, and you are so full of confidence that it will work- Then you have it all thrown back in your face.

Companies were using lead paint because it was cheaper than regular paint by about a 3rd but this led to toxins being admitted into children and affecting their growing process of the mind and body. So a law was put in place practically banning its use. This not only helps our children but makes less lawsuits for companies being blamed for children's deaths or other harmful actions.

hwRZ7DY7aa	This man lives a tragedy, he lost his wife and his child.... I can't imagine something more horrible happening to a person, most people would just fall apart. And yet he hasn't. He still has his work, his music and some social life so I think you should be very content that he's holding on.  If you want to get to know him better I think you need to be very patient and a good listener.|`|AA10287830	I think if I lost a child I would never be the same again.  And this man not only lost a child but his spouse as well.  He just needs time to heal.  Don't push yourself on him.  Give him room and time.  It may take years and years before he wants to get close to anyone new, if ever.  Respect that and let him be.  Just remain his friend and take things one day at a time.  Be gentle with him and his feelings.|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	Give it time.  Be there for him when he is interested in company.  Do nice things for him when you can, without being too obvious or drastic.  And, in the meantime, consider his age and whether you want a relationship with a guy that much older.  I'm assuming that's where you'd like to go.|`|S2ZccVFAaa	He needs help. It has been 2 years, if he doesn't get help soon there is a good chance he may forget how to and not desire to function normally again.     My former brother in law lost a son. After that he pulled away from his other kids too. He lost his boy about 12 years ago and still refuses to get close to anyone. He needed professional help and refused to get it. His oldest is now 18 and as soon as he graduates my guess is he will be gone.     Really, I'm not sure what you can do for him. He sounds like he would benefit from professional help. Convincing him of that is the challenge. Does he talk about his wife or daughter? If so try getting him to talk about that. Find his "hot spot"...what he talks about easily. Offer to go sit and have coffee or something while you talk. Maybe suggest going to an activity together but make it clear you're not expecting anything of him and it's JUST FRIENDS. Do something to make him laugh and do something spontaneous. Run through sprinklers and let your hair down or something.     Good luck.|`|UwiGwDGdaa	He's obviously still coping with the losses. He might be afraid simply because he doesn't want to get attached to someone and then lose them again, or he may be suffering from depression.     You have to give it time and be patient with him - it will take awhile before he feels comfortable getting close to someone again. Offer him an ear when he needs to talk, encourage him to talk to a grief counselor, and be ready for him when he finally opens up. Sometimes a person needs to talk at 2a.m. - I've had friends call me then for emotional help.     Don't push him or he'll back away - just give it time.

EaurpLufaa	Yes.  It takes a real man to love another man.  Even Jonathan (Biblical character) said that his love for David (another Biblical character) was far deeper and much more complex than any love he could ever feel for a woman.  Many ancient Romans and Greeks had the mindset you exhibit in your question (manly to love other men).  However, today, people are much more conservative.  They just don't understand.  There's nothing "girly" about loving another male.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	Sort of... There was a radical thesis about 30 years ago, it may have been put forward by the oft-reviled A .Dworkin, which argued that in the power structure of Western society, straight white men occupy position # 1, while gay men, straight women and non-white men vie for the #2 position. This places the latter group in a position of "horizontal hostility" to each other. Add any number of other factors such as poverty and disability and people are lower in the power pyramid.<br>  <br>  Although a glance at the lineup in US government today will show how much has changed in 30 years, there's probably still some truth in there. Dworkin didn't exactly say what you said; she said (if I remember right) that the most macho, ultramasculine men, the ones who have serious misogyny, are actually the most homosexual of all.<br>  <br>  You can imagine the howls of outrage. I don't actually quite "get" how the argument was supposed to work, but calling the most outwardly homophobic group around homosexual was really pretty outrageous. It got their attention anyway, but also allowed for some easy stereotyping and subsequent wholesale rejection of a lot of the more measured arguments that were being brought forward at the time. <br>  <br>  (I suppose that's why it's called radicalism, and I suppose that's why I'm too practical to be a radical.) <br>  <br>  Somewhere in there, anyway, I think there's a grain of truth. It would only apply to the kind of gay man who really hates women in a way that goes beyond the sexual, and among my large gay male acquaintance I can't think of a single one of these. Seen a few on TV though.<br>  <br>  But supposing them to exist, and juxtaposing such a specimen with a seriously macho caricature (of whom I also don't know any, but anyway), one could argue: a man who despises women but desires them is only a half-hater; one who despises them on both counts is a full-strength misogynist. <br>  <br>  So (deep breath) if misogyny equates to masculinity (which I disagree with), then your argument could be made.  It all gets terribly philosophical and negative and outdated though. I believe things have changed a lot, and these very abstruse reflections don't help much outside academia.|`|AA10895669	I've heard it said that many gay and effeminate men find it very difficult meeting partners because other gay men are not attracted to that stereotype.<br>  <br>  I also know many gay men who are typical guys, not a frilly bone in their bodies. I suppose you could say that male homosexuality is a form of masculinity. Look at the history of the ancient greek armies. It's seems pretty masculine to me for men to go and fight wars and then have sex. But that's why I prefer the finer things in life like shopping, doing lunch and decorating my home.|`|AA11313798	well I'D SAY... that people vary. it's not set in stone if gay/straight people are masculine/feminine.<br>  <br>  we can't label everyone the same things because we are all different people.<br>  <br>  but to answer your question, i think one reason someone would be attracted to masculinity is because they desire to be a little or a lot more feminine. <br>  <br>  such as.. if you wanted to be held, you'd seek someone that would like to hold you.. not be held too..right? <br>  <br>  but i don't want to make that set in stone either, i'm sure there are plenty fem attract fem and mas attract mas.<br>  <br>  people vary, so let people be people.|`|lQgXxSNcaa	Nope...since when did masculinity become a function of sexual orientation or gender for that matter???

If you value his friendship tactfully show him how to change his attitude.  People become critical when they are criticized or under-confident.  Its important that you deal with this issue properly so that it does not destroy your friendship.  Don't tolerate criticism in any form, stop him before he has time to say something critical or turn the tables on him by being doubley critical in return.  Theres loads of ways to show him you will not tolerate it.  You did say you have a good connection with him and it appears you care enough to sort it out.|`|y4LpyzGvaa	well the best thing you could do was first pray for him that he might be able to see that what he is doing is only a reflection of how he see life...<br>  <br>  the second one was help him realize this...|`|cebad5b46077e5b2866e0817f2c2e8caaa	The answer depends on how much you value this person as a friend.  If you would like to continue a friendship with them, then it is worthwhile to confront him on this behavior.  Definitely doing it in a tactful and caring manner is appropriate.  Be sure to make 'I' statements like, "When you say things like _____, it makes me feel ______ (sad, hurt, etc)."  And be clear that if this communication style of his does not change, that you are not sure it is a good idea that you remain friends.  <br>  <br>  You are doing yourself a dis-service if you accept that kind of treatment from someone.  You will continue to be 'put-down' and it will negatively impact you.  <br>  <br>  If he is a smart guy and he cares about his friendship with you, he will work to change it.  It may simply be that he doesn't realize he does that, or how it affects others.  (yes some people are that oblivious)  <br>  <br>  But after you have confronted him and if he gets really defensive about it, or twists it around to make it an issue about you, or only makes minimal efforts to change it, then I would cut my losses and move on.  You deserve to have a healthy, loving friendship/relationship with those in your life.  Not to be criticized constantly.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand if you do not really care whether this person is around or not, then politely decline opportunities to get together anymore.  Or you can even state that you just don't feel its a good connection between the two of you and would prefer not to spend time together any longer.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you choose, good luck!

0vQsoYIbaa	That is the problem, that most people (including your teachers) think economics are a zero sum game - that if someone succeeds then someone else has to fail.

The failure of capitalism hurts everybody.|`|2GNFQPdmaa	In a word, trade.<br>  <br>  Whoever told you that economics was a zero-sum game was probably a marxist. The way it really works is that trade enriches all partners, and in a downturn trade dries up.<br>  <br>  Here's an example: The US is rich, and it buys a lot of things from all over the world. Then the housing market collapses.

We are also using less oil, so the middle east has economic problems.<br>  <br>  With Germany's export market weakened by the collapse in the US, the whole EU takes a hit. Because there's less trade going on, financial centers like London and New York get hit even harder.<br>  <br>  Pretty soon the effect ripples out to the rest of Asia, Europe, and the Americas.<br>  <br>  That's how a global downturn happens.|`|8a2e845892f5a5deb6e1a79f0cf30f75aa	pmjenn is spot on.<br>  <br>  Its all down to productivity.

9YWYpPLiaa	Well, its not like I can really give you all the answers, or the one you want.  But I can tell you what I've learned from my own experiences:  those people that come into you life will always be the same untill you figure out why you are attracted (not sexually) or are attracting them to you.  Also, learn to say no!  If your feeling bad about yourself and not telling these women that what they want you to do is making you feel hate yourself, no offense, but grow a pair and say no!  When your out picking up on these woman you can tell in some way what they are like if they seem to have something in common with the others then just walk away.  Yes you may have to go without getting any for a while but maybe that would be the best thing.  As to what you think of the way you look... change it!  Plenty of chicks are into bald heads if you don't like it talk to a doc see if something can work out. Honestly, I really do wish you luck and sorry if some of the things I said were a little on the harsh side, but you did ask not to hear the mushy stuff.|`|WaLkmcGiaa	I've seen a similar question by u..<br>  The only thing in common with all these women you describe is yourself, so you are attracting them.. before you jump into a relationship i'd make sure that she has a strong family, (so you don't get those girls with dad issues as you say)<br>  Maybe dating a women that can kick your ***, meet them at kick-boxing classes, or  a mad- black woman, or a more mature woman who is older than you by a few years.<br>  And just because she want to be dominated in the br makes her needy in real life?<br>  Maybe youre not attracted to women at all and you need another man to satisfy your needs|`|E2xG6bpnaa	Sex is complicated... giving, taking, what does she like, where do I draw the line?

Its sex, enjoy it and that is soooo much better when a deep connection is made.  Your right the right girl may never ever come along... but why prepare for that?
TDBpYyuPaa	Systematic desensitization.  Systematic desensitization is a therapy that specifically treats phobias.  The person makes a hierarchy of their fear (if it's dogs they might say the bottom is seeing a picture of a dog and the top would be petting a real dog).  Then the therapist teaches them relaxation techniques and has them use these techniques while going through each step in the hierarchy.  The person with the phobia is ultimately supposed to associate the relaxed feeling with the feared object and will no longer fear it after treatment.|`|TSQF1O7Vaa	I was terrified of big dogs for a time.

9EVcTnUWaa	I've been in and out of therapy for 40+years dealing with depression and I've thought about suicide a whole lot of times. But since I'm here you know that I haven't done it/  There are time when I wonder if things will ever get better.When you deal with something as long as I've been dealing with depression you start to wonder and to want to change things.  Sometimes it seems like the only answer is suicide, but I also know what I would do to my family and in particular my daughters.  There for I don't follow through with it but I would be lying if I said that I didn't think about it especially when my depression is really bad. So thinking about it is't acting on it.  A lot of people are lying if they say that they never thought about it.  It's the acting on it that's the problem.  IF it ever get to that point than get help ASAP!!!!!|`|6GmtcZteaa	Yes. Because we can't judge on others for thinking that. Perhaps their capacity of ' keeping it in' is not as big as ours. Perhaps they just had too many problems, more than they can just plan out by simple thinking and their way out seemed to be suicide, but  - they -  were stong enough fighters not to do it. I persoanlly have thought about it a couple of times, but ofcourse I wont go through with it. Certainly because I know I dont give up to anything that easily and the fact thats its not worth it ofcourse and my family would have to deal with that for the rest of their lifes. But I certainly think every person is jus bound to have a certain point in their lifes when enough is enough, but things usually start getting better from there.

AEAxZEveaa	Well, I think there are people in every group of "ists" (race, sexual orientation, religion, etc) who are a little out there.  I think you could apply this argument to any group of activists. It does seem to me that some women who consider themselves feminists tend to believe that women should only act like men--that anything traditionally feminine is bad. I tend to think that that is the most sexist idea of all. I love being a stay at home mom. I love being married and taking care of my husband. I don't think there is anything wrong with that. Now, I should add that my husband and I are equals and I take on many of the roles that are traditionally male (like managing our investments). I realize that women fifty years ago didn't have that equality and didn't have much of a choice. I think the focus should be all about equality of opportunity rather than trying to act like men or trying to place women above men. Men and women are equals, regardless of what some people may think. There are feminists that don't believe like that. It's just that you see the loudest ones the most and think that they're all like that.<br>  <br>  By the way: who are you speaking to in your edits?|`|cB2VGhLgaa	maybe it just suprises people that someone would actually want to be a servant as their only job, thats what housewives are you know, servants.|`|li07DuSGaa	We've strived for equality because we've been treated so badly in the years before.

Nobody seems to tap upon the NORMAL feminists just asking for the bare minimum. stupid stereotypes...|`|zXPGm2fraa	I don't understand why so many people think that when one person says something from whatever group, they assume that all those who belong to that group agree and collude and all feel passionately about it. I have a really good idea that when a guy says "women are good for nothing except babies and cleaning" doesn't represent all guys. As for political groups or movements, the comments that, for instance, Dr. Kamau Kambon, former visiting professor of African Studies at NC State University, an African-American Equal Rights Activist made I highly doubt represent the entire face or opinion of African American Equal Rights Activists. I'm not going to quote him, you can look it up. Assuming that everyone who believes in a cause has the exact same mindset is naive.<br>  About the actual quote, it's a silly thing to say and being a housewife/mother is one of the HARDEST and MOST IMPORTANT jobs a person can do, and very hard to do it right, and there is very little reward in it from external sources like other occupations. And it's WAY harder than being a builder, or a banker, or a wildlife rehabilitator.<br>  <br>  Edit: Okay you just wanted to know why a "feminist" would say something that's degrading to women, sorry I misunderstood what you were asserting. My opinion is she said it because she either meant something else (to give her the benefit of the doubt) such as women don't have to accept that there is only one option for them in their lives, or she said it because she actually does disrespect housewives, or she said something that she didn't think all the way through out of anger or frustration.|`|O5IzJLQPaa	I'm not a feminist, but my conjecture is that these women are not women.

Whats up with that.|`|4beOKtogaa	The Feminist Movement initially started as a means to give women the same opportunities as men, particularly in the work place.  What the original feminists wanted was the choice to do with their lives what they wanted, whether it was being an a doctor or a seamstress, or even a stay at home mom.  The feminists wanted women to be able to make the same choices as men and not just be told to stay at home.<br>  In many ways they've accomplished this goal, think Ms. Clinton and Ms. Palin in 2008's election.  <br>  However, the movement continues because while women are now allowed to do the same jobs as men, they still don't make as much and are much more rare in many 'male dominated' fields.<br>  <br>  In every movement or organization (political party, religion, etc) there are people who take more extreme views than others.  While the majority of feminists (or regular women) feel that women should feel good making the choice that is best for them (stay at home mom, doctor, lawyer, teacher, etc) and be paid the same amount as the men in that field, a small minority believe that women MUST make the choice to go into the work place.<br>  Please know that these women are an extreme group and are not representatives of the majority of feminists.|`|FUIBscKGaa	You repeat yourself too often.  Asked (by you) and answered multiple times.<br>  <br>  I think your whole laid back dude persona is funny.  (cute boy in the avatar, by the way.  Isn't he that famous skater kid?  The name escapes me) A few days ago, you were saying how some feminists are okay, just not the "radical ones".  I corrected your misuse of the term radical, and posted on several of your non-questions. The more I have corrected you, the more your true gripe has become evident.  You've now gone from disliking only "lesbian and radical" (again misusing the word radical) to disliking all feminists.  You are not only redundant, but you are now contradicting yourself.<br>  <br>  The most amusing thing about your laid-back-guy thing that you are trying to portray yourself as, reveals you as an mra.  They tried desperately to say that they had leftists in their pseudo movement, although they couldn't produce a single one.  They somehow thought this would hide the fact that they are a bunch of violent right wing ninnies.  What you don't realize, as you continue to pretend you are something you're not, is that liberal men are nothing like you.  Liberal men are either so genuinely laid back that they don't care what anybody does, left of right.  (my best friend is like that.)  Or they are passionate about their political views due to their concern for justice and equality.<br>  <br>  I know you will deny you are an mra.  Ever since I got here and started posting quotes by your pedophilia and rape promoting leaders, you guys have tried to change your tune.  Just a few days ago, you mras proudly proclaimed yourself as such, where as now, there are suddenly several posts that are by men trying to escape the stigma, even as they continue to use all of the exact same techniques used only by mras.  Remember, I have a lot of experience with you guys, and can tell who you are with no effort.  It's also funny to note that a lot of feminists once truly thought that mra stood for male republican asshole, and had to be told what it really meant.<br>  <br>  Just for being a pedantic weirdo, I am posting yet another fully sourced, and fully documented quote by an mra leader, as well as another link to Liz's page.

During the second wave of feminism many women were not given that choice.  If you were not a stay at home PTA mom, who had the dinner on the table and were dressed to the nines when your husband came home you were a failure.  Women were not given the choice to pursue their careers.  Once you were married you were expected to stay home even if mothering and motherhood was not something you wanted to do.  Men were bound by the same conventions and had to be the breadwinners who had very little input or interaction with their children.<br>  I think today that this should be a choice between couples.  As well I think with the high rate of divorce it is irresponsible for a women not to have enough education and training to also be able to support herself and her children if the union fails.  I also think that staying at home and raising children should be recognized for the important job that it is and perhaps the government could at least give couples who do this a tax break. benefits or pay something towards the caregivers pension so that like many elderly women who did devote their lives to their family and are living in poverty today.|`|EWUy2YFIaa	You're always going to find people like that, in any demographic.

It seems to be a common theory, not just this user's beliefs only but also among the majority of feminists I've encountered."<br>  <br>  And you ask:<br>  "...why would statements like this be made by a feminist? "<br>  <br>  OK. Here's my take on it:<br>  I don't think the statement is directed at housewives. If someone says: "....women should strive to be more than housewives" I don't immediately pick up on an implication of derision of the good role housewives can play, as you do. <br>  <br>  Firstly, I would wonder if I really heard the person say "CAN strive" instead of "SHOULD strive"... because that would significantly change the meaning. There's a big difference between can and should. And there's also a big difference between "be more than" and "instead of being"... so be careful with words.<br>  <br>  But, giving you the benefit of the doubt, if they say "SHOULD strive" then I would try to consider the scope and merit of the opinion and not jump to the conclusion that housewives are being disrespected. <br>  <br>  It's all very well and good to be a housewife but not necessarily wise to limit one's opportunities for future survival. By striving to be more than a housewife, a woman can obtain skills and work experience should she need to fall back on them in future. It's like insurance. For example, if her husband lost his job or left her and she needed to support children. <br>  <br>  Therefore, all girls should be encouraged to nuture their talents and get some independant income-earning skills under their belt before jumping blindly into marriage and children. I'm very relieved that my mother did because dad didn't help feed, clothe and educate us. <br>  <br>  It's basic and wise survival mentality. It's good.
AA11155064	In Rousseau's era, democracy -- as we now understand it -- was largely a fledgling concept. It was to large measure through Rousseau and his compatriots (read the excellent text "Twelve Who Ruled" by Peter Gay.) and events of the time that democracy got kicked off into it's current form.<br>  <br>  In Pre-revolutionary 18th century  France, society was still very much feudally structured. Inherited wealth was secured by actual and virtual enslavement of lesser levels of the populace. Rule of government was via mainly through the offices of a dynastic monarchy that had achieved moral corruptness by today's standards. Venality was rife and influence was made by self serving nobility and church royalty to preserve their own considerable privileges and dissolution.<br>  <br>  In this scenario, middle-classes (bourgeoisie)  and would-be aspirants (sans-cullottes) were stifled from social mobility or status realisation. The same affected the peasantry. One's lot in life was almost cast in stone at birth barring falls from grace that were virtually insurmountable  once engaged. Each sub-monarchic class was regarded as both obligatorily servile and total disposable by its societal supra-stratum.<br>  <br>  In this milieu, philosophers of the time proposed the concept of "Noblese Oblige" which over time evolved into the democratic ideal of "The Social Contract". This originally proposed that in order for all societal levels to prosper, there existed reciprocal obligations between all parties. For nobility to impose tithes (fiscal impositions/ taxes) on peasantry they had to provide an environment that readily enabled it. The peasantry had in turn to warrant any pleasantries or concessions made them. In short instead of starving and flogging a workhorse to premature death, nuture and pamper it for longer more prosperous life capable of greater burdens.<br>  <br>  Much of the preceeding observations were not Rousseau's alone -- there were many who shared the philosophies. However, he was cast in an historical position that permitted him to enable change. History has largely been good to him. (The Terror may not have been his finest hour -- but acceptable in the context of the times.)<br>  <br>  In current day society, a form of philosophic unwritten "Social Contact' remains. In democratic societies, the populace agree to abide by certain government codified behaviours (laws) for the greater populace's good. In return the government agrees to provides a supportable comfortable responsive-to-constituents environment with appropriate welfare.
srIMFTb8aa	These questions are always silly.  <br>  <br>  Many feminist do support minorities, animal rights, the environment, free-range chickens, etc.  However, they don't usually identify as feminists when supporting these issues because it's much more effective to identify as a civil rights activist, animal rights activist, environmentalist, or whatever kind of activism is appropriate to the issue at hand.<br>  <br>  Feminism, civil rights and race relations aren't mutually exclusive.<br>  <br>  Why is that so hard to understand?|`|iHKJsyfTaa	A Black Russian ???

I have been on marches against racism, specifically South Africa when it had apartheid. Yet I have never protested on women's issues. I have written letters, signed partitions and certainly spoken out against racism whenever I have come up against it.<br>  <br>  I am just as likely to respond to racist questions on answers as sexist ones or any form of prejudice.<br>  <br>  I have bought up my children to respect those of other ethnic groups, religions as well as women.  The only time my son ever got into a fight when he was growing up was when someone was making racist remarks to a friend of his and although I told him that fighting was not the answer I was secretly proud of him.<br>  <br>  All of the feminist friends I have are just as offended by racism as sexism, most people who hate prejudice, hate all prejudice not just that which affects them.|`|EWUy2YFIaa	That's not true.  There are plenty of feminist organizations that focus on non-white women.  Women for Women is a sponsorship organization that focuses on (mainly non-caucasian women, obviously) in developing countries, and I was just reading about organizations that are dedicated to stopping arranged marriages of young girls in the Middle East, and another dedicated to helping impoverished prostitutes get on new career paths in India.  <br>  <br>  Your assertion doesn't hold water.

In fact, I'm also sick of race used to describe skin color, how many "white" people has anyone ever met who were from this one "white" country?

I believe this dilemma with the feminists exposes them as the true frauds that they are and the closet bigots that they always were! <br>  <br>  This is coming from a black man in Las Vegas, NV

b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	I'm currently working on my bio-psych doctorate, and according to the latest DSM a diagnosis of DID requires that at least two personalities routinely take control of the individual's behavior with an associated memory loss that goes beyond normal forgetfulness; in addition, symptoms cannot be due to drug use or medical condition. DID is a very controversial diagnosis, many professionals don't believe it exists. You don't have true DID because you don't have the associated amnesia, in fact you are very aware of yourself and your identities. It's interesting to me that you discuss Emily as a static, unchanging identity, you said: <br>  "Emily would just be Emily. Of course, I am a straight female, and a straight female acting bold and boisterous like a male wouldn't blow over well with other males. I don't like Emily"<br>  Emily is the person you are, yet you are afraid to act in the way that you truly wish to, so you've created (or adopted) and internalized a persona that can do the things that you want to do without fear. You should be who you want to be, men are varied in what they are looking for in a woman, some men like bold women. Society tells women that they shouldn't act certain ways or hold certain careers, but this is changing rapidly, be who you want to be. Famed swordsman Myamoto Musashi once said, "There is nothing outside yourself that can make you stronger, faster or smarter," I find this particularly relevant to your situation. You can pretend to be someone else because you think that your true self is an unchanging identity, but this may be because you need to find yourself. A journey of a million miles begins with a single footstep, good luck.

d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	I consider Zeitgeist to be an intellectually dishonest documentary, not because of the filmmakers personal bias, but because of its disregard for the truth. There is so much questionable statements that can easily be refuted, or controversial points that have legitimate opposing views that should have been presented.<br>  <br>  - Regarding part 1: Jesus<br>  <br>  The "Mythology of Jesus" theory was an obscure and generally dismissed theory. <br>  It has gained exposure due to author "Acharya S" and her collaboration with the Zeitgeist filmmaker. (She is also author of the films companion guide). But even the casual but astute viewer will find considerable silliness in the some of the conjectures where practically any numerical or astrological connection 'proves' mytholical derision. Son=sun? Three stars in Orions belt = three kings? Virgo = Mary because the astrological sign sort of looks like an M? Who buys this stuff?<br>  <br>  Some other views:<br>  <br>  " The idea of Jesus as a myth is rejected by the majority of biblical scholars and historians. In 2004, Richard Burridge and Graham Gould stated that they did not know of any "respectable" scholars that held the view today. Robert E. Van Voorst has stated that biblical scholars and historians regard the thesis as "effectively refuted"."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_myth_hypothesis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_myth_...</a><br>  <br>  For a point-by-point analysis, see <a href="http://www.conspiracyscience.com/articles/zeitgeist/part-one/" rel="nofollow">http://www.conspiracyscience.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  For more rebuttals, see <a href="http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-story-of-jesus" rel="nofollow">http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  - Regarding Part II: 9/11<br>  <br>  It should be noted upfront that being skeptical of the 'official version' of anything presented by the government or media, is a good thing for society. And it should also be noted that questioners of 9/11 'offical versions' range from genuine intellectual pursuits of greater truths, to bizarre interpretations specifically intended to support a unwavering point of view. <br>  <br>  The Zeitgeist filmmaker is part of that spectrum that has bought into the theory that the government orchestrated the whole thing. Unfortunately the evidence they selected and presented was sloppy and much of it easily disproved, even by members of the Truth movement.

Socialism takes away personal responsibility; while capitalism promotes rewards to the person who will work hard and try to better themselves financially.

That process doesn't simply remove the clitoral hood, which might be regarded as the equivalent of male circumcision, but the clitoris itself. <br>  <br>  These days, it is done for reasons of cultural preference, and circumcision does not prevent men from sexual function later....FGM does. <br>  <br>  Western women seem to prefer the "cut" to the uncut...and while both styles have their fans, a lot of men seem to opt for circumcision as adults, simply because women prefer it. There are also some studies that suggest that women can run a higher risk of cervical cancer if their partners are not circumcised.<br>  <br>  If it strikes you as silly, consider the number ot women who change their bodies to be considered "desirable". There is an ocean of implants out there, and people give their daughters implants for their sweet sixteens, and nose jobs for their bat mitzvahs.<br>  <br>  No one seems to be allowed to just "be" anymore.|`|AA11589988	I do think that circumcision for males should be a choice but it's wrong to equate female castration with male circumcision.<br>  Removal of the clitoris is castration and it's not analogous to removal of male foreskin.|`|G1kdupY3aa	"The World Health Organization (WHO; 2007), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS; 2007), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; 2008) state that evidence indicates male circumcision significantly reduces the risk of HIV acquisition by men during penile-vaginal sex...".<br>  <br>  Circumcision saves lives.<br>  **************************************...<br>  I've been doing some reading and can't find one single country on earth that explicitly bans male circumcision in all its forms.

We found the whole idea barbaric and did not let it happen to them automatically in hospital.)<br>  <br>  I'm sure other people have suggested that you get over this. It's not so much the single issue, as everything it seems to represent to you.

I'm not so nuts that I advocate throwing people in jail for something so common place. Educated against? Hell yes. The whole reason people think circumcision is a good idea is because of "cleanliness", which is completely nuts. I mean, I could hear fine without ears, and I dislike getting dead skin and shampoo caught behind them, but that is NOT a good reason to cut them off (soap, or condoms if we're talking about penises, is a much better idea than cutting up our bodies). Besides, the original argument for circumcision (outside of religion, which I think that Jews and Muslims do for that reason) was to make it harder to masturbate. Yep, blame your circumcised wiener on puritanical Christian values that make no damn sense.<br>  <br>  The last thing America needs is more people in jail alongside the people that smoked pot once or thought about smoking pot. I'm not so much of a bigot that I think that prohibiting people from exercising an important part of their religion is a good idea. I mean, a penis works fine without the foreskin. It works better with it though, which really needs to be drilled into the collective American psyche.<br>  <br>  Edit: Male circumcision is nowhere near as traumatic, painful, and altering as female circumcision. The majority of female circumcision requires cutting off the clitoris at the very least. The equivalent of that is cutting off the entire head a dude's penis and making the rest less sensitive or completely dead. The equivalent of male circumcision on a female would only be the removal of the hood of the clitoris.|`|IwUpusQiaa	well as a child, your parents have that right over you...just as they do with every other decision you are faced.<br>  i don't think comparing male circumcision to female genital mutilation is fair, either. the reasoning behind these surgeries are completely different (one is an effort to keep the area cleaner, and less prone to infection, disease, etc. the second..not so much.)<br>  all this aside, i don't feel infant male circumcision is fair.

Heck, I met someone in a parade one day! <br>  <br>  Then there are those days where I feel alone, lug myself to school, and feel even worse because I'm not around the people I want to be around. Those are the days I busy myself with work; the days I don't commit to memory. <br>  <br>  Of course, there are times when I feel alone and I call an old friend. Hearing their voice is just enough to lift my spirits up. <br>  <br>  My favorite thing to do when I'm feeling alone and can't knock it, I go bargain shopping :) Getting an awesome deal and being around other people make me feel so much better. Also, if I go to a consignment store, it makes me feel like there is a mystery behind anything I am buying. I leaf through the racks, dart across the strip malls, and scan price tags until I develop schizophrenia.

b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	Were you partially conscious or totally asleep? Sleep paralysis is something that occurs sometimes where "there is a paralysis that occurs as a natural part of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which is known as REM atonia. Sleep paralysis occurs when the brain awakes from a REM state, but the body paralysis persists. This leaves the person fully conscious, but unable to move. In addition, the state may be accompanied by terrifying hallucinations (hypnagogic) and an acute sense of danger.[3] Sleep paralysis is particularly frightening to the individual due to the vividness of such hallucinations.[4] The hallucinatory element to sleep paralysis makes it even more likely that someone will interpret the experience as a dream, since completely fanciful, or dream-like, objects may appear in the room alongside one's normal vision. Some scientists have proposed this condition as an explanation for alien abductions and ghostly encounters."<br>  Hypnagogic jerk is a similar notion, it's also a frightening hallucination/dream state.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	When you sleep, your body is actually paralyzed by your brain so that you can't hurt yourself.  Sometimes, when you are not sleeping very deeply, a little sense of that paralysis leaks through to your conscious mind.  It gets frightened and makes up reasons for the fear.  That's what causes the nightmare.  The nightmare is caused by the fear, not the other way around.  All of us have these types of dreams occasionally.  If it persists for more than a couple of weeks, I'd talk to my doc about it anyway.  You might need a sleep study.|`|32f5ffc7a51bf64f7b223532d269eabbaa	Feelings of despair and being trapped.

50zbKv0jaa	Famously in 'King Harold's Saga', King Harold of England offered the Viking King Harald Hardraada of Norway 'seven feet of English ground, or as much more as he is taller than other men'. As the Anglo Saxon King rode off Hardraada commented 'what a little man he was; but he stood proudly in his stirrups!' The height and appearance of the two kings is not known, but the average height for males at this time was about 1.73m (5ft 8 inches), and for women about 1.57m (5ft 2 inches). These heights are not dramatically different from the average stature today.|`|6b24cf642defa808f4e13cc745076453aa	I don't think they are taller on the whole.   When I've been there they all seem to be in the range of elsewhere.  Except for some of the African tribes, where men are consistently taller than Europeans and others.   But if you look at sociological issues, Scandinavians certainly seem a great deal smarter than most other humans - so they stand tall in my eyes.   I don't know whether that has anything with what they eat.   Maybe having a culture of their own, strong enough to resist Hollywood, is the secret.|`|4NV4bew9aa	Look at your question and rewrite it!<br>  <br>  It's not culture that makes anyone tall.

eVYhqaXDaa	When maximizing earnings, you are focusing on a flow; when maximizing wealth, you are focusing on a stock. While maximizing one does not mean you are unconcerned about the other, there will be a difference of emphasis. (It is possible for earnings maximization to ignore wealth; it is not possible for wealth maximization to ignore earnings). <br>  Earnings is more focused on short term standard of living. I want to earn as much as I can so I can buy as much as I want. In the extreme, I don't save at all (i.e., I do not build up any wealth). I'm enjoying life now, but if anything happens to my earnings stream, I am in trouble.<br>  Maximizing wealth trades some of that standard of living for security. I may not enjoy as high a standard of living now, but I will be able to maintain my current standard of living longer. <br>  <br>  For example, let's say our earnings maximizer earns $100,000 a year and spends it all. He is enjoying a very high standard of living. Our wealth maximizer makes $50,000, but spends only $30,000. His standard of living is much lower, but for every year he earns $50,000, he can maintain his standard of living for 1.67 years. For the earnings maximizer, the ratio is 1:1. The wealth maximizer still cares about earnings, because the more he earns the more he can save. He, however, at two ways to reach his goal: earn more or spend less. The earnings maximizer can only earn more.
9okusH1kaa	I live in NY, a great bastion of single 35-40 yr old women that feel like they were cheated out of a man. They rejected the men in their life for a host of reasons stemming from sky high standards and now they feel that men and society in general are pathetic, evil, out to get them, cheating them, etc. Younger people or couples are a reminder of what they no longer have. They are bitter.<br>  <br>  The men have dealt with a lifetime of rejection and are abject losers or they have waited to long to settle down and now find that they can no longer attract women in their 20s. They become bitter and dissatisfied, especially when they realize they are left with the single 35-40 yr old women as their only options. <br>  <br>  This is because of a lack of parity between the # of women in the top echelons of NY society and the # of men there. There are far more women, for a variety of reasons. Women usually reject their social inferiors and so the rejected men and the lonely women end up bitter. This problem is increasing in NY.|`|AA10527991	You shouldn't generalize.  Not everyone who is between 35-40 are mean.

There are a huge number of lousy therapists out there and, sadly, most people who are in need of help don't know how to tell a good therapist from a bad one.

6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	The unemployment rate is still under 8 % and in 1982 it peaked at 10% so  it is not the worst, However it is more worrisome because the 82 recession was caused by the fed tightening to get rid or inflation so we knew that it would not last very long but now we have no idea   how bad it will get or when it will end.

Ch9TedMcaa	Good question. Because it will take a while to build all those roads, bridges, and fix up schools, rebuilding these things creates the jobs. What affect it will have on the overall economy remains to be seen.  But when you put people to work, they are now earning money. The concept is that they will use this salary to purchase more goods, take out home loans, car loans, student loans, all to get the economy stimulated. This may have a short term effect or a long term, no one knows yet.<br>  <br>  What the government is doing now is using Keynesian economics, which believes that more government spending on the economy will stimulate it. The drawback of this however is that the debt will continue to rise, which pay push us to higher inflation and decrease the value of the dollar.|`|Ny5FYSvEaa	Once the infrastructure projects have finished the jobs will be there no longer, but hopefully that will occur in a different stage of the economic cycle. Anyway a job for a little while is better than no job at all.<br>  <br>  Pay goes to employees, who spend it, but that is only part of the effect. The companies employed to do the building need to buy the materials necessary for the job, including machinery. So a large part of the money spent on infrastructure goes straight back into the economy before workers spend their pay cheques.<br>  <br>  This stimulation could occur by spending money on anything though. The important aspect is that better roads and transport improve productivity. When people can get places faster and more easily, and people can transport goods faster and more easily, less money and time are lost in transportation. This means goods can be made more cheaply and people can do more work in the same amount of time. This leads to higher productivity, meaning more production without spending any more time or money. High productivity is the key to a permanently strong economy. Also, better transportation allows companies can access more areas, meaning more competition in markets, or markets in areas where they otherwise wouldn't have existed, and a more efficient economy.|`|MgsK1VQCaa	If you want to stimulate the economy there are a lot of ways to do it, some more effective and faster than others, but they all have one thing in common: getting money to start moving around again. You could just give everyone a couple of hundred dollars and hope they go spend it rather than save it, or cut their taxes which would be the same thing but probably spread over many months or even years. Spending money on infrastructure improvements, while maybe not putting money into the economy quite as fast as a direct payment, has the added benefit of making the transportation sector better able to handle the expected pick up when it arrives. And the money paid to construction workers will usually change hands several times as the worker spends it for everyday living expenses like groceries, gas for their vehicles, going to the movies, buying clothes, etc. Then the cashier at the supermarket gets paid and she spends her money on lunch for her kids or a new car, and it goes on and on. The only drawback, as I see it, is that the time frame for construction projects is pretty long, sometime taking years from initial design to finished project. The good thing about this particular slate of projects is that many of them have been in the works for a while and some were actually ready to go, ie 'shovel-ready' when the bill was signed. As for worthwhile jobs, I'd say that these jobs are worthwhile and will be in demand as long as we need to move things from point A to point B.|`|gwqS6xHpaa	In my opinion, one problem we have in this country is, FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE GONE TO COLLEGE.  NEXT, FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE NOT GRADUATED.  <br>  <br>  The college dream should not be forced down the throats of every child.  Some children should be aiming for college, others for trade school (electricians, construction, plumbers...) and others for manufacturing.<br>  <br>  Sadly, we have created a society, where only the most educated (those with a 4 year degree or higher) have any shot at making it to middle class.  We did it by shopping at wal-mart and turning our back on solid US companies and forcing a race to the bottom for prices.  Now, all of the decent jobs for high school graduates are gone.  Further, jobs for blue collar workers and white collar workers is following.<br>  <br>  Will building roads help the economy. I say yes and no.  It is not the fix all.

gv5DsZRZaa	well i dont have sex either and i think its gross too!! <br>  <br>  and i am NOT bi or lesbian.<br>  <br>  fyi to the many stupids out there that this is the first thing thatd get in ur heads- let kids grow up before havin sex! sex shouldnt be an option for someone under 16 at least!! i am partly against gays/lesbians/bi,<br>  and ive been hugely turned on before by someone, so im NOT. <br>  <br>  and neither are other people that dont like it or wanna do it yet.<br>  <br>  and to answer this ladys question- <br>  u probly have a sexual desire for him for some reason that ur not seeing. <br>  i liked this guy once, and i started gettin this wierd feeling, and later, it turned more and more into a definite turn-on. <br>  no sex dreams on him but i did get those feelings before i even LIKED him at all, so sometimes i guess its not really noticeable when u like or love someone.|`|l2qnuSKjaa	ok.. well hes kinda dumb but w/e cuz its purely natural. this pretty much means that u have a sexual desire that hasnt been satisfied and that its growin. its natural and normal. and u dont have to tell him.. and the reason why u probably had this sex dream with him, is bcuz hes the closest thing to intimacy u had and u incorborated him in ur dream and then it resulted in sex. dont look too much into it. its nott that big of a deal|`|TApsFzgBaa	WELL I THINK HE IS REALLY STUPID  FOR NOT HAVING SEX WITH U......BUT I DNT KNOW IF U HAD ME I WOULD HAVE SEX WITH U EVERYSINGLE DAY I LOVE SEX N IF U WANT SOME ILL GIVE U SOME OF THIS BBY GIRL.........
WzKrZoHQaa	Hi there, good posting.  Many ppl feel like this but forget that as it is all relative OK ?  It could be that you have a thyroid issue and a hormonal imbalance but you will never know this until you have blood tests via Dr surgery.  If it is depression then tablets alone will be ok but the Dr needs to offer you some counselling to discover why you feeling this way and what it was that brought about this change in you.<br>  <br>  You seem to be from a good solid background and are now worrying about World events that you may have little or no control over - OR could you ?  Have you thought about how you can play a part in facilitating even the smallest of changes for the ones you are now concerned about ?  Can you help in some way ?  By trying to find a solution to helping the others you may find the peace you so desire in yourself.  Firstly though you are of little help to anyone if you are not functioning 100% yourself so it is vital you seek prof help as quickly as possible.<br>  <br>  I suggest you write down what life used to be like for you and how you used to feel - then on separate piece of A4 write down how you feel now - don't just write down in a long list but randomly just one word across the page, even upside down, sideways on etc and then put a sort of cloud edge around each word - slot words in between larger ones then look at it.  Repressed anger usually turns to depression, write down when the change started to get noticed.  What was going on around that time in yr life when these changes took place ?  Do you feel you have let someone down ?  Do you feel you have been let down yourself?  Was a death ?  Maybe now you need to speak to someone like CRUSE.    Write a letter - this is a letter you will never send but write it anyway and then burn it - I find this helps to dilute feelings and even repeat it a couple of times a year - yes it does help.<br>  <br>  You can perhaps contact an organisation and see how you could help them - this will be you doing your bit for the people you are concerned about and in turn help yourself.  I would still get conselling as we all get stuck - like a cart wheel gets stuck in the mud at the bottom - this is where you are at the moment and because you have been there a while the mud around the wheel has become hard and has you trapped.  You need a "softening" of surroundings in some way and a little help to pull you forward - just slightly so you are on the move again and that wheel can carry on turning.<br>  <br>  You have maybe lost your focus. Need to have a Goal Setting session.  This works backwards so start with what you would like to have done with your life by the time you take your last breath.  Write in down in a long list - this includes YOU, friends & family relationships.  Partnership/marriage and own family, own your own place with prize winning garden, collection of ?? stamps/antique militaria/false teeth (yes people do collect them)  but you get the picture ?  Animals would you like to own a dog etc?  Environment - what would like to have achieved for the environment before you leave this earth ?  write it down.  Your job and career - how far do you want to have gone with it - what needs to be done NOW to be able to get to this end stage in yr career?  Global - again this is where you can excel - maybe a total change of career and you go work for a major charity is what will bring back that spark in you and give you that peace you seek and fill this black void you are experiencing.  Work back from many, many years down the line in the future to present day. What needs to be done to get you exactly where you want to be in yr life?  There should be approx 8 columns the 9th being the very end one with loads of things written down. The first column will be TODAY, second will be 1 WEEK, third column 1 MONTH, then 3 MONTHS, 6 MONTHS, 1 YEAR, 5 YEARS, 10 YEARS.  Use these columns to REFOCUS your thoughts.<br>  <br>  example - if your hearts desire is to go work for a charity then start seeking out the ones closet to yr heart and research them.  Make calls and go meet people.  You will still need to work so keep your personal responsibilities in order at all times.  BUt these things can be done behind the scenes - and it can start TODAY with a simple phone call it can get this Goal Setting sheet already put in place.  This will be a work in progress and you will add bits and alter bits - but that's ok as this is YOUR own Goal Setting sheet and nothing is set in stone is it ?  You need to fill your time and surround yourself with new and interesting things.  Yes I realise it is hard when you are feeling low - believe me I've been there this is why I know the value of the Goal Setting sheet.  You need fresh direction and this will bring you back and by doing this in reverse it will highlight the first thing you need to do to achieve things.<br>  <br>  I wish you well dear Answers Friend but it is as simple as making that first call and no one else can do that for you.  You have then achieved something|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Maybe it's a spiritual void. I'm not talking about religion, but an idea that there is more to life then the material.

I was more interested in the one that brought me cheap presents but was glad I never went for his suggestions of getting together after he told me his real intentions about women.

My best advice as a fellow over thinker is simple-<br>  a. take some Time away from her- relax have some alone time..I'm wondering...do you suffer from and anxiety? Maybe your a nail-biter? (Not sure why, but you seem to have that...quality? Maybe I'm over thinking it...) Anyways- relax, relax, relax. Find a non stress place, maybe play sick for a week or so. It is flu season.<br>  <br>  b. depending if your religious, pray to your god. This always helps me, so that I feel like there is someone there ho understands.<br>  <br>  c. build your self confidence Again. Find something new for you to think on, and a person wouldn't be your best option. Maybe a new pet, ETC. I think change could help.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, fellow over thinker :)
WzKrZoHQaa	What a brave posting and very interesting too.  WELL DONE YOU FOR BEING CLEAN & SOBER ALL THIS TIME - FAB WORK GIRL STAY STRONG.<br>  <br>  Ok just because you have no Insurance doesn't mean you are not entitled to help and support.  By your Q I'm guessing you are in US and I don't know much about the system over your end of the world.  But I have found this site for you.  I have checked it out and it looks full of support and its free - yippeeeeee.    Give them a call Hun you have done SO WELL in helping yourself so far, sometimes we just get that cart wheel stuck in the mud at the bottom and need a helping hand (usually a stranger) to help us get that wheel turning full circle again.  Soon enough once it starts to turn it will be at the top again and you and your b/f will be experiencing life again.   Take as much time as you need but for the time being ask yr b/f to respect that just for now at least NO MEANS NO    Good luck Hun  :)  I wish you all the best.|`|jbE1iUiyaa	try 1-800-love-191<br>  ask for Dr. Drew and ask him about it. <br>  thats love line byt the way|`|lF65kGdyaa	It's doubtful that the rape at 15 was your first experience with sexual victimization. Although, it probably is your first coherent memory of it.<br>  <br>  Often what happens in our home is what we seek and define as love. <br>  A traumatic home life thus leads us to seeking that, as our definition of love, within those that would help to recreate the trauma (hence the previously abusive guy and undoubtedly the great sex).<br>  <br>  Now you are with a good guy you know is good and sex may actually have a traumatic context within your subconscious. Him being your "soul mate" (as you have defined him) elevates his representation of who and what he is to you in your mind. If sex is a "bad thing" somewhere in that subconscious, then having sex with him becomes a corruption and a putrid act. <br>  <br>  It will take very serious realization to adjust your mind. This is most often done through therapy with a professional, but can be done by oneself and a strong support network.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on staying clean and sober, by the way!<br>  <br>  Good luck and any further questions...<br>  ....well I'm sure you'lll figure out how to ask them.
oxriDchOaa	You're more or less stuck with the IQ you have.  You can listen to classical music, read books, eat your fruits and veggies and the whatnot but it probably won't bump your IQ by more than a few points (assuming the IQ test you took was accurate.  Free online IQ tests are definitely NOT accurate).<br>  <br>  The good news is that you don't need to raise your IQ.  IQ really doesn't indicate anything other than your ability to do IQ tests.  Sure, having a high IQ certainly helps, but it's really not necessary unless you're dead-set on being an astrophysicist.<br>  <br>  Despite what you see on internet banner ads, Paris Hilton's IQ is NOT 120.  Most online tests grossly inflate their numbers because everybody wants to be above average.  About 70% of people have an IQ between 90 and 110, which means that you're in pretty good company.  <br>  <br>  If you take the time you would have wasted trying in vain to raise your IQ and spend it learning something useful, you'll be much better off.|`|wE1PcSquaa	You can't.<br>  Your IQ is just what it is, and theres nothing you can ever<br>  do to increase it.<br>  A 15 year old for example, will have the exact same IQ when<br>  they're 45 years old.<br>  IQ is just a measure for determining your capacity to assert<br>  intelligence, and you can't increase that capacity (or decrease it).|`|LI0fWv2Vaa	have someone with a higher iq explain it to you so when you take it again you understand better why you got that wrong and hopefully choose the right answer.<br>  <br>  but really, your iq isn't based on iq test...some are even false because they base some on experience.|`|11GpqRSQaa	i'd say eat healthier, exercise and drink water before the test. <br>  <br>  And do some logical practice type things like math or some game.|`|ZAg0XAvkaa	Just try harder|`|NvrVjOhBaa	First of all, how do you know it's 102? Did you take more than one test?
42d1de7ff8420f02c887feec3a13ae5baa	i think its possible...just commit to it. College seems to be a bit of work as much as understanding. I'm sure a lot of high IQs don't have a degree, so in the end, just being a brainiac doesn't qualify you for a free degree~those who commit and work at it make it.|`|8mD0wyKMaa	Yes, it's possible for average people to get degrees.  Most people with degrees are average.  Average intelligence is not the reason people don't get degrees -- choices, goals, and life circumstances are the reasons.  People who don't need a degree to be what they want don't have to go to college, and people who don't have the money or have some personal or relationship problems also might not go to college.
eK2nRJL3aa	Honestly, this sounds like a line from a movie. Have you ever heard of the movie "What's Love Got to Do With It" based on the life of Tina Turner and her abusive ex-husband, Ike Turner? Well, there is a part in the movie where "Tina" goes to meet Ike and his male friend in a diner with her female friend and Ike orders a cake and is trying to get "Tina" to eat it and she keeps refusing. Then he keeps trying to force it into her mouth while she's still fighting with him and he finally smashes the cake onto her face. They begin tuggling and Tina tries to get up to leave and her friend tries to intervene and stop Ike and Ike hits her friend. Then at the end of the altercation, Ike tells "Tina" again to eat the cake and his male friend for the sake of "peace" says, "Tina, just eat the cake please". So, I believe this commentator may have been referring to this scene in the movie implying that Chris must have told her to "eat the cake" and she refused and so an altercation ensued. It was a lame excuse of a joke, but I don't think it was necessarily sexist.|`|9ed226ee22a85f302293fed29122bfe1aa	Use of the word a** isn't sexist.<br>  <br>  It was used as a slang term refferring to a person. I could say to my male friend "get your a** over here" and suddenly it isn't sexist?<br>  <br>  I'm afraid you've been brainwashed by feminists to believe, that in Western culture, anything reffering to women is sexist.|`|8miMWB64aa	A:  That quote doesn't even really make sense.<br>  <br>  B:  You really shouldn't see everything between a man and a woman as being between men and women.  If you can't hear someone say something like, "He should smack her up" with regards to that situation without feeling offended, it's probably time to start thinking about the problems with seeing everything in terms of gender.<br>  <br>  C:  It's probably not something you should even really care about.  People say things on the net just for kicks most of the time.
6GmtcZteaa	Take it easy . I don't think there is a problem here, as much as you would like to convince yourself there is, Which is why you jumped in front of the car and threw your friends book in a puddle. You would like to believe that you have a problem when you don't. I don't think there is a problem with you, rather I think you did those stuff so you can think there is a problem with you. If it's lack of sleep - which I don't think is the case- then sleep more often.Jumping in a pool is fine though, I did it once with my friends it was fun:). I think you're totally fine, just a little bit confused. Try being more optimistic and more positive. You don't do things like that again.:) And getting your friends respect back would be easy, if you just act right.<br>  P.s : I am going to give you a star because you hate Twilight.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	Yes well its hardly surprising is it ?  You throw yr friends work folder in a puddle for no reason and you walk infront of a car for no reason - consider that driver if he had hit you ?  You selfish B %**$$d<br>  <br>  GROW UP - don't use the PMS excuse that is a very real medical condition - you are just a stupid idiot throwing a sodding hissy fit.  I hope yr friends totally ignore you and move as far away from you as they can - you do not deseve them.  Are you in UK and between 13-19yrs old ?  Then contact these people below - really ..............!!!!!|`|wUQW5GBtaa	I jump in our pool with clothes on just about every day!  No biggie.

yW62Xm9caa	Yes it is true.Bright colours can make you feel happy and energetic and dark colours like grey and black can make you feel sad and depressed.Blue and green make you feel calm.Yellow sometimes makes you lose your temper and makes baby's cry more.Red can sometimes make you feel romance.Purple is a colour like royalty so it makes you feel luxurious.Apparently light brown makes you feel clever and dark brown is also for sadness.|`|TtMKPBR3aa	yes colors change perceptions<br>  <br>  that is why McDonalds restaurants have loud colors for you to get in and get the hell out. Expensive restaurants have soft colors to stay a while. Firetrucks are red so you see them and get out of the way|`|hccISKvHaa	Really? I thought it was green that clams you.<br>  I painted my room green for that very reason and I really think it works =)|`|cQ6UFMmyaa	This is theory, arguable by both sides. Both sides have valid evidence and research that they do and do not affect you mood. Color itself does not exist. What most people refer to as color is the reflection and absorption rate of materials. What we see is the reflection of the remaining colors of the light spectrum that are not absorbed. If there was no light on an object, there would be no color because color is the reception of the remaining parts of the light spectrum. That is why, for example, most plants are seen as green. The chlorophyll absorb most colors, only leaving greens and reds to be perceived, the rest of the spectrum is absorbed and transformed in to ATP, energy|`|lQelUqFoaa	Yes its extremely true. I am persuing a visual communications major, and they say it can change moods and invoke feelings, they used examples like a blue room calming people down, and a yellow room for people always anxious and on the go.|`|CX7o9faQaa	It is true. The fact is the more brighter colours are the more cheerful they will make you, and darker colours will make you think negatively and could make you angry or sad. Eg. Emos...they prefer black because that the way they feel: sad and depressed.|`|CssLCBdJaa	ofcourse looking at certain colors will change your mood.<br>  looking at light colours will make u fell calm...........
NrkWd4Aoaa	It appears that you at least want to "want to do" these things.<br>  This is a good start.<br>  <br>  Your communication skills are better than you think they are.  You communicated your problem very effectively.<br>  <br>  Your parents are with you now.  Learn from them. <br>  <br>  (1) ask your mom or dad to teach you how to do laundry. <br>  (2) ask your mom or dad to teach you how to make your bed.<br>  (3) learn how to make simple meals.<br>  (4) pitch in and help clean up.<br>  <br>  I used to joke about something I called "inertia poisoning, the number one crippler of young adults."  <br>  <br>  What you are talking about is very serious, but if you can find your sense of humor then life and the obstacles to a good life won't be so scary.  <br>  <br>  Another thought:  Helen Keller was deaf and blind.  This would be terrifying to most people, but  her life became an inspiration to millions.  <br>  <br>  "I am only one, still I am one. I cannot do everything, still I can do something. I will not refuse to do the something I can do."<br>  <br>  "Many persons have the wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self-gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose."<br>  <br>  Finally, I wonder if you might be experiencing a bit of Asperger's Syndrome.  Please spend some time looking into this AFTER <br>  <br>  (1)  you've gotten your laundry as far as the drier or hung up on the line, and <br>  (2) learned how to make scrambled eggs and toast and at least gotten your dirty dishes as far as the sink.<br>  <br>  Finally, finally, if you get any worthwhile answers to your question, please print them off or copy them down along with a copy of your very good question and tape them to your bathroom mirror or next to your toilet so you don't forget to keep after your goals.<br>  <br>  Ignore the jerks.|`|xiM5P5mzaa	Tell your parents you really want to live independently and that you really want to make a good future for yourself, but you have "things" hindering you... things that you can't quite put a finger on, and that you need their support in searching the right professionals to help you pinpoint where the problems are.  If you tell them in all honesty, I believe they will help you out in as many ways as you need.<br>  <br>  First thing that comes to mind is to screen for learning disabilities.  These are easily dismissed as non-important if they're not very prominent... but all who have slight or overlooked learning disabilities will tell you otherwise-- that it is important to them and their quality of life!  I don't know what kinds of specialists screen for these, but your family doctor could recommend you.<br>  <br>  Second thing that you may need to do is to find the reasons behind your phobias.  A counselor (psychological) may help you with that.  He or she can also help you with your communications skills.  We are not born with them; we learn, practise, and master them... all of us.  Some have had better teachers and some had to learn it themselves.  But, it's learnable.  Ask for information and get practising.<br>  <br>  And the third thing is to look deep into your soul, where YOU are at your core.  Do you like yourself?  Were you a planned pregnancy?  Was your mom overwhealmed with the thought of birthing you, i.e., the pain or the responsibility, that growing up made you anxious everytime you thought about leaving her?  (Subconsciously, from your having received her nervous vibes in utero, connected to the thought of you leaving her (in bodily form).)  What did people tell you or say about you as a young child... that were so not true, but that you believed anyway, being so young?  A trained spiritual counselor can help you with this.<br>  <br>  Finally, take some responsibility and learn how to do a few things for youself.  Have people teach you.  We are all lazy at some point.. I am, but we should find ways to overcome it.  I do it by making lists of things I should do but don't feel like doing.  Then I force myself to do one, check it off, be proud of myself, then go on to do the next thing.  I usually start with the easiest job and move on to harder jobs.  When I finish the list, I treat myself with a snack I like.  It's like training myself.  It works; you should try it.<br>  <br>  And finally, finally, don't be too hard on yourself.  You clearlyl don't want to be this way and you're asking for help.  That's the right thing to do.  There must be a problem somewhere and when you know what it is, then you can take steps to change them.  The worst thing is not knowing what keeps you from living normally.  But, once you can see the problem, you can fix it.  Or, if you will, once you know your enemy by name, you can fight it!<br>  <br>  Good luck, talk to your parents, and get better!|`|3ClXJavvaa	Honestly, go to a professional.<br>  You have some real codependent issues and need to get it sorted out.<br>  A professional will know exactly how to handle the situation and help you get better and maybe even happier with the life you lead.<br>  Good luck!|`|f61TFB6taa	Laziness will make you a worthless pile of human scum.

This is treatable.|`|cd444ad7205162c19a3662445956ed32aa	I understand your situation very well.As a child I was told that I wasn,t good enough on many occasions. I don,t think its mental illness but a disturbed form of game play that some adults use to justify their belief systems against their children. This causes so much harm to children and fills them with self doubt which is difficult to shake off even when you are grown up.    .|`|BNxyN2NWaa	Yes , this is a neurosis . A neurosis is a mental disorder that deny's or distorts reality . This one is very akin to paranoia. It is very hard to deal with and professional help is needed .

She may not have got this as a child and craves it all the time.|`|082c52d49d24cf249ff2b1bcab72a8f7aa	I agree with GC about the confidence thing, though in cases where people apparently strive for attention, they rebuke it once they get it... compulsively lying to an extent where everyone feels they have to agree with what's said.  It's an appalling situation .. the lie is lived and built upon continuously ... some people build big egos and are successful and popular that way, others just eat themselves away ... Its going to take a wake up call to snap anyone out of that sort of circumstance before they destroy other lives as well as their own.  If they have no concern for their own quality of life, they should at least realise they are pulling others under with them. ***** footing isn't the answer, the circle would just continue.|`|nYRkAmdtaa	Paranoia / persecution complex / there are aspects of isolation / rejection possibly , it is complex as the marriage with the father may be putting her under pressure or she may feel insecure in the marriage or neglected . First approach her and do not enter into an argument with her but discuss it with other members of the family and have a witness there if you approach her , advise her to seek professional help as you are emotionaly involved and so it is difficult for you . Any third party involvement in her life who have suggested to her anything or pressured her , lot of it about .  good luck . deal with similar in my own family . EDIT - you are probably not getting through to her as she is in a state of tension or trauma .|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	This is called a schizophrenia and they hear voices that tell them things, what to do etc. This is treatable and can be dangerous.

rIhl7yh6aa	Im guessing you spoke directly to the guy. At first I'd be very curious as to why all of sudden you are calling and being so up front, but if I still liked you I'd be pretty psyched. It depends whether the guy likes the girl taking a initiative or not, I'd say the majority of guys would be very flattered especially if they still liked you. I don't think he will care at all how you got his number, he may ask but I don't think he would be freaked out. Hopefully you eased expressing your feelings because it would be completely out of the blue and he will wonder why you are telling him this now.|`|NbDhNrVUaa	It can't hurt to try. <br>  <br>  Honestly, if you don't call you'll never know. Your answer will be a decided "No Chance". <br>  <br>  If you put yourself out there, you have the chance that he will want to hook up and the chance that he is already with someone. And if he says No flat out, what did you really lose? Nothing, you get to move on without that nagging curiosity!<br>  <br>  If you wait, he might get with some other girl and trust me, it's happened to me, then you will both be in unhappy situations. Haven't you seen My Best Friends Wedding? ;)<br>  <br>  He'll be flattered regardless of his answer. <br>  Good Luck|`|LrsSKxWmaa	that'd def. be flattering considering I just found out someone that I cared for felt the same way, so much so that they sought out my phone number to tell me. Why be freaked if I'm getting the result that I wanted?|`|6GmtcZteaa	First I'd be happy she called me I mean if I liked her all along I wouldn't care who gave her my number lol as long as she called me. I'd probably be more intersted in why she hasnt told me sher liked me along !! But I think thats besides the point, do that call him and find out. I'm sure his last concerns would be where he got your number from. sO just try. good luck !|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Young mind only knows.
AA11199881	I think you will find most of those personal goals are made in the heat of a moment for example the A's normally follow a bad grade or report..the weight loss thing we tend to go the whole hog on weight loss setting ourselves up for failure.<br>  <br>  Instead of a slow and steady approach to weigh loss we dive in starve ourselves of all delights and then fall off the wagon. Same with smokers they throw the packet out then crave the smokes. Instead of reducing the number of smokes per day or identifying triggers when they smoke (drinking, after meals, before bed, when they wake up) or reducing the mg of nicotine until they don't want to smoke anymore.<br>  <br>  Alot of it too has to do with self discipline as well, you have to have the drive and the motivation to suceed in what you want to do and be organized.<br>  <br>  Being armed with information and realistic goals is a good start for any person to acheive their nominated goals so if you get a C in science work toward uping the grade to c+ or a B little steps in the end work towards the one big step that you need to change what you would like.|`|34VfDyuyaa	well, for starters, maybe we're just too lazy..lazy is always the enemy of success.<br>  <br>  improve?<br>  well, i have read once that what one thinks, is what one gets.<br>  so try this:<br>  step1 : ask<br>  step2: believe<br>  step3: receive<br>  <br>  ask, start your sentence with "i want..."<br>  believe, believe that you will soon get what you asked for<br>  receive, make sure that whatever you have asked for will make you happy, so try or make sure that you will be so so super happy if you will be getting what you asked.<br>  <br>  remember, you're talking to the universe.<br>  <br>  whatever you think about, will happen to you.<br>  so make sure you think about good stuffs.<br>  <br>  try it, you won't lose anything.|`|xBDMqCL1aa	The satisfaction comes from actually even getting off our lazy bums and achieving what little we actually can of it.

In fact, I think they are intertwined.|`|8miMWB64aa	How are those two things different?<br>  <br>  Needing and wanting are the same thing with different takes, like a glass being half empty or half full.<br>  <br>  Like, let's take a something we can all agree upon as being a basic need: food.  When we say we "need" food, don't we just mean that we really, really want food, because not having it would make us extremely unhappy (and then dead)?<br>  <br>  If you "need" someone, you just want them really badly, for whatever reasons.  So the question here really is.. do you want someone to want you, or to realllyy want you?<br>  <br>  Note:  If I had to guess what you may've meant, I guess you're asking:  "Would you rather someone be with you because they want to out of love or because they want to for other reasons, such as finicial?"  In that case, I think most people would choose the primer option, since most people want love in their relationships, and the first directly implies it.

WzKrZoHQaa	You need to work out why you are angry in the first place otherwise it will just fester and come out in other ways even years down the line.  Try this great site - it will point you in right direction.  Good posting by the way.  Good luck :)|`|lF65kGdyaa	This is a tough one. I had issues with anger for a long time. first and foremost thing you can do is breath in and out when you feel it coming on. Exhale that anger and breath in the peace and calm.<br>  <br>  Next, look for triggers. <br>  <br>  What makes you angry? <br>  What ALWAYS makes you angry? <br>  Is it rational? <br>  Where does it stem from (in the past)?<br>  <br>  You have to ask a lot of questions to yourself and be ready for some uncomfortable answers, maybe. In time you'll mellow out, but you have to WANT TO .<br>  <br>  Try to stay positive (in your mind) and know that there are actually unseen forces that are trying to keep you in this unhealthy state.<br>  <br>  Always remember that you can beat them, and the things that are actually TRYING to piss you off.<br>  <br>  They are weak, BUT you are aware that you have a problem.<br>  THAT alone is the awareness and strength that you need to overcome the problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	That is a very good question and you are not alone in asking that question.<br>  <br>  For most people (and I speak from experience), it is a lot of work to change the way you react.  You have trained yourself to react the way you react and you have to untrain yourself (during your life there were benefits to doing things the way you do and so you learned to do things that way, but now you have to reign it in, relearn your reactions).<br>  <br>  Keeping it as brief as possible, there are likely two major things that you need to work on.<br>  <br>  There is the WHY you get angry, and the is the HOW you act when angry.<br>  <br>  If you want to control your anger, you need to work on the why (find ways of looking at things that doesn't lead to becoming angry; explain situations to yourself in a way that doesn't lead to anger), and you need to control the how (you need to work on how you let the anger show; try humor or sarcasm instead of anger maybe).<br>  <br>  It won't happen overnight.<br>  <br>  Anger is a normal emotion and serves a purpose.  But if it is excessive in occurrence or how you show it, clearly you need to change and may need someone to help you.  It is very dfficult to do on your own.<br>  <br>  I have a stupid thing I do that helps me, just to give a real example.  When I start to stress on things and feel myself going towards anger, I just say "relax" (in a relaxing way) and kind of push with both of my hands forward like I am pushing the crap away from me, and it helps ME.  I am not saying this would work for you, I am just putting it out there to show a way that how you react can be changed,  <br>  <br>  good luck with it.  anger can be very destructive if you let it rule you.|`|IyEJfHGSaa	When u start to get angry..

I wonder whether maybe you might have felt unloved or over looked as a child. <br>  Start avoiding situations where you can meet these men, just stick with your girlfriends, don't meet people from the internet. Just try and enjoy yourself without these men who end up making you feel worse.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I think you will be able to change this cycle. x|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Well if you grow out of it is really up to your willpower. You know that those guys you sleep with don't really respect you as a person, they do this because they find you physically attractive. Ask yourself if this is all you want from your life and from a relationship with a man.. you can have several bed partners but you can't have more than one soulmate and life partner.. a guy who treats you with respect, honesty and trust.. and if you love him, you will return those feelings.. respect, honesty and trustworthyness.. that means of course (not sleeping around with other men once you find the one for you) those guys like to have a casual relationship with you.. they may even take you to the cinema or treat you to a drink in a bar.. but all with just one thing in their mind..  to get you to have sex with them.. Also bear in mind that for everyone who has multiple sex partners.. (everyone) the risk of contracting a Sexually transmitted disease or even HIV rises drastically.. because you don't know how many other casual sex partners those guys have, you run the risk of getting HIV.. so unless a condom is used every time and even that is not always reliable, you are living a dangerous life...those guys show you love and affection only to get you into bed.. if that was genuine love.. you would be in a lasting relationship with one of those guys and that would be enough for you to get love and affection from one man.. Those others of course act a bit romantic to get you to sleep with them..  foreplay not excluded.. but they don't love you, they don't respect you and if you got pregnant, which I am sure you take precautions against.. but it could still happen you would have a hard time proving who the dad is if you have a lot of guys who could be the potential father and they can refuse a paternity test .. especially if they find out that they are by far not the only guy you slept with.. so bear that in mind and just think of what could happen.. STD on it's own is not nice to have even if you never get HIV. Don't you believe you owe it to yourself to find your self respect, and say to yourself '' I only want to be loved for myself, for the person I am, for what I have to offer to a guy, i am more than someone to take to bed, I have feelings and I want to be loved for myself, i want to fall in love with a man who respects me, whom I can trust and who has real and genuine feelings of love for me'' so start believing you are worth more than a casual fling with many men...The world is not fair.. some people will find out and in some peoples opinion you will be considered a person with no morals..I am sure you are doing this to find love and affection and because you crave real love and affection, but to sleep with a mulittude of different guys is not going to help you find that one guy who respects you and loves you for the person you are and who looks deeper and sees you don't just have a body to offer but a nice personality and a character that is caring and loving.. so let those losers go.. They want casual sex.. you have to say that you are worth more than that... worth a proper relationship where you can find a guy who is going to be your lover but also your best friend and soulmate.. you have to look outside those guys you are having casual sex with and the sooner, the better for you.. because it's an illusion that they give you genuine love and affection.. they have a movtive behind doing that.. to bed you.. and if you got pregnant.. thy would do nothing and you coulnd't force 5 or 6 guys to do a paternity test.. then you would come across as promiscuous.. you could do that if in doubt between two guys..  and would still need them to agree to take this test.. and think about STD.. and that real love cannot be found just by having sex with lots of guys.. so you need more self esteem and tell yourself you are worth better than that and stop this lifestyle.. because you want real love.. and you are not going to find it amongst that kind of guys who only look for casual sex and a casual relationship.. if the chips were down.. each one of them would abandon you.. so they aren't worth it.. you can do better.. Try to be a one man woman..'' for your own self respect and for the sake of finding real love that way...x|`|cQ6UFMmyaa	The first step is admitting you have the problem.

Some common themes of fears could be abandonment, betrayal, loss of control, etc. For example: they say when someone dreams of losing their teeth/tooth, it's a fear of losing control in some aspect of their life.

rJ8kLGgkaa	Nobody can intrepret your dream for you, because the dream doesn't stand by itself.  Dreams usualy reflect and amplify something that is going on in your life.  <br>  <br>  Whenever you wake up after a dream, be sure to remember the feelings you had.  For example, you might feel disoriented and confused to see the moon in the house and the clouds high up.  If you think about your life recently, you might have things going on that don't make sense.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you may be filled with a sense of amazement and wonder that something as beautiful as the moon is inside your family home, and the clouds being high might give you a feeling of spaciousness.

Since your moon in your dream is close to you in your dream, whatever you were thinking about right before falling a sleep you feel strongly for. with your sky being really high up, the often used term of "the sky is the limit" , may be in play. Meaning you have more space to prevent you from reaching your limit. So whatever you felt strongly about, its most likely true.<br>  <br>  Sorry if it seems...confusing.

4fc129ccfffdb16cb2d28a6fe0c55cdeaa	As attractive as this world may sound, I personally wouldn't like to live in a world without men.I mean what would happen to that illusion called love or at least attraction? Not everybody is into women and I would certainly wouldn't want to get pleasure from a vibrator all my life :)) Plus, they can be useful once in a while with really heavy chores that rely on physical power and endurance [not many girls would feel good about being a 'macho woman']<br>   <br>  Don't get me wrong, I'm not taking their side, but I think women are perfectly capable of violent crimes, some form of rape and organizing a war if it's in their interest. I'm certain there are a lot of 'evil' and ambitious [in a bad way] women in the world that could hurt people and the environment simply because of their strong emotions and impulses.<br>  <br>  Also, there aren't many women inventors, scientists and writers mainly because they didn't have enough freedom and means to study, so anybody don't start any crap about women not being capable to think, discover and invent.<br>  <br>  Also, never let guys 'fix' things -most suck at it :P|`|A71Uu05Uaa	Wait, who'd do the work though?

What about the millions of male inventors, scientists, mathmeticians, revoulotionary thinkers, 4 breeds that females find it difficult to produce. Sure males produce most if not all of the murderers, but we also produce most if not all of the geniuses. (when I say scientist I'm not talking lab worker, I mean someone who can think - Einstein, Newton, etc. The next breakthrough won't come from lab equipment, it will come from someones mind.)<br>  <br>  Oh and for the record there would still be war. Women are just as power hungry as men, and you're forgetting the one thing men don't do that women do: jealousy, bitching about each other, a group of men get on infinitely better than a group of women. There would still be violent crime. Women are almost as violent as men, and this gap seems to disappear when alchohol is involved.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	No.  I love the men in my immediate family and I know and am fond of many men in my circle of friends and relatives.  There are some men I don't like, it's true.  Just as there are some women I don't like.<br>  I don't like war, violent crime, rape (how do we accuse only men of environmental damage?).  I do know a couple of child molesters and one rapist - enough to avoid them like the plague.  I have the misfortune to know quite a few fathers who are extremely neglectful of their duties.  <br>  But my world would be very much poorer without men.  Certainly I would step in front of a bullet for my husband and sons - they, together with my daughters have given me love, devotion and my whole life is centred around them.|`|eBMKmgCjaa	When people first heard about the nazi 'final solution to the Jewish problem' nobody took it seriously either.

lF65kGdyaa	The holes, from which the light radiates from, are located in what might be defined as a squalid or unseemly place. <br>  Your actual bathroom may very well be a model of cleanliness, but it is what the bathroom represents that is key. <br>  <br>  The light also does not come from outside, but from some places deep within your home. Are the rooms into which they lead, dark rooms?<br>  The home represents your mind, yourself. <br>  <br>  The holes have been kicked out, or forced. <br>  Something within you (possibly something from very far in your past) wants to "come out" or be brought to the surface. In doing so, it will radiate some light on issues you may be facing now.<br>  <br>  You probably have some issues with your mother as well. Since you convey a seemingly stern reluctance to her generous offer of hospitality. <br>  It could also mean that you simply do not want to become like her, or take residence in HER HOME (mind, or her frame of mind).<br>  <br>  The mansion, again, is an aspect of you, but a projection or perception of what you desire to be, or the frame of MIND where you desire to reside within. Your IDEAL. However, it being a "weekend" only residence, it is not a frame of mind you may find yourself within very often.<br>  <br>  Animals are frequently alerted to those things, we ourselves, are not. <br>  The severity of their behavior is indicative of the severity of what they are trying to TELL YOU about YOU and the surroundings of this home.<br>  <br>   For even though you have left the comfort of your daily residence to escape what it is trying to tell you, you have CHOSEN to take residence in a much larger and possibly colder and certainly darker, scarier place. Thus thrusting yourself to meet with the issue at hand. <br>  <br>  The "spooky" farmhouse, the darkening pines and dirt road, the mysterious driving demon (desire of some kind?) and finally old man, are all components of some dark and scary place deep within the recesses of your mind. <br>  A forgotten memory, that may be buried for your own safety and peace of mind. <br>  <br>  However, the mind is not reliable when it comes to burying the past. <br>  <br>  The farmer with the five red spots could represent 5 people, but it is more likely that he shows you the towel to alert you to FIVE senses, which are all unified in communicating something to you, as is everything else in your dream.<br>  The five senses that are in YOUR blood.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this gives some clarity and eventually, some peace of mind.<br>  Sleep well and sleep in safety.|`|svfBYHFfaa	CHANGE LOCATION WHERE YOU SLEEP GET OUT OF THAT BEDROOM OF YOURS there might be some unexplainable phenomena going on there
Et011ogJaa	You have to change the way you think.  Be aware of your thoughts and replace the negative ones with good true thoughts. It is hard work but it is worth it.  You bring into your life what you think and feel about it.  It is okay to be prepared for the worst...but always hope for the best and be grateful for whatever happens.  Life is here to teach us to become a better person. I struggle with negative thoughts and find that I complain too much. I get sick of hearing myself being such an ingrate. I challenge myself daily to only let kind words come out of my mouth. I have to post positive words around my house to remind me to stay positive. I wish you the best.  One movie/documentary that helped motivate me to be more positive was The Secret.

Just because everything is seemingly perfect, as you would define perfect, doesn't mean there is not something wrong with you that you have to deal with.  <br>  <br>  OK, first rule: don't beat yourself up over it!  If you grew up with the idea that surviving life is the thought of the day, and the only thought of the day, you don't know how to act differently.  Some people may call it being a brat, but I would say that you have some issues you have to deal with from your childhood.  <br>  <br>  You might have feelings of guilt piled on to whatever you carried into your relationship, because you are asking yourself, why can't you just be happy and content?  The only way you will find the answers you are looking for is either a) you start talking to your partner openly and honestly about everything that you went through as a child (free therapy) or b) find a therapist to "download" on.  In either case, it won't get better if you don't deal with it, so before it affects your life in a very negative way, get tot he bottom of it.  Check with you doctor for a referral if you want to talk to a therapist, and check with your health insurance provider - most will provide up to 6 sessions per year for you to talk to someone.  Good luck.|`|Rn9AEpjeaa	I'm the exact same way. I think it has to do with anxiety.

WzKrZoHQaa	Many organisations undertake psychological or psychosymetric testing as a matter of course these days.  Police, Govt, All the Armed Forces and that is just to get into the Forces.  It is a way of judging whether you can work things out.  Some seem simple and many seem to fly through the tests but it is a way to test ability and reaction.<br>  <br>  PSYCHOLOGICAL tests aren’t magic, so let’s get that clear right at the beginning. They assess and evaluate information that you give to the examiner, which is why the formal name of psychological testing is psychological assessment. You give this information either in the form of answers to interview questions or as answers on paper—or on a computer—to specific questions. Ultimately, a test’s accuracy depends on how carefully and seriously you answer the questions you’re asked. <br>  <br>  Psychological tests fall into several categories: <br>  <br>  Achievement and aptitude tests are usually seen in educational or employment settings, and they attempt to measure either how much you know about a certain topic (i.e., your achieved knowledge), such as mathematics or spelling, or how much of a capacity you have (i.e., your aptitude) to master material in a particular area, such as mechanical relationships.  <br>  <br>  Intelligence tests attempt to measure your intelligence—that is, your basic ability to understand the world around you, assimilate its functioning, and apply this knowledge to enhance the quality of your life. Or, as Alfred Whitehead said about intelligence, “it enables the individual to profit by error without being slaughtered by it.<br>  Intelligence, therefore, is a measure of a potential, not a measure of what you’ve learned (as in an achievement test), and so it is supposed to be independent of culture. The challenge is to design a test that can actually be culture-free; most intelligence tests fail in this area to some extent for one reason or another.<br>  <br>  Neuropsychological tests attempt to measure deficits in cognitive functioning (i.e., your ability to think, speak, reason, etc.) that may result from some sort of brain damage, such as a stroke or a brain injury. <br>  <br>  Occupational tests attempt to match your interests with the interests of persons in known careers. The logic here is that if the things that interest you in life match up with, say, the things that interest most school teachers, then you might make a good school teacher yourself. <br>  <br>  Personality tests attempt to measure your basic personality style and are most used in research or forensic settings to help with clinical diagnoses. Two of the most well-known personality tests are<br>  ?  the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), or the revised MMPI-2, composed of several hundred “yes or no” questions, and   the Rorschach (the “inkblot test”), composed of several cards of inkblots—you simply give a description of the images and feelings you experience in looking at the blots.<br>    <br>  Specific clinical tests attempt to measure specific clinical matters, such as your current level of anxiety or depression.<br>  <br>  Hope this link below helps - you can even take free tests online - so by doing so you will have MORE evidence for your coursework and yr tutor will hopefully be suitably impressed.<br>  <br>  I wish you well Hun  :)|`|AA11707728	In a nutshell, psych testing provides objectivity but risks losing validity.|`|Zx8dDBY8aa	Advantages of psych test is a good prediction of what would happen if someone was in this situation. Obvious advantage would be it answers questions about the mind. It also open doors to new possibilities to answer other questions. A disadvantage would be psych testing is hard to control. How much restriction is too much restriction when you're doing the test? Nuisance variables or confounding variables could get in the way of collecting the right data. The data also needs to be interpreted correctly to answer your hypothesis.<br>  <br>  Edit: psych tests needs to be valid, reliable, and consistent.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	I like how you called us your Yahoo Answers family.

WzKrZoHQaa	Well as he has asked for his family to be present I would concentrate on his wife - after all if he works too hard then maybe she has a hard time at home with children etc?  Ask her what she does when she's not going out for lunch on a Sunday with people from her husbands office ?????   If she says she is a housewife don't do the usual "oh" and then completely ignore her for rest of rhe meal.  This gives her open floor to talk about her day to day life and you can come back with "oh how interesting" and then pick up snip its from there.  What does she do when the kids are in school, does she have clubs etc to keep her busy.  Keep good eye contact and just develop the conversation from there.  Do they have a holiday booked this year, is this a new destination for them?  What do the children do, do they have after school clubs (do thay have any medals etc)  What is their best subject ?

Be willing to talk about the food, restaurant or homemade.<br>  <br>  Liberal professors and activists are supposed to be sensitive to other people's feelings and needs.<br>  <br>  So, your father's ego and psychological problems, if any, regarding his dislike for conservative materialistic business types, ought be kept on a leash by his own awareness that if he talks in a literally disgusting manner at a dinner to which he was invited, he kicks his own daughter's progress.<br>  <br>  So, imho either you directly tell your dad to keep it light and/or toward the accomodating/conservative side (he's not going to make much voter-change), or you trust that your dad has authentic liberal sensitivity towards you which trumps any tendencies toward upsetting conversation.<br>  <br>  On the constructive side:  as a former engineer, science is both materialistic and gee-whiz, linked with computer techies.  So, geek heaven, if your dad can manage tolerance and civility.<br>  <br>  Obviously, that leaves wife and kids vis a vis liberal activism.  Kids don't really factor in, as even liberals are smart enough not to lecture 10-year-olds, unless the libs are in classrooms or entertainment.<br>  <br>  Why should wife fear you as a rival?  That's a point which may need to be diffused, as your age is a factor.  So do side with her being as somewhat a mother or an older sister.  (If she's anything but supportive of husband as great provider and breadwinner, a shocker.)  Even if so, at that juncture, don't stroke her liberal fantasies, support her husband/your boss' more practical business perspective.  After all, even a political activist should have nothing special against an honest, hard-working entrepreneur, except regarding their limited political caring with disdain.<br>  <br>  Obviously, everyone's talking about the banksters, the liberal idiots who pushed Fannie & Freddie into bad, politically correct but economically stupid loans, etc.  Risky business to take any stand there, eh?  Probably making intelligent sounds about how dreadful things are getting, without assigning blame, is less risky.<br>  <br>  Bottom line:  if you're a good, productive worker, that's the asset which is most significant for your working relationship.<br>  <br>  Cheers.

Hence the 50% divorce rate. <br>  <br>  The truth is, men make lousy women, and women make lousy men, so what does feminism insist that we swap roles, when that makes us both miserable?
IstwJtBraa	Keep procrastinating.  It will come to a point where you will have to cram because of not much time left.  It all works out in the end!|`|N4JUrdbsaa	Well, for starters, you have to understand that this all comes down to you. We can beg and plead and order you to do this and that, but in the end, it's up to you to actually do it.<br>  <br>  Instruct some self-discipline by saying "I will do ____" and then doing it while thinking/saying it. Trust me, it helps when you have the idea in your head. Maybe start off with something simple, so that when you feel that sense of accomplishment, then you can be more eager to work on your necessary script.<br>  <br>  If this fails, get someone else to force you to do your work, and if bad comes to worse, then give yourself/have them give you punishment. Unplug your computer, followed by tv, or phone, or game system, or anything. You get the idea...you need to be tough on yourself if you can't do the work with a gentle nudge.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|Ys2ysG6Uaa	Iv found with essay writing, for example, ill give myself a time limit. This time limit can be to complete small steps like paragraphs, up to dates to complete the essay- all drafts.<br>  <br>  Eg, ill spend the afternoon completing 3 or 4 paragraphs of an essay, with mini breaks to keep me going- it has to be done, and no one else is going to do it, and the faster its done... <br>  <br>  In fact im on a break now, i have to finish my last essay for a summer course this arvo, and as soon as im done here ill get straight back into it

Write her a short letter and tel her how this is making you feel too.  Tell her you will go sit in reception and wait for her until she has spoken to Dr but she needs to be seen again and she needs to be honest with Dr.  If you are in UK then PLEASE if you are both between 13-19yrs old they will help you big time they are fabulous for support of the young.

HDgvOJyLaa	Have you been naughty lately? LoL j/k. <br>  From what I've been told years back, by my parents about dreaming about snake(s) is that it means curse or some sort. <br>  <br>  Are you getting alone with any of your friends? family? work? any issues with them? If so, then be careful. Something you may want to avoid. <br>  It will fire back at you that's all so, be careful and avoid any conflicts or whatever that your dealing with....!|`|svfBYHFfaa	thats a good omen YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY COMIN YER WAY GRABBIT N LET IT BYTE YOU and you will awaken rewarded|`|AA10438590	I think Morgan's answer is very much on point and I think in addition to that this is actually a good dream:<br>  <br>  In your dream you replayed the moment right before you were bitten. I think you know that there are some problems around you that are growing. You have tried to take the high road (climbing up on chairs and benches). Now you realize you want to face these problems head on before they get bigger. You are worried when you do you might get "hurt". But you also know that by looking at the problems again, and facing them head on with your self-protection in mind you can avoid "being bitten". <br>  <br>  Hope that helps~!|`|V5cxTgdfaa	"To see a snake or be bitten by one in your dream, signifies hidden fears and worries that are threatening you. Your dream may be alerting you to something in your waking life that you are not aware of or that has not yet surfaced. Alternatively, the snake may be seen as phallic and thus symbolize temptation, dangerous and forbidden sexuality. If you are afraid of the snake, then it signifies your fears of sex, intimacy or commitment. The snake may also refer to a person around you who is callous, ruthless, and can't be trusted. As a positive symbol, snakes represent healing, transformation, knowledge and wisdom. It is indicative of self-renewal and positive changes."|`|7IjGzvqTaa	This is probably going to sound fairly pessimistic, but...<br>  <br>  ...the odds of this dream actually meaning anything are slim.<br>  <br>  When you go to sleep, your brain uses this time to consolidate information that you've gathered throughout the day.  This is why you often dream about something you've either seen, talked about, or thought about a lot that day.  Sometimes it doesn't even have to be repeated; certain things that were mentioned once in passing can pop up in your dreams, too.  When your brain is sorting through this information while you sleep so that it can be "filed," you usually dream about it and a story is created around it in your mind.<br>  <br>  Another explanation that scientists are studying is the way that dreams prepare you for the world at large.  It has been theorized that when you dream, your brain is essentially running through that scenario and you're practicing your reaction.  For example, there have been cases of people who have helped out in emergency situations that felt as though they had "done it all before," despite it being the first emergency they had helped out with.  Most who experience this recall having several emergency-themed dreams.  Because they had "practiced" in their sleep, so to speak, they didn't have to stop and think about what to do next in the real world.  This also often contributes to the feeling of deja vu.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps, after seeing, hearing, or thinking about snakes in the past day, your brain is running situations on how to handle a snake attack?  Granted, this is a very scientific way to look at things;  if you're actually searching for a philosophical meaning to your dream, you may have to look pretty hard to find one that's believable.  Keep in mind that even if that were the case, dreams can only tell us things we already know, even if they're simply clarifying it for us.|`|BY5gnSMgaa	Thats i toughie, I think what your dream is expressing is that you kept on putting off taking care of your problems, so they got bigger, and bigger. Once they were way out of proportion, you tryed to handle them and failed. Its deffinatly a fear dream.
rJ8kLGgkaa	Dreams amplify your feelings about things that are going on in your life, so it is important to remember the feelings you had at different points in the dream.  Because the dream reflects :*your* life, nobody can really interpret a dream for you.  <br>  <br>  As some examples to get you started, you might think about feelings of isolation from all but a few close friends (the zombies vs the animals), people creating obstacles who you expected to be helpful (the airline attendant), feelings like you are making a mess of things (the gel section), etc.  <br>  <br>  Remember that the dream is reflecting your attitude towards things, not reality.  In real life, the people you dream as zombies may really care about you, but somehow you aren't open to it. Again, the dream is showing how you feel, not reality.<br>  <br>  You said the dream shows you like a lion, and that you feel powerful and unstoppable since the dream.  This sounds like you have a feeling that you can overcome the obstacles in your life.  This is a good sign.  But remember that you can feel (and be) powerful and self assured, but also gentle and open hearted.  If you forget the last part, the zombies will get you!

1hvrQYWiaa	Can't see Mugabe officially adopting an 'imperialist' currency - the soldiers are getting $US to keep them loyal. Nothing will change for the better in Zimbabwe until Mugabe dies or is removed by force. Anyway, $US isn't really strong/stable enough anymore - makes more sense to adopt the Euro if you're looking around for a new currency. However, this would be even more unlikely in Mugabe's Zimbabwe;as the Euro is a European currency, it's obviously racist and colonialist.|`|2FT7sVkbaa	Too many people make the mistake to making Zimbabwe's economy similar to the U.S. economy, there are BIG differences, they don't have the wealth and resources to back up their currency, no aircraft factories, no farms, no gold reserves, no bridges and super highways, no coal and gas reserves, ect,
LivqhqSoaa	to feel suicidal often indicates long-term stressful situations from which you see no end or escape.  Maybe you feel as though you have no options.  If this describes you, then perhaps counseling and medication can resolve the problem.  medication to help replace used up brain chemicals that are necessary to maintain normal feelings.   on the other hand, if you have no precipitating events or if depression is not the problem, then you may have more serious condition and it would be really good to see a professional very soon and tell him/her about these fantasies and suicide attempts before you really do kill yourself.  Life is GREAT. and if you aren't experiencing joy in your life, something is very wrong.  It CAN be corrected, but you have to take action and immediately.  There are millions of options available to you, and most of them will lead you to a more pleasant experience of life. But you must take charge and do something positive about it NOW!  I wish you the best of luck.  You are precious, and deserve to be happy. and it CAN be attained.|`|G9VBTg47aa	I would say try to escape the city and live like a monk and practise meditation.

15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	"Do they think they are easy targets?"  Yes.  They sense they can be.  "What are the signs of a man who is likely to do this?"  Men are predators, on the hunt.  Watch out for men that are pushy and manipulative.  These will push a gal beyond the bounds of what is appropriate.  Watch out for moves that set off alarm bells.  "Come outside with me." "Come to my place." "You don't  have to think like that."  "Trust me."  "Do they feel more confident with those women? Does it make them feel dominant? And in control?" Yes. Again, Yes.  "Does shyness accentuate a woman's femininity in the traditional sense?"  Yes, I think it does.  It can be a nice, attractive quality, and not always for the wrong reasons.  I find quiet, shy ladies intriguing, like a mystery to solve, and I want to get to know them.  They are like a garden to explore.|`|S2ZccVFAaa	They're not men enough to get a woman any other way so they go for women who flock to them, worship them, and put them on a pedestal. It makes them feel better about themselves.    Yes to feeling more confident, yes to making them feel superior and dominant.     A real man does not take advantage of any woman. He doesn't have to. If you're used to having these types of men find one who loves you and cherishes you.|`|1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	So, I take it you are a "shy quiet woman" who has recently, or perhaps habitually, experienced men who have "taken advantage" of you?    First of all, let's not generalize.  Not ALL men do this.  And even the good ones won't always live up to a woman's expectations.  And if the woman (for lack of a better way of expressing it) chooses to play the victim role, every man (good and bad) can be labeled a villain.      Secondly, men and women who choose not to assert their own worth can and often are taken advantage of by ppl.  Sometimes you have to say "No" before another person knows they are crossing a personal boundary.  If you aren't willing to express that a particular behavior isn't okay with you, others may believe you are okay with being treated that way.      Remember....  There is a way to be feminine and "lady-like" and still not be a victim.  You just have to value your self more than you value the opinions of someone who may take advantage of you.    Be strong and be well.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Take advantage? Like anyone is truly selfless? I take advantage of everyone around me, but at least I'm transparent about it, instead of living in this dream world where prince charming has no desires except to make his woman happy. Quiet women can be good looking, smart, funny etc. What makes you so afraid for them? If a woman doesn't want to be intimate and the man isn't willing to pin her down then why can't the woman just say no. What's so incredibly hard about that?    We get taught early on that it's convenient and safe (socially) to play the victim role whenever we want to. We get drunk on it. It's SO easy to want to be a victim because then it's not your fault. Well, guess what. We have never chosen anything but we ARE wholly responsible.     I'm sorry your question just reminds me of someone.|`|tKWwZpOAaa	generalize much?|`|BkleL3F4aa	I would never do that. Report to my in box missy.
vy8SRHxlaa	because feminism in 2009 is nowhere near as relevant is it was in 1969 and especially in 1909. Sure things like pay rates and many issues like that SHOULD be resolved. My problem is that it has now made it OK for women to belittle men, and men just have to put up with it. Sexism isn't just something men do to women, that is something many feminists seem to forget.<br>  <br>  for the record, I do not believe feminists are lesbian. Nor am I against feminist ideology, I just hate what in todays society it achieves.|`|AA11809403	i don't know if it is most men who believe that, but it sure is a lot of them.  <br>  <br>  there was a time when many guys would accuse a woman of being a lesbian if she did not want to date them, or if she refused to have sex with them.<br>  <br>  My best guess as to the situation NOW is that guys say these things in the hope of scaring girls/women who can still be intimidated - who worry a lot about attracting boys - in other words, younger teenage girls.<br>  <br>  it would be nice to have a sociological discussion of the possible causes without the trolls being so eager to contribute.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	I don't believe all feminists are rug munchers, and I think "most men" (a lie right there by you) don't believe that either. However, many will make this suggestion in mockery... it's tongue in cheek. However, 60s & 70s feminism actively DID promote lesbianism - what's that famous quote: "Feminism is the therory, lesbianism is the practice"?|`|C7yjMBuqaa	That "stereotype" is based on the fact that, not only do the feminist movement have a strong history of man-hating, it has a strong history of promoting/advocating lesbianism as well.|`|c5984e3a5d60bd87646e6866a2bf78efaa	Because anti-feminist men are ignorant and have insecurity issues.|`|3lV7ZY3raa	men only say that because they feel that there masculinity is threatened.|`|AXTZOMjiaa	Gun Fanatic is right.  To prove my point, just look at most of feminist posters around here.  Most of them are bisexual or lesbian.  A few are straight.  You're in the minority.   Most of them also do promote for lesbianism or bisexuality.  You can ask a question if any of them are turned on by women's bodies or lesbian porn and a lot of them are.  Feminism attracts these types of women.|`|OFHh0KJaaa	Sure there are some feminists that are not lesbian, but I've never met a lesbian that wasn't a radical feminist. <br>  <br>  There are some feminists out there who say that you can't be fully feminist and be anything other than a gay woman. If that makes sense. There is no room for Christian feminists. <br>  <br>  If you are a Christian, and a feminist, you are on the wrong team sweetheart!<br>  <br>  Just watch the contempt and sexism for the male babies of radical feminists if they bring them to their secret androgyny parades at feminist book stores.<br>  <br>  Feminist's should also minor in something called "making sense." Just because they learned it in "woman's studies" does not mean it is true in real life.<br>  <br>  Because feminism is anti marriage, anti man, anti feminine woman, anti child, pro abortion, pro homosexual. All of which is incompatible with Christianity. <br>  <br>  You can't be a Christian and a feminist at the same time.|`|R2AYKVVlaa	Amy, these are the regular group of woman haters on here. You can't apply logic where there is none, but your keeping your cool is admirable.  Most of the men around right now (Patriarch Verlch and some others) are mras and that's a group that promotes rape and molesting kids. They are very emotionally disturbed people and they get off on picking on women like you. It's called homoerotic ritual male bonding and they masturbate while they do it, and they have admitted it. They are getting a sexual charge out of your reaction, so you should leave them be.|`|GisH4rjraa	Because feminists hate men.  Their actions and views show that they hate men.  Why would a heterosexual hate men like they do.  It doesn't make sense.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	I really depends on how strong the feminism is in them.  It ranges for simply being a misguided female to being a butch "whoa-man was that a dude or a chick?"|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	It's popular by the media to reinforce old and untrue stereotypes of  feminists as lesbians, and is especially popular among those opposed to feminism, such as the religious right and anti-feminist groups, to denigrate feminism and feminists. It's a very effective way to keep women and men on the defensive when discussing equal rights-it also distracts feminists (and especially those not sure about feminism) from the true goals of feminism and reduces every discussion about equality to "I'm not a lesbian, I don't hate men, I'm not masculine"..It causes women to say "I'm not a feminist but..." and then list a number of feminist ideas such as equality in employment, politics and society. <br>  <br>  The media, right wing groups (such as Christian Coalition of America, Focus on the Family, and National Association of Evangelicals), anti-feminist groups ( such as Concerned Women for America, Eagle Forum, and Independent Women's Forum), anti-feminist MRA groups, right wing and religious pundits ( such Rush, Patrick Buchanan, James Dobson, and Pat Robertson) all have a vested interest in keeping the old feminist stereotypes of the 1960's alive, instead of discussing the third wave of feminism. They want a past that never existed, one of the mythical 1950's, when every family supposedly could afford to have one partner not working and the little woman was at home baking cookies and walking around cleaning in hose and heels and dress and full make-up. <br>  <br>  I see it as a political strategy to denigrate feminists and feminism, and it's obviously very effective. Most of the anti-feminist religious and right-wing political groups have a lot of money and people to spread their negative views of feminism. Feminists don't exactly have the PR machinery or pulpits or political organizations like anti-feminists do.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	When Feminism became an issue again, back in the 1970's, they tried to be inclusive in their range. It included being open to people of varying sexual orientation...including Gays. Its hard to believe in this day and age that something like that made a difference...but it did. As panic about the movement spread, so did the "dyke" stereotype. <br>  <br>  It scared a lot of women from even thinking of calling themselves "feminists", lest they be thought of as "one of THEM".I basically assume anyone who plays that card is ignorant. I don't need to "prove" that I am anything.  But it makes a wonderful tool to keep people from focusing on the real issues.|`|eBMKmgCjaa	Its a generalization, but its based on the fact that modern feminism has had a high proportion of lesbians.

But seeing as you bring it up,  if you look at specific demographics you will see that  single men and male part-time workers are worse off than their female counterparts e.g. "weekly median gross earnings for a woman working part-time are ￡145.60; for a man [working part-time] ￡137.80" <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4221357.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment...</a><br>  <br>  And its easy to find examples of jobs where women are being paid more than men e.g. “Young women in New York and several of the nation’s other largest cities who work full time have forged ahead of men in wages”<br>  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/03/nyregion/03women.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5088&en=8941c5442f49a9a4&ex=1343793600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/03/nyregi...</a><br>  <br>  Or: “Female directors in corporate America earned median compensation of $120,000, based on the most recently available pay data, compared with $104,375 for male board members, research group The Corporate Library said "http://www.reuters.com/article/domestic...<br>  <br>  Feminists don't seem to be able to do maths very well. If you worked 35 hours per week as an administrative assistant, would you expect to get paid as much as the surgeon who works 60 hours per week? Most people would agree that the person who has more skills or works longer hours should have their training and labour rewarded. However when it comes to gender issues we tend to have a collective blind spot, and all too readily jump to the conclusion that women are being exploited. Thus when we hear that the average woman gets paid less than the average man, many people immediately presume this is caused by sexism. However, this is what the UK governmental department of statistics says:  <br>  <br>  "Women's weekly earnings, including overtime, were lower than men's. This was partly because they worked fewer paid hours per week. ...Although median hourly pay provides a useful comparison between the earnings of men and women, it does not necessarily indicate differences in rates of pay for comparable jobs. Pay medians are affected by the different work patterns of men and women, such as the proportions in different occupations and their length of time in jobs" i.e. women get paid less on average because on average they work fewer hours or in less well-paid occupations. <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=167" rel="nofollow">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget....</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it really isn't difficult to figure this out, but the issue gets promoted in the media as evidence of sexism. Ironically, female statisticians earn more than men (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, cited here <a href="http://glennsacks.com/blog/?p=621" rel="nofollow">http://glennsacks.com/blog/?p=621</a>|`|zNPGaZRHaa	I feel offended that you would say most men in your post. I think you mean most republican men. Please don't insult an entire gender based on what one group of them are proposing.|`|yiHsLtPdaa	I don't think most men believe that. It's just like using the word "gay" to describe an undesirable male. There are always a few nutcases who take things too far. They use that as a derogatory term that is intended as an insult. Ironically, most feminists, in fact, really are lesbians so I doubt it meets the intended purpose. Those "guys" who use the lesbian term are probably 16 year olds who couldn't get a date for the prom.<br>  <br>  Real anti-feminists couldn't care less about a feminists' orientation. That isn't our beef. We care about the misandry, falsehoods & outright lies, sexism, double standards, hypocrisy and reverse discrimination just to name few of the kinds of things that have been directed at us over the years.
klRvguajaa	Encourage women to get married.<br>  <br>  Married women are three times less likely to be raped than single women.  Must have something to do with them submitting to their husband's authority...?|`|eBMKmgCjaa	You could highlight the fact that this very serious issue has been hijacked by feminists as a propaganda weapon against men. <br>  <br>  For example, the suggestion that 1 in 4 women are raped is part of the general 'all men are rapists' attitude. The Independent Women's Forum maintains that this statistic is a myth: "based on a fallacious feminist study commissioned by Ms. magazine. The researcher, Mary Koss, hand-picked by hard-line feminist Gloria Steinem, acknowledges that 73 percent of the young women she counted as rape victims were not aware they had been raped. Forty-three percent of them were dating their 'attacker' again" <a href="http://www.massnews.com/2003_Editions/5_May/050503_mn_umass_feminists_hate_men_rally.shtml_feminists_hate_men_rally.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.massnews.com/2003_Editions/5_...</a><br>  <br>  The general tactic has been to expand the definition of rape so as to make it seem more prevalent: "…even verbal coercion or manipulation constitutes rape” (Roiphe, 1993, pp. 66–67) and “with such a sweeping definition of rape, I wonder how many people there are, male or female, who haven’t been date-raped at one point or another” (Roiphe, 1993, p. 79).  Dr. Christina Hoff Sommers observes: "Dr. Andrea Parrot, chair of the Cornell University Coalition Advocating Rape Education and author of Sexual Assault on Campus, begins her date rape prevention manual with the words, "Any sexual intercourse without mutual desire is a form of rape"http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/...<br>  <br>  Incredibly, when one feminist spokeswoman was challenged on the '1 in 4' statistic, she responded: "The statistics don't really matter... We're just trying to focus on the real issue here... not bicker about numbers" <a href="http://www.deltabravo.net/files/ifmenhav.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deltabravo.net/files/ifmenhav...</a>|`|fDGPbwdsaa	You need to remind everyone that all sex is rape - unless the woman initiates it... feminism says so. A large banner across the main doors should do.<br>  <br>  And give every man you meet (heterosexual men) a dirty look, as if they've done something wrong already...<br>  <br>  I'd love to see 'type' above supply evidence of mra's actively promoting rape & paedophilia - of course, if she can't, she owes an apology - but we all know feminists do not apologise (under normal circumstances - I've had one in all my life, and that was very recent).|`|AA11809403	i have wondered if a rape victim could, in some way, mark her rapist - during the event. using something like indelible ink, not something like a cut.<br>  <br>  this could be used for identification and legal prosecution.  this mark would speak to every other woman, to make it clear that this man has raped at least once, already, and is not trustworthy.<br>  just a thought.|`|OFHh0KJaaa	Hero, nice try feminist. Stop pretending to be men ladies. That is not even funny!<br>  <br>  I'm not a member of anything ditz. Nice try though.

R8yEBIXnaa	Death is rarely considered to actually represent physical death. Mostly it's considered to mean a change of some sort or the end of some phase in your life.
R2AYKVVlaa	You experienced sleep paralysis, and it's sometimes been called "old hag syndrome.  I gave you some links below, which will help you understand when, why, and how it's likely to happen.  <br>  <br>  I've had it for years, and it can vary between being the most terrifying experiences, to some that are very pleasant.  What happens is that you wake up suddenly from your sleep, but part of your mind is still asleep.  You are literally sitting there with your eyes opened, thus able to see, but you are still dreaming.  Everything in the room looks normal, since you are actually looking at it, and your dream is superimposed on that reality.  Since we are paralyzed when we are dreaming, you will remain paralyzed, and only think you are opening your eyes once it passes.  I've had everything from giant snake people, to cute little kids staring at me.  I've been pinned against the ceiling, flown out my window, and had some weird biker guys at the foot of my bed.  I've been visited by aliens and my dead relatives.  All of these experiences seemed as real as what I am feeling right now, yet they were not real.  <br>  <br>  As you will read in the articles, stress is almost always the cause.  I have learned to avoid those triggers, but it still happens, although rarely.  I have learned to also gain some control over the episodes themselves.  Now when it happens, I am able to remind myself to physically relax, knowing it will pass shortly.  I know that sounds loopy, but I have figured out how to do it, so I know it can be done.  Just knowing what is going on is the first step.  Read everything you can about it, as this will help you to remember when it happens again.  You will sometimes feel as if you are trying to leave your body, and during my last episode, I was aware enough to just relax, and allowed myself to go.  I was pinned against the ceiling (remember, this isn't actually happening.  But even as aware as I am that it didn't truly occur, even in my conscious state, I can't fully separate the sensations from how I feel in reality.  When I speak of it, it is a real memory, and seems like reality) and could see my own body below me.  As I talked myself into relaxing, I floated about rather than being pinned, and woke up a few seconds later.<br>  <br>  Don't be too scared, even though I know you are probably pretty freaked out by it.  It took me a year to tell anybody about my first episode, and by that time, I'd had a couple more.  I truly thought I was losing my mind, or being visited by demons, or aliens, one.  But I came to find out that it is not even classified as a mental illness, and is very much a physical thing.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I really feel for you.|`|r2gonS44aa	The first part of this, sounds as if you woke up in a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Its common that if you wake up in a panic attack that you will do it again in the same night, (Best way to curb that is to get out of bed... no matter how tired you are, and do something for even 20 minutes, to change your pattern of thinking... you know whatever it was that woke you.)<br>  <br>  The 2nd thing sounds like you woke up in a panic attack, during REM sleep, Which would mean your body is still in sleep paralysis.  Sometimes you can open your eyes but not move (That one has happened to me) or sometimes you can't do anything.  I've found the best way to counter that, is to remind yourself what is going on.  I'm having a sleep paralysis moment and I'm panicing...  Go back to sleep.<br>  <br>  You weren't dreaming, and sleep paralysis is uncommon, it is kind of a fluke that you have them often. But it you do find that you are having sleep paralysis often, I would get seen by a doctor ASAP, because that can be some scary *** stuff.  <br>  <br>  If you work yourself up too much you may go into shock, so just like I said before relax, remind yourself exactly what is going on.  Remember you have survived this before and you will again... Go Back to sleep!!  ;)<br>  <br>  Are you on any new medications, or any medications that have any certain side effects in corrolation with sleep or sleep walking  etc? <br>  You may need a med change in this case.<br>  <br>  If not, write down when its happened in a journal and keep track, that way if it starts up again, you can mention it to your parents or doctor and you will have a record of when and where its happend.  I would also keep a log of what happened that day, some stressors can cause crazy things like this to happen to your body.|`|mXGJQ9B7aa	look, it could be a medical thing like that man said but, and i don't mean to scare you, well i have forgot the name but they are these 2 guosts that pray on girls and 1 of my mums mates said that they had done it to her and she couldn't move.  idk though?|`|mDnjTzxCaa	Hi. You have a sleep disorder named sleep paralysis. When we go to sleep the brain shots off the motor centers to prevent the body from acting out dreams. So actually every normal person get paralyzed when they go to sleep. But when we wake up the brain normally opens up the motor centers again instantly, so we do not remember the paralysis. However those people with sleep paralysis disorder have a delay getting rid of the paralysis. When they wake up sometimes the brain fails to open up the motor centers for a few seconds or more. So you are awake but you cannot even open your eyes. That disorder has a drug treatment. You should consult a psychiatrist.|`|sfhyZlMOaa	it is a dream<br>  <br>  once,i had a dream,that i already woke up,but can't move,then a female ghost(i think) is coming for me slowly!!(but the figure is not that scary like zamara morgan,its just a female,that is ghost)<br>  <br>  so im freaking out,i can't move and breathe,but when the female hugged me,lol...i heard some voice from my mother outside my room,and i can't shout!<br>  <br>  Maybe what happened to you,is,you had your panic attack while you're dreaming,i think that's possible|`|E23s2wSNaa	omg thats scary, man im surprised u didnt pee urself, i prolly would have lol<br>  <br>  no it sounds like a medical thing, shoot i wish i knew the name for it, but theres something that happens where u cant move, but i cant explain the face, maybe u were dreaming and couldnt move? idk sry, all i have<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  ok i did some research for u, i mean i only found what its called when u cant move, its called sleep paralysis, i hope this helps|`|4yFDVPhQaa	ok i dont know what that is but ive had it happen to me a lot before. when i was a kid i remember seeing people in my door way or hands coming at me and to this day i still have no clue if i was dreaming.

DbuDaEqnaa	This is exactly what I talk about with my counsellor! I was always 'should' but now it's becoming more want as I grow up. Sadly however, it's a shock to most people I know who don't like it, calling me selfish. But the thing is, I think you have to be more selfish in this world to get what you want out of it and I guess people will have to get used to it! The want self can win as much as you let it. Obviously there are still things that must/should be done but it's just how much you let them impact your life!<br>  Regards x|`|SHQHnKfcaa	Wanting is powerful to the mind and controlling it is hard to most people.<br>  <br>  When we think we "should", we tend to rebel on it and instead, "should"  it's.....I "want"
