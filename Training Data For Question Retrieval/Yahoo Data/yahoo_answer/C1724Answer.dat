eL5tsepwaa	I am really shocked that parents have complained about this presenter, who is apparently doing a great job in many ways, or so I have read elsewhere.<br>  I think children should be exposed to people who are different from them in order to prepare them for life - by shielding them from anything which might confuse or upset them first time round then we are just setting them up for numerous embarrassing 'staring' occasions in future.<br>  In fact I think CBeebies is a great platform for introducing disabilities into a child's awareness -  children enjoy watching, they can ask their parents why the lady only has one arm, get an explanation, and carry on enjoying their programmes! We could speculate that they might come to realise that disabled people are nothing to be scared of!<br>  By sheltering their children from disability, and actively complaining about their exposure to it, these parents are showing not only their own ignorance, but are sending their children the message that it is 'wrong' to be disabled and that disabled people should be hidden away.|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	Dave S....<br>  <br>  Learning about disabilities is a head start in empathy and understanding, something all children should learn from a young age. Many schools/nursery's have special needs toys, many schools/nursery's now incorporate special need children into their mainstream section. From a very young age children are taught to understand the difference not only in culture and ethnicity but also in awareness of others, disabilities and social culture. All children I know have a great understanding of those with needs, they show great compassion and in fact are the best advocates for those with special needs. To be shown we are not all the same at a young age , gives you the ability to understand more the needs of those who you meet as an adult. Not to judge and to listen.<br>  <br>  Sex is an adult activity primarily an act to breed. It is an act between two (ok sometimes more lol) people, to enhance pleasure, satisfaction and for both people to achieve sexual fulfilment. Hence why the the legal age is sixteen. Sex to children is complex and full of amusement. Most at this age find the concept of kissing a girl/boy yukky, let alone going into indeapth discussions with them about vagina's and penises<br>  <br>  To compare the two is bonkers!!|`|rh8Ph8Xfaa	I just wonder what the reaction would have been if the presenter had been the proverbial black one-legged lesbian with three eyes.<br>  <br>  THAT wouldn't have had a word said about it -<br>  black - racist<br>  lesbian - homophobic<br>  one leg and three eyes - physical deformity (let's build a ramp for her wheelchair etc etc)<br>  <br>  See what I mean<br>  <br>  <br>  AND WHY DON'T YOU JUST WRITE A LETTER TO DAVE S INSTEAD OF USING THIS SITE TO CHAT WITH HIM ALL THE TIME|`|mNzgWFkGaa	Absolutely!  In life your children are going to meet people with disabilities anyway, so shouldn't the message you teach your kids is to treat them the same as everybody else?   I don't know why some folks  are so uncomfortable about other  people with a disability they are  just people after all.|`|EgXOeDP2aa	This is just so medieval,  these parents are moronic.<br>  All they need to say is that this is the way god made her.<br>  and to explain that not all people are born the same.<br>  There but for the grace of god goes any one of us.  God forbid<br>  that these parents and any of their offspring ever have an<br>  accident which leaves them disabled in any way. It would be<br>  interesting to see if their opinions change.|`|4d163081b2e7d60145dd97484dd14342aa	I'm disgusted.  I'm pretty certain she won't scare the kids.  Children should be taught to embrace people who are "different" and not fear them.  These parents are just damaging their children.|`|ESKslyfsaa	It's a disgrace, of course any decent parent would talk to their child.  <br>  Where will it end.  Don't take your children out in case there's a disabled person about.  Pathetic.|`|wnyuH0aTaa	She seems armless enough to me.|`|lvjQ20cbaa	I've sat here for 10 minutes trying to think of something to write but there are no words to adequately describe the parents stupidity.<br>  <br>  Any child that watches CBeebies is probably too young to have any discrimination to a disability but will probably be curios to why the lady only has one arm and may well ask questions. The fear comes from the parents who are obviously unable to explain to the child why this woman is different. I'm sure a simple "she was born with one arm, some people are born blind or deaf, some with one arm or leg etc." would satisfy the majority of kids and if they were frightened a good parent will easily calm the child.<br>  <br>  @ dave s. You suggest that CBeebies are at fault as they haven't explained to kids that this presenter has a disability. Surely that's the job of the parents if the child enquires isn't it?|`|031551eb799725ff135a73eee37b3162aa	Absolutely right. No wonder children with disabilities get bullied if parents are so ignorant in their education of their own kids. It's a disgrace that such an incident should occur. This presenter should stay and more disabled children and adults should be encouraged. What about the war wounded and siamese twins and burns victims etc-should we hide them all? Nazi germany this is not- so let's start teaching children and informing them better. You can't be racist- rightly so- but you can ban the disabled?|`|K2Wg3f9saa	The  mothers who complained that their children would not be able to sleep, are actually damaging their children by forcing them to remain in a cocoon. Imagine if one of those mothers lost a limb in an accident, then that child would never sleep. Life is kind and cruel, and to try to shield children unnecessarily just does more harm than good. Who wants to grow up in a Peter Pan idealistic world? Do these parents hide the fact from their children that there are people in the world who are starving to death, people who are dying daily and so on? What a shock when these children finally see reality.|`|xcdHd7G0aa	Disability is a part of life that cannot be ignored and brushed under the carpet. Children shouldn't be shielded from disabled people, they should be taught about the differences we all have and to be tolerant of others. I'm more inclined to believe that the parents who have complained are the ones who find a woman with a missing arm scary, not their children.|`|8bplNvAQaa	Yes I would.  In fact, that's probably one of the best ways to teach them.  Saves discomfort when they ask questions in a shopping centre (out loud) so the guy can hear.  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  There are many ignorant people.  These are the types that would have complained about a black guy on the telly scaring their children (in the 50's or something).  Anyway, children's telly scares the sh-it out of me and probably scares them too.  Its parents who have the problem, not the kids - I bet ya.  <br>  <br>  What the hell is lazy town about.

But we're not the land of "We'll bring you your opportunity on a silver platter."

Housing is...well, it depends on where you choose to live. And for filing taxes, TurboTax is the way to go.<br>  <br>  If you're a student, there are numerous ways to finance your education. There are several scholarships in place at nearly all colleges and universities (both need- and merit-based).

Or the leases at least.|`|DsqNjCjPaa	I know this is a long answer but it PLEASE PLEASE read it, as I have a lot of evidence to support my opinion. <br>  <br>  No, America is no longer the land of opportunity for all, nor has it been for a long time. It was when it was founded but as rich people moved and as people became richer; they wanted to hoard their wealth. The American Dream is a convenient excuse for corporations not to do their duty by giving back to society. Some people will never be able to achieve the Dream, because it is exactly that, all Dreams are fictitious including the American one. As Adolf Hitler said, the bigger the lie the more people will believe it (this is not an exact quote). <br>  <br>  This poem by Lawrence Ferlinghetti shows it: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/english/poemscult/ferlinghettirev2.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesiz...</a><br>  <br>  He describes the American Dream as an odourless TV ad, exactly. Claims made in a TV ad are rarely true. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, income inequality is much higher in the USA:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Role_of_education" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_ineq...</a><br>  <br>  Educational attainment in the USA is also linked to Income. So if you want to get good grades you have to be rich. However, if you want to be rich, the best chances are to get good grades and degrees etc.<br>  <br>  Also, as Rich B said in answer to your question, the American Dream turns millionaires in to billionaires. <br>  <br>  Rofe also answered by saying you have to decrease government in your life, again the USA is a bizarre country, as they have more faith in elitist corporations than their own government which most of them elected. The US Government should be put in a museum, it is definitely small enough and it no longer serves its original purpose like all other artefacts. <br>  <br>  During, this economic crisis, financial institutions have PROVEN ETERNALLY that they can NEVER BE TRUSTED EVER AGAIN to run their business responsibly. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.economicmobility.org/assets/pdfs/EMP%20American%20Dream%20Report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.economicmobility.org/assets/p...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_mobility#Economic_mobility_worldwide" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_mo...</a> <br>  <br>  This document shows differing opinions among people in the US and other countries. In the US a majority of people believe it is not the government’s responsibility to increase social mobility, they also believe people are rewarded fairly for their efforts. <br>  <br>  The majority of non-Americans believe exactly the opposite. If the American Dream is alive and well how come economic mobility, development (HDI), quality of life is lower in the US and higher in all Scandinavian countries and in France and Germany where government involvement in people’s lives is much higher? <br>  <br>  Why do Americans have these opinions?<br>  <br>  They don’t, corporations have worked with the media to make sure Americans believe in the ideas given above. <br>  <br>  They start at childhood; broadcasters such as Disney and Nickelodeon are the main culprits. Shows like “the Suite Life of Zack and Cody” allude to the ideals of America. <br>  <br>  Look at all the child characters; they are all obsessed with money. There is a 15 year old girl, who works at the candy counter in the hotel, and she gets a free hotel suite (again this adds to the believe that the rich help the poor- which is not true in the majority of cases, it is delusional at best). <br>  <br>  Watch this clip below from 2.00 to 2.20 and then watch from 5.00-5.20 as it shows you what I mean, the rich heiress London Tipton is the oriental, black haired girl and maddie is the blond in the brown hat. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8JIVDBk0Mo&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8JIVDBk0...</a><br>  <br>  Other programs like Cory in the House show a teenage businessman who lives in the White House, Hannah Montana promotes the idea that you can have the best of both worlds, when in reality most people have the worst of one world. <br>  <br>  Collectively, this has brainwashed a generation of children, and mutated them in to a generation which will seek money and personal gain over anything else. 50 years ago children lived in the real world and learned that some times everything is not always possible, through experiencing life and not from watching TV/movies. <br>  <br>  America is obsessed with naked capitalism; it has even managed to turn blood, an organ vital to life in to a commodity like oil. <br>  <br>  You are fluent in English, if you want to and can afford to, you should move to a different Anglosphere country, like Australia, New Zealand and Ireland- all have higher quality oflife, ecnomic mobilty, life expectancy and are more developed than the USA.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	It was a land of opportunity in 1776, but it isn't any more.<br>  <br>  America is a country where if you're already rich and have lots of money, you can get even richer and make lots more money.<br>  <br>  If you're poor, though - you're basically screwed.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	I believe it is.

If a regular person comes on the scene, people massacre him/her and regular people that might actually make a difference are discouraged to run .   Until people get a clue, and stop believing everything you hear like sheep, we deserve exactly what we get.|`|elJHDb1jaa	I dont find it funny. It is very predictable though. also its exactly what he said he was going to do in his books. Too bad all the people that voted for him didnt research the candidates.|`|buUTakKAaa	yes he's too much rethoric, and not any action. <br>  <br>  a great speaker is nothing if he dosen't translate his words to action|`|oMIVICHDaa	thats politics for you.|`|hpzfccwaaa	Who am i to disagree" hand shakes are made of these" the prints of a presidents walk. I know we all focus on the talk but when the sound is turned off you get to see the walk and that's what matters most.|`|QIZH3RkXaa	The people that voted for him are like the people you went to high school with that were idiots and were not going to amount to anything in life.|`|tVfkiFAvaa	Hmm maybe. Its not like he is the first person to tell people what they want to hear just to get elected.|`|0QKEW5lRaa	its a president thing, lie your way in, do nothing, ??????????, PROFIT|`|OIS808Qmaa	All politicians are liars......have we still not come to terms with this?  They are all the same, they are all puppets.  Moving on.....|`|NBGskcFhaa	im so sick of hearing about this guy|`|OIERnVh6aa	Well, in case you didn't realize, we had 2 nut jobs to vote for (Mc Cain and Obama), And Obama just happened to say all the right things that won the people over. He is our only hope and he knows that. I agree with you about him not doing what he said he was going to do. I never thought he was going to do what he said he was going to do in the first place. Yeah, sure he made history and that is only because of his color. <br>  <br>  The question now is, will he make history even more by rescuing our country? Or will he be as bad or worse than Bush by doing the opposite of what he claimed he was going to do?. We need someone smart, someone that actually knows something to help our country get out of this MAJOR recession. Of course, for some reason people are acting really dumb right now. It's like they don't care what we're going through, they just keep waiting there money on things that they don't even need. <br>  <br>  WAKE UP AMERICA!!!! <br>  BEFORE IT IS TO LATE!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Also, I don't know if people have noticed or not, but since Obama has been in the picture, there has been nothing but dark people that he has been helping and having work for him. I don't mean to be racist, but I think Caucasians, Mexicans and all the other race in this country are being over ruled *"silently"*. <br>  <br>  I will never forget when Michelle Obama (his wife) said when they was going through the election: "I was never proud of our Country until now." She was only proud of our country when people started rooting for her and her husband. <br>  Guess what, Michelle better keep watch out, because Oprah is trying to steel Obama lol. I wonder if we're going to have another Clinton on our hands?? What do you think.<br>  <br>  I don't care for either McCain or Obama. However, as scary as this is, I guess I'd rather have Obama take over than I would McCain or Palin. Palin is dumber than a box of rocks, whoop de do, she was a beauty queen at one time. Big deal. Now it's like she is a Celeb. wigs like her hair and glasses like hers, clothes like hers. She's no one, her daughter got knocked up and not married. As for Mc Cain, well .. he's just another Bush and if he were elected president, then he would have probably passed away while he was president and that would have left us in Palins hands. OH BROTHER! So think of it that way. Now are you glad that Obama is our president instead?.|`|WHJc8VH9aa	I think you should take Leslie's advice and run for president. At least you wouldn't have an agenda and would be starting from a neutral mindset. Our two political parties in this country are a joke, and it seems like most people don't care. I think we should fire every last politician, and replace them with people that have never held office before. I mean seriously, with all the jerks we have as politicians now, it can't be that hard to run a country. These assholes are more concerned about playing golf, and hanging out in strip clubs than they are with running the country. We need a modern day Mr. Smith.<br>  Obama is a joke, Mccain was a joke. As for Kanye, he can go to hell. Peace.|`|X6ABZvqAaa	Obama is the first black president and because of that, people are falling for him. Im not a racist and that's not the point of this, but, everyone seems to like him for the fact he is the first black president and that's not how it should be - following through your promises make you a good president.|`|j8CeFZOvaa	Since Obama got elected I said "I can't wait until Obama doesn't follow through with what he say's, and everyone's gonna ***** and whine until a new President is elected" Well, that's America I guess. Peace :)|`|kXVagSmbaa	I HATE OBAMA!|`|jPLiMCPDaa	What politician ever does?|`|us952RMHaa	yeah a little funny.|`|EWnTv4hqaa	and screws up....alot!!! we are in for a big change alright|`|c1334d7d6d160918eed9551c6f52e61baa	Obama did what he had to do to become President. He promised change.He promised troop withdrawal(july '07 campaign) then when was elected realized that was not possible.He promised bi-partisan decision making.He might as well promised a chicken in every pot ,too.He made these promises when we were at the throws of a depression/recession and were vulnerable as a nation,dying for any sign of hope.And we as a nation were like a sixteen yr. old gal falling in love for the first time and giving it up to the football jock who told us he" loved" us.And then figured out he was just trying to score. What strikes me is that his inaugural ceremony cost the most $$$ by a mile in inaugural history. In this difficult economic time Could he have not said "let's keep it modest,we really can't afford all the hoopla"?!?!?Bruce Springsteen,Kanye West,U2,Beyonce........WTF!!! Anyway now that he is the Prez he can come up with any number of reasons/ excuses why he can not keep his word. Your question should ask why is he not doing ANYTHING of what he said.
HCvJ0AGnaa	I became aware of this tho' a previous question in here. After watching the horrific cruelty I saw I emailed the school he attended with a link to the you tube clip.<br>  <br>  As a mum of four I am COMPLETELY responsible for their actions. It is my job to raise them with compassion and understanding. To give them a wide and varied outlook on the world and to steer them, at all times on the correct path.<br>  <br>  My boys are still young, they are like sponge's, sucking in information at all times, if they ever become anything like this, I would have no option but to blame myself. There are two many parents in this world who take no responsibility for their children's actions, who turn a blind eye to what they do and who have no real concern for who they are with, where they are or what they are doing.<br>  <br>  For a fourteen year old to show this much cruelty to an animal there has to either be a serious mental health issues or sadly he has been brought up with no real love, respect or acknowledgement of society and it's basic rules!|`|WLCpLU0jaa	I have not and will not see this video. Should the parents be punished you ask? The answer is yes. The have raised him (or have failed to) to act like that. So, it's only right that they should suffer the fruits of their labor.|`|1015550a74d6acc9fb8b60a911e82b56aa	If my kid did that I would have to seriously question my role as a parent in allowing them to become so deranged.  So, yes, I think that parents should be held responsible for what their kids do.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Hopefully the Humane Society or ASCPA has stepped in and removed any pets from the home.<br>  <br>  Also, I would hope there would be a neighborhood or community meeting where concerned pet owners would know the identity of this potential serial killer.<br>  <br>  The parents need to take their screwed up off spring to a therapist, but since the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, this kid may have been a victim of child abuse himself.<br>  <br>  If that was my kid, he'd be shipped off to the psych ward for a mental evaluation and then off to military school.|`|AA11049477	I didn't want or try to watch this particular video nasty, <br>  I don't need the horror of it stuck head & I get the idea.<br>  If his parents are NOT held at least partly responsible, the opportunity to nip this sort of behaviour in the bud will be lost forever.<br>  Maybe it should be 50/50?<br>  They owe it to society to raise a balanced & respectful teenager, don't they?<br>  For him to have done this, let alone the stupidity of posting it on the internet, they will have to admit they brought a brainless & violent thug into the world.<br>  If he thinks animal abuse is entertaining & then moves onto abusing people, will they ONLY then question their parenting skills?<br>  I'd be so deeply ashamed if he were my son.<br>  Ashamed & consider disowning him.<br>  This teenager does not realise the pain he's caused to those around him, I bet.|`|H08vPJ2Maa	Absolutely. His parents "raised" him and are usually responsible for how he turns out. Of course there are psycho's who are just wrong in the head despite their upbringing but that's pretty rare. And if his only punishment was to have his bike taken away from him gives us a bit of a clue as to what sort of parents they are.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't normally be cruel to kids but I'd like to get my hands on that one!<br>  <br>  BTW - I haven't watched it and I am not going to. Just thinking about it upsets me.<br>  <br>  EDIT - I don't think putting is parents names and address just randomly all over the palce is helpful - it would have been better to send them to the police and the RSPCA.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Parents should be held responsible to a certain extent, especially for a kid like this who is obviously disturbed and clearly isn't the brightest bulb in the box. They are abusing and neglecting him if he isn't getting the psychiatric treatment he obviously needs. The killers of James Bulger started by torturing animals and it's well known that those who sadistically harm animals can progress to harming humans too.<br>  <br>  However, publishing personal contact details was a criminally insane and stupid act which could potentially harm this boy's brothers and sisters (if he has any), and his next door neighbours too, as well as himself and his parents.<br>  <br>  Some animal rights activists are pretty extreme (on a par with Muslim terrorists) and could potentially plot an act of violence against this family.|`|nOFvdF9yaa	An extra "pleasure" & "satisfaction" came to my mind (& heart) after reading your question, added details, comments AND all the answers to your question! So happy I'm with my country & society that we NEVER EVER had to face such perversion or brutalities in our life (at least I myself witnessed 3 generations). By the way, I lost my interest to see that vdo & probably I myself might turn to a psychopath something! <br>  Well, the reason for my coming here is this: You asked whether the parents of the sick 14 yrs oldie's are responsible or not. <br>  Look, Meganjes, if it were my country or my society, then of course I would had to admit that the parents were first to blame! But, unfortunately, it's the West! Secondly, the so-called psychopathy, mental-disorder, schizophrenia etc are mainly seen in the Western societies! Because the way of their life, lifestyle, especially the "indulgences" they get from the so-called "civilized'(!) community------------they can think of these nonsense brutality. I do forecast: nothing would happen to that 14 yrs older or to his parents! Simply the boy would go for treatment & the parents would be proved "innocent"---may be they would get some extra financial benefit to carry on the treatment of their child! I never ever think of that in my Bangladeshi society, where we're already aware of the consequences! So-called 'psychopathy' would never arise because we're brought up that way. I won't say that our children do not hit animals; of course they do it out of anger when an animal does disturb too much; we, mostly throw stones or scare them somehow to stay away from wrong doing. In fact this is the CURSE of the over-civilized society, where the children as well as some adults have nothing to do except showing (or expressing) their attitudes this way like the 14 yrs boy! <br>  For example, I use to face daily a question here at Yahoo! from a teenage girl/boy against his/her mom or dad or parents----which I never ever dream from my society! Our innocent, under-aged children might shout against their mom or dad but no one would place complaints against their mom at least! We use to believe that Heaven is under the feet of our mom! I'm not blaming the particular boy or the parents; I do blame the whole Western societies for their allowing too much indulgences to the youngsters. I do thank you that persons like you are still there to feel the whole. Thank you again.|`|sX4kZfN2aa	Maybe the parents didn't know what the boy was doing when he did this awful thing... but to only take his dirt bike away is a problem. The boy needs help and should be taken to a Doctor for therapy by his parents.  Actions like this can only grow worse if untreated... if he does that to animals next comes humans.  Get him help, before it's too late!!!|`|X1U803Idaa	I don't think either is helpful.<br>  <br>  The kid should be in the care of a psychiatrist. If the parents have been previously recommended to one before and ignored that advice I think they are neglecting him and they need to be held responsible for that.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Of course the parents need to be responsible, and in this case, it is easy to see why this monster got to be the way he is; his parents have enabled him to turn into a sociopathic soulless POS prick who will undoubtedly turn his attention to human victims next, virtually all serial killers began by torturing animals.|`|AA10283080	To a certain extent the parents should be held responsible.<br>  But the child also needs to be held responsible or he will never learn responsibility considering his parents obviously haven't taught him one ounce of it so far.|`|iTetA3oCaa	Until they reach maturity the parents are responsible and society should hold them responsible.  They have the most influence over their children's lives and need to live up to their responsibility.  And it starts very early|`|YTasscmKaa	Up until the age of majority, yes, parents should be held responsible for what their little monsters do.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	No.  Legislatures continue to pass one more law on top of one more law.  A gutless politician would support legislation to hold the parents responsible for animal cruelty if a lobby offered the right set of incentives.  The larger picture problem is the serial passage of class laws such as seat belts, and  parental responsibility for a child's school attendance.  If you want the government to enact more laws, a good starting point would IQ testing of school teachers.  Would a politician anger the teacher's lobby with such a law?   The tendency to seek passage of a law when some issue presents itself  destroys whatever sense of community that may exist.  Good news:  if you would seek passage of a parental responsibility law for animal mistreatment the law would likely pass.  Your government loves a law that portrays it in favorable light.   Freedom is no factor in its  analysis.|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	How?<br>  Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics " Hotel California"<br>  " Alley Oop" with "The Chain gang"<br>  The lost generation?<br>  "Don't know much - about misery"<br>  "Knowing me knowing you"<br>  "Say you say me"<br>  When they too was mass produced and rolled off from the same faulty production lines that went out of control could not even control their own  little ones like themselves too in time.<br>  The misery was exposed by the mystery of us-911 in time.<br>  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49<br>  Luke 8.5-8,10-17<br>  Luke 4.4<br>  Luke 11.46-52<br>  Luke 9.25,55-56,60<br>  Luke 21.30-33<br>  Leviticus 4.13,22<br>  Matt 22.17-21,32<br>  What do you think?

WHJc8VH9aa	Poverty has a large part to do with terrorism. Although there are some exceptions, like Bin Laden, for the most part terrorism is the best financial option. Prospects of terrorism are often lured into acts of terror not primarily because of fundamental beliefs, but by finances. I actually read an article about a member of Al-Qaeda member who was promised $500 for a C-section for his wife, but soon left the organization after receiving nothing. Something you won't often hear about is how the US government obtained intelligence from terrorists captured in Afghanistan and Iraq. Cold hard cash. These guys had nothing better else to do than to fight, but when offered cash, they became turncoats in an instant. Nearly everyone's loyalty can be bought at some price, it's the price that differs from person to person. That is how they figured out where Saddam's son was, one of his top men was bribed by cash from the US government. <br>  <br>  As for explaining why Bin Laden would prefer to live in a cave rather than driving a Ferrari around Dubai, I can't tell you. I guess he is someone that truly believes in his beliefs, and of course there will be exceptions to this theory. Maybe he is unhappy from his money. If you think about it, he is hypocritical for having such animosity towards everything western, when in fact his wealth was inherited by doing business with the west...|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics " Hotel California"<br>  The Book of the Dead in idol worshipping the dead Mummy of failures and horrors with hear-say from the twilight zone that crumble in dust with self lack of knowledge and total loss of IQ that could not even survive in the real world without the Book of the Living with commandments in worshipping God in different time zone in time.<br>  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49<br>  Matt 22.17-21,32<br>  Luke 21.30-33<br>  Luke 9.25,55-56,60<br>  Luke 8.5-8,10-17<br>  Luke 4.4<br>  Leviticus 4.13,22<br>  Luke 11.46-52<br>  What do you think?|`|t6MHAb55aa	there are 800,000 Pakistani army guarding nuclear arsenals and taliban are how many??lol u guys are seriously retarded taliban are just bunch of idiots who are backed by russia and her allies.if everyone in Pakistan tribal area has a job, no one cares for those Taliban.for them working for taliban is a job.u know taliban got prados and best cars in pakistan tribal areas.they travel in four wheelers and have big houses and luxurious life.if Pakistani government ever starts spending money on education in these tribal areas the taliban would be over .Do u know taliban blows up schools?why so ? cause people don't get educated if people get educated they won't support their cause.Taliban won't allow Pakistan army to build roads?why cause they don't want these people to get some contact with world.Pakistan army builds houses and they blow it up.so the point is Taliban are nothing more than a drama and i don't think pakistanis support them.Pakistanis have no concern with them.They only care for Pakistan but that doesn't mean they like america.Pakistan has lost billions fighting war on terror,their thousands of soldiers are dead so people are angry at america.they say america created alqaeda/taliban and now they want to kill them.the better way is education which pakistan has always demanded saying "if america is sincere to finish alqaeda, open schools,build roads" but then will alqaeda let pakistan build schools,hospitals in tribal areas??the best revenge to alqaeda is opening schools,hospitals giving people there jobs.i am not trying to offend any american, i m just giving u my point of view.go and ask a common pakistani , they are only concerned about his job,his life and his food he has no concern with taliban.its good to talk sitting from america but facts are different here.|`|WLCpLU0jaa	There is no relationship between them any more than there is one between crime and poverty.

f551e387a3e6f01af266f4af899c09e9aa	I agree with you 100%.  People are hopeful that he will be able to save the economy because as a general rule they wanted to go as far from Bush as they could, and that just happened to be Obama.  I don't think he has a better chance of saving the economy than any other President, but people know we definitely need something to happen soon or we are going to be in big, big trouble.  Although I don't really like Obama, with a democratic majority house and senate, either he will fix the economy real quick or screw it up beyond comprehension...don't really see anything in between.|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	Just doing the opposite of the GOP will have America in the right direction.

It does this every 50-60 years or so.<br>  <br>  Obama's "plan" is quite simple. Tax the heck out of Americans and give money to the banks and crappy care companies so they can continue to make crappy cars. Also, he's an every day Robin Hood - Let's tax the rich, hard-working, SMART Americans and give it to the foreclosure, stupid morons who bit off more than they can chew in this world.

H08vPJ2Maa	It's great to know that the Americans will still defend their right to own guns after this!<br>  <br>  Anyone why buys a child a gun is insane and irresponsible. You are asking for trouble and some poor woman and her unborn child had to pay the price for this.<br>  <br>  And yes, to think that there are guns designed for children, that do not even need to be registered is a very serious cause for concern.<br>  <br>  But hey, at least the constitution is protected and that's the most important thing!|`|AA11987492	Well, where I am from this is common place. Hunting is a common pasttime around here. I know many families, mine included, that allow their children to have guns. They are taught gun safety, and irresponsibility with guns is NOT tolerated. I have never witnessed any problems with this (I am not ignorant to believe that it does not happen) and the kids are very responsible and good wth their guns.<br>  <br>  ETA: After reading the story, this child has MANY more problems than gun ownership, he just as easily could've went into the kitchen and got a knife. The fact that he had a gun available doesn't matter.|`|AA11593971	Actually, I don't have a problem with buying an older "child" a gun if his/her access and use of the gun is properly controlled by the parents. The kid needs to learn respect and use for the weapon. <br>  <br>  The missing piece to this sad story is that the kid was given total control over the gun. That was STUPID by any definition. As in so many of these stories where a kid kills/wounds someone with a gun, it was the stupidity of the parents that led to the tragedy... not the access itself.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	No! Are you kidding? The gun should have been owned by the parents and locked up in a proper cabinet. The person that bought him the gun (what 11 year old has the money to buy a gun himself? It's not like he can really get a job, not legally.) has blood on his hands. <br>  <br>  Denial - Delusion - Lazy - Stupid - Fool - adjectives I am tempted to use.<br>  <br>  He's 11. His parents are responsible for him. If they were responsible then this would not have happened or it's likely that it would not. Who teaches their kids that problems can be solved with guns????|`|f5wTQblsaa	Just thank goodness the laws on owning guns are much stricter in the UK than the USA.

Having seen alot of shoot em up playstation games I dont think the child really understood what happens when you shoot someone.|`|NkYQXP8Oaa	I don't mean to be politically incorrect, but it depends on their class and background...if you know what I mean.|`|GQZDcfUiaa	I think it's okay for a mature 11 year old to have a gun, IF he/she has been properly instructed on use and safety. My son had a family gun handed down to him when he was able to shoot, but he was too immature to keep it for himself at all times. It was returned to the gun safe when he wasn't using it. <br>  I married into a family of hunters and it's not an unusual thing at all for a child that age to have his/her own gun. The biggy is teach, teach by example, and safety first!|`|9wtpCNb6aa	Well i personally wouldnt buy an 11 year old a gun unless i was stupid.  There are other ways to protect yourself if thats what it was about.  <br>  <br>  The parents are obviously to blame as they bought him the gun, they must be off their heads.  But even at 11, that boy will know right from wrong and WILL know that shooting someone for no reason other than pure evilness is just wrong.|`|AA11414292	I you believe that any one should be allowed any where near a gun before 18 then your more stupid than I ever thought possible.<br>  Just on record's alone more gun accidents and shooting are carried out by under 18 year old in the USA.<br>  God help us they cling to a very old law that's so out of date.<br>  No wonder we let them have America you've got to have some where for the mentally ill to live|`|uKrdjrJiaa	Only a fool !I wont even let my 10 year old have scissors!|`|ZA11WBR2aa	It is quite evident that the gun was not purchased legally, so the problem is not with the law but with the fact that the laws should be strictly enforced to register every gun and arrest people who sell illegal ammunition.|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	The same sort of imbecile that bought a 9 year old an air gun when I was a kid.<br>  <br>  America is weird in this regard. No drink till your 21, but feel free to own a gun at 11. It strikes me that their priorities are all mixed up. They are wedded to the gun and no amount of "accidents" or atrocities are about to change them.|`|elY5vkVyaa	America is a f***ing madhouse; what kind of supposedly civilized Country makes shotguns specially designed for children and allows them to be kept without a license? It's a GUN for FFS!<br>  <br>  I certainly think this child is not quite right in the head but would he have committed such a crime if the temptation of a lethal weapon was not within easy reach? Guns and cars; America loves them more than people.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	People in the U.K. should put the emphasis on getting their political freedoms back. (What aren't people there going to be allowed by "Big Brother" to say or do next?) The Second Amendment supports the First. Within that context it is possible that some minor adjustment could be made to gun laws.|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	I said in a previous question about this, that I was shocked he had a gun and blamed the parents.

Surely the USA have a age licence on owing guns or are they taught how to shoot in kindergarten?|`|AA10283080	The people who didn't teach him right from wrong and allowed him to keep a gun in his room are at fault.<br>  <br>  My nephew is 16 and owns guns (all rifles). But he wasn't allowed to keep those guns in his room until he was 16 and showed his father that he knew how to respect the weapon and not take it lightly. The problem with gun ownership in America is that so many of the owners are irresponsible.

How did those alleged terrorists get on the planes without surveillance cameras taking pictures of them? What happened was someone at these agencies heard the terrorists talking about it, concealed that info, made it happen, then blamed it on the dumkopfs that were talking about it. All US intelligence supports the SERPENT! Why or how do you think a sh*thead like GHW Bush could be head of the CIA? Because the SERPENT moves by itself on automatic, headlong to its death! Also the sketched picture of Khalid Mohammed in NY Daily News is ridiculous. He could not and would not grow a beard!.." They deprived him of sleep and got him to confess to everything, then I said that I had seen him up at Cornell, he said, "Cornell? Sure I was up there!

I think children are only afraid of people who are different if their parents allow them to exhibit that sort of unhealthy behaviour.  Kids are naturally curious and if you answer their questions and show them there is nothing wrong with looking different everything is fine.  <br>  The whole issue is solved with a 2 minute conversation.

They're curious, inquisitive and at that age full of the question why.<br>  <br>  It is not the children who are to blame but the parents who fail to answer the child's questions, reassure them and enlighten them to the fact that we are all different.<br>  <br>  The children won't run for the tele screaming in horror. Young children might point, stare and ask but they will only become distressed if the parent reacts in an over emotional way and refuses to answer the child's curious questions. <br>  <br>  In my humble opinion it is the parents that are alarmed and have registered complains, not on behalf of their children but for their own want of an easy life and because they have a difficulty excepting difference in our society.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	I would not have thought so. Most children would just be curious, I think.  I think having a disabled presenter is educational for children in some ways as it teaches them that, even with physical disabilities, we are all the same and should all have equal opportunities. I think it would open the minds of children a lot more, if that makes sense.|`|9GbPZUTXaa	If they are then they need to confront it and become accepting. For God's sake, when I was a kid there were terrible sights around, any number of disfigured faces of the WW2 pilots burnt alive when their planes were afire, limbless wounded, and not to mention more common birth defects like clubfoot. Are we meant to hide these people?

They might ask about it -but I doubt they're scared of it.|`|SYU4JIohaa	Children are known to pick up fears from their parents, so if an adult is freaked out by something then most likely their child will be.  <br>  <br>  I think in this case some parents are putting their issues with this presenter onto their children, and instead of seeing this as a positive thing and using it to teach their children about acceptance, they are accusing TV bosses of positive discrimination.<br>  <br>  I'm sure some children are frightened when they first see someone "different", but that should be when the parents step in and teach them, not feed their fears.|`|b7FbWNmlaa	I can't believe this, i think it is truly awful, it is a problem for the parents not the children, we all need to be accepting as a society and  value the fact that we are all different, children with a little discussion can accept all races and disabilities with ease. The parents should use this as an opportunity to discuss the fact that we are all born different, even down to hair and eye colour, arm or no arm is no different and should  embraced that people with disabilities are being portrayed in a positive light on mainstream tv.|`|OVmzkRTOaa	As someone who works with very young children I know that they are very accepting, highly adaptable and brimming with curiosity.<br>  I am inclined to think that it is the parents who have issues and who are discomforted by seeing an image that raises questions they are not at ease with answering.|`|4Yoif38laa	I suspect some may be. Several years ago I was looking after my 5 year-old niece while my brother and his wife had a weekend away. My niece was invited to a birthday party at the local swimming baths. I left her and returned home. A short while later I received a phone call from the birthday girl's mother to say my niece had become hysterical upon seeing another child who had only one arm. A few months later her uncle visited and because he had shoulder surgery his arm was strapped up and not visible. My niece remarked that "Uncle Hugh had two arms last time he came." It is easy for an adult to accept differences, but children may be scared when they see something which they don't perceive as normal.|`|rh8Ph8Xfaa	I just wonder what the reaction would have been if the presenter had been the proverbial black one-legged lesbian with three eyes.<br>  <br>  THAT wouldn't have had a word said about it - <br>  black - racist<br>  lesbian - homophobic<br>  one leg and three eyes - physical deformity (let's build a ramp for her wheelchair etc etc)<br>  <br>  See what I mean|`|JODVNkU8aa	I was really annoyed when I read the story about this.<br>  How can parents be so stupid, have they never heard of sitting the kids down and explaing why the presenter was born without an arm.<br>  Kids see worse things on the tv and computer games.<br>  Kids accept things and are far more open than adults.<br>  Parents just being too protective all for the wrong reasons|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	Most children would be curious rather than scared, it is ignorant parents that are complaining.

I also believe it is not necessarily due to the rarity of seeing it. I have never met a child who is scared of the visual presentation of the storyteller - they are primarily listening to the story. I  think the lady was born with it. Race is the same in this instance. I wonder if those complaining parents could close their eyes and just listen for a minute....they might get a nasty surprise when they realise the story is just the same.<br>  Edit - funny as I asked my boys about this and one said she looked scary and did not like it and the other did not give a hoot|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Parents always teach their children by example, and this is a terrible example of intolerance.

VkzmH1GKaa	Drug abuse has become non newsworthy except in general terms. if someone would step up and really examine a case or several cases from the start to the usually tragic ending it may increase awareness for a while. The problem is drug abuse remains the dirty little secret in most communities that people love to give lip service to and that's all.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	This is a lame response; but, I kind of feel that news outlets are afraid of assigning the cause of death in a drug OD case because the family will file a legal action for a few million dollars. Stabbing and shootings are clearly the causative agent in those stories.  A newspaper with an editorial page and a reader's letter section could offer an excellent platform for attacking the terrible legal and illegal drug abuse problem.  Catching the dealers does not seem to be the solution because there other dealers ready to step into the supply chain.  The medical doctor who routinely over-prescribes narcotics should be targeted for loss of license.  There is not a replacement for a dealer doctor.  In theory.

HJaVcUGwaa	Hamas did not start this war, Israel did. So success or failure is measured by how well the aggressor’s objectives were met. If you noticed throughout the war, Israel never clearly listed a set of objectives, because they knew by doing that, then they would be considered losers in this war if the objectives were not met.<br>  <br>  Implied Israel objectives of the war were:<br>  1) Destroy Hamas or at least weaken it significantly so that they lose control of Gaza<br>  2) Cripple Hamas’s ability to launch rockets<br>  3) Make the Palestinians in Gaza turn against Hamas<br>  <br>  Secondary objective:<br>  4) Free captured Israeli soldier Shalit<br>  <br>  What actually happened:<br>  1) Hamas was not weakened<br>  2) The rockets did not stop or slow down throughout the Israeli war on Gaza. They reached further than ever targets, with greater numbers. They stopped only when Hamas decided to stop; which was 12 hours after Israel ceased firing.<br>  3) Hams popularity in Gaza increased significantly and they have thousands more recruits.<br>  4) Israeli soldier Shalit was not freed<br>  <br>  Additionally,<br>  1) People around the world now know the reality of the Palestine-Israel conflict<br>  2) Israel lost heavily in world public opinion<br>  3) Israel tried in the last few days to achieve a symbolic military victory by occupying Gaza city at least for a few hours, but they could not advance more than just 10s of meters into the city.<br>  4) Israel’s killing and injuring of thousands of civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in Gaza is the opposite of victory, as it just muddied Israel’s reputation even further. It is not difficult to kill thousands of defenseless civilians by one of the most advanced armies in the world. This is normally called cowardess.<br>  5) More and more people are now comparing Zionism to Nazism.<br>  <br>  So looking at the above, I would say that Israel has miserably lost in Gaza, and Hamas won.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	I wonder what was actually their goal as most of the 1300 people killed were women and children and their prime targets included schools and hospitals.|`|tod8jy9Paa	All Israel achieved was to kill over 1300 men, women and children even innocent babies and raise a city to ruins. Hamas can still and do launch rockets into Israel whenever they need to So in fact Israel failed and managed to get world opinion turned against them. Now if they had sat down and gave Hamas the land they wanted all that killing would not have been necessary, but as we all know Israel give nothing they just take and take|`|Acjg6qF0aa	Hamas is evil. All they want is the destruction of Israel and Jewish people. Everything that happend in Gaza was deserving and, if anything merciful in retrospect to what Hamas should have gotten. How long does a country have to put up with a group launching rockets? And when an Israeli died, where was the compassion for them from Gaza? There was none. So, I see no reason to show compassion towards Gaza.<br>  <br>  Israel did nothing to initiate an attack from Hamas. It just has been happening for years. So, after a build up, Israel lashed out, with all understanding as to the reason why. <br>  <br>  Why Hamas would try and attack a country like Israel (the only power in the area) is unclear, Hamas never stood a chance. <br>  <br>  Hopefully Israel isnt done and Hamas finally learns their lesson. Actually, I dont hope Hamas learns its lesson, I want Israel to continue to lash out. It seems the only thing Hamas, Iran, Syria, and many other areas of the middle east understand is violence. Teach them in the way they can understand. The world will be a better place with Hamas.<br>  <br>  LOL, I love whoever is above me's way of thinking. Hamas won? Won what? The right to continue living, thats about all they won. They showed the world they are weak and pathetic. Israel proved its point, and Israel won by Hamas continously wanting to go to peace talks now, unlike before the Israeli attack. Who is the one pushing for peace talks in Egypt? Hamas.<br>  <br>  And anyone who would list a reference of Norman Finkelstein  has some problems. If anyone deserved more to be in one of the buildings Israel bombed, it was this guy. It will be a happy day when this guy leaves this earth.|`|RoLcpujNaa	1) we fought them after 8 years of THIS<br>  eight ******years!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyYsFLttmX8&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyYsFLttm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN5yJzzVmEw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN5yJzzVm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpUnt8O_Ngw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpUnt8O_N...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlBHEFX3mq4&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlBHEFX3m...</a><br>  <br>  2) we didn't achieved anything.

My point is that we spend so much time and money chasing down someone over a doobie and then prosecuting them and keeping up with them via probation etc. <br>  <br>  I honestly don't see the big deal with it considering how alcohol is legal. Alcohol kills so many people via car wrecks/dui and causes so much harm via bar fights, domestic violence, etc. I have never heard of anyone smoking a joint and going out and killing someone innocent in their car.

I think they've switched back to the Tories again now. The Sun used to be further to the right than the Daily Mail, but they've toned down in recent years.<br>  <br>  Daily Mail - right wing reactionary paper, has always backed the Tories except in the 1930s when they backed Oswald Mosley's far-right fascists.<br>  <br>  Daily Express - was traditionally a Tory paper, then switched to Labour in the 1990s, then switched right back again. Currently it's even more right wing than the Daily Mail, I wouldn't be surprised if they backed the BNP in the next election!<br>  <br>  Daily Telegraph - traditional conservative paper, Tory blue through and through. Has the largest, and I think oldest readership of any of the quality dailies. The paper had a very pro-American, neo-con stance under Conrad Black's ownership, but this has lessened a bit under Barclay ownership.<br>  <br>  Independent - despite the name, the paper supports Labour and donates large sums of money to the party.<br>  <br>  Guardian - Labour. Probably the paper most closely associated with the New Labour project, and the paper of choice for the liberal elite.<br>  <br>  Times - not sure who they're backing at the moment.

TxRRITveaa	no, steriods eventually destroys your body. no amount of money or entertainment is worth that much. <br>  <br>  What's great about sports is seeing someone with god-given talent work hard and acheive what we believe to be impossible; that great catch, the last at bat home run, the underdog beating the greatest team ever (usa vs ussr hockey). If those moments were repeated with ease all of those memories we have rooting for our heroes will be lost and diminished. we might as well just watch a video simulation rather than real people play the game.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Everyone in sports is on steroids but only a handful get detected.|`|d12a585a9f486535d07b0683ef24b00eaa	yeah  i guess.

qwXC05gLaa	Honda Accord is going to be a better car.  So, in pure choice, Accord is better.<br>  <br>  Where it is built is only part of the consideration.  Personally, I don't care where it is built.  The profit of that Accord is going to Japan and profit of that Pontiac is going to Detroit and end up in Wall Street.  So, where it is built doesn't really matter.  I would rather pay a fair wage like those in Honda Plants than those over paid UAW workers.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	I owned one Detroit auto.  Have owned Hondas for the last 30 years.  I do not know how to repair or service so I need an auto with dealer backup.  I would say that German vehicles, in spite of price tag, do not show me the reliability track record of the Japanese automakers.  Over the years, I have grown more angry with Detroit and would not consider its products under any circumstances.   The Civic is looking like the Accord of 30 years ago and looks like a bargain in today's market.|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	foreign cars have a better track record than domestic cars do.better gas mileage,better performance,far higher in reliability,emissions standards are better, and yes a lot of them are made right here in the united states.i've owned both american and"foreign" and have had far less problems with the foreign than american.<br>  <br>  i don't necessarily agree with the buy local either now days everyone is trying to keep their money call around for prices and don't be afraid to quote what another dealership is offering think of it as an auction for your business
R5oeDX1xaa	good question.  For one we should look at the question of if Iran is really any threat to anyone at all.  The country itself has never attacked another country.  They have never expressed the desire to.  It is simply the fact that Iran is against the creation of the Jewish state of Israel and with good reason.  If you listen to Ahmadinejad's interview on Larry King, the man doesn't sound like a crazy terrorist.  he sounds very intelligent and what he says makes a lot of sense.<br>  <br>  Venezuela also is no threat to anyone.  They as far as I can tell along with Iran are taking steps to protect themselves as they feel that they have been threatened with military action from the US and from Israel.  <br>  <br>  Russia, N. Korea, and China are all real threats if one just looks at their past military history.<br>  <br>  The US should not support Israel.  It was illegally made and it was made through acts of terrorism.  yes Zionist terrorists.  Rahm Emmanuel's own father was a Zionist terrorist.  Israel has committed so many criminal acts against the civilians living in Lebanon and the Gaza strip.|`|nYCuCYfvaa	Firstly to the guy in the middle, developing -one- weapon would not destroy the U.S. They would need many ICBMs with accurate guiding systems, and there is no possible way the Americans would not see an incoming attack.<br>  If Iran actually launched a nuclear attack against America, Iran would be converted into radioactive vapour almost instantaneously.<br>  <br>  Second, China and the U.S are not going to war anytime soon. China and the U.S have the closest trade/economic partnership in the world. They need each other to stay alive, why the hell would they go to war over something as stupid as crazy religious nutjobs?<br>  <br>  mrs cath: You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. The state of Israel is 100% legitimate, the Jews never removed the Palestinians. The Palestinians sold their land on the premise that the Arabs would "push the Jews back into the sea". They attacked and they lost.<br>  <br>  Stop whining.|`|uiDGbDFraa	There is no real threat. Iran is nothing, absolutely nothing, Think about it, Ahmdinafag is always talking about how much he hates Israel, and how he would nuke it and all that ( wish he does ) but he CANT, he has no power to do so, he has no nukes, its just talking. Just a few weeks ago when Israel launched their Operation Cast Lead on Gaza, he has the best chance to attack Israel, he had the best reasons. But what did he do?<br>  <br>  Nothing, he wasnt even in the media. <br>  <br>  None of those countries have any interest in America, countries only invade others to gain something from them. No one gains anything from attacking the U.S.<br>  <br>  It's just fear repeatedly fed to the masses to justify all the things the U.S. says or does.|`|kYFtoVpXaa	No, if anyone were to attack someone with a nuke, all the other countries in the world would go ape-sh-it and attack that country, CTA- Complete and Total Annihalation.|`|cmhNfMbPaa	Consider the U.S. defense budget, compared to any other country.

T9hl36WUaa	I think a lot of it is attributed to the banks. The banks were lending out money that they did not have to people who could not pay them back, and when the bank started going into debt, the stock market completely crashed. So a lot of them went out of business, and it made it worse when people started pulling out their 401K's and such. This stimulus plan is also bull crap cause theyre not limiting it on what they can spend it on, and so they spend it on brand new jets, and stupid stuff.|`|03n14OLLaa	America has been prosperous so it's like we were blind to the rest of the word's problems.

The reason for this financial mess is that people are buying things they cannot afford. Credit cards make it a lot easier to be able to buy these things, as you do not have to pay for them until the bill comes. But if you cannot afford it, the bill just keeps increasing until your things start becoming repossessed to pay your debts. When that doesnt cover it, you lose your house and ba da bing, recession.|`|OUWTvtVVaa	The advanced countries, not the developing country.

sIv9gaolaa	I totally agree.I have watched CBeebies loads of times with my little cousins and think the girl is so brave not to hide her disability and agree that she shouldn't have to. No wonder kids are bullying other kids with disabilities, they have no understanding. My little cousins love her, she is so talented. My cousins said "Look..that girls arm looks sore" and we explained that she was born like that but she seemed content that she was managing to draw pictures and looks really happy. I admire her for her braveness, and think she should continue doing what she does best.|`|zon13nY2aa	I totally agree.<br>  <br>  No wonder kids are growing up to be complete morons when their parents aren't teaching them about disabilities and reassuring them that people come in all shapes and sizes!<br>  <br>  This subject is really making me cross.

I hope they keep her on.|`|RyRLahS7aa	WHY would you register a complaint about that? What do you want her to do, get a new arm?|`|F89MNQheaa	No I dont think you are wrong, I didnt know who you meant so I googled her and read a sky news report. Parents like that are disgusting, is it any wonder that say for eg  if their child got meningitis and lost a limb due to it then they will be considered a freak as this is what message they are sending to their kids! By not explaining this lady presenter was born this way and it is a disability, nothing to be ashamed of and it is infact very normal these days they are bringing their child up in a discriminative way, will they tell their child not to watch someone because of their race aswell? It makes me so angry that they are allowed to influence their childrens thoughts and beliefs to that extent.|`|CqAK1uiNaa	To be honest i thought we were past this kind of prejudice. As a kid at school i remember people being picked on because they were in some way different. If you wore glasses, if you had a brace on your teeth, if you had ginger hair, if you were very short etc. Such nasty behaviour was once common place, what a shame it still exists in the 21st Century. Why don't the parents simply explain why the lady only has one arm? For God's sake she isn't something out of Doctor Who! She is a Human being doing a job, that's all, so long as she is up to the task, what does it matter? Some people are so pathetic. Anyway i am sure the BBC will ignore such prejudice, for once the BBC are doing something right.<br>  Just hope the lady concerned ignores the ignorance of the few.
