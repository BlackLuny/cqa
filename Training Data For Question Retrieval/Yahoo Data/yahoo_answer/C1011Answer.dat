vucMO9Glaa	Because he is Sr's son and, though I may not be his biggest fan, he is a very good driver.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	I thought his car looked really clean.|`|cKl8ZSrSaa	His daddy|`|NxBljj6Baa	Yeah man, HE IS A GREAT RACER, hehehe...  He had all the view of his daddies hiney as he rode the coat tails of Sr. into racing.  Every time Sr. stopped walking he felt Jr.s nose bump him in the brown eye.  Daddy outfitted him everything and Jr. was too busy clowning around drinking and acting a fool to take advantage of it.  <br>  Now where is Jr.?  He is a fabulas bottom dweller in NASCAR.  He likes to just sap the money from dummies that buy every T-Shirt and hat that is released every year with a new sponsor and car number.  <br>  What has he gave back to racing?  He has gave his heart and soul to drink and party as much as he possibly can.  You better realize that!  This career has not been in vein.  He has set out to accomplish what few men have done before.  When someone lets him know what he wants to accomplish, he will start working on it.  So keep your nose in your own business and stop bashing Jr.  He is still greeving or something like that.  He lost his Daddy, his nose has no one to bump into any more.  I feel really bad for the guy, I guess he will go down in history as the most hmmm, someone remind me of what it is that he has done again?|`|vet4adaYaa	Because he's good driver, has a great attitude, he's a Daytona 500 winner and is a "real" race car driver, and finally, he pisses chumps like you off so much you have to make up lies about him to feel better about your lame driver, that's just a cherry on top of the Sunday ; )|`|58h70voyaa	Because of his Daddy!!

WJdN2zXVaa	probably fly. fly is when you use both hands at the same time and theyre always in sync with eachother. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Ez6_MVxQo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Ez6_MVx...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Swim-Butterfly-Stroke" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Swim-Butterfly-St...</a><br>  <br>  theres also swimming drills that really build up your abs. this is on the ground when you're not in the water. you lay on your back and lift your legs about 6 inches off the ground. keep them there for a minute or two. you should  also kick while theyre off the ground. its reallllyyy hard. but you can feel it immediately when you start doing it.|`|2umKyYEaaa	Fly works on your abs and therefore will probably reduce body fat, but if you're swimming intensively and regularly, any stroke should make you lose weight. I swim and have trouble gaining weight.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you don't know how to do the fly, you shouldn't start learning it just to work on your abs. Try doing crunches or sit-ups instead. It's much exhausting, time consuming and more effective.|`|YSYhog7yaa	any will get rid of fat, and most will work your abs too, so when the fat does go away you'll have a nice stomach too...but any stroke works as long as you do it often, not just 3 times a month|`|f2ZNJy48aa	Definatley fly. It works your abs. And you are using all of the muscles in your body, especially the stomach to make you go forward and out.|`|uDzzZ8zeaa	There is no local fat metabolism in human physiology. That is, you burn fat globally not locally when you spend more calories than you take in. There is not effective way to burn fat only on your belly. Either you burn fat everywhere or you don't. However, you can get stronger abs by exercising, so the most effective way would be dolphin kicks, and to lose fat swimming interval training is king. <br>  I hope this helps.|`|uwXdnoWYaa	How do you do the fly? Well you bring your arms up over your head. And keep your legs together.|`|nZ49ukJvaa	fly, duh

tLLWMy7iaa	That's difficult, hmmm. I guess you could focus on making your legs stronger, because good three-point shooters use mostly leg on their shots. That way, your shot is consistent even when you are tired in a game. Also, you could lay down on your back and shoot the ball straight up into the air to practice your wrist-flick and ball rotation.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Not really.  I mean, the only way I can see to improve your long range game is to practice shooting the 3 ball.
nxymxSUFaa	Plain and simple, it's the geometry of the field.  Distance of the runner from the base verses velocity of the throw but the pitcher verses reaction time.  When you add it all up the advantage goes to the runner 99% of the time.  The pitcher, in this case, is trying to beat the odds.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	There aren't as many good pickoff moves as there used to be.  Also, you can't surprise guys with a good move any more.  Teams have a complete library on every major league pitcher, so a runner can watch the other teams guy go through two dozen pickoff attempts on film before the game even starts.|`|iPWKzzQtaa	If the player has no intention to steal, he is not going to get picked off...as a base runner it's considered very bad to get picked off.<br>  <br>  But occasionally a base stealer gets caught leaning towards 2B..an alert pitcher make the throw to first..the first baseman throws to second..that counts as a pick off.<br>  <br>  the frequency is the same as always,|`|yk4S7uuraa	No more, no less, than it used to be.|`|OUvFSeYeaa	The reason that pickoffs are so rare is because a lot of base-runners don't take very big leads for that reason exactly. They aren't going to risk it. And truly, it's not that rare because you will see 1 or 2 people picked off every week because the pitcher throws it over to first and the runner is stealing. Then he gets caught in a rundown and if he is out, the pitcher gets the pickoff.|`|Nx4mJZVxaa	Its pretty hard for a pitcher to pickoff a man on base.I remember in 2004 that Pedro Martinez picked off Miltan Bradley.bradley took a big lead and martinez threw it to first and got him out then bradley had a spaz attack|`|n10B2mmiaa	pick offs are rare because it is rare to see a big enough lead to even pick the guy off|`|5EuOTAjJaa	I think it is because there has been a subtle shift in the baseball world to recognizing that wasting a lot of time during the game trying to pickoff runners is a zero sum game.<br>  Because it distracts the pitcher from doing his primary job. Concentrating on getting the batter out.<br>  Plus the slide step delivery is making it more difficult for the average runner to wander very far off the base.|`|GwawzO5Faa	Very few pitchers have a good/deceptive move to first.<br>  <br>  Andy Pettitte is great at it.

Y26eOD9Caa	I own that movie.  If you watch Achilles closely, you can see elements of Keysi in his body movements.  On another note, I try not to bash anyone who is being creative, but Keysi, while it looks cool, seems awkward, and prone to leaving you at disadvantages, positionally (too much infighting, too much leaning in, leading with your head)   It looks to be all flash; a great style for the screen, not too practical for real life i'd have to study it for myself, or see it in action to make an informed decision as to it's effectiveness, but there really isn't anywhere in my area that teaches it.|`|V9ucqn5caa	Well, in an article I read in Black Belt Magazine, batman was the first movie it was ever used in. So unless Troy is relatively recent, I highly doubt it was.<br>  Ya never know, though.
Ucbnl7VJaa	No license and yes at 18 you can buy black powder. There are rules on storage for large quantities but under 10(maybe 20?) pounds you can just store it in the factory container.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	there shouldn't be a problem. blackpowder in its ready form will incur a haz-mat shipping fee when ordering online. <br>  <br>  if you run into problems you can always do it the old way- purchase each of its separate components without a hazmat fee or ID check and mix it at home to your choice of blackpowder (they're like 100 different mixes)<br>  <br>  where I live there is no license to buy BP or GP, there is a federal law that limits the possession of BP up to 50 lbs.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	At age 18, the procedure is the same as buying anything else. You go to the store, give them money, and they give you the powder. It helps if you know which granulation you're wanting. It wouldn't do to get FFFg if you need FFg.|`|hSOHLKUNaa	you can buy black powder but in the future you will have heart problems if you take black powder|`|yaq7oaH6aa	They sell it by the pound.<br>  (It's not a real good idea to store more than<br>  that in any one place anyway.)<br>  If you're 18 there should be no problem.|`|r16CvqSCaa	as far as I know you can buy it|`|PcOEPKfIaa	black power is mostly sold in 1 pound cans of different grain sizes. 1f, 2f, 3f, 4f. to fit your usage .no license needed  . but check your state laws!! i hope its used only in appropriate firearms.

lYnkvRASaa	I don't think it will ever be challenged.  That is almost 12 full seasons.<br>  <br>  Strange he did that back in the era of all that fighting and risk of injury.  Today with our ban fighting plans to make it safe it almost has to happen right?  Extra Sarcasm added.  <br>  <br>  Seriously today's game is faster, guys are generally bigger and there seems to be less respect for each other out there.  In that environment I don't see anyone going 12 yrs without some injury too keep them out of a game.|`|9ujT56Maaa	We may never see it broken.  Jarvis was among the last of the true "tough guys" of the NHL.  Extra safety protocols have decreased the importance of toughness in a hockey player, allowing more skill players who whine at getting a hangnail to make it to the big stage.  (Also, the fact that controlled substance testing is far more common these days also has had its effect on ironman streaks).  Maybe another old-school hardass will emerge in the league sometime soon, but I'm not holding my breath.|`|UoUaO52taa	It's almost 12 full yrs but I think not. Then again everyone said Lou Gehrig's ironman streak of 2130gms was unbreakable and Cal Ripken Jr. beat it by 500gms|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	I started working out this morning for my comeback...........I think that may be the one record I can break!  If I don't die first!|`|Q6Dyu1zKaa	I think it is very unlikely that Jarvis' record will ever be broken.  Mostly because of the way the NHL has changed the way they handle concussions.  When Jarvis played you would often see or hear about a player "getting their bell rung" and they would be back on the ice within a couple of shifts and back in the line up for the next game.  Now a player that suffers the same type of injury is more likely to be held out of the line up until team doctors had ruled out a concussion and/or any concussion like symptoms had cleared up.|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	With the way they've changed the game to almost promote head hunting, to force tired players to stay on the ice after icings and with more travel and less time off, I don't think there's much of a chance that we'll ever see anything close to Jarvis' streak again, at least not in the immediate future until they smarten up and fix some flawed rules.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Maybe a 3rd/4th line guy who isn't playing 20+ minutes a game.  But even then...that's 12 seasons of no injuries.  No groin pulls, no sprains, no shoulder injuries, no wrist injuries, no knee stuff.<br>  <br>  In the current form that the game is being played...I don't see it happening.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	I would say yes. Maybe not in our lifetime, but i don't think that it is an untouchable record. Very difficult,yes, but not unachievable.
a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	1) When Glenn Anderson was called out, it really didn't do a whole lot either way (and I realize that Glenn has neither confirmed or denied the allegations to this day despite all thr sources which claim he is)<br>  <br>  2) Again, I don't think there would be much of an effect either way<br>  <br>  3) I can't speak for today's players, but in my day, they would have made his life a living hell.  Back then far fewer people 'came out' and I think that the gay lifestyle was less understood.  Fast forward 40 years and while I think that the lifestyle is more understood, and we are aware of gay people more than ever, I'm still not so sure that it would be accepted by 100% of the players.<br>  <br>  4) Again, as in #3.  I think that society has come a long way in the 40 years when it comes to openly gay athletes (especially as 40 years ago I don't believe that there were any 'openly gay' athletes).  I do think that the fans would be more tolerant than players though.<br>  <br>  5) I think Bettman would find the positive aspects of it and preach tolerance.  He's a very smart man and understands that based on 'publicized ratios' that there is probably at least one gay player in the NHL, and respects that players rights.  Players are tested regularly for AIDS as the NHL is considered a blood sport and while those player's names are currently kept private the positive test has to be made public - and in today's society - we know that it would eventually leak out.  (There have been no positive HIV tests under this program to date).|`|FY17j1Ajaa	A player that came out would have to be incredibly courageous or incredibly stupid. The pressure, the media circus, would be unbearable. If that player got traded or demoted, the media would crucify that team for being homophobic. This player would be a major distraction in the clubhouse, only because the media wouldn't let it rest. His team would suffer.|`|FEIXGtQyaa	I'm pretty open to other peoples life styles; i don't judge people depending on their sexual preference. I don't hate the homosexual community and it's their choice, or how they were born.<br>  <br>  I can't speak for Canada, but I know there are a lot of people in America that are for and are against gay rights and such.<br>  <br>  So, I'm not sure when it comes to this. But I don't understand why people would quit watching the sport all together, or just quit watching the team because of the sex a player likes...<br>  Just because a dude likes a dude, that doesn't affect how they play.... haha|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I think it would hurt the sport.  I mean, no offense to gay people, but the general public of sports fans would probably think less of hockey player for being gay.  Its not right, but the thing is that hockey players are supposed to be tough and macho, and gays are thought of to be feminine and girly.  Its just how society thinks, and I think it would hurt the sport.<br>  <br>  I think it would help the gay rights movement.  I mean they would have a high profile sports figure on their side.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of players would react badly.  I mean, some may say they wouldn't care, but I think deep down they would be uncomfortable.  I mean, these are guys you're in the locker room, get dressed in front of, shower with, etc.  To know one of them is gay would be very uncomfortable.  I mean, you'd wonder if the guy is looking at you sexually while youre in the shower and stuff.  Its kinda the same thing why women and men don't share locker rooms and shower together in public gyms.  Again, while some may say its not right, its the truth and its how things are in society.<br>  <br>  I think the fans would have a mixed reaction.  I mean, some fans of that player and that team would stand behind him (no pun intended) just the way Yankee fans are standing behind A-Roid with the steroid use, not really comparing being gay to using steroids, but just using it as an example that fans of a team will stand behind a player no matter what.  I think opposing fans would be VERY harsh, probably shouting derrogatory comments at him, and probably being very rough.<br>  <br>  Bettman, well I dont know.  I mean, I'm pretty sure he would have to be "politically correct" so regardless what his own personal feelings are, he'd have to be very cautious in how he addressed it.|`|42ef902b67cef343060a46d1d7776268aa	I don't think it would do much of anything to hockey in the long run...it hasn't really done much to the NBA now that John Ameche has come out as being gay.<br>  <br>  I think it would help the gay rights movement...any movement wants as many high-profile names and faces as possible.<br>  <br>  I think most other players would be ok with it...but you'd always have the Tim Hardaway type who is really pissed off about it.<br>  <br>  I don't think there would be that big an uproar from Bettman or the fans...|`|qDeoA37Daa	im guessing this isnt hypothetical is it?|`|jRTJbmEDaa	RANGERS SUCK!!!|`|MnMkgAscaa	Buttman would ask him out on a date.|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	I see no difference, but that might just be my view. Bottom line if you do your job and do it well who cares what you do at home. It would have the same effect as when baseball players came out, people would just say, really I never would have thought....then back to business.<br>   I feel it would help gays in the states get into the game a bit which could be great for the game, I know there is a sector of Canada that is primarily gay and they love there hockey up there.<br>  <br>  Edit: I wonder what kind of shenanigans these deviants tried on bOb....|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	First off I am sure ther are gay players. Whether any are the superstars , I am really not sure. But I think in the US there are unfortunately too many people that still have a problem with gay men . Especially in Sports. They seem to be much more tolerant of lesbians. See various "out" Tennis and Basketball women players .I do not think it would overly hurt hockey in the long term. In short term, some would no longer watch. But the again some would start to watch because of it. Some because they hae a gay role model and some to see if the "fruit" ( Sorry Greg I am trying to say what those people would say) would bet his butt kicked . I think that the gay rights movement could site any gay pro athlete as a point to show that there is no difference between gays and straight people. Some players would be upset, but most I am sure would be supportive. I have seen a poll on that somewhere , but can't find it right now . I think I have covered how some fans would react earlier in this answer. As for Bettman . If he had smarts , he would embrace that player ( no Gay Bettman Jokes ) And try to use it as a selling point. That our game is truly for everyone from every walk of life. Hockey would be the most accepting then  . Unfortunately It may be a long time before the right player with the right amount of guts  does come out while still an active player  . A bit sad really. This coming from a straight female hockey player|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	I don't think it would really help or hurt. Some homophobs would quit watching but would be replaced by the homos that start watching.<br>  <br>   I don't think it would help or hurt their movement. Remember the former NBAer came out of the closet and it was only talked about for a week. (Ameche maybe? Can't remember) He would be considered a hero in the gay community though.<br>  <br>   There would be a negative reaction from the players for the most part IMO. Though they might not come right out and say as much. There is a trust factor there......that he was in the closet was misleading and may be looked at as mistrust? Gays are a deviant bunch (generally speaking)<br>  <br>    Opposing fans would have some real fuel for the fire. Fans of the gay player (The NYR ...LOL) would.....well I am not sure.....mixed reaction.<br>  <br>   Bettman would not react.<br>  <br>  <br>   Hope I was respectful enough for ya' cupcake. (I kid)<br>  <br>   EDIT*-Oops......well, I guess I will say no offence intended but I said it and I will stick by it. Remember, I am saying "generally speaking" and yes, I am stereotyping when I make the "deviant" comment. In my experience (have worked with a few gays over the years) and they were deviant.

AA11570394	Pretty soon most will be stocked up enough they won’t be buying much and it will subside some. I would say within 6 months. That is unless some unforeseen event occurs. <br>  <br>  Personally I don’t see HR 45 passing but I would bet the assault weapons ban will be reinstated before Christmas this year. Obama himself stated he is supportive of that ban as have numerous democrats. So I would stock up on high capacity magazines while they are legal.  <br>  <br>  And despite what dca20033 like’s to ramble on about; “we the people” are now represented by a majority of liberals who loathe guns. And their track record is passing restrictive gun laws every time they are a majority in our government. I doubt they will change their tune. And no one is going to create a civil war because of new gun laws, just wont happen! Oh there are some who will fight to the death, problem is not many. The rest of America won’t give up; fast food, malls, stocked grocery stores, paychecks, their homes, cars, and all the other things they are used to. So all this brouhaha that every gun owner will battle Uncle Sam in the streets is bull sh*t!|`|0cLj35Fgaa	I don't know exactly how long it will last.  However, this feeding frenzy is not permanently sustainable.  If the economy gets worse (which is possible) then fewer people will have enough money to spare on additional firearms.  If I had to guess, it would be about 1 year.  Obama may not try to implement more firearms legislation just yet, since his hands are tied up with the economy (and also partly with Afghanistan).<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: 45 cal, what makes you think that a republican will undo an assault weapons ban?  I don't see any republicans trying to repeal the machine gun ban.  What makes you think that a republican would risk getting negative publicity from liberals and anti-gun mommies?  Over the next four years, the republican party will probably be undergoing a series of reformations (and support for firearms may be on the cut list).  Also, just look at the proposed assault weapons ban.  It has a lot of republican sponsors.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* No, there has been a Culture of Fear Created Artificially, Phony,  Irrational, Fictitious, Unreal, False, Insincere, Disingenuous, Delusional Frenzy on Guns & Ammo beyond belief similar to what happened after September 11th when Gun Sales increased 70+% and Ammo sales increased at 140%.* Unbelievable, Unfounded, and Unnesscessary.* " Only a Criminal, Tyrant or Tyrannical Government is Afraid of the Armed Citizen."..

Shifting the demand curve up (from threat of future decreased supply) raises prices. Higher prices (and potentially higher profits) encourages more companies to begin supplying. Increases in supply lowers prices. While the ammo market may have reeled at first from the influx of business, an equilibrium will be reached either when prices go so high demand falls, or when supply finally catches up. I predict supply will soon ( a few months) catch up with demand, ceteris paribus.

Looks like they didn't have to look very hard in your case.  Also, it states where you have to have a permit then the county judge or county sheriff usually has some say so.  They usually don't have to have a reason to deny, they can deny just because they want to, also.<br>  <br>  In April 2004, Ohio's concealed carry statute went into effect. The law (Ohio Revised Code 2923.12, et seq.) allows persons 21 and older to receive a concealed handgun license provided that they receive a minimum of 12 hours of handgun training (10 hours of classroom instruction and 2 hours of range time) from a certified instructor, demonstrate competency with a handgun through written and shooting tests, pass a criminal background check, and meet certain residency requirements.[162]<br>  <br>  The licenses are issued by county sheriffs.<br>  <br>  The statute prohibits any person with any drug conviction from receiving a license, as well as any person convicted of a felony and those who have been convicted of certain misdemeanor crimes of violence within three years (ORC 2923.125).<br>  <br>  The law contains language that asserts it is a "law of general application" and thus supersedes any local ordinances that are more restrictive than state law. However, as of July 2006, at least two court cases brought by municipalities are challenging this language as being in violation of Ohio's Constitution. Both of which have been denied by appeals courts as having no "merit" and being in direct violation of Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution often called the “home rule” amendment, states that municipalities “shall have authority to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations, as are not in conflict with general laws.” No matter what any local judge says, the law is clear according to the Ohio Supreme Court. It is a general law if it complies with the following:<br>  <br>  1. What is a General Law? To constitute a general law for purposes of the Home Rule Amendment, a statute must (1) be part of a statewide and comprehensive legislative enactment (2) apply to all parts of the state alike and operate uniformly throughout the state (3) set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations, rather than merely grant or limit legislative power of a municipal corporation to set forth police, sanitary, or similar regulations (4) prescribe a rule of conduct upon citizens generally. City of Canton v. State (2002), 95 Ohio St. 3d 149, 766 N.E.2d 96<br>  <br>  The new CCW rules fall under ALL of these requirements<br>  <br>  a. They are part of a statewide law that anyone can understand b. they apply to ALL parts of the state and create a uniform law that ALL must follow c. they set forth new rules that ALL peace officers MUST follow d. they set a code of conduct upon all citizens that have the CCW. And require that code be followed|`|dfBwVxXFaa	probably not, it was a violent charge.

EGe0k8P6aa	All this supposes you're using rifle barrels. That said, the Aguila .22 LR Super Maximum takes the prize. It has 204 ft-lbs of muzzle energy. Next up is the Aguila .22LR Interceptor, CCI's Stinger, and CCI's Segmented Hollow Point. All three are in the 192-191 ft-lbs of muzzle energy range with the Interceptor having just a hair more power. Next up is the CCI Velocitor at 183 ft-lbs of muzzle energy. Below that you have the various other hyper-velocity rounds by CCI and Remington.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	CCI Stinger<br>  .22LR - 1640 FPS<br>  32 Grain Copper Plated HP<br>  191 ft-lb energy at muzzle<br>  <br>  CCI Velocitor<br>  .22LR - 1435 FPS<br>  40 Grain Copper Plated HP<br>  183 ft-lb energy at muzzle|`|RYDSc5Bqaa	The Aguila Interceptor is the fastest .22LR with a 40 grain bullet.

Be aware that these super velocity .22 are not known for their accuracy.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	Aguila Interceptor and CCI Velociter.<br>  <br>  The lighter rounds don't carry their energy down range as well.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	CCI Velociter, possibly there is another load from a different manufacturer.|`|CutogVC1aa	These are Hyper Velocity, but anything that says High Velocity will do the job.

AA11016927	Out of your 10 options I would look seriously at South Florida, New Orleans, & Galveston. <br>  <br>  <br>  "Nawlin's" would probably be your "best bet" for an inexpensive, FUN, fishing trip. Because Nawlin's is going through a "re-building period" you can find CRAZY good deals on Hotels/Condos, rental vehicles, fishing guides, Etc. <br>  <br>  The fishing in and around New Orleans can be quite good, (esp for a shore-fisherman). And you have the luxury of either Saltwater OR Freshwater fish. I'll bet you could get a GREAT deal on a guide, if you wanted one.  <br>  <br>  Not to mention the fantastic site-seeing, GREAT food, good music, Etc.  <br>  <br>  South Florida- Great fishing! But, hotel/condo/housing can get expensive QUICK. And many areas in SF you do need a boat to fully experience how great the fishing can be. For those reason's I'd look elsewhere in Florida. <br>  <br>  My favorite place to visit in Fla is St. Augustine. If I had to choose my 4 favorite places in Fla they would be Pensacola, St. Augustine, The Keys (beyond Marathon), & Titusville.  All of these areas offer GREAT fishing without all the "commercial", "touristy" crap you see in other areas of the State.   <br>  <br>  The reason I pick St. Augustine as my fav? <br>  <br>  My kids love Disney/Universal and Orlando is only 1 1/2-2 hours away. We can "visit" Orlando and get back to the little community of St. A within a few hours escaping the "headache" of Orlando. It has great beaches and tons of site-seeing opportunity's, (St. Augustine is the oldest city in America that harbors a huge spanish fort, Ripley's Believe it or Not, various art community's, Etc).

Its great for shore fishing, with great wading opportunities; for Bonefish, Tarpon etc. I go with a fly rod and wade the flats, but lure fishing is perfectly possible.<br>  <br>  Its a great place for the family too, my wife loves going, due to the great beaches.

There are charter boats available for half-day and all-day trips, party boats where you can fish with about 50 others, docks and piers, surf fishing and jetties. Also in the area are several fresh water lakes and rivers where you can catch bass, bream, crappie, catfish, bullfrogs, etc. If you go at the right time there are many tournaments, including shark and cobia, running from there.<br>  There are also beaches available for the entire family to swim in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as a water-based amusement park (Big Kahunas) and multiple choices for accommodations in Destin or nearby towns.|`|ExaerfDraa	I second Destin, Larggest fishing fleet in Florida, Piers, Jetties, Surf, Bay fishing. I was out on the jetty a few days ago and caught Bonito, Blue Fish, and a spanish mack. When I was leaving a guy pulled in a 30-40 lb gag grouper on a live pinfish on the bottom. Plenty of charters but if you want to catch some speckled trout and redfish check out Dawn Patrol Charters and talk to Capt JT. Great guy.|`|tThI3nWiaa	Go to the Oregon Inlet fishing center on the Outer Banks of North Carolina . The fleet there is second to none .

1Ihf8Ixeaa	I agree, Crocs are very nice for walking around in a pool area. But try the website below, there are some flip flops by speedo or tyr that work just as well.  <br>  <a href="http://www.swimoutlet.com/Sandals_s/357.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.swimoutlet.com/Sandals_s/357....</a>|`|f2ZNJy48aa	Crocks. I swim and for swim meets and walking around on deck, I wear Crocks. They are comfy and have good support. Crocks aren't the cheapest, but they range from $15-$25. But they are definetly worth every penny. And the come in many different color choices. And they are waterproof.
cqps4ujeaa	Well, at first I would have said Oakland hands down, but I'll measure it up in three categories, drafting/contracts, coaching and on field performance.<br>  <br>  I'd give drafting to the Raiders (ugh) only because they draft players who they think will be good, while Detroit tries what I call "Overloading".  They try to improve a position by using a high draft picks until it's filled.  Best example, WR's, 4 in the first round and only 1 left on the roster.<br>  <br>  Contract management I'd give to the Lions because they don't have the opportunity to screw up a contract due to the fact they don't have any talent outside of Johnson.  The Raiders made two massive mistakes last year, giving Javon Walker a dollar, let alone 40 million and signing Deangelo Hall, who got hurt by Asomugha's talent due to the fact he was thrown to nearly every time.<br>  <br>  So... half and half<br>  <br>  Coaching is tough.  I think the Raiders have better coaches, but they have no opportunity to even implement their systems, thus their players can't develop.  The Lions had Steve Mariucci, who led the Lions to a 7-9 season last year, although went 1-7 in their last 8 games.  They fired him and hired some useless coach.  Sure, 7-9 isn't great, but it's a lot better than 0-16.<br>  <br>  Coaches are tied...?<br>  <br>  On field performance is pretty easy.  The Raiders have win games, the Lions couldn't.  Raiders get the point by default.<br>  <br>  So, the Lions are worse, except when they get lucky and get a Barry Sanders or a Calvin Johnson.  The Raiders have picks that could still be great, if Russel gets an o-line and shows he has the will to win.  If Mcfadden can avoid turf toe, he could be a great runner.<br>  <br>  That said, they're both pretty bad|`|rNUyV1EYaa	The Raiders. The Lions already took step one to recovery by getting rid of Matt Millen.<br>  <br>  If you want to get to the third worst team, pick my Cowboys. Jerry Jones will never figure out he's not the only reason they won three Super Bowls in the 1990's. And 1996 just keeps getting farther and farther away...|`|cbb0a0d0de389b758b2597f821be31aaaa	Al Davis is clearly out of his mind and Oakland is a mess, but the numbers don't lie and Detroit is in the middle of one of the worst runs in NFL history.<br>  <br>  Detroit|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	Raiders. At least the lions do try to stay the course and let it play out as far as a coach and philosophy. Al is constantly hiring and firing coaches.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I think Detroit is worse. Their managers seem to be incompetent. The Raiders management just seem to be egotistical.|`|20zLmf3Laa	Tough question to answer. The Raiders are owned by Al Davis and I can't see them improving until he's either removed by the league, because he's senile or God forbid, if he died while still being owner of the team. Yeah Detroit went 0-16 last season but the season before they were 7-9, and at least the Fords are showing some effort to be better by firing Matt Millen (though long overdue).|`|oXnsELl9aa	Oaklend by far.

ch04T8YRaa	Do the hurdle technique while sitting on the floor. Have one leg(lead leg) out in front of you with the toe up and have the other(the trail leg) bent at your side as you do when running a hurdle. Do the arm movements. Count 3 strides-3 arm movements and then bring the arm opposite your lead leg out in front of you, bent at a 90 degree angle as if you're looking at your watch and bring the other arm back. Lean your torso as you do this, just as if you were really clearing a hurdle. Do not rotate your torso, it'll get you off balance. This'll help a little with technique, though it's not really a stretch.

The day that Senior and Junior both started for the Ms and both hit home runs could not have been written any more perfectly.

Likewise, the round is not one you'd choose for defense, so no useful data comparing different loads are readily available for stops, what with superior weapons like an inexpensive shotgun so readily available.|`|hphqiBEuaa	what twist is your gun's barrel.

Get a pistol, at least a .380 or larger, loaded with Glaser Safety Slugs.  If your circumstances dictate that you have to stick with the rifle, any of those bullet weights should be adequate.<br>  The reason I mentioned the neighbors' houses is that if you do have to fire a round or two at some lowlife, and miss, and injure or kill a neighbor, you're going to become more familiar with the inside of police stations and courtrooms than you should ever have to be.   That could be a problem even if you're successful in dropping the deviant, using that type of gun, especially if your local prosecutor is a flaming left-winger Democrat with national political ambitions.

Most stores will not give you to much for your old putter though....<br>  <br>  Good luck!

ll2y4YIGaa	if you like the wrist shots, the xxxx<br>  if you like slap shots a lot, the one95<br>  <br>  id reccomend the one95 because its more durable.<br>  and plus it puts out a pretty decent wristshot.<br>  <br>  oh and by the way, the xx is the same thing as the xxxx.<br>  the difference is a tad lighter for the xxxx and the xx is all black.|`|axxQzOCHaa	I have tried Easton, CCM + Sherwood composite sticks with varying levels of success.<br>  Teammates of mine use the XXXX or One95 and seem happy with what they are using. <br>  Don't know if you've used a Easton Stealth but that's what my teammate with the XXXX was using previously and he's noticed a big difference.<br>  <br>  As far as flex:<br>  75 flex is usually for those players weighing under 150 or who primarily take wrist shots. Keep in mind that if you have to cut the shaft, the flexiblity of the shaft will be hampered, meaning it won't bend as much it should make it a bit more durable as a result however|`|zgPr8HQyaa	If you have to buy the sticks, I would suggest buying neither, and getting something cheaper like an old synergy.  At 13 you're not going to be strong enough to really take advantage of the flex, and youre likely cutting the shafts down, which further diminishes the flex.<br>  <br>  Out of the 2, I'd say to get a One95, I havent liked any of the vapor series of stick since the XX (which I wish they'd bring back)<br>  <br>  I use an Easton Synergy Elite or the Reebok O-stick, Love both of them.|`|t6TEqWvsaa	Vapor XXXX mostly everyone on my hockey team has one     you'll love it!!

vAi8HvMpaa	I'd go for an A5 or 98 Custom. The A5 has a better loading system but you can upgrade the 98 more, including the loading system. It depends on if you're looking to upgrade or get the gun and get out there.|`|13bc7214bebe9f20a8000b9480b7b9d7aa	Just go, play around with your friends markers and decide which one you like best...<br>  <br>  There are benefits and draw backs to all markers.<br>  <br>  A5s along with 98s are very durable and reliable, you can operate on CO2 or HPA, and you rarely have to do work on them.<br>  <br>  The draw back is rate of fire, A5's and 98's are mechanical markers... no electronics unless you spend another pretty penny to get an e-grip, however, this will still not bring it to level with a speedball marker of equal value.<br>  <br>  As for speedball, and along with it rate of fire, the Ion, along with its little brother the Vibe, are common choices for your price range.  These markers are electro-pneumatic, meaning that they operate by a switch of some sort (tripped by the trigger) going to a circuit board which fires the marker.  They provide a nice rate of fire for the price.<br>  <br>  I own an Ion, so I can tell you the drawbacks to it first hand, and I will assume its little brother is no better.<br>  <br>  1. Smartparts melts epoxy in the board so that you cannot upload upgrades, instead you will buy a new board. ($100+)<br>  <br>  2. Out of the box, you will almost have to buy a new feedneck (locking) so that either your hopper will fit in it or it wont fall out as it will be either too tight or too loose. ($25)<br>  <br>  3. The stock trigger is crap.  Considering the best way to get the highest rate of fire, it is impossible.  You cannot "walk" the trigger because the lower pull is too close to the trigger frame. ($25)<br>  <br>  4. The trigger pivots in the wrong place.  This is a simple engineering flaw that has terrible impact.  If you are holding the marker properly, its just off.  The pivot needs to be set back about half an inch. (unfixable)<br>  <br>  5. They tend to be plagued with problems, I know a guy who has, over about a year and a half, upgraded every part in his Ion because the parts needed to be replaced.<br>  <br>  Personally, if you are wanting to go down the speedball road, I would go with either a Dangerous Power G3 ($300), it is a very good deal, or possibly a FEP Quest, my friend mentioned in point 5 bought one and likes it better than his Planet Eclipse 07 EGO.<br>  <br>  In woods, the A5 is great, dont get suckered into the X7, it is simply an A5 internals with cosmetics and a lighter body (which means more kick, trust me, it matters).  I personally carry a Tiberius T9 Elite, look it up, its a great marker, but probably out of your price range.|`|ijJzcp6waa	personally get the vibe,reds ion ,smartparts ion or spyder electra 08 for begineer to mid player and get hpa tank|`|xfRwel49aa	I agree with the dude|`|vF5lU8zeaa	Tippman A5,9 smart parts vibe,spyder, ion all pretty good guns.|`|QcmNHRzyaa	Proto is coming out with a new $200 SLG.

z4IcQZGdaa	after ice out fishing is great, both of the previous suggestions work fine, the key is something that looks slow and wounded, because its still probably cold and the northerns metabolisms will be slow so they will look for an easy and sometimes smaller meal, instead of chasing big baitfish and waisting energy, i like to use a slow trolled flutter spoon, or regular spoon, and slow trolled stick baits like rapalas are great too, also try slower retrieve spinner baits, just hav a variety and try everything till one works|`|c81fa0395c7807a69ecfa0cdd3674cb1aa	pike fishing is usually best after ice out. use a live sucker to catch pike or a big lure like this (<a href="http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_93418_100020002_100000000_100020000_100-20-2)" rel="nofollow">http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a> will catch them|`|lECmz3SEaa	frogs or minnows on a steel leader on any rig you can devise|`|7royFhIgaa	It is good after the ice is out.

qyATAaeXaa	I thought about this for awhile. I also have a rather large calf and likewise have done significant modifications to my Salomon alpine boots. I mostly Telemark now and have less issues with my calf because the boot shells are much shorter. I wear Garmont boots. <br>  <br>  Garmont also makes Alpine and Alpine Touring boots. The Alpine boots are typical 4 buckle models, but some of their AT/Ski Mountaineering boots are 3 buckle styles that are shorter (31.5cm.) These should work in standard bindings as well, so you shouldn't have to switch them either. The boots in the link I've provided also have an instep that is more similar to a telemark boot. It has an independent hinged tongue which may help with your high instep.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.garmontusa.com/621706211.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.garmontusa.com/621706211.html</a><br>  <br>  It's worth a shot, even if it means you have to switch bindings. Figure it's a small price to pay for the comfort.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	I'm in almost the same situation, but mine are the performa 8.  I need to replace my boots next season and I suspect that I will return to a current model Salomon.  I will ask my boot fitter who does some of the best work in the country, (Seattle)  and he is usually very up to date on what the boot makers are changing.   My boots were cut down an inch around the top of the shell and I expect that the same thing will be done again.  Get the boot that fits the best to start with and then start modifying it for a perfect fit.   Longer bails for the top buckles can be installed in most boots and that will allow you to close the top buckle.  I really hope this helps.
GDqMm7r0aa	New jersey has nothing to do with why the deer are rubbing.

However, if you get up early enough, you'll have a little time to wake up before you hit the road.  <br>    My tip would be to get up 45 minutes before your run, eat carbs(muffin), a banana, and some gatorade.<br>    If you can find friends to run with, that's even better, b/c that will help you to stay committed to your time, and friends will help keep you awake.   <br>  Good luck|`|RjxgEUijaa	if you wanna run around 7 AM, i suggest you get up around 6-6:30 and eat something with alot of carbs and protein.

TeNIStN1aa	Both calibers will be effective on deer sized games.<br>  <br>  If you hunt at places where a magazine capacity restriction is in effect, then a Mosin Nagant will suite you better unless you can find a reliable 5 shot magazine or a good magazine block for Enfields.<br>  <br>  A Enfield No 4 will be better suited for hunting due to its receiver sight. Hitting targets at long range will be much easier with a receiver sight compare to standard iron sights. Receiver sights will even outperform cheaper scopes under low light conditions. If you decided to chop up and sporterize those old battle rifles, Enfields will still be a more desirable choice due to their bend down bolt handles. You must modify a Mosin Nagant's bolt handle if you want to mount a scope.<br>  <br>  PS: Please don't chop up or sporterize any old rifles that are collectable.|`|QrjuueMCaa	MoNags are good for batting practice.

0MJRD9sYaa	You have to do an offline draft to be able to use keepers. I'm 80% sure of that.|`|4uSRVZNNaa	you have to go to commisioner tools and manually enter your leagues keepers.  so once you have determined your draft order and have the keepers from all your managers, you enter them manually like it was an offline draft.  <br>  so if you have 4 keepers for example, you would manually enter the keepers for all your managers and the draft would start with round 5.<br>  I have never personally done this but I am in a keeper league and that is how the commish in our league did it.|`|0Rvm65njaa	You have to  manually enter them at the commish tools tab and scroll all the way down to Draft management.  From there you can enter each keeper for each team, round by round.  However, wait until all manages have joined the league, because everytime someone joins it will reset the pre draft keeper input and you'll end up re-inputting all the info.
0MJRD9sYaa	Don't do it.|`|4uSRVZNNaa	I see this as being in your favor.  your are getting the more proven players here. <br>  my breakdown:<br>  <br>  david wright. by far the best player in this deal. a top 5 fantasy player.  no one else here can contribute in all 5 standard categories.<br>  carlos pena. likely a lock for 30+ hr and 100+ rbis.  will hurt you a bit in BA but as long as he stays healthy he has good protection in the line up with longoria, upton and crawford hitting around him.<br>  hunter pence. decent contributor that will neither help nor hurt you really. gives you stat support in all 5 cats.<br>  ted lilly.  hurts you a bit in era and whip but a virtual lock for double digit wins and 150+ Ks.  solid contributor who to me is underrated every year.<br>  <br>  the other end:<br>  chris davis. probably could have the biggest year of the players you are giving up.  30+ hr, 100+ rbis and runs is the potential here.  no speed.  could be a top 20 guy.  but wright is top 5.<br>  jacoby ellsbury. runs and sb guy.  virtually useless for hrs and rbis.  but you have han ram, wright and pence who will more than make up for that loss of speed.<br>  kevin youkilis. an on base/run scoring guy who finally cranked it up for some contribution in hr, rbis and avg last year.  yes he's a solid but can he repeat?  doubt it.  manny's gone so less lineup protection.  rated as high as he is b/c of 1b/3b eligibility. otherwise overrated.<br>  james shields. could very well have better numbers than lilly.  or not.  largely unproven to me.<br>  <br>  this same trade in say 2-3 years would be very different and likely more even mainly because most of the guys you are giving up are younger and unproven.  if this is a keeper league you may want to give this more thought.  but you're getting david wright.  nuff said.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	I would take that deal|`|faf42318f3fc2bbe429706ae27cc12a9aa	Basically I see this in your favor. Anytime you can get a top 5 player for a group of later round players, you should do it. You lose out on SB with Ellsbury, but you can probably pick up SB's with Taveras or Bourn. <br>  <br>  2009 projections<br>  <br>  <br>  Carlos Pena 88 run 37HR 114 rbi 1 .257<br>  David Wright 112 run 31HR 109 rbi 21 .308<br>  Hunter Pence 77 run 27HR 82 rbi 12 .275<br>  Ted Lilly 180 k 16W 3.93 era  1.23 whip<br>  <br>  Jacoby Ellsbury 98 10 51 49 .286<br>  Chris Davis 92     33    102 5 .280<br>  Kevin Youkilis    94    24 105   4     .300<br>  James Shield 159 k 16W 3.77  1.17|`|aiBSMFWmaa	Wright is by far the best player in the deal! But the you have to sit back and see if your overpaying.<br>  <br>  I dislike Pena, his batting avg. can destroy your entire teams but his pwr numbers are good. Hunter pence is up and comming, and in a season considered a sompmore fluke, he hit 25 HRs, so hes comming along. <br>  <br>  Jocoby and Davis have excellent long term, as well as 09 value. Jocoby will offer 50+ SB and Davis 30+ (maybe 45+ who knows) HRs. Youk continues to impress, and with Papi still sore, and Manny somewhere in the western US, youk is the big boy in town. Sheilds is a average SP and is worth owning, and starting a fair ammount of the time. <br>  <br>  I reluctanly say no, Wright is great to own, but try to re0work it and get someon e other than Pena. <br>  <br>  - But It wouldnt be ridiculas to accept, its a decent offer....<br>  Wright may be the 09 MVP, but the combination of Youk and Davis will match his numbers. Pena and Pence arent going to help you average or SB totals whil Jocoby will. And sheilds is a nice peice to have.<br>  <br>  Hard Question!|`|rNvcwYlMaa	Nope.. Davis will be better than pena and youk will put up hr's like wright. pence is only good for hr's and ellsbury handles sb's which no one you get in the trade does.. and shields will be a beast this year.. <br>  <br>  Don't do it. Wright may be tempting but it isnt worth it.
n1eSGvN6aa	It won't matter that much but one you get competitive in High School, you'll want to the exact right spike. Use the distance spikes over running shoes.

AA12400459	What are your chances? Of getting in? Or getting a scholarship? I find it interesting that you didn't mention anything about what you want to study. Why do you even want to go to school? Don't you think you ought to put a little emphasis on that? That might help you figure out which of those schools would be right for you.<br>  <br>  And, um, well, considering you categorized this question under "Swimming and Diving," I'd say you need to focus a little more on the details.<br>  <br>  Add: I'm not familiar with the admissions policies of those schools. Based on what you've listed, I wouldn't expect you to have any problem getting into a public university. (Who do you think goes to college? Martians?) However, something some people neglect to think about is retention rates. Some schools will take all comers, so they really don't have much incentive in keeping you. Investigate drop out rates, if you can. You also might want to spend some time mulling over your choice of major. For example, how many major newspapers do you think will go bust in the next 5 years?<br>  <br>  That's a lot of gabbing on my part. What you REALLY should do is talk to your school's guidance counselor. They should know something that no one on Y!A is privvy to -- the acceptance rate for applicants from your school.

nAtBuBRhaa	Just because of his injury, he will land as far as #7 to the Raiders. But, if it wasn't for that, I'd say he go to #4 with the Seahawks. This still might get him, but I think it all depends on how he feels by then. If any type of scenario happens, then the farthest I think he would go is to Jacksonville (#8) or San Francisco (#10). But, some teams just pick the best player on the board, and by #6, he probably will be the best player on the board.|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	He is praying that he doesnt become a raider!!|`|cqps4ujeaa	Probably Raiders, I don't think that the Seahawks want a WR with an injury, they have too many of them.  (7th)<br>  <br>  Also, Crabtree is NOT the next Steve Smith.  He's nowhere near Steve Smith.  Smith is a small and fast guy where as Crabtree is average height with great football speed and incredible hands.  He reminds me more of an Anquan Boldin/Reggie Wayne type of player.|`|8KmGcTW8aa	Either he will go to the Seahawks with the forth pick or the Raiders with the seventh pick.|`|94Ti4bHtaa	Since the Lions are horrible at drafting I say they pick him at #1|`|P7rBYyXvaa	He better get in the first 5. The next steve smith, i'm tellin ya...|`|wUe4HFJxaa	let me start with the steve smith guy... are you serious? smith is 5'9 190 crabs is 6'3 215. smith has litening speed. crabs as good speed...football speed. both have great hands and are capabale of turning an catch into a huge play. only thing that is common between the two. no where near the same. crabs is more of the boldin, fitz, wayne type of guy.... but i wouldn't be surprised to see the lions take him. thats what they do. rcvrs first. but if they don't, either the seahawks or the raiders. if the lions try and make a case for him, they could get the option to accept a trade up from seattle or oakland. that's what they should do.|`|NTGuR64Raa	4th or 7th, depending on his stress fracture injury I imagine.|`|YAQA9qxCaa	1st round for sure but usc qb matt sanchez might beat him in top 15 i'd say|`|0MJRD9sYaa	7 to the Raiders.|`|2VYjOqnpaa	Seattle will take him.

cOPCNP7Laa	The most interesting thing about football is its relevance to today's society both positively and negatively. Let me elaborate:<br>  <br>  1) How football brings people together.<br>  2) How it helps children find a life, a dream to follow, etc You could take example of Brazilians in favelas who become Ronaldiho's, etc<br>  3) How football has a place, in certain societies, within religious, racial and political viewpoints.<br>  4) How because of point 3) football stops being point 1) and becomes a means of hate, etc<br>  <br>  I think this is the most important thing about football. Talking about its purpose, passion, influence and effect on single people, communities and societies as a whole.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps. Good luck though :)|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	How much fun football brings outside the stadium.

ZKikquiOaa	It's not only that, it's in reverse I think, in that great coaches can't be star athletes.  There are qualities in a good coach that will interfere with their own ability to perform.  To be a great coach, you not only have to know what works for you, you have to know what works for the athletes you're coaching.  That's a lot of knowledge ratlling around in your head, it's a rare talent that can have so much knowledge and shut it off when performing.  <br>  <br>  Usually star athletes know how to make it work for themselves, but not necessarily how to make others perform.  I'm an archer, and I know how to make the shot work for me, and I can coach beginners.  But to coach other advanced archers, I just don't have the knowledge to begin to do that.

i8cFHtUzaa	Have you ever seen Miss Congeniality? You need to watch it, she puts out a very brief, but effective "lesson" about defending against an attacker.<br>  <br>  From the front, use the heel of your palm and thrust it upwards into their nose- This will cause the nose to break and their eyes to tear up, leaving you time to get away.<br>  <br>  If they come at you from behind, you can use whatever you can reach (or fists, feet, knee, elbow) to smack them in the balls, a very sensitive area. You really can't go wrong with aiming and hitting their face/nose/eyes and their genetalia as hard as you can. <br>  <br>  Oh and, their knees.|`|AA11334468	A strike to the tendons will produce a burning sensation<br>  <br>  A kick to the side of the upper leg will weaken the leg and allow you to run<br>  <br>  A stike to the back of the head where the muscles of the neck meet the skull with produce nausea not much force needed just a hard tap|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Take a martial art if you can and carry some OC spray or a taser around with you in your purse.|`|xzZYf2X5aa	in the gut!!!! and eye!!! and neck!!! scream!!! <br>  =] where ever u can really!!!<br>  NOSE-BREAKING!!! and definitely pepper spray!!!|`|WpqfQOTJaa	Is it legal to carry pepper spray in NYC? I suggest doing that. if you're not the fighting type, you can just pull out your little can of "get the **** away from me" and squirt it right in their eyes.<br>  <br>  That, and carry a whistle with you. When someone grabs you, just blow the wistle.<br>  <br>  And as a guy I cringe at the thought of this, but in self defence, kick him in the nuts. But ONLY in self defence.|`|13360f8150c9715c66a1ecb9c2002c6aaa	JASON gave you an excellent link.If you can't get pepper spray a small purse sized can of hair spray will do the job but that's only if he attacks from the front and rapists usually come from behind.<br>  If you go to the site JASON suggested surf to the rape/domestic assault page.I think you will find it an eye opener.It's written by MARC "THE ANIMAL" MACYOUNG.HE WASN'T CALLED ANIMAL BECAUSE HE WAS A SWEET GUY.|`|u0JCNh8zaa	Grab a guy by his package and drop to your knees.

If you see someone suspicous approaching, start walking the other direction. A good, solid, all metal pen is also very effective as a weapon. <br>  <br>  Some people say a solid metal pen is the most lethal legal weapon you can use because a sharp stab to the throat, chest, or any joint can cause critical injury. The important thing however, is to know what to do once the person you hit with a pen is distracted by the pain. If it was enough to hurt him, you could just run away. If not, you might have to hit him in the groin, the eyes, the throat or kick him sharply in the knee cap before you can run.<br>  <br>  Also, if you need to shout for help. Don't yell help. This might sound strange, but in reality if you shout help, almost no one will respond because it does not concern them. However, if you shout "FIRE!" people will start worrying and come to you because a fire would put them in risk as well.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|jD7QqFUJaa	Take out your cell phone call someone and talk to them until you know you're safe. Tell them the details of where you are and anything else. Just keep talking.  <br>  <br>  Be mindful of your surroundings,  avoid shady areas, wear good running shoes, maybe carry mace, and walk in groups whenever you can.  <br>  If you're interested, learn a martial art if you can.<br>  <br>  An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.|`|t0X1cEh7aa	The between-the-legs spot; temples; say something really stupid, but somehow make it make sense, to divert their attention for a moment and then run for it; just run for it; stay near buildings/stores so you can get help easily; I don't know what the bustling rogue city life is like, I live in a boring town :3<br>  Even in my school, I'm pretty sure I can handle things :o.|`|WtZHSAAUaa	I agree. with the other answer. The two most sensitive places you can go for are the balls, and the nose. If you throw a good punch at someone's nose it will bleed everywhere. It probably wouldn't even need a good punch. Poke him/them in the eyes as well. But if you want to avoid defending yourself find alternative routes? Get picked up? Get your parents to meet you.|`|Q7haeWgvaa	It's better to learn self defense by martial arts. But for the moment you can try some practical ways. when guys attack hit them right at their balls. or you may try of get dust or sand from the ground and throw to their eyes or carry a small aerosol and spray their eyes.|`|1CTbPfbqaa	Is this a serious question?"key points to hit him?" I'm sorry but I find it very unlikely that anyone in the world that isn't kept in captivity or has a mental problem does not know by the age of the 14 that a man's testicles are his "key points"|`|2NPFyggxaa	Wow, that sounds really scary (seriously).<br>  Well one thing I think you should do is find a self-defense class. They will teach you all the things you should know when faced with a situation such as a passing stranger. And groups are always a good decision. I hope you never do get faced with a situation like that.<br>  Be safe|`|B4nujMnlaa	I think the best thing you can do for yourself is start martial arts. Karate and Kung Fu are very good alternatives! Also, don't worry, relax, and kick some a**!!|`|QLa5q3wcaa	Lob off his nutsack with your teeth<br>  carrying a taser wouldnt be a bad idea either|`|g9TxgMlwaa	Throw oranges at him|`|TIqFAXo1aa	pepper spray|`|yQYP7yFuaa	kick him right in the balls and run|`|OnKWDALpaa	sucks... best bet is to carry pepper spray, spray them, and haul a**..<br>  or u can go kinda ghetto and get a ball from a pool table and put it in a sock, then swing it at their head.. pocket knives, kitchen tools...<br>  take up a defense class if u can. doesnt have to be something boring. maybe kick boxin, karate, etc.<br>  even then, you're a young girl and when a pervert wants his way bad enough, he'll go to crazy lengths to get stuff. so, to rely solely on ur body as defense wouldnt be wise. <br>  but when u have natural defense and a weapon, ur chances of being able to stick up for urself is raised.<br>  <br>  take care!|`|fV2SYj60aa	prevention is always better than having to fight.  Always, always be aware of your surroundings.  Don't go down allies or questionable streets.  If you see a guy you have to pass, try an alternate route or cross the street.  If you feel someone behind you, speed up and cross the street and find a safer location.  Dress appropriately and not suggestively.  Wear a hood or a hat that might pass you off as a guy if they can't see your face.  If you're alone, maybe be on your cellphone (while still staying alert of your surroundings) so that if something happens they will hear and someone will know.<br>  <br>  Other than that, go for the nuts and eyes. Bite anything near your face.|`|qQiOtyuzaa	For starters, learn how to avoid getting in that type of situation in the first place (that's the MOST IMPORTANT part of self defense. ) A good site to find info on that is <a href="http://nononsenseselfdefense.com/" rel="nofollow">http://nononsenseselfdefense.com/</a> .  TONS of useful info on what to look for, avoid, etc <br>  <br>  And self-defense classes are good, but not if they don't simulate real attacks (you want the "attacker" to fight back in the class....they're not gonna stand still in the street so you can hit them, after all)<br>  <br>  Oh and don't make the mistake of thinking it's just "city stuff". There's pervs in the suburbs, countryside, etc, as well.|`|IHHOHsMbaa	Gouge the eyes with your thumbs (push them as hard as you can.) Hit the neck as hard as you can (like a karate chop.) Hit the groin, any method will do. Another place is the ears, Make your hands in to cups, as if you were going to drink from them and then clap them on your victim's ears as hard as you can. All you need is the force it would take to kill a mosquito in order to rupture the victim's ear drums.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Groin and throat are weak areas. If it isn't illegal I suggest pepper spray, but Taser would be even better. If you are confronted don't back off, literally think of putting him out. Say something that shows that you mean business e.g. (From a big Irish guy I train with haha): "Get the f*** away or I will f***ing cripple you." Worked.<br>  Yea don't go places alone, try to go with a big guy or two as well. Groups are always safest, more populated areas too.
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	I'd say water before, gatorade during, and gatorade after.<br>  <br>  Before, you should make it a point to stay hydrated all day, don't try to cram it all in the hour before a workout.<br>  <br>  During, if the gatorade causes you stomach discomfort, you might try diluting it with an equal amount of water (or buying the powdered kind and mixing half strength).<br>  <br>  After, the gatorade replenishes energy, and electrolytes lost through sweat.<br>  <br>  Also, studies have shown that long term, chocolate milk has great potential as a recovery drink.  It has a good proportion of sugars, fats, and proteins.  You'd have to wait a while to drink it, since dairy might be hard on your stomach right after a workout.  Perhaps add half a glass at dinner each night?|`|15d86cc8d6706b5b214ae1b6a4194dd1aa	you only need Gatorade if you exercise for more than an hour at a time. other than that drink water. and drink 500ml of Gatorade for every hour you work out. i know a guy who did an ironman and drank only Gatorade and his kidneys failed. so use Gatorade to replenish your essentials. cytomax and all energy drinks have side effects. don't drink that garbage.|`|2gz6ad5kaa	Gatorade and water.|`|OffM2Ndiaa	cytomax|`|vE6kSOcUaa	Powerade or Gatorade.

NpqAbZqpaa	If you figure 700 PA, a 20 ratio would be 35, a 10 would be 70. 14 would be about 50 hrs. <br>  <br>  If A's first two years weren't at the start of your range, I'd put him as a candidate. I figure that's 30, 22 then some 45's and maybe even a 50 in there.<br>  <br>  B looks odd after year 5.  Looked like a good HR hitter then moved into astounding #'s<br>  <br>  C as well.  About a 30-35 hrs hitter then went up.  Steadied down for a few years, then zoomed up again.<br>  <br>  D looks consistent, but still over the top.  <br>  <br>  E. certainly has 1 suspect year (12.9).  If I'm guessing this is probably Luis Gonzalez.<br>  <br>  For F, like A, if year one is a rookie year, and year 11 is a low AB year.  <br>  <br>  So, for me, A may not have, depending on the timing of the start of the career, B I think so, C definitely, D as well, E probably in one year, F maybe not.<br>  <br>  B, C, D and a bit of E|`|gwKxe7gGaa	A,D,E seem to be the roiders, and B,C,F look clean to me.|`|3BHmXNacaa	A C D F are my guesses|`|O3oqZsR3aa	i would have to say player A,. his home run rate is quiet low for a span in the middle there and then it comes back around 20ish. the others are pretty consistent and are in a similar range for a major part of their careers. they either start off with a lesser rate or end or have maybe one or two in the middle that doesn't stay consistent with the rest, could result from injury. Player A is up and down and doesn't really have a consistent level. If anyone id say player A. <br>  <br>  Although I would argue that its hard to tell just by home run rate as steroids don't necessarily shoot up home run rate. at bats will vary with use as well because an injury prone player using roids will come across and have more at bats the next season and consequently it more homers but the rate could stay the same...you know what i mean? for example one person could hit 10 homers in 200 at bats. then use steroids stay healthy and smash 30 in 600. the rate is the same. however he is healthier because he recovers quicker and plays more.|`|bK5QIdivaa	I say B C and E. I tried to look for a few years that we're way different from that player's average. By the way, this is a really neat and challenging question.

LjqoMHMJaa	They want to see you catch and throw rightie and leftie. They want to see endurance and speed. They want to see passion. They want to see you show off your best skills. Try-outs are not a team effort. They are an individual show off time because there is no team made yet.|`|F2jOdGPoaa	Mainly what everyone said is important, but Speed and Endurance. If you can keep up with a midi, your fine, but if you can't thast whats important. Most lax coaches at the NCAA level will test you on a 2.5 mile and 100 push ups. If you pass that, show skills with passing and stick handling. Then show defense by STICK checks, then show them a good and power full shot. But don't try to hard to over power it and miss or hit the goalie right in the stomach.|`|19zYqLOPaa	everything the above people said are all important, but one more thing is also critical. DETERMINATION. never give up when the ball is about to go out of bounds and always chase the loose ball. coaches like to see that you are working your hardest and never stop|`|s7fUsMqoaa	you should expect RUNNING And MORE RUNNING um you should have good stick work and footwork. Catching throwing shooting passing and all that stuff and dont try to hard youll mess up|`|23qMl5LXaa	Speed AND Endurance<br>  Lots of people think its JUST speed, but it isn't. With only speed, you won't make it. You have to have a huge amount of endurance. All coaches hate joggers, so if you start to jog in the try out, really try as hard as you can to get your energy up and sprint. Plan on sprinting hard for almost two hours for the try outs. Thats what it was for me.
NvaK57Phaa	make sure you do not overeat. eat plenty of lean proteins such as tuna, chicken breast, egg whites, beans, nuts, milk, cheese, yogurt, and soy. these foods help build muscle, but do not add on much fat. when you eat them, try to space out your servings to 6 small meals a day.  this will keep you from being hungry, while reducing fat intake. also eat fruits and vegetables. they have glucose, which is healthy sugar and have fuel for your body to keep you going. carbs will help a lot too. foods like bread and pasta give you energy and keep your body up and running. you can eat these foods before and after your workouts to help increase muscle growth. after your workouts, you should eat bigger portions, (not TOO BIG, but reasonably bigger) in order to give your body quick protein for muscle fuel. also, drink a lot of water. water speeds up fat burning and although that may not be your biggest concern, your muscles need water to grow as well (just like a plant needs water).<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK THIS FOOTBALL SEASON!|`|Jp7qZKfMaa	Chicken.....good stuff I don't know ask someone smart|`|wUe4HFJxaa	peanut butter sandwhich, bananas and water. alot of fruit.|`|DNKNI27Baa	spagetti helps a lot, ive heard.

3327fnWjaa	Just try to work on your technique for jumping. I know it sounds weird, but there is a wrong way to jump. If you look at shorter basketball players, they use their arms and mid-section along with their legs cohesively to jump properly (explode) to the rim. Worse case scenario, try one a set of these special pieces that attach to the front of your shoes, they work by exercising certain muscles in your legs. You can google them or find the ad for them in almost any basketball magazine.|`|ypL0PJ4Iaa	SAD!!! I'm 5' 7" and only 13 and easily dunk on a 10' hoop. Bend your knees more.

Being they had slower practice speeds. They then leaned out there engines to much for the cooler than expected  Temperatures and just burned the engines up.  Jeff #24  and Jimmy # 48  was on the speed program being they had fast cars in  both practices..  Also Stewart #14   and Newman did not have a engine problem.. also note  the #5 and #88 share a building. So more than likely they shared info like engine tuning.

The Falcons really would love a playmaker opposite Abraham, so I could see them drafting Tyson Jackson DE from LSU. On the other hand the continued development of Ryan is important, so them drafting Pettigrew the TE from Oklahoma State wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility.

PxtmMAMnaa	i know people who have been working on fulls forever and people who have gotten them within 2. layouts are pretty easy to get, as long as you have a good tuck. i have really bad tuck habits so i havent been able to get my layout but for some people it was so easy. standing full will not happen in four years unless you have had a standing tuck for a long time. work on roundoff backhandspring tucks first of all if you dont have them, then move on to layouts fulls etc.|`|8mSXZD6qaa	i am self tought and i got my layout 4 weeks after my tuck.<br>  i did my very first layout at nationals sat and sunday.<br>  i now learning to do a full and a double tuck.<br>  but i am a extremly fast learner<br>  trust me you will get it.<br>  it all depends on your height and your set.|`|uKyfRzxIaa	it takes about the same amount of time between a backtuck and a layout and a layout and a full, but yeah, don't worry, you'll have your full in four years! :D|`|KaQfKHkYaa	it took me a year, but im a really fast learner, but then again i took some time off for competition, if you keep working at a layout you should be able  to get it within a year, full alot longer. the whole concept of twisting is way different to learn then any layout will ever be, just warning you now. if you work really hard at your layout you should be able to get it in a year (even tho you are a slow lerner) <br>  <br>  my best of luck to ya!!! hope this helps!
gA9aQKfaaa	Take more classes at your local gym the best way to learn is with a coach. (: That way you don't hurt your self.

pC6KstvHaa	I would probably do track, but thats just because everyone makes the track team, and its easy if you've never done it before.|`|FSSU21cyaa	personally I think lacrosse is more exciting and more of a team sport. I think that lacrosse would be more fun because it's more diverse and, as opposed to track, if you yourself are not a superstar, you and your team can play better as a team and still win whereas in track you need to be the fastest runner to win the race.

n9R8r8Siaa	There are kind of two types of 800m runners, there are those who are very powerful and go out fast but die a bit at the end, and there are those who can maintain the speed and kick at the end but will not be as fast. Depending on your abilities, whether you can maintain high speeds over a long period of time or whether you are a powerhouse, you should adjust your training to that. I would say obviously the main one to go with would be long distance to build up that core you need but along the way you should do some workouts that are based around speed and power (fartleks and hills) so that you can be strong but also be able to maintain it.|`|2cywkJ5Uaa	400 and down are sprint<br>  <br>  so you should join the long distance coz i run the 800<br>  and i'm in long distance.|`|iVOqsKnVaa	In my school people who run the 800 train with the distance group|`|HrycUpKSaa	distance|`|4a5e6710a48bf2552818efa224ab69cdaa	Unless you plan on sprinting 800meters, you would want to join the distance team.

4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	You've heard it here first:  the Pavlik that fought last night is going to lose against Abraham.  I don't see any change in Pavlik, and if he stays the course, he's going to find Abraham hard to hit, and Abraham's sporatic bursts are going to keep Pav off balance.  If Pav can't learn to shell his opponent from a distance to take advantage of his natural height advantage, he's going to get "B-Hopped" again.  Pav needs a plan "B", and I don't see it.  I don't think Sturm could last against Pavlik, but I haven't studied Sturm as well as I have Pav and Abraham.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	I think he should fight Duddy just for the reason that Duddy is going to get ruined eventually, let it be against somebody where he can make some money. I have always thought that Abraham would beat Pavlik, in my opinion he is a better puncher and has the chin and physical strength to take Pavlik's punches and keep coming. I would like to see him on the inside against Pavlik and nullify his reach. Pavlik isn't the one punch guy that he is sometimes made out to be, don't get me wrong he can whack, but he is inaccurate and typically wears his guy down a volume before stopping them. Abraham is a more accurate and moves better and I think he going to give angles and eventually catch Pavlik with a left hand that is going to put him down. I think Pavlik will finish the fight but I just don't see him beating a guy as strong and as tough as Abraham. I do see him however taking out Sturm, decisively. I don't think that Sturm has the boxing skills or the physical gifts to get out and stay out of the way of Pavlik's punches, I would predict a late stoppage.|`|Yrcf7HGAaa	I agree I'd rather watch Pavlik versus either Abraham or Sturm forget Duddy.<br>  <br>  I have been anticipating for a showdown between Pavlik versus Abraham.  Arthur Abraham will fight smart and most likely KO Kelly Pavlik I highly doubt Team Pavlik will ever intend to take a fight against Arthur "King" Abraham.<br>  <br>  In regards to Felix Strum I have not really kept up with his career but I am guessing even Strum would give plenty of trouble to Pavlik just as Strum has done to many opponents including Oscar De La Hoya a fight which Strum should have won many years ago.|`|Xm8crry3aa	Pavlik was overrated and overhyped.

t4UrqK4Raa	Haha that means absolutely nothing. Believe it or not an athlete is not given money based on how many years of varsity they play. You have to be good and have good stats to get scholarships and most importantly, the coaches have to really want you to go to their school.

Attorney General gets carte blanche to ban guns at will: Under the proposal, the U.S. Attorney General can add any  "semiautomatic rifle or shotgun originally designed for military or law enforcement use, or a firearm based on the design of such a firearm, that is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, as determined by the Attorney General."<br>  <br>  <br>  Note our current AG, Eric Holden, states that he does not believe it is a constitutional right to be allowed to keep a fully assembled firearm of any type in your home.  This means in addition to not being able to own any of these firearms, those firearms you CAN own, the AG believes a law requiring you to store them at the shooting range, police station, or disassembled in your home in a safe.<br>  <br>  Further restrictions not specifically targeted at the AWB to be aware of.<br>  <br>  The other senator from Illinios has introduced a bill requiring ALL gun holders to get a license that is only good for 5 years.  If it expires you will be a criminal.  Expect to see a very large 'processing fee' and 'background check fee' applied to this permit ($500?)<br>  <br>  Further there is a bill being applied to Illinios only right now, but it has a duplicate that is giong to be introduced to the US congress once the illinios one gets passed that demands that all gun owners must posses a ONE MILLION DOLLAR insurance policy against misuse or accident by that firearm, including coverage if a criminal steals your gun and uses it in a crime to harm someone.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	It would depend on what the new law has for definitions or restrictions.|`|Op8JYvlhaa	Hi capacity mags (anything that holds more than 10) will probably be included in the ban.  Assault Rifle, the technical term is a military weapon with a "selector switch."  By this I mean you can select between single shot or full auto.  I own a semi automatic rifle (SIG 5.56) but according to the new ban that will more than likely happen, I own an "assault rifle."  The guns themselves will be banned, as well as the mags.  The extra goodies like suppressors and stocks I am not sure how they will see those but my advice is buy everything you want NOW while you can still get it!  Just in case.  As long as you have what you want, then you will not be left out in the cold in the future.  Besides, you can ALWAYS sell the stuff if you needed too, and a banned weapon would be worth way more than you paid to purchase the item new or used.  (new is better IMO)|`|c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	Socialists hate guns.  <br>  <br>  Obama is a socialists.<br>  <br>  You don't believe that, you are an idiot.  The democrats (and some Rhinos), at least the socialists ones. know that it is very unpopular to ban guns.  They can't prove that their laws do any good.  They have to go about it sideways.  I have seen many states try and do things.  Very few can out right ban them, but they can make it so that most people can't own one.  <br>  <br>  Requiring a gun to be disassemble in separate locked containers makes a gun an expensive, paper-weight.<br>  Gun and ammo taxes hurt American manufacturing and reduce the ability of Americans to have firearms.<br>  Requiring certifications and identification cards to own a gun is another way to reduce the number of honest, law abiding citizens to get one.<br>  Requiring expensive insurance to own a gun, another financial burden on gun owners.<br>  <br>  Simply put.  Gun haters, many of which are democrats and all are socialists, work very to take away the rights that have been bought and paid for with American blood to give you a Nanny state where they give you food, basic health, living space, and TV.  All they want is your complete and utter slavery.  <br>  <br>  We deserve the leaders that we elect, and it makes me ashamed to see the people that we have elected.|`|CxCswacOaa	During the last ban the democrats put on the American people (a.k.a. the militia) you couldn't buy foldaway stocks.  You could still find high cap. magazines, but they were very expensive because they couldn't be manufactured anymore.|`|1f34cb08ac2251c3afe6fe04a9dfbc46aa	Sure, his website says that he wants to ban every gun in the country, but come on.  President Bush also campaigned on partially privatizing social security in 2004.  Did I miss a news report on that happening, or do politicians generally just make a lot of promises that they have no intention of keeping?<br>  <br>  Besides, Obama wouldn't be able to start mobilizing against guns until the economy recovers.  So figure even if he introduces a bill this fall, it likely wouldn't even go into effect for months after that.<br>  <br>  The rush to buy as many guns as you can fit in your house just doesn't make sense to me.  There's no way a law will go into effect for at least another year.  And that's even assuming that he goes after guns as his first real initiative - what about universal health care or SCHIP, or the War on Terror or drugs, or the minimum wage, or all of those other "Democratic priorities"?<br>  <br>  I don't think it's worth  worrying about something that might not even happen, personally.  Besides, if he wants to move on guns, he'd be smart to wait for the prices to come back down.  At least then, he'd be able to say "When I took office, and AR-15 assault rifle cost $2000 - in the one year since then, the price has fallen by half.  Handgun ammunition has dropped in price by 70% since March.  We need to put an end to this proliferation of deadly weapons.  We need heavier taxes on ammunition, and we need to ban guns outright."<br>  <br>  Until he can make that argument, I think we're all pretty much in the clear.  There are only 2 things that could make me legitimately fear for my guns: the death of a conservative Supreme Court Justice, or an assassination attempt.  Until then, I'm more mad at the NRA for making ammo impossible to find, than at Obama for posting something on his website.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	Speculation is that it would be similar to Carolyn McCarthy (D) NY, previous attempt at legislation. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-1022" rel="nofollow">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext...</a><br>  <br>  Also, <br>  You might want to look at H.R.45 (it is backburner in committee) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-45" rel="nofollow">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext...</a><br>  <br>  This is likely the direction they will attempt.

Now if you're a really fast learner and learn to do front and back handspring sequences along with back and front tucks in 2 months, then I think you would deffinitly make it. Even just front handspring sequences would really help. Try out. If you don't try out, you'll never know. Plus, maybe your high school does it different than mine. My varsity is also the competitive. I know its the same for every school in Georgia, but I don't know about other states as much. Try out, go to the gym for tumbling, and really work on your left splits.

Ro03hVb6aa	Your shape and size remind me of a few players like Norman Berryman and Inga Tuigamala (both from NZ) or a fijian called Rupeni Cau Cau.  All of these guys had size, speed and power (especially Rupeni who is ballistic when he is fit).  The first two got caps at centre (though Inga started as winger) and Rupeni plays wing.<br>  <br>  You'll probably only learn the basics of the game like tackling, rucking, mauling and the like by playing but you can read a bit.<br>  <br>  Most guys fall short on their cardio and you can tell after 60 mins of a match who benches and who runs.  My old club was coached by a former premiership player and he would make us do lots of wind sprints from one end of the pitch & back and our cardio shot up.  he didn't give a damn if we puked, we'd just keep doing them.  We would also finish every second session with a 5k run.  He said you run more than you bench press so it should be your focus.  He also split the backs and made us work on off the mark speed by lots of short sharp 10 meter sprints and 60 meter sprints.<br>  <br>  I spent one off season lifting weights like an american football player would, put on about 7 kg and then went back to the running.  I focused on core strength life deadlifts, squats, power cleans, weight chins and dips - stuff you probably know well.  I still do these but not more than twice a week.|`|bapPfhMZaa	stamina is very important along wiht your core, so i say focus on those two things.  also you  sound like you would play front row(prop) because of your weight, but because of your height maybe a lock(2nd row) both of which are very important and require strength.|`|aYVPZjLVaa	You must learn how to tackle and will most likely need to learn how to crash the ball (aka short runs to allow the backs to line up and organize).|`|371249d16660f0f3a82c0e3130485084aa	You might be an ok winger.

xhPKkkELaa	Welcome to surfing. This question has been asked enough times before, but there is really only one true answer.<br>  <br>  Lessons are the only sensible way to start surfing, either from a professional instructor, or surfing family or friends who are experienced surfers.There are way too many dangerous people in the water now, who THINK they can surf. Please don't join their ranks.The VERY LAST THING the rest of us experienced surfers want is people to take silly on-line advice, and go down to the beach, grab a surfboard, and go out and get in our way.<br>  <br>  Most people start out best on long boards, but I have seen plenty of surfers start begin with a short board and master it in no time. It just tends to be more difficult. The bottom line is there are NO RULES as to what kind of surfboard you learn on. Certainly a longboard usually is more user friendly.<br>  <br>  Most professional instructors will rent you a board to learn on. Beginners shouldn't even think about buying a board until they master the basics, and decide they really want to keep on surfing.<br>  <br>  This question comes up a lot on YA Surfing, and it is impossible to answer it accurately on-line. Although I am sure you will get lots of "advice" the real BEST ANSWER is to go to a good local surf shop and discuss your skill level, your size and local wave conditions with the folks there. they will give you much better info than ANYBODY out here in cyberspace. When you are finally ready, you should really think about buying a decent board, and avoiding popouts , and boards made in sweat shops in China, unless that's just all you can afford. And don't forget, there are always used boards for sale in every surf shop. After 42 years of surfing, I still get my surfboard buying advice at good local shops in the places where I surf.<br>  <br>  And, I know there are lots of nice kids who want to share information with you on line. But don't take the advice from youngsters, who may know even less than you do about surfing, a surfboard is a big investment. I am sure you are mature enough to read through the BS that lots of people throw at you on line.<br>  <br>  Anybody, on-line, who gives specific advice on what size board someone should buy is foolish. Anyone who takes that advice is more foolish.Good luck! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avalonsurfschool.com/index.ht..." rel="nofollow">http://www.avalonsurfschool.com/index.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm</a><br>  Boards made in far eastern sweats shops:<br>  <a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkSTwhvv9kI/AAAAAAAAAfg/QMqBFAtXzQ4/s1600-h/chinaboards.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkST...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_surfboard.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_su...</a>|`|gUCjkj9oaa	buy a cheap used board|`|Op1WIwyPaa	I would talk to the people at your local surf shop. But a longboard is a great board to learn on.<br>  <br>  The Surfboard Man<br>  <a href="http://www.thesurfboardman.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesurfboardman.com/</a>|`|WGmob26jaa	When looking for a beginner surf board you should look for something that is as tall as you can reach above your head with your feet flat on the ground. Also don't buy a surfboard that is small and skinny you want to buy a board that is fat and larger than you this will make it easier for you to paddle, and catch a wave. It is not impossible to learn on a shorter skinnier board but it is easier to learn on a fatter and larger one. Just don't buy a board because it is good looking.|`|qbuKhyrYaa	LISTEN TO ME! K so if you are just starting out who knows if you will fall in love with it and if you dont fall in love you dont want to spend 3 or 4 hundred dollars on a board you barely rode right. So go to costco and by a wavestorm for 95 dollars no joke they are the perfect board to start on and if you end up never really getting in to it then o well right! I work at a surf camp and I always tell my campers parents this when they are about to go out and by a board and they always thank me so much afterwards. There good boards to have to I surf everyday and compete nationaly on shortboard but I own one because its a really fun board to have when the surf id a foot or if the tide is low and ther r a lot of rocks. Trust me this way you can learn the basics then spend your money later on a board that you wont grow out of and can use later. Plus with a foam board if you hit someone no worries you know|`|I1y96bgxaa	Mini-mal is a funboard.  They are basically not a longboard or a shortboard (just under 9ft until above 6'6").  Mini-mal is great to learn on. I would suggest a longboard.  You can use a longboard in all conditions and they are the best to have laying around to teach a friend on.  See both the surfboardman and John F as they both always have awesome advice to give.|`|xo5rqZ2Caa	Try a fun board because if you want to get a high performance board in the future fun boards are closer to a performance board than a mini-mal

503585d82d5a567dd571c75eab93e30daa	It is a temporary grip you wrap over the original grip.  The temporary grip lasts 2 matches (although many people keep them on for much much longer, i dont).  You can buy different types of overgrips and most come in 3-packs, although some popular ones come in 10 or 30 packs.  NothingButTennis.com has a table that shows the different overgrip categories, go to their FAQ page i think.  I prefer the "pro feel" or "microtac" grips, and i make them tacky with a tacky towel.|`|Oe5BCMzKaa	its just another grip- u wrap it round . you do it so that u can remove it when it gets worn or slippery.|`|sptrtwxlaa	its another grip you put over the original-get it Over Grip
dpSr0icwaa	stocks are not specific to the CHAMBERING of the gun...they are specific to the make and models of the gun.<br>  <br>  Now, the 'sportsman 78' is a K-mart 'exclusive' Remington 700.<br>  <br>  A that would work for a Remington 700 (long action) will work  for your gun.  However, stay away from any that are 'short action' or 'magnum length action' as they will not fit.  As your gun does not have a detachable magazine, stay away from stocks that are noted as being designed for Detachable Magazines, or DM.  Finally stay way from 'varmint' stocks, as these are designed to take a wider barrel than your gun has.<br>  <br>  Besides DM, there is one other thing to remember about remington 700.  ADL means 'no hinged floorplate' and BDL means 'hinged floorplate'<br>  <br>  Some stockmakers make a single remington 700 long action stock, with no spot for the hinged floorplate because the purchaser can easily cut through the last little bit of stock and take the hinged floor plate off his old stock and put it on the new one, so the stock maker has less inventory complications to worry about.<br>  <br>  Some stockmakers do specify ADL or BDL.<br>  <br>  If they do specify, go for the ADL type|`|QrjuueMCaa	You could put a cheap $2.00 "Fu*k Obama" sticker on in and you will be the envy of every sportsman alive and dead!!!
nb4VGxH7aa	One of my best friends plays for San Jose State and yeah they are going to contend this year but dude, he is asking about WCC schools not the WAC. Unless you are extremely talented, you cannot make the USD team. It's considered a powerhouse that has been consistently in the top ten in the nation the past few years. My roommate attempted to walk on at USD last year and he failed big time. He played in the Little League World Series, High School, etc. Pepperdine is very talented also and a much smaller school. You could possibly walk on there but once again, you better have some talent. Loyola Marymount is the worst of the bunch and finished 7th in the WCC last year. Santa Clara finished third. If you want to try to play for the best team, it's USD. I might go there but I am very unbiased about this. 44-17 last year, upset by Fresno State in the Long Beach regional. Not to mention, number 1 recruiting class in the country in 2007-2008.|`|okECVBkzaa	I'd go with San Jose St, but out of that group probably Santa Clara.<br>  <br>  San Jose St wont be easy though, they should be right there for division title.

More than a block a game is something to be proud of at any level. Probably want to work on crashing the boards and boxing out so you can get more rebounds, and play some defense so you can get some steals to go along with those blocks.|`|75nQwsVPaa	lol, technically your ppg is 4.4<br>  you avg. 1.4 bpg, 1.1 apg, 1.2 rpg, and 0.4 spg.  <br>  if your are comparing yourself to kids your own age, no offensee but i'd say your maybe a little below average but i do think that is a nice amt. of blocks per game.  <br>  what does being white have to do w/ any of this?  manu ginobili (technically has white skin) and he's one of the nastiest players in the nba.|`|c7992d905ee1715cf5c3ed1c09c6ee98aa	step it up you slackin

Lol0iLfgaa	Middle distance.<br>  You have a good body for distance, but you also have foot speed.  So if I were you, the 400/800m would be the events I would focus on.  Remember though, there really isn't an exact science to this.  Just run whatever you are the best at.<br>  <br>  Also, give the high jump and maybe even the pole vault a try.|`|ssrLnvvWaa	how about high jump . you could be pretty good if ur 5 foot 9 and are flexible|`|HrycUpKSaa	the 400!|`|n9R8r8Siaa	Normally that would be a good body type for long distance but it dosnt necessarily mean you can be good at it because of your oxygen intake etc... And normally i would say that isnt the greatest body shape for sprinting because they are most usually short and stocky but as we all know that changed with Usain Bolt. If you want to be a sprinter i suggest working on being more powerful and if you want to be a long distance runner you have to work at it, run at least twice a week, build a strong core, and do at least one workout a week. But just do whatever you think is best for you and good luck!

He wants to be in the England squad for next years world cup as it will be his last, and i really don't think he has a chance if he stays in America.

The only problem with the college game idea is that if you used it to import draft classes, many of the prospects these days come from high school, so there would be a lot of potential good prospects you could miss out on.|`|hR87A418aa	GEH!!! ur soo right MVP Baseball 2005 with manny on the cover MAN. till this day me n my friends talk about that been 1 of the best games..... 2k games suck balls omg i hate when u hit a single u have to tap O like crazy or the right fielder can get u out..........|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	yea they should have a baseball campus legend mode|`|AA12069570	I do, MVP Baseball 2005 is better than all the 2008 games there were, I still play that on XBOX as opposed to buy games for my 360 because the 2K series sucks|`|3BHmXNacaa	Yea definitely, the metal bats were so much cooler then wood.

aiBSMFWmaa	NO. Evan is a budding super star! He reminds me of David Wright, and will contribute in all stat catagories. He is by FAR the best player in the deal. <br>  <br>  Davis, although impressive, is a bit on the risky side. I believe he's a 35+ HR guy, but other think last season was a fluke. He's a nice long term investment, but not at your price. Soto is a great young catcher, but I think Ianetta will work just fine for you. Chris will be building off a solid breakout year, and has the benefit of playing half his games in Coors (a notorious hitters park). Ianetta shouldn't be too far behind Soto this season. <br>  <br>  LaRoche really doesn't matter, he'll help out in deep leagues, but isnt a huge factor in the deal. <br>  <br>  Don't do it! Longoria will be a perineal top 10, soon top 5 player for many years to come.|`|k5TKF2rRaa	No|`|azxbIaVfaa	i wouldn't but it's just my opinion|`|Dilobt5gaa	i wouldnt|`|VRN4A8vwaa	i think ianetta is already enough for a catcher spot<br>  the reason why this trade is unacceptable is why longoria got traded?

zOKHhBvLaa	as long as you know the basics of the game, every position, know how to manage to get the player's to do the right found a mantles then you should be able to become a manager in baseball. You should talk to the baseball coach of your high school and see if you can help out with the coaching of the team to get some experience of how managing a team is really like|`|a9d1c39e771753ee705728da48b7614eaa	In order to become a manager in professional baseball, you would probaly have to have some coaching experience at a local level and show that you are good at it, then maybe you could go to some of the professional leagues and try to hook on as a coach, but I dont think managing in the pros is something you can go into right off the bat.|`|vVofB4DPaa	"Away in a Manger" .....<br>  <br>  I think there are only 3 managers in the MLB leagues that weren't players at one time.

FFE9Qztzaa	For a defender :<br>  Predators OR The Total 90's.<br>  If you are the aggresive type == total 90<br>  If you are the passing, long cross ball, attentive type = Predators.|`|XGOXmiEiaa	The second or first ones are best for your position. The vapors are not good for your position because they are very thin and as a defender, you will most likely get your foot stepped on quite a lot and if you are wearing vapors, will hurt a lot. Depending on what type of defender you are you should try the Predators or the 90's. If you are a centre back you should use the 90's because they are tougher, and are better for clearing the ball and they will not hurt if your foot get stepped on. If you are a full back, you should get the Predators because they are good for swinging in a cross or playing a through ball and also will not hurt if your foot get stepped on either.|`|7BIiofbaaa	It all depends on what qualities you're looking for:<br>  <br>  If you're looking for power go with the second. If you're looking for accuracy and precision go with the first. And if you're looking for speed/style go with the third.|`|o7gV56ngaa	Football boots (soccer cleats) are a personal thing.

GZpwkL1Vaa	I'm glad somebody asked this I'm a big eagles fan and have been studying the draft alot. The eagles shouldn't trade up because they do have multiple needs and the more they address, the better they will be. In my opinion these are their main needs:<br>  Two offensive lineman<br>  A power running back<br>  A large receieving target or tight end<br>  <br>  some people will say they need a safety too, but quinten demps has proven to be a very promising safety, even though he had a bad game in the NFC championship, you can't write off a player who had a great season soley on one performance, and the coaches will feel the same way. players are given second chances after an entire poor season, one game is nothing. I still think he will be brian dawkin's successor. For that reason and the fact that their is no safety prospect worthy of a first round pick, it will not be a safety chosen for the eagles.<br>  <br>  defensive end is a need which some eagles fans want addressed. you wont find a single person who doesn't think trent cole is at least a solid starter, if not an elite one. I beleive they will not go defensive end for a few reasons.<br>  1. Last year they spent a 3rd round pick on bryan smith, a developmental project who is looking very promising. As well as Victor Ibiamiri, who they picked 2 years ago in the second round and still has alot of potential, as he improved last year from his rookie season.<br>  2. Darren Howard, 10 sacks leading the team as the "weaker" starter at DE? and people want to replace him? for lack of a better term, WTF? <br>  3. Jaqua Parker and Chris Clemons combined for 9 sacks, as back-ups. <br>  4. The eagles use their defensive lineman in a rotation, they will not invest a high draft pick on an end when they have so much depth and are not planning on eventually having that player start full time.<br>  <br>  Now with the 21st pick, They would love to have an elite tackle fall to them, but none of the top four (jason smith, michael oher, andre smith, eugene monroe) will likely drop that far. So that leaves a few potential picks who their is a good chance they will be availible.<br>  1. Chris "Beanie" Wells (a power back)<br>  2. Eric Britton (an offensive tackle)<br>  3. Brandon Pettigrew (tight end)<br>  <br>  I am almost possitive one of these players will be availible with the 21st overall pick. Beanie Wells would be the first choice, because he fills a need and is a top 10 talent who will drop due to lack of demand for runningbacks. He is way to good to pass up and is a perfect compliment for Westbrook. And, with a mediocre 4.54 yard dash at the combine today, he must just slip. Even though Eric Britton is not as talented as Brandon Pettigrew, i beleive the eagles would choose him first. Brent Celek has shown a tonne of potential as a TE and the eagles have plenty of offensive weapons that mcnabb can throw to already. Britton is a big offensive tackle who's stock is rising, and with the high demand for tackles i can gaurentee he wont be their by the 28th pick.<br>  <br>  Next to the first 3 players i listed, I beleive these would be some additional players who would be considered if the prior were off the board.<br>  1. Duke Robinson (offensive guard)<br>  2. Alex Mack (center)<br>  3. Kenny Britt (a big receiver)<br>  <br>  Duke Robinson is a very very likely pick if he falls to 28th overall, he is by far the best guard in this class and has pro-bowl potential. At 6'5" 328 he deffinetly is the kind of guard andy read wants as well. Alex Mack showed at the senior bowl exactly what type of talent he is, whenever someone talks about a center going in the first round he has the ability to dominate. Kenny Britt is that big (6'4") target mcnabb has been wishing for, and if the previous 5 picks i listed are not availible he would be a good choice.<br>  <br>  The eagles had a great season last year, 3rd ranked defense and 8th ranked offense. I would really say that had the 6th best offense because they were 6th in scoring, and if your offense leads the league is yards it means nothing if they didnt put up the points. Since they performed at such a high level, they can draft based on a good balance of talent and need. So if a big name player happened to slide down to the 21st pick don't be suprised if Andy Reid pulls the trigger, regardless of the position. My dream senario would be Wells and Britton, but that is unlikely to happen. A more realistic expectation would be the combination of Beanie Wells and Duke Robinson, and if the two were availible with the eagles two selections, i can't see the eagles passing them up.<br>  <br>  If i don't get best answer for all that i am going tp be pissed off haha|`|DHvN1m9Eaa	they will draft C, Alex Mack of California The Eagles wanted TE Brandon Pettigrew, but he will likely be gone. Center, guard, plug him (Mack) into the interior of your line and you will have a pro bowler then TE Jared Cook of South Carolina  needs to work on his blocking, but was the fastest tight end at the combine running a 4.50.|`|8RkYlaQxaa	They need another RB to help back up Brian Westbrook. The best fit for the 21st. pick would be Chris Wells out of Ohio State. He's big, fast, and great tackle breaker. So there's the 21st. pick.<br>  <br>  We also need a O-Lineman. Most of our O-line is old and we need some back-up. I say we take a guy like Cornelius Robinson. He's big and can help protect Donovan as well.<br>  <br>  Those are my two hopeful picks. Lets just hope we don't trade out of the first round again just like the last two years!|`|CP2Ahl1baa	they should draft michel oher with the first one then trade down the second one and get sean green and jared cook<br>  <br>  they get there power back there tackle and there TE<br>  <br>  they might even trade lito sheperd for a late first round pick and could get eben birttin <br>  <br>  they could have a monster draft|`|yg3Pveakaa	Get a RB and OL/WR..BUt if you can get TJ at WR..get the OL for pass protection..|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Someone who is overrated and not amount to squat like usual.

Michael Curry needs plays to put the ball in Iversons hands. If Iverson doesnt score than the Pistons will have a hard time winning. Then their defense is the worst that I have seen it in years. I would put Rodney Stuckey on the bench too. Pistons need a pg that can get Iverson the ball. Rodney Stuckey can score too. So i would let Stuckey come off the bench scoring.|`|WhO1j091aa	they'll get a low seed in the playoffs and lose in the first round. so if you consider that done, then sure|`|tjLbXhtEaa	Yup the engine seized up when Joe D  traded 'MR.

t1b1rnI0aa	I would say either corner back or safety if you want to play defense. Just in case you dont kno the positions at all cornerbacks line up near the edge of the field and mainly defend the pass, safeties line up about 15 yards back off the ball and mostly defend the pass but are sometimes used in run defense. I think you would be best for these posistions because you are not big enough to be a linebacker or lineman. If you wanted to be on offense I would say a wide reciever or possibly a tight end.
