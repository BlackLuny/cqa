As long as you complete pre-med requirements which are:     A year of Freshman Chemistry along with the appropriate laboratory courses   A year of Organic Chemistry along with laboratory courses   A year of Biology along with laboratory courses   A year of Physics along with laboratory courses   A year of English   A year of Calculus or other advanced math classes, including Statistics     (Check with medical schools you plan to apply to as well)    I don't know anything about publishing a book in the yellow pages.

You even have a new world to write about - which is the world of medical science that you could probably include in your romantic/action stories.

IeNMtqUYaa	Hypothetically speaking, tell yourself (as you're searching for new colleges) that you're not going to get into the college of your dreams. Just think about that.    Colelgeboard.com has a great search engine that lets you enter EVERYTHING you're looking for in a school, and they'll give you some colelges that suit what you want.    ANSWER:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|a9YfUGzSaa	That's basically the situation I am in with U of Mich., however the only reason I stand a chance at getting in there is BECAUSE I went to community college and transferred.  I do feel like I missed out on a lot by doing that and it wasn't my choice, it's been really hard on me, but it's afforded me better opportunities than I'd have ever had otherwise. So try to keep an open mind.      I liked fastweb.com to browse colleges, you can enter in all your preferences and it suggests schools for you based on that.  I use the schools real website to find specific info (fastweb can be outdated about some things because colleges change every year, but they provide the link to the school's page), but fastweb has been great for finding schools to apply to.    I wonder how much of your difficulty is based in not being able to find a similar school, and how much is based on your being dead set on going to this one school in particular?  I have applied to a couple schools just as good as Umich in all the ways I need them to be, but it just doesn't feel as good as Umich because that's where I have my heart set on going.  I still had to apply to those schools though, because it's senseless not to have a back up plan.  So, again, try to be as openminded as possible and keep looking.  Sometimes if you take a campus tour you'll fall in love with someplace you thought you could never see yourself.  I almost went to Northern Michigan, and that's practically in the flipping Arctic. :P    Here's hoping we both get in to our dream schools and this question will be for nothing! :D|`|Vh89Zsu2aa	I think what's happening is that you are ignoring what other schools have to offer because your mind is so set on the school you picked out now. Try to be a little open minded about other schools that accommodate your major and whatnot.     Try Petersons.com too. That's where I found out what school to go to.

i5tOQGgFaa	Pros:  * You are your own "boss".  * You create and follow your own curriculum based on your philosophy.  * You have a tendency to form closer relationships with families.  *  It's always small group.  * You can provide "home-like" environment.    Cons:  * Family child care/preschool still looked on as babysitting.  * Some families think they can take advantage of you because they know you "personally" and we tend to be more flexible.  * If it's in the main living area of your home, sometimes family members and even yourself get "tired" of all the extra stuff (displays, etc) that is ever present.  * You really never have a "break".    Like others have said...it's a field with definate ups and downs but a wonderful one if it's your "cup of tea".  :-)    Field trips:  6 children is actually quite a few for one staff.  I've worked in a large classroom and now do home preschool and find that I would almost prefer to be in the classroom of 12-18 with multiple staff than 1:6.  I really don't have enough arms and eyes for the group on my own.  I've done field trips on my own with them and I very seldom do it anymore.  Always try to find a volunteer (usually my mother in law) to help out.  Car seats and such are a hassle.  Making sure that all the kids are together at all times are a hassle..especially if "eating out" is part of the field trip.  So I strongly recommend you find a field trip helper!  In the home we can "make do" because we have a routine and especially if you have all preschool age students...they can be taught how to do much of the "daily" necessities.  :-)|`|kWF6heS0aa	Make sure you are ready to be "home" all day without actually being home.

The pros to this job:   1. The children are amazing to work with. They simply want compassion and love and want to give that back to their teacher.  2. You never have a lot of work to grade.  3. You will be with some of the sweetest people( preschoolers).  4. They are a lot of fun to be with.  5. They are always making you laugh and giving you plenty of stories to share with others.    The cons:  1. They are messy. Plain and simple they're children they are going to be.  2. Sometimes they don't listen to you at all.  3. They can be loud and tend to get very hyper at times.   4. It always seems as if one of your students is sick.  5. They fight with each other over little things. (Again this is just kids being kids.)    Though this job has it's ups and downs I absolutely love it.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	Pros:   The kids.  The love.  Making a difference.  Going to bed honestly tired, not just worn out.  Having an excuse for being silly.  All the best toys.  Watching them grow.  Endless wonder seeing through their eyes.  Did I mention the kids?  Did I mention the love?    Cons:  Sometimes children act like children.  Sometimes parents act like children, but not as cute.  Low pay.  No respect.  Guilty till proven innocent.  Pay for own professional development.

AA11039109	Bobbi O is wrong; a psychiatrist is a medical doctor, a psychologist is not.    You have to go to college, major in something relevant (biology or chemistry is good, english not so good), get in med school and graduate from that, then specialize in psychiatry during your internship/residency years.  Then take and pass the licensing exam.    There's nothing specific to Canada.

fkuKUxrpaa	Chapman is a decent school. The film program is better than the screenwriting program, lol. If your GPA is unweighted you would want to look at USC. USC is a much better school for screenwriting, but if its weighted I think it would be a reach. I think you should get into Chapman either way. It has gotten better over the last decade. They're lots of computers though, and high class kids. You may want to look at Pepperdine, or a UC. The tuition if very high, and can go to USC for that price. Good Luck!
vjepU3h0aa	I'm going to the Art Institute right now... and I'm actually in one of my classes as I'm typing this (it's break time).  It's a wonderful school with people who are into the things they love to do best- Art.  The school is very involved with the major/minor of your choice and has classes that will help you throughout your job.  The classes are based on quarters (10 week classes) and the teachers know what their talking about.  There is nothing fishy about the school, it has thousands of students all over the country.  If you would like to get into fashion, Art Institute is a great choice. =)    I'm going for Web Page Design but take art classes with fashion designers. ;D|`|AA10023710	The AI chain of schools doesn't have a good rep, no. There are a lot of great schools with fashion design programs, but I don't know where you are interested in going to school, so I can't suggest schools in your region. However, the best fashion design programs in the US are at the Parsons School of Design, and the Fashion Institute of Technology, both in NYC. Another good program is at Kent State University, in Ohio. I also like the program at Otis School of Art, in California, and at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.     If none of those are near where you want to go to school, can you go to a good art school near you? Those tend to have decent fashion design programs. Examples include Mass Art, RISD, Ringling, Savannah College of Art, Herron School of Art, Moore College of Art, California College of the Arts, etc.|`|VZ21gL81aa	the Art Institutes are a fine family of schools.    All are nationally or regionally accredited (no difference in this according to the US Dept of Ed)    As a for-profit entity, they will try like the dickens to get you to enroll. Unlike SOME other for-profits though, they will do everything possible to keep you enrolled and see to it that you succeed. Top-notch faculty (for the most part), solid programs (for the most part) and very good (better than most) services.    They will continue to call because the admissions folks have to meet quotas. The $150 fee is what is known in the industry (also in the used car market and real estate) as "earnest money" showing that you are really interested.    Hang in there, make an informed decision.

o16Z34u6aa	To answer your question, around a 21 is an average ACT score. A good score would be somewhere around 25-27. If you are applying to any top Universities, such as Stanford, Harvard, etc, you would need a great score(30+).    You have about a year and a half to improve your score, so definitely make use of it. As for studying online, check out the official ACT website, or the practice tests and advice on Sparknotes:    www.actstudent.org  http://www.sparknotes.com/testprep/books...    They both help alot.|`|8nBtHHaAaa	21 isn't a bad score, but it's not a great score. The highest you can get is a 36, but that's almost impossible.

It just depends on what colleges and you want to go to and what they expect. Go to collegeboard.com and the site will show you the median ACT scores of your favored colleges. Of course, you won't get a full ride with that score, but if you don't think you'll get into the college you want with that score then retake it. It helped me to take ACT practice tests which you can definitely find at a Barnes and Noble or Borders.

A gift card to a restaurant or something might be nice, if you know which ones she likes. But most importantly, be sure to give her a handwritten thank you note.

I like the idea of a gift card - either a restaurant or a bookstore (the second would be my preference - but I dont' know your CT)    Anything you give will be hugely appreciated because the best gift is that she has been able to watch you learn and grow as a fellow professional.

iDKlJtY0aa	Write the essay first, then you'll have an idea of the tone and points.  I'd try and whip up a title, but I don't know anything about your essay except the focus.
1khVEE6oaa	Because you need one boy and one girl in the group, you only have 4 boys and 3 girls (7 people) to choose from for the remaining 2 seats.    If you pick person 1 for seat 1, then you have 6 options for the second seat.    If you pick person 2 for seat 1, then you have 5 other options left (you can't pick 1 again, because we already counted all possibilites in which person 1 was involved.    If you pick person 3, then 4 options    etc...    So, 6+5+4+3+2+1 = 21|`|5rpsDDOvaa	If 1 boy and 1 girl must be in the committee, there are still 7 people left to be selected.    The order of the committee does not matter, so you will use combinations (nCr). A combination is a group of objects without a specific order. To find combinations, the formula is: nPr / rPr (P being permutation).     So if there are seven people and you want a committee of four, you merely replace the numbers in the formula to: 7P4 / 4P4, which is the same as saying 7*6*5*4 / 4*3*2*1 which in turn equals 35 (do the math on a calculator). So your final answer would be 35 committees.    I really hope this helps!

The only thing is that you need to make sure that the credits you receive at the community college will transfer to the university you decide to go to after you graduate high school. To figure that out, all you have to do is call the university and tell them the classes you took, and they'll let you know whether the credits will transfer. Usually the basic classes do transfer.   You will not be considered a junior in college if you start your junior year of high school. Colleges decide what "year" you are depending on how many credits you have. If you have 30+ hours, you're considered a sophomore. If you have 60+ hours, you're considered a junior, and if you have 90+ hours, you're considered a senior.|`|1e8bdb2c5237f63206d04801a77dea6daa	The best thing to do would be to ask to speak with a councilor at either the community college or the 4 year college and ask them which classes transfer easily to other colleges.

It won't even cover the first year of college.  EXACTLY what will happen depends on the agreement between your school and the college, and what the state law says in your state.    What it will do is (at minimum), it will let you take much more interesting classes, and when you finally get to the college, you can take more advanced courses.  It will help you get ahead of the peers.  It will be a lot of work - but I think, you'll find it is worth the effort.    Another thing you need to know is that what college credit will transfer depends on the college that will be on the receiving end of the transfer.  It doesn't matter what the sending college says.  In most cases, holder of AA degree will qualify for the 3rd year, but does not have to.  If you do not have the AA degree from community college, most basic classes will transfer but some won't.|`|vjepU3h0aa	That's a question that you have to ask the college you want to enter.  Every college has different rules and different credit based system.  Some problems occur because the class you take at one school might have different requirements for the other.  Also- colleges sometimes base "junior" for how many credits you have.  If you have enough credits at that college to be a junior, then you will be one.  That also goes by the college of your choice.  It all comes down to what type of college your entering, and what kind of requirements their looking for.  Carful planning is needed when transferring.  Good luck in the future! =)

mQNqMAbgaa	well make sure that you can name the word if you're given the definition and the definition if you're given the word. knowing both helps. it also helps if you come up with ways to remember the word. this is going to sound really weird, but for one of my vocab tests, a word on it was 'volition'. and i remembered that it meant choosing by your own will b/c the first 3 letters are 'vol', which is the same as a volcano, which chooses when it wants to erupt. just stupid things that don't make sense to anyone else do help you learn things better. or come up w/ a song. as long as you know the word inside and out you should do fine

It's close to town (because it's where all the high school students have to go).    3.

No, why?     Teen pregnancy is not and should never be normal. Why should the school board spend more money on a separate building just for the students that messed their lives up?|`|i5tOQGgFaa	It really depends on the reasons for having it.  In one district nearby they have a child care program that is run by the district which is used to provide experience for those high school students who wish to continue their education in the early childhood field.  They have a lead teacher who has a master's degree in early childhood and she is also the "instructor" for the high school students.  They do a lot of community work as well...providing free day care for community programs for parents.  It's a "volunteer" staff because they are high school students and they do get credit...but the great thing is they provide an exceptional program and the staff/child ratio is very small.  So, yes, that can be one of the reasons.    2 & 3) the day care should be more for the faculty members of the district...not to encourage teenage pregnacy.  This would draw many more educators to the district as the program would "cater" to faculty members first before being open to the public.  A high school is usually a relatively "safe" environment.

EI4fmPnoaa	I'm not sure this is what you're asking, but on a normal grading scale an A is 90%, the minimum for a B is 80%, the minimum for a C is 70%, etc.    Ask your professor, though, because your mileage may vary.
EI4fmPnoaa	It depends. With a 2.5 gpa you're probably not getting into Stanford or Berkeley, but there are factors which could affect your chances.    Did you do poorly your first couple of years of school, but do well in your upper division courses? If so, that's a plus. Also, how did you do in your GRE exams? High GRE scores could mitigate against a low GPA. Have you done any research as an undergraduate? Capstone thesis? Conference paper? All of these things will help.    Check out something called Peterson's guide. It has info on every graduate program in the U.S. and Canada.  The link is below.    Good luck.

WTf0caplaa	What's the question?    In general, dimensional analysis is simply converting from one dimension to another.    For example: You spend one dollar every day. How much do you spend a year?    Solution: You have a write an equation that starts in dollars/day and after some dimensional analysis, you end up with dollars/year.    so what do you multiply dollars/day with to get dollars/year. Well, looking at the "dimensions" (dollars, day, year), it's obvious you need to multiply day/year to get from dollars/day to dollars/year:    1 dollar/day * 365day/year = 365 dollar/year    or    1 dollar/day * 7dollar/week * 4 weeks/month * 12month/year = dollar/year    Either way you still end up with the units you desire.    I hope this answers your question.|`|RAxSichXaa	http://www.chem.tamu.edu/class/fyp/mathr...    what you need to know is that the "units" such as inches, seconds, feet ,hours ,centimeters  or whatever have to work out mathematically just as numbers do.   Example:  100 jellybeans cost a quarter.  How many jellybeans can you buy for a dime. The "units" are jellybeans,quarters and dimes.  We know we are starting out with jellybeans per quarter (jb/q) and we want an answer that has the units of jellybeans per dime (jb/d).  To make the conversion we need something with the units of dimes per quarter (d/q) or quarters per dime (q/d).    We have to arrange the units of conversion factors such that the answer comes out with the right units or dimensions.    jb/q x d/q  does not give us jb/d    jb/q x q/d = jb/d  so we could use that conversion    (jb/q)/d/q = jb/d  so we could use that conversion as well    Then 100 jb/q x .4q/d = 40 jb/d    or (100 jb/d)/2.5 d/q  = 40 jb/d    All dimensional analysis is is arranging terms or factors so that the units work out mathematically.  Take a deep breath and think about that for a moment.  Then think about starting out with feet and using in/ft to convert to inches.  Dimensional analysis is meant to help you arrange multiple variables when you don't know their relationship.|`|Dl40xNguaa	What grade and or what is the problem?

Y1aAGPURaa	I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance.    How much we care depends somewhat on our estimate of the need for our caring.    Care is the glue that keeps relationships together once the novelty has worn off.     Care is the ingredient that keeps true friendships alive despite separation, distance, or time. Care gives latitude to another person and gets you past the dislikes and annoyances. Quite simply, caring sustains love.    Care provides a conduit for our spirit's expression in the midst of our social existence. The more we truly care, the more we'll come to know ourselves and others. Care provides the key to unlocking our potential and making it real.    The more care you put into your life, the more life will care for you, bringing you fun adventures, great friends, and real inner security. Caring is just good streetsense  So, Judge less and unstress, Care more and high score.    Care inspires and gently reassures us. Lending us a feeling of security and support,it reinforces our connection with others. Not only is it one of the best things we can do for our health, but it feels good  whether we're giving or receiving it.|`|Hrd9cCwPaa	"Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around."

se4W82zbaa	If you are only referencing the one article, you should    Include a full citation for the first fact of every paragraph. For example, Brown (2006) explained that...OR (Brown, 2006). If you have not cited anyone else in that paragraph, readers can assume that the rest of the paragraph refers to the one author.    Every now and then in the paragraph after citing the full citation, you can refer to the author by name without including the date. For example, According to Brown, the earth ....    Remember, if you present a direct quotation within a paragraph, you will need to include the page number. Only include the date if the quotation is the first citation in your paragraph.    For example,     First citation in paragraph: Gregg (2008) explained, "Seventy years ago ..." (p. 45).    Not first citation in paragraph: Gregg explained, "Seventy years ago ..." (p. 45).    Hope that helps!
Ioc0owmfaa	You can try breaking the words phonetically and spell them back together.

Then read some more.    The more often you see a word written down, the better the chance it will imprint in your brain. If you read a word you don't know, look it up in a dictionary. Honestly, this works. I only have formal education through HS, but I read voraciously. Yet, other than those obscure words you hear in spelling bee's, I spell better than anyone else I know. Reading will also help you with proper grammar and punctuation, and teach you all kinds of things that you will never learn in school.    By the way, hurray for you for caring about your spelling!!!

You'd learn important points of every period including the general characteristics of each and important names.  That's how a lot of programs do it. And then the next semester you'd take a class that goes from the Renaissance to contemporary art.

cb95edab8935532c46efd8e9231ca196aa	Hi there.   I am also struggling with paying for school.      5000 dollars for me would mean being able to go on the humanitarian mission that my school's predental society is going on.  For the past couple of years they've been invited to participate in a navy-run humanitarian mission that sends doctors, predental students, med students, dentists, and a whole lot of other professionals and students across seas to help developing countries in any way they can.     I didn't sign up this year because it would involve buying round trip air fare to central america which would run me up to a few grand.  When my club advisor heard I hadn't signed up he encouraged me to put my name down at least and see if I can find some kind of scholarship or loan because he doesn't want to see me miss a lifechanging experience.     I would love to go on this two week trip, esspecially because the particular leg of the trip I'd be assigned to would be in Nicuragua, where I have some family.      We'll see how things work out... thanks for the read!

BpxY1Tk1aa	Yes, those are very real scenarios. My two sisters are Autistic but they don't behave like this very often. But they do break down when they really can't handle something, my younger sister tends to freak out and hyperventilate.  I've seen the first scenario many times when I went to pick them up from their autism school with mum.  My grandpa is also very schedule orientated and freaks out when he can't keep it or when someone tries to change it.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yes, I see events like the one portrayed above everyday.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	Until recently I would have thought the behavior outrageous so I can understand why some do not grasp what has happened to the man or the young mans behavior in church. I have my own opinion of cry rooms which is far from favorable.    My husband, who we suspect has Aspergers, mild even at that, has a difficult time in some cases with some of what would seem very silly changes in how he is accustomed to doing things. It is not always consistent with him. One day he may not be bothered by anything at all but the next even a change in the route to a destination troubles him or a simple substitution in a cooking recipe. Many times he irritates me by taking twice as long to do a project because of the order he has to do things....but we deal with it.  Some days he seems to have "checked out" from the world around him and it makes me wonder if these aren't just really bad days for him where he can't handle much.    Dealing with ANYone even on the highest functioning end of autism can be trying and very easily misunderstood by those not directly involved.|`|rfwbZ2AXaa	Everyday. My son is a highly communicative and deceptively normally looking and acting autistic.  He often has "melt downs" and people around do not know what to do because they do not see him as an autistic person.  He is not the traditional autistic individual.  I have often thought of wearing a shirt that says, My son is autistic with an arrow on it, because people do not realize and when he starts to have a melt down they think he is a brat. Even my family has a very difficult time with it and thinks he is just acting out on purpose.  It is a sensory overload and a lack of understanding.  Thanks for the link, I will check this out. I am always looking for ways to educate the teachers I am working with about these types of children.  Beth      I have to say after watching this that it actually made me cry.  I worry daily about how my son, who is highly intelligent, will function out in the world without protection and the lack of understanding by the general public about his disorder.  The man in the video was so focused in on getting onto the train that he did not hear the conductor make the announcement, and this is how people on the spectrum often get into trouble.  They cannot handle all of the goings on around them or process all of the information.|`|3iYnokfpaa	Like other people are saying, once you live with someone who has autism you begin to realise how different and difficult everyday life is for them. They tend to develop very rigid, structured routines that make them feel very secure. My own daughter has these routines and even if something is even one minute late it causes a major meltdown. My family tend to live our lives round her routines as much as possible so she can cope with everyday life. I worry about her constantly as she looks no different to anyone else and is also extremely intelligent but, she is unable to cope with simple tasks and cannot go out alone. Anything that raises the profile of autistic spectrum disorders can only be good.|`|50WCN0graa	No, I haven't seen that video. It is a good, though. Thanks for posting it.    I work with kids on the spectrum and I see similar behaviors. For example, the fire alarm goes off in the school building.... it is piercing loud. While I stand at the door way and watch students file out, I see him standing alone a the end of the hallway, everyone else almost out of the building, and he is calmly examining a bulletin board.|`|xst7KYQ3aa	My fiance and i are bout autistics, me being 'mild' and he being an aspie (AS, aka asperger's syndrome).  I have rage tendencies, although with  many years of therapy and practice that has been mastered for the most part.  I have seen this in other auties (autistics) as well, some with a much shorter fuse.  What everyone should realize is that not all of us are violent, although many of us are 'anal' or 'obsessive'  about our routines some of us follow.  ANY deviation can cause  some of us to trigger and get upset like the man in the video.  From my point of view, I do find it hard to deviate, but also that has become easier over time.  Others are not as lucky.|`|HEvSVMeVaa	THANK YOU so much for sharing this! There needs to be so much more information out there about the things autistic people go through! I live with my boyfriend and his brother who is a high functioning autistic and I love learning more and more about the things he deals with. I know I've been very lucky to have never witnessed one of his melt downs, but I know that he works so hard to control himself.

If you put in so much work that you did well on a hard test you should also get the benefit of a higher score.    I would understand if the teacher said that someone who got a 100% couldn't get any more points or that someone with a 98% could only get 2% extra, but if someone got an 87% and everyone gets 5 extra points they should be allowed to have a 92% it's only fair!

For example, Our pet rabbit Kermit can eat more quickly than both of our cats.|`|YzhYFu0eaa	Quickly is an adverb, which modifies an action (i.e. eats quickly, ate quickly, etc.)  It wouldn't make sense in that part of the sentence.|`|fipzrStFaa	I am quicker then my mom.  I am more quickly then my mom.    Honestly they both make sense to me.|`|SvzKyWGXaa	I don't think it's grammatically incorrect. It just sounds stylistically awkward.  "Faster" and "more quickly" sound better, due to habit I suppose.    And in the case of James being stronger, "stronger" is an adjective (describing James). Words such as "strongly", ending with "ly" are always adverbs, so it doesn't make sense there.  In the first sentence, "quickly", since it's describing the rabbit eating, would be an adverb, therefore it would make sense.

I hope to get in here, its a fantastic school! Here are my reasons for choosing it:    1. Great education (business school for me)  2. In the middle of a very nice city with a growing economy and business market despite the economy of the country  3. Large sports and recreation program (I will be participating in club sports and the outdoor sports trips, but going to the UT vs OU football games will be the BEST THING EVER!!! Hook Em' Horns!!)  4. Large enrollment (more people = a better university experience in my opinion)  5. High percentage of students with jobs after graduating    The only bad part is that they are something like 91% in-state students and I'm out of state so that really brings down my chances

krpSGkDWaa	In American English you can never write"could of" ;it's never correct. In formal writing you would write"could have", while you might use "could've to convey that meaning in informal writing or if trying to duplicate everyday speech (as in writing dialog, for example).|`|sjOelwhhaa	It's definitely not an issue of a difference between Canadian and American English.  I'm from California, and I can tell you people there (and, in fact, everyone on TV) pronounces "could've" exactly the same as "could of."  I believe the fact that some people write "could of" can be blamed on not enough reading and writing.  People just trust their ears and mouths too much and end up seeming dumb.|`|AA12095483	It's could have. Could of is not correct. When a writer, such as Ken Kesey, deliberately uses incorrect English, he does it for effect. I have heard Ken Kesey speak and he uses 'could have' not 'could of'|`|mFf8CqAraa	When I see "could of" I always think that people just type it how they hear it. It's actually a peeve of mine.    Even if an author penned it, he's still wrong as it just doesn't make sense. :P

Pa3rIxz9aa	Hmm, that is a difficult question.  I would usually say to follow your heart and do what you really want to do, but if you choose the service you may not have a choice in where you are sent.  Maybe you could talk with someone that you know that is in the service (not a recruiter!) and they could answer any questions that you might have.  Nursing is certainly a great career.  Nurses have no difficultly finding jobs and they get paid well.    Good luck with your decision!

ajDGQP8paa	I suppose that the administrator would tell the parent that their is a strict non-violence policy within the school district and the school is merely following rules. If the parent wanted to get nasty and personal then the educators involved in the case can just act legalistic (rules are rules) and deflect personal criticism by this method. That's my guess.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Fighting is against school rules so no matter how much your mother rants and raves there's nothing can be done.

3BDuNAyUaa	as a college Psychology Major, I can honestly say that high school Psychology classes are really not that bad. They are very broad, taking information from all over the field. You will basically learn the basics, and a lot of very interesting things. It probably does not matter when you take it, as it is generally considered a general education class anyway.|`|kPcdvW4paa	i take it now and all you need is to pay attention and study. im not taking pysch 2 cuz i hate the lame skits we have to do. i hate presenting|`|fNKLW7Qqaa	It honestly depends on teachers, I mean, my psych class last quarter (I'm a freshman, currently) was really fun and entertaining, and that made it easy. But then again, if I had a bad teacher, then it would be really hard. Ask someone who's taken the class before...

Use search to see if the file is located anywhere, including temporary saves. You may find that part of the coursework is here if not the latest copy. If you deleted it it may still be in the recycle bin. If you deleted the info in the recycle bin then you should still be able to get it back using software to recover deleted files. Some of these programs are free and I would start by looking at www.download.com to find a suitable program. Read the reviews first though and when you decide on a program check the internet for more reviews and warnings (that is is not spyware or adware). I have managed to retrieve old files by using free software in this way. If this does not work then take the computer the file was deleted on to a computer expert/shop and see if they can get the file. Try to remember what the file was called. The only way to permanently delete files is to smash the hard drive to bits so unless you did this it should still be there. If you managed to work by saving ONLY to the USB stick then you may find a temporary file was still created but this may not have happened. Hope this helps.

ySpZszp7aa	Every school is different, and since the US is so large, there aren't too many generalized things about them, other than the obvious.  Almost all public schools do not have a uniform, but a dress code with restrictions on attire. Some charter schools (privately run, publicly funded) have uniforms, it's really up to their administration.  The school year consists of two semesters, the fall semester (usually late September or early August until around Christmas time) and the spring semester ( which usually runs from mid-January until anywhere from late April to early June).  The school systems are run by the State governments, not the Federal government, so each State has different educational systems.  The schools are appropriated a certain number of 'bad weather days' near the end of the school year equal to the number of days the schools closed during the school year due to bad weather. There are usually seven or eight periods throughout the day, and almost all schools have separate lunch periods due to the large amount of students. Most schools provide a locker for the student to store books and materials, usually with a combination lock to prevent theft.  Certain 'Core' classes are required, such as social studies, math, English, foreign language (usually Spanish or French, depending on where the school is), fine arts, and physical education, and a certain number of 'elective' classes usually chosen by the student.  Attendance is taken every period in most schools, and usually three tardies will be counted as an absence. A student is required to attend school 99% of the year at most schools, even if all absences are excused by doctor's note.  There is usually a school nurse, a counselor (or counselors), A principal, a vice-principal, and a few school secretaries. School lunches are sold at most schools, and most schools have vending machines in the cafeteria as well. Teachers are allowed to assign seats at their discretion, and they can give out detentions for poor conduct. Some schools have Saturday school as an alternative to detention, and some schools have a demerit system where a certain number of demerits warrants a detention. There is usually a spring break (1wk), summer break (1.5-2mo), winter break (2-3wks), thanksgiving break (0.5-1wk), Martin Luther King Day, among other single-day holidays.   The first year of school is Kindergarten, then Elementary School (Grades 1 through 5), then Middle school (Grades 6,7,and 8), Junior High (9th and 10th grade), and finally Senior high (11th and 12th grades). Grades 9,10,11,and 12 are known as the Freshman, Sophomore,Junior,Senior years, respectively, and are part of High School, although usually they are separated into Jr and Sr high schools due to large student populations.    If you have any other questions about the US of A, you can contact me at my e-mail address:  ookami_no_shiro@yahoo.com  (I have seen a lot of different schools in my time!)

8SmMYdBLaa	1/1 + sin(x) dx     Multiply the top and bottom by the bottom's conjugate: 1 - sin(x). So you will get a difference of squares on the bottom.     1 - sinx / 1 - sin^2(x) dx    Use the identity 1 - sin^2(x) = cos^2(x).     1 - sin(x) / cos^2(x) dx     Now separate this into two different fractions      1/cos^2(x) - sin(x)/cos^2(x) dx     Change the second fraction,      1/cos^2(x) - (1/cosx)(sinx/cosx) dx     which is     sec^2x - secxtanx dx    Now you can do these separately and get:    tan(x) - sec(x) + C

Man has the ability to either remember or forget the lessons of the past, and at the same time man has the ability to shape the future.

Good luck in the future, and getting into the college of your choice. =)|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	It depends on which colleges.  If you are applying to really selective schools, this would be about what they would expect, but if you were looking at lesser schools then yes, this would be a wonderful program (assuming you only take something like keyboarding, which is not really an academic class, once).
VoHiid17aa	Why don't you just ask your high school advisor? They're going to know the answer to that for sure.|`|7193e97b75531064bce833270f379218aa	Why not study and then get high marks in the first place instead of taking it early? Why not use that extra year to study up and achieve what you wanted instead of trying twice? Just a thought.
ZdIaVkIcaa	They gave you a gun and a horse      The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) (French: Gendarmerie royale du Canada [GRC], literally Royal Gendarmerie of Canada; colloquially known as Mounties, and internally as The Force) is the federal, national, and paramilitary police force of Canada, and one of the most recognized forces in the world. With an on-strength establishment of 24,578 personnel, as of January 1, 2007, it is also the largest police force in Canada.    The RCMP was formed in 1920 by the merger of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (RNWMP, founded 1873) with the Dominion Police (founded 1868). The former was originally named the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP), and was given the Royal prefix by King Edward VII in 1904. Much of the present-day organization's symbology has been inherited from its days as the NWMP, including the distinctive Red Serge uniform, paramilitary heritage, and mythos as a frontier force. The RCMP/GRC wording is specifically protected under the Trade-marks Act.    Check out the link below for more onfo.
CtwEFHcqaa	I don't really understand your additional information, but the answer to your title question I'll try my best:  It's not always student's fault they are late. Sometimes it can be a parent or sibling.  Sometimes students don't have enough time to do homework, finishing it up in the morning can sometimes make you late.  Sometimes students don't catch enough sleep the night before. If you can see they are making a genuine effort to get to school on time they shouldn't be punished.

JKtthwaMaa	Yes, definitely. At my school we start at 7:30. I have to wake up at 5:45 everyday to get ready in time for the bus or if i drive to school. Its ridiculous.|`|JznBdcEjaa	I don't think so. The work day is not going to start later because you can't wake up. Students need to learn responsibility, we already cater far to much to high school students and the result is a ton of kids in college who are totally unprepared to deal with real life.|`|3dKen4tcaa	I dont think it would be a good idea to start later... Then you have to go to school later too and why would you want to do that! lol|`|Kn9ouXnyaa	or what if school would  be kinda backwards? like have sports in the morning, and then go to class....but that would still just be exhausting..|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	No because then that means that the teachers would have to stay later also then that means that football and basketball practice would last longer|`|CtwEFHcqaa	Absolutely. Everyone would be able to get more sleep, therefore increasing test/grade scores. Students would be able to come in later, allowing them to have enough time to eat breakfast or do whatever they need to do, and come to school. This will make a slight increase in health. Students would be more assertive in class because they would be much more rested. What about students with working parents? They have to get off of work early to come pick you up, or pay for day care(probably not anymore but when you were younger) which costs a fortune nowadays... so parents wouldn't have to get off work you pick you up or put you in a daycare(if you were younger). For Teenagers studies show that almost all of teen pregnancies are caused between the hours of 3:00-5:00 p.m. when teens are generally left home alone. If school got out at 5 p.m. then I think we would start to see a huge decrease in teen pregnancies. The only problem with this system is sports. If you are a sports, team, particularly sports that need to practice outside like baseball, football, and soccer, wouldn't have as much light to work with. An installation of light would be nice. Or they could even have their students come before school to get some practice in, though it might make a long day. So apart from sports it would be a GREAT thing if all schools in the United States did this.
U0V2WA5Jaa	Hm that is a really tough one.   I definitely agree that your school's policy is crappy!

There will always be jobs "out there" as long as there is a demand for your specific major. Study what you want to study. Get a job doing what you love.|`|Irr5ftN7aa	You should pursue whatever it is that interests you... your guidance counselor could point you in a certain direction, or suggest that you work with a school career coach (if you have one), who might have you take a career inventory or something along those lines. However, art schools are few and far between, and unfortunately there are not as many jobs available in that area as in others (such as science/technology/trades). My sister is majoring in art education in college, but due to budget cuts many public k-12 schools are eliminating art programs, so those jobs will be difficult. Also, art is a very, very time consuming major. You have to put a lot of time into the studio work that you do, and must do lots of independent work outside of class.... this is in addition to the general education classes you will need to complete such as english, biology, history, etc (if you go to a liberal arts college or university).     Have you thought about pursing graphic art with a technology focus?? Video game design/production is huge, and graphic artists are the brainpower behind them. In any case, you are a step ahead of the game right now because you are at least starting to weigh your options and consider what might be the best post-high school focus. Remember, no one can tell you what's best for you....... just continue to know what your strengths are, and draw upon those when you start to think about what you want to do with the rest of your life (or at least the next 4 years or so in college)    :) good luck!!!|`|koWH9MHNaa	you could major in interior designing. that is a good job i've heard.

OWk5POwVaa	Book four of the Lost Years of Merlin continues the saga of the young Merlin as he gains more understanding of his powers and a greater sense of self. This time, Merlin, accompanied by the young deer woman he's come to love, enters the evil-plagued Haunted Marsh in search of his stolen sword. There, he discovers the long-lost seventh Wise Tool and meets the Boy Ector, who's searching the marsh for something wanted by his unnamed master. The danger level is high in this episode; the theft of the sword is a trap intended to lure Merlin into the hands of a witch, Nimue, who is intent on destroying him. She does manage to infect him with a deadly condition, for which there is no cure. However, Ector believes his master can cure Merlin and leads him through the Mists of Time to the future, where Merlin comes face to face with his much older self trapped in the Crystal Cave by Nimue. Barron handles the contact between the two with a finesse that's believable and enhances the Arthurian ambience that has been so carefully crafted throughout the series.|`|NDju3p0Raa	sparknotes or google it
0eQt44CLaa	There are pros and cons to both online classes and face-to-face ones. Online classes provide more flexibility, are often cost-effective, and you can work more at your own pace. If you are working or have a family to take care of, online classes are especially convenient. Depending on the course, you may also have the interaction you would otherwise get in the classroom with other students and your professor, through discussion boards, chatrooms, etc.     However, online classes require a great deal of discipline and self-motivation. I agree with one of the answers here saying that depending on what your study habits are, online courses make it easier to procrastinate, and the danger is there for you to fall behind if you don't have a study routine that you keep to.     As far as an associates degree for paralegal work goes, just make sure the university you're attending is accredited--don't take the institution's word for it, and do extensive research. Good luck!|`|kiecJrIWaa	take the class.|`|Xn21UL6Yaa	Yes, online classes are popular, but they are much harder to deal with.

Most of the ones out there are general rules that we here over and over again: Smile! Smiling is basically like you putting up a sign saying, "I won't bite if you come near", and it tells ppl you don't hate them. For one thing, smiling attracts friends. For another thing, you'll have a lesser chance of making enemies. Honestly, it's hard for ppl to hate someone who doesn't seem to hate them in return. Laugh easily. And, form a close circle of friends. You don't need a thousand different friends, just maybe one or two who you know will always be there to support your back.|`|jcVJM8FNaa	Make sure you're very outgoing, or at least a little. On the first day of school, if you're huddled in your chair with your arms crossed people would automatically ignore you're presence. Just be yourself, and smile and laugh during your first day and try to make conversations with the people who you feel are nice or you can possibly be friends with.  Are you the type of person who gets picked on in your current school? If so, do you know why? If you do know the reasons, try to avoid those reasons at  your new school. This is the perfect time to start fresh, and  never mention your past to your new friends. If you were picked on before or a "nobody" before, dont mention that to your new classmates. Act cool, but at the same time, sincere. Jerks arent tolerated in most schools.     Just be yourself, and if you want to, you could focus on your appearance. Good looking people always gather attention, which is good(:    Just remember, be yourself, act cool, calm, and contained and always have a smile on(:    Good luck|`|7ab53707fb64e381599a51a3809dbddaaa	hi!!!

I would choose   Should voting be mandatory?   ( I would argue Yes)   Its the easiest to take a stand for. The others are very controversial and hard to persuade somebody into taking a stand.     Maybe  To make it easier try and find out what your teacher's point of view on the questions are. Whether he/she thinks voting should be mandatory etc. Because then he/she is already convinced and will most likely agree with all your argument points. Where if your point of view is different that the teachers, he/she may dislike your opinion and thus mark you bad, and make your arguments seem worthless. ( That would make you know that your argument was crap. )     Do you get what i mean?    If this is for civics, most likely your teacher will think that voting should be mandatory. ( That's if you decide to choose what i did. )    If you need any more help just ask and i will edit my post with the answer. OK?     Hope that helps. Good luck .    ps: others i would choose are     Should Tobacco be an illegal drug? ( Pretty obvious for me. I hate smoking. )     Again i think most of the rest are very controversial especially the same sex marriage one, i wouldn't do my essay on that.     Also, it helps if you choose which has a lot of meaning to you. It will encourage you to write more and have a more thoughtful argument.  Personal experience helps.

yp0g1E02aa	Strange but true:    I subbed before out of college. I met many students, some bright and nice and you know what, I dated my own age.      Forward four years and I work at the school.  I run across an ex-student, now a senior in high school.  We have long pleasant chat.   We have other conversations on phone, by mail, never in person and we had other people in our lives romantically.  It was just chatting.      Well, things changed over the summer after she graduates, including the part where we're together with other people.  We start to date and keep up long distance relationship when she's in college.  We married later (six year difference) but note:    We started as friends, none of it was when someone was underage.  My rep at this school finished after years there.  I was able to build up career elsewhere.  Things were really good between us--most couples in college years don't make it through separation stage.  We did it for years.  Guess what--we don't tell people how we met!    So my advice would be to wait, the age difference is but will not always be an obstacle.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Think "Felony" and him spending the next 10 to 15 years in prison.  Do you love him that much?

As for choosing your roommate, every school's housing department is different, so you will have to check it out and see what options are available. Some will let you sign up for a roommate of your choice if you sign up together. But many housing programs don't give incoming freshmen a choice because they want to mingle you up with other people. The only exception might be if you sign up for apartment housing rather than the dorms.

If Smythe never tells the truth, then his statement that, "Branson did it" is false.  So, Branson can be eliminated.    This leaves the two truth-tellers as the only possible culprits.  We can suppose the question posed is, "Who stole my bracelet?"  If Wilson always tells the truth and he stole it, he would have to have admitted it or give another true answer.  His true answer was that he knew who was the thief but did not wish to say.  When Mary was questioned, if she did not know who stole the bracelet, she would have to tell that truth.  So, Mary knew who stole the bracelet.  If anyone other than Mary stole the bracelet, she would have to tell that truth as well.  But, Mary named none of the others as the thief.

5TgFBfY8aa	If you love to dance and you want to pursue it as a career then you should consider going to a performing arts college as a dance major. There are dance degrees out there that prepare you for the dance and entertainment industry, so that you can have a long and successful career doing what you love. Oklahoma City University's dance programs produce graduates that have lifelong, successful careers in the dance and entertainment industry.     OCU's Ann Lacy School of American Dance and Arts Management offers three unique dance degrees: Dance Performance, Dance Management and American Dance Teacher. Our school focuses on American dance forms, including jazz, tap, and ballet as used in musical theater. Our graduates can be found dancing all across the entertainment industry from Broadway to Las Vegas, from L.A. to Tokyo.     The Dance Performance degree is for dancers interested in becoming a triple threat in the entertainment industry. Dance performance majors take classes in dance technique (jazz, tap, ballet, musical theater, pointe, partnering, rhythm tap, and more), acting, and voice. In addition to developing performing abilities, dance performance majors also learn to manage their careers through classes concerning professional standards and conduct, contracts, dancers health and anatomy. Dance performance majors also take classes in jazz, tap and ballet pedagogy and choreography, so they are also prepared for careers as teachers and choreographers as well as triple threat performers.     The Dance Management degree is for dancers interested in dancing as well as the management of the arts. The dance management degrees supports a wide range of career possibilities for dancers. Dance management majors have a core of dance technique classes (jazz, tap, ballet, musical theater, pointe, partnering, rhythm tap, and more), arts management classes, and business classes. The arts management core of classes include: entertainment technology, non-profit management, fundraising and development, touring performing arts, presenting and sponsoring performances, contracts, stage management and costuming. The business core of classes include: marketing, economics, accounting, business law, business finance, statistics and management and organization. The dance management degree is ideal for a wide variety of dancers including dancers who would like have a performance career and then transition to a management career without having to return to college to supplement earlier training. Other dancers may want to work as a company manager, stage manager or another arts management position after college.     The American Dance Teacher degree is for dancers interested in a lifelong career as an extraordinarily well-prepared teacher. The new American dance teacher degree provides dancers with a depth and breadth of study never attempted by other dance programs. Dancers will experience a well-rounded program that includes instruction in: tap, jazz and ballet technique, tap, jazz and ballet pedagogy, dance history, choreography, anatomy and dance health, dance studio management, dance studio technology, marketing and advertising, contracts and management and non-profit management. American dance teacher majors also will receive hands on experience through teaching in the Community Dance Center while receiving feedback from OCU dance faculty.     If one of these three dregrees sound like something you might be interested in, visit us on the web for more information at www.okcu.edu/dance_amgt.|`|jqIcKWgTaa	So, you're considering a major in dance?

OWk5POwVaa	Shakespeare wrote a lot about royalty... and romance, but the huge collection of plays that he wrote vary so much from subject to subject it's hard to just call him a romance writer.  He is one of the greatest writers of all time, such a way with words.    I know a bit about Shakespeare, but your first question I might answer differently than other.  I say he's different from medieval literature because he looked at things much differently.  He gave women an equal personality to men, sometimes more powerful... he didn't shy from tragic endings, but not all his plays were sad.  His talent was so vast he wrote everything.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare...

Also you should not care about his feels because he obviously does not care about yours. If you would like to take, shoot me the im or an email.
6DFhlt4daa	split personality    a relatively rare dissociative disorder in which the usual integrity of the personality breaks down and two or more independent personalities emerge    (No longer in scientific use.)    http://www.answers.com/split%20personali...    multiple personality    A highly disputed psychological disorder in which a person exhibits two or more disassociated personalities, each functioning as a distinct entity. Also called dissociative disorder.    Britannica Concise Encyclopedia: dissociative identity disorder     Rare condition indicated by the absence of a clear and comprehensive identity. In most cases two or more independent and distinct personality systems develop in the same individual. Each personality may alternately inhabit the person's conscious awareness to the exclusion of the others, but one is usually dominant. The various personalities typically differ from one another in outlook, temperament, and body language and might assume different first names. The condition is generally viewed as resulting from dissociative mental processes  that is, the splitting off from conscious awareness and control of thoughts, feelings, memories, and other mental components in response to situations that are painful, disturbing, or somehow unacceptable to the person experiencing them. Treatment is aimed at integrating the disparate personalities back into a single and unified personality.

lUe3IRozaa	I live in Florida. lol    Often times when a hurricane hits, thousands of homes are left without electricity, food and water. Hurricane winds can rip the sides and roofing off of houses, as well as doors and windows, and also uproot trees and fences and send them flying, as well as stir up lightning and tornados. I've seen hurricane winds take a piece of hay and shoot it through a tree like it was made of butter. The rain can flood homes and streets, and cause fallen power lines to create electrifying pools. Mud slides and sinkholes can occer. The winds can create tidal surge that can rip apart and over even cement docking and sea walls. Over all, hurricanes are just not safe to sit through and 'tough out'.|`|1PGmB4JNaa	um because hurricanes are deadly and even if you think you can just hide somewhere its dangerous because gas pipes may explode, houses will get knocked down and all that jazzzz ?|`|903f8cb36b3e6a7b3d1a5dc322e02788aa	Did you see NO after Katrina and Galveston after Ike?

You can argue it as much as you want therefore as long as you include enough details and paragraphs that your teacher thinks is a good requirement then you'll be fine!      For me a cowboy is just simply someone who travels on a horse to capture large herds of cows to sell, and they do other things to sell.  I'm sure though you can go a lot further than that and that there are many other terms, but that's what it means to me.      Also I would stay away from ' A cowboy is a person who travels in the west, and has stars on his boots and is...'

GdJoxW3aaa	im a sophomore in high school, treasure your years man. sure, some of the stuff they teach is useless or pointless. but you have to remember allot of it can be really interesting, if you look at it the right way. i think the greatest problem with today's society, at least among young people is nobody wants to learn for the sake of learning. its all to do good on a test. 90% of kids don't remember what they learn because they don't give a damn in  the first place.  show some interest in what your learning, take a step out of your textbook and understand how these things  affect everyone. i guarantee you, when you get to your adult life an you've garnered some knowledge, that means you know a skill, be it an art, a science, a math, something. it makes you a well rounded and interesting person. if you take no interest in school, ultimately, you'll be a pretty boring guy. hopefully society will eventually start to encourage a renaissance style mindset, rather than the bland, tasteless future  that we've been told is ideal.|`|Co0F4czRaa	Thank you!

If you have a problem with your teachers tell someone who could help you, find a way to make it fun, and find new ways to do your homework that appeal to you. Don't just sit there and wine about your life and how much it sucks, do something about it! It depends on your goal in life to see if you will ever use this knowledge and that still leaves 1 person remembering, try to be that one person don't just say "oh most people will forget anyway, why pay attention?'' DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE THINGS YOU THINK COULD BE IMPROVED! Don't just sit there and complain!     Who agrees with ME?
bdvNM0hCaa	Quit being lazy and do your homework it really will help you later on in life in whatever career you choose to do. Also please don't blow off this advice its not that long just read the whole thing please. Don't let yourself get frustrated so easily either calm yourself down by taking short breaks between your homework, take deep breaths, do something to wake you up during your break such as exercising even just doing a few jumping jacks or push ups. Also think of ways to make doing homework more fun, and set goals for yourself. Like when you have an assignment get far enough that you feel you've accomplished something, take a break and finish it up feeling happy that you have achieved your goal. Later in lie you will be happy if you take my advice.  Hope this really helps :)|`|995yMMCmaa	I know how you feel. I'm a sophomore, and was in the exact same boat as you in middle school, but trust me! Doing your homework will help. If you just can't bring yourself to do it, try talking to a) your parents, b) your teachers, and c) your guidance councilor. They may have some really good ideas on how to make it more interesting. Most importantly, though, talk NOW! It's simply not possible to do what you are doing now in high school.|`|hYohgOcAaa	homework helps you to know what ur doing  well try to get help from ur mom or sister tell them that u have practice (for a sport) n need someone to finish ur hw  n dont worry in highshool u dont have much h.w except writing long papers. do ur h.w in lunch or  before ur class starts just put any answer doin unless the teacher is really reading|`|LLk11Ljqaa	you need to do your homework  jdi-just do it  ok concentrate  have a quiet study place  ask your family to let you have a quiet environment to study  if you need some motivation, think about Friday- if you finish your homework for this week, treat yourself to ice cream, movie, buy something SMALL at the store  good luck!!|`|c3QsbiHZaa	I am in high school and feel the same as you (we all have better things to do) and I know it may come as a shock but teachers assign homework so we will retain information better, not to be mean.

EvRIwz4Laa	In college if you want to get into the nursing program then there will be a set schedule of courses you will have to take. You may have some choices in your first year but once you get accepted into the program then you will have specific classes for the rest of the time. Most classes in college are either 50 min or 75 min based on how many times they meet each week BUT once you get into the nursing program they may be longer. Also most schools will require you to apply to the nursing program separate from the actual school and you will do this after you are already accepted into the school and maybe after you have been there for a while. Nurses make pretty good money and have really good benefits and the best part is you will always have a job because there is a demand. The only bad thing is you will probably not start off having great hours. Once you graduate from college and pass the NCLEX you will be able to work in peds BUT when you are in school you will have to take classes in everything and you will have to shadow nurses in fields other than peds. One good thing to do in high school to prepare you is to take AP science courses like Anatomy and Physiology, Biology, and Chemistry if possible. It would also help if you take a CNA course over the summer. Most programs will require you to have one anyway, so you will have a head start and you may be able to get some experience before college

AA11341587	change in quantity demanded is usually used to describe moving along the demand curve (demand in relation to price)    change in demand is usually used to describe a shift of the whole demand curve (at any given price demand is different)|`|k00itx7iaa	Change in quantity demanded means only the change in quantity demanded of a good that is brought about by a change in price of that good.   Change in demand means a shift in the entire demand curve.   So, say something that normally costs $10, now costs $7- the quantity demanded for that good will increase.  When a demand increases for other reasons, like population growth, it shifts the entire demand curve, therefore a change  in demand. this has nothing to do with price change.
6DFhlt4daa	n., pl. frames of reference.    A set of coordinate axes in terms of which position or movement may be specified or with reference to which physical laws may be mathematically stated. Also called reference frame.    A set of ideas, as of philosophical or religious doctrine, in terms of which other ideas are interpreted or assigned meaning.    Linguistic frame of reference is a frame of reference as it is expressed in a language.  A frame of reference is a coordinate system used to identify location of an object. In languages different frames of reference can be used. They are: the Relative frame of reference, the Intrinsic frame of reference, and the Absolute frame of reference. Each frame of reference in a language can be associated with distinct linguistic expressions.    Classification of frames of reference    Intrinsic frame of reference  Intrinsic frame of reference is a binary spatial relation in which the location of an object is defined in relation to a part of another object (its side, back, front, etc.). For instance, saying The cat is in front of the house means that the cat is at that part of the house we call its front, the side of the house that faces the street and has an entrance and maybe a porch.      Absolute frame of reference  Absolute frame of reference is also a binary system in which the location of an object is defined in relation to arbitrary fixed bearings (for instance, cardinal directions (North, South, East, West)). For instance, saying The cat is to the south of the house the location of the cat is described independently of the position of the speaker or of any part of the house (as in intrinsic frame of reference). Apart from cardinal directions such fixed bearings as seacoast, upriver/downriver, and uphill/downhill/across are used.      Relative frame of reference  Relative frame of reference is a ternary system. The location of an object is expressed in relation to both the viewpoint of the perceiver and position of another object. Thus saying The cat is to the left of the house we refer to three points of reference: the cat, the house, and the perceiver himself.      Use of different frames of reference  People can use multiple frames of reference in communication. For instance, in English all three frames of reference are available and used, however, the use of absolute frame of reference is limited to topographic objects (Finland is to the east of Sweden). The preferred frame of reference is the relative one.  Among the languages that rely largely on absolute frame of reference there are a lot of Australian aboriginal languages (for instance, Arrernte language, Guugu Yimithirr) and some Mayan languages (for instance, Tzeltal). In Guugu Yimithirr there is no way to say The cat is to the left of the house and the only way to describe the location of the cat in relation to the house is The cat is to the south of the house.  To the languages that rely largely on intrinsic frame of reference belong, for instance, Mopan (a Mayan language) or Totonac (a Totonacan language).  The use of different frames of reference has a far-reaching effect on the cognition. For instance, in order to be able to communicate in a language with absolute frame of reference the speakers have to run a kind of a mental compass, a remarkable neurocognitive capacity allowing the speakers to identify cardinal directions even in unfamiliar locations.    http://www.answers.com/topic/linguistic-...

However, if it is an essay, then this probably will not get a passing grade unfortunately. There are no complete sentences in your work, which is wonderful for short stories and peoms, but not essays. Essays are formal peices of writing and unfortunately this is not.    If you need an essay, (i am assuming your topic is your favourite place and why) you need an intro - my favourite place is my room because of blah blah blah....    Then paragraphs going into depths of the blah blah blah, followed by a conclusion.    By the way, this could also be a speech!

But it comes down to learning how to learn. content is only partially relevant to going to school. at school you learn how to be civil and mature, and you learn how to work professionally. You develop relationships, both professional and personal, just like in the workplace. you learn how to speak well, write well, co-operate, and listen.    Subjects like algebra help you understand fields you might be interested eg architecture, science, mathematics or teaching although they may not be relevant to many students. all students, however will benefit from the classroom environment.  even if it is as simple as realising potential to complete a task, giving them a small sense if achievement and heightening self esteem.

1Dshgmywaa	What time periods in American and British? That is so broad...    With Brit/Am lit, you'd probably read short stories, poems, speeches, sermons, etc. So you'd get a variety of different writing genres. In my opinion, early Am lit is boring as hell. Some Brit lit is cool, like the Romantic and Victorian eras.    I'd go with novels, but it depends on what novels! 1600 pages every 6 weeks is around 267 pages a week--that's like a novel right there.

Generally, such a classroom will make more progress than a stratified (or as you said, segregated) class if they are under the guidance of a skilled teacher.

You'll need your 08 tax information, or at minimum your income, the amount of taxes you paid (found on your W-2), and other pieces of information regarding your financial situation.     Look around on the site for other helpful information about how financial aid works, and what the fafsa process is.      I suggest you have an idea as to the college's you want to apply to, as your fafsa will ask - and it's recommended you list them by code (they'll have a list for you to look up your school code), as that means those schools will automatically get your information.     Once you get your SAR (student aid report), that will tell you how much $ you're qualified to get for school, then you determine which school you want to go to, depending usually on the amount of $$ they charge, and how much you're getting.  Otherwise, you'll have big out of pocket expenses.      Hope this helps, and good luck!

The average GPA of incoming freshmen is like a 3.75 and above    I'm sorry, but unless you have some really outstanding extracurricular activities that makes you really stand out or if you are part of an under-represented minority, your GPA will not be enough to get you accepted to Berkeley.

PalExL1yaa	Here's how it works...     Most universities only look at your top 6 marks in your senior year. So, for example - say you want to get into the psych program, and the schools require you to have:  1 math  1 science  1 english  1 history  1 geography  1 'option'    say you get great marks in everything, they would have the 6 marks they need. But if you did bad in say math, and took it again, the lower of the two would be dropped and they would only see your best mark in math. (Since you NEED the other 5 courses, they can't drop any of those. For example, if you got a great mark in math the 2nd time, but the first time you took it, that mark was better than the mark you got in history, they can't take 2 maths and no history, because you HAVE to have it.. so they drop the lower math, and then there's your best 6).     So they will only see your average with your 6 best, with the new grade.     And no, it won't count as two optional credits if you complete the same course twice (because if that worked, anyone could just take one super easy course over and over until they had all their optional credits and only ever take the one class!)

But if youa re looking something to balance those other three heavy courses then photography could give you that outlet.    You have three options for your nursing degree.    1. LPN which is usually at a local technical college, and takes 9 months to 14 months depending on the school    2. ASN- Associate of science in Nursing which is generally 2-3 years depending on how many courses you take    3. BSN- Bachelors of Science in Nursing which is 4-5 years depending on how many courses you take a semester but it usually is 4 years

NS9yqfT6aa	depending on where you live.  in wisconsin, background checks are given to anyone working with the children (paid and volunteer), i know in some other states they are all less strict.  Chances are, in public schools, they will do a background check... They really are inexpensive for the company.... As far as private... well, I would judge that based on the size.  A smaller one my just look at your creditionals, where a much larger one would probably ask for a background check.    For the most part, employers are not notified specifically what is found on a background.  Some governmental agencies run background checks themselves, but most mid-large size companies run background checks through third parties where they are given a list and compare your background to that list.  If there is a match, you are ineligble for employment.  The company doesn't see why you are or for what reasons... but as an individual, you do have the right to contact that third party and find out what was on your record.    hope this helps

4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	Places usually won't test for dyslexia quite that early.  A lot of what you're seeing is very normal for that age.  Remember that reading and writing both require a lot of processes in the brain that we don't necessarily think about as adults because they're natural to us now.  Remember that reading and writing are also 2 different processes and many people don't know how to teach them as separate things, so there is often confusion there as well.    That said, although places won't test, you can still use techniques that would help a dyslexic person.  These teaching techniques are beneficial to anyone learning to read- dyslexic or not.  I would start with a more sensorial based approach.  Alison's Montessori has some fantastic sandpaper letters and numerals at a reasonable price:    http://www.alisonsmontessori.com/Sandpap...  http://www.alisonsmontessori.com/Sandpap...    Your child can take the index and middle finger and trace over them and it is no longer a visual reminder, but one you can actually feel.  I know this works personally because I've used the same things to really remember the difference between the phonetic system used in Taiwan with their Chinese characters.  I couldn't remember what was what until I used the sandpaper characters.    I'd also suggest not starting with print, but with cursive.  I gave you a link to the print version of the sandpaper letters, but here's a cursive version:    http://www.alisonsmontessori.com/Sandpap...    It is easier for children to learn the cursive because it's a more natural flow to the way they draw, there is less confusion over whether a letter is supposed to go a certain way (b and p are very different) and each letter starts at the same point and makes the same first initial move, so it's easier.      Don't worry about upper case yet.  Most of what we write is lower case.  Focus on one thing at a time rather than trying to get him to learn everything at once.      With the letter order getting mixed up, that's another common thing for 4 year olds.  What you might want to do is when he is writing, put an "x" or a sticker on the top left corner and tell him that's where he wants to start.  When you said he writes, "nosyBr," I'm curious whether he's writing the letters in order (First he writes the B then the r then the y, but they're in the wrong spots) or whether he's writing the n first, then o, then s....  It would be more common the first way, but try to watch for that.    My final advice is to work on activities not directly related to letters, but will help.  These are activities that help the child build up his or her attention to detail and observational skills.  We have many different things for this throughout our classroom.  Some simple things that most houses have are puzzles, blocks, cleaning supplies, and kitchen activities.  When the child is engrossed in these things, they begin to pay attention to the details and begin to build their observational skills.  This helps them when it's time to tell the difference between a "b," "d," or "p."    Don't worry...as a preschool/kindergarten teacher, we get this question a LOT from parents.  It's usually just something that takes a little time.  The brain is not fully developed necessarily to be able to identify these differences.  That doesn't mean there's nothing you can do yet...it just means there's no way to really tell at this age whether there is a problem with dyslexia or whether it's just something that will take more time so there's no real test at this early age.  Hopefully, the techniques I suggest will help.|`|7uedTD6Iaa	Do not be so worried right now.  This is so common for children your son's age.  Children frequently reverse letters and number through 1st grade and sometimes even through 2nd.  It is age appropriate.  You should be concerned if you don't see any improvement by the end of kindergarten.  All reversals should be gone by the middle of 2nd grade grade.  The most common ones I see lasting the longest are the reversal of 5, 3, b, d, and q.      Dyslexia is a reading disability.  It has to do with the way you perceive information, not produce it.  Dysgraphia is a writing disorder, but PreK is way too early to diagnose anyone.  It has way more to do than just letter and number reversals.  It has to do with the way you form sentences and organize thoughts.  That cannot be tested until your child is developmentally and academically able to produce more in-depth writing|`|MT1498npaa	Don't feel to discouraged. I've had friends when I was younger who wrote their fives backwards and couldn't write correctly for several years, but she finally fixed it. I think you and your son should sit down and practice a bit everyday; it could help him in the future. And if that doesn't work out too well, try and get some professional help for him. Don't be too worried, though. Good luck! :-)|`|PnlgLBcwaa	In the US-your public school can screen for a learnign diability-although tehy don't specifically test for dyslexia-they may seem a disability indicative of dyslexia--there are some educational pyschologist that do specifically test for dyslexia    BUT_kids his age are supposed to write backwards-consistantely--soem kids can learn to write----but developmentally-it is perfectly approrpriate for kids to write backwards at this age..    dyslexia used to be commonly noticed in 2nd grade--but kids are being taught reaiding and writing much earlier now--and some just aren't ready..I'd be more concerned if it doiesn't clear up by the end of kindergarten-    still keep an eye on it--and feel free to have him tested-we can't diagnose on Yahoo....|`|ORonhAuvaa	Your child is experiencing a normal developmental problem that usually stops around age 7. If everything else is going fine, then he doesn't need to be tested at this point.    He should know some numbers, letters, colors, shapes and how to write his name, either from a model or on his own. He should understand how to hold a book, which way to turn the pages and know that reading is done from left to right. He should know spatial concepts such as above, below, on top etc. He may begin to recognize familiar words such as cat. He may know some beginning sounds. He may be able to count objects to ten and have one to one correspondence.    Children with learning disabilities usually show across the board learning difficulties, but particularly in pre-reading, pre-math and pre-writing skills. If all he has now is letter reversals, then I would wait.     You also may want to check with his Pre-K teacher. Usually testing referrals come because the teacher has noticed that a child is not keeping up with the other kids in a major way. Testing is not usually done until the child is almost 6, because of developmental issues like you are discussing.     If your family has other close members who have learning disabilities, then keep a close eye on it. You can't really change a child's perception and skills any further than their brain development allows.    Please don't transmit your anxiety about learning to your child as this may in and of itself cause problems.

5gkBaGZoaa	Based on the other answers, it seems that people are always trying to find ways to sue teachers or get them fired, which is virtually impossible, so don't even bother trying.     If he is truly giving you a hard time, the first thing you need to do is speak to him privately after class. Let him know how it makes you feel.     Secondly, just make yourself invisible. This works for any student who has some type of friction with their teacher. What I mean by making yourself invisible is try not to bring attention to yourself. Come into the room with all your supplies, homework completed, etc. Just sit at your desk and do not talk. Don't whisper, don't laugh, don't make wisecracks. Only speak if you have a legitimate question about the assignment, and do this only after raising your hand quietly and waiting to be recognized. If you keep up this behavior, the teacher will stop looking at you or paying attention to you. He will forget you are there and focus on the students that are causing disruptions. This way you can just put your time in then get the heck out of there as soon as possible.|`|816d0234ce66aef35ce88055d2729beeaa	Try asking if you can talk to him.

After that, think of something else for 30 seconds. Then, name everything they did when you weren't looking. Again, try to go to the tiniest detail. Remember, don't use visual clues! Over time, increase the number of things.    Listen to a random conversation. A minute and a half later, write everything they said. Include any accents. Write when they paused or something. Write the exact wording. Over time, listen to longer conversations.    Choose one of your friends, and record every possible detail about them. What brand shirt are they wearing? Do they have any scratches? Try to do it in two minutes. Later that day, show your friend the stuff you wrote down and ask them if you were right.

0cf9ed1304c763f2d55de0d605203e4faa	Though there are no specific written laws as to how teachers share personal information, there is an a general consensus that teachers protect their personal information. Reason is two fold 1) children are likely to be abusive or engage in 'piss taking' and 2) because it can deter the reputation of a teacher in the community/society.    However the fact that this teacher has taken the opposite measures is probably because she wants her pupils to UNDERSTAND, and RELATE to those that challenge the norm in society and not to look down on them. Making them aware at a young age is fine as long as its neutral not biased..     That is art the art of teaching - to teach through understanding so on is able to relate.|`|ceXTs9HYaa	Hi, how are you? Well, after reading your question, I was fairly shocked myself... it sounds almost like an article in a newspaper! I think that you have a perfectly reasonable question, and that would make anyone curious.     I don't think it's nescessarily appropriate for the teacher to announce her sexual preference to the students, especially not first and foremost! But I understand that the world is becoming more and more "accepting" of certain behavior, especially those associated with the truth, it seems. So I guess that from my point of view as a 25 year old, who's been to both private and public schools, I would be very stunned to hear a teacher's intro include sexual preference- even if it was a health class, and the teacher was new and young... that doesn't really justify the weirdness of knowing such personal info at age 12!

(-2y^2-4y+7) + (-2y^2-4y+7)    Then you end up with:  -2y^2 + -2y^2 = -4y^2  -4y + -4y = -8y  +7 + +7 = 14    So you have -4y^2 -8y +14    It's been 20 years since I touched this stuff tho, and that's as far as I can remember how to break it down.

They don't pay for all your schooling either, you're usually only eligible for the GI Bill for 4 years whereas you're eligible for financial aid for 6 years.  Look into some other options before you go this direction, it's a lot more hassle than what it's been worth for me.|`|rUMlDAINaa	This sounds like a frustrating situation - for you and for many other young people.    First of all, if you work through college, as long as you get your pharmacy degree, you will be able to pay off student loans - and yes, you will be paying them off for awhile.  However, there will always be jobs in your field, and they pay better than most.    Community college is a great resource and one that I wish more people utilized. You can knock off a lot of basic studies courses (talk to the guidance counselors at both your CC and Univ so they are aware that you want to MAKE SURE that the courses you take at CC will TRANSFER).  This is an economical way to get through the "goofy" courses that all freshmen and sophomores are required; you could probably go local and live at home, save some money.      As far as financial aid goes - if YOU are paying independently - at least, considered independent of your parents - you can usually qualify for some financial aid - whether federal or through a work-study program.  For example, I worked as a teaching assistant for 3 years. A friend of mine worked for the Housing Dept. on campus; another worked in the library (and she got a lot less money but it wasn't as stressful).      As far as the military goes - to not go into this lightly. Getting through basic isn't as easy as it sounds (of course, I'm more familiar with the Marines than the Army, and the Army's basic is definitely easier than the Marines).  Weigh your choices carefully and DO NOT believe any/everything that the recruiter tells you. They are trained to make quota - getting enough bodies in is how they make their $$. So, sit down and read the contracts. Also, be aware that currently, the amount of benefits, including the GI Bill, that military personnel are given is up for debate in our national govt. With the economy as bad as it is, they may start cutting programs, even veterans' benefits.  Whether the GI Bill will pay for grad school versus undergrad is debatable.     Keep something in mind: you are incredibly young. You have lots of time ahead of you - hear me on this. If you take some time - maybe a couple of years - live at home, save some money, get some life experience - the universities and pharmacy programs will still be there.     Stay strong, man. It sounds like you have some tough choices, but take your time and make good ones.

Further down, flowering trees of cherry  sigh in the breeze over each dropped petal.  This little house and garden, set among the plains,   Lies like a treasured patch of aquamarine and stains  The endless flat brown of the  Kansas prairie.

Near the biggest flower was a tomato plant or two,  accompanied by some pepper plants that certainly had grew.  They sparkled there like diamonds, with the dew fresh on their skins,  I knew I'd have to call my brother and boast 'bout them and the Minnesota Twins.   He lived in Missouri, but rooted for another team,   but the way the Twins had been playing was something of a dream.  As I looked at the plants, here came my old dog Red,  With something in his mouth, trying to bury it in the garden bed.

If so, then students complete an entire course in one semester.     Also, most high schools allow the student's to choose their classes and may require limited science courses to graduate. In which case, some students wait until their senior year and cram in 1-3 science classes to make up for the years they did not take one.    My suggestion, check with your child's school. Science is one of the most important classes for students to take because it prepares them for many fields of careers. If your child can take a science, I would probably get him/her into one.    My source: Myself, a high school science teacher.|`|akjk0KDlaa	oh i see, its like my school. does she have 4 classes in the fall and 4 in the spring?    1 year of science actually means semester.  basically, at my school u need 3 years, or semesters of science total.  so i'm finishing it next year, if i wanted to, i'd be able to finish it this year but i chose not to to make it easier.

PQJyaFDXaa	I know of no such formal program to arrange this.  Minors (persons below 18) are legally considered to be a vulnerable group and there are additional restrictions on the contacts they can have, for their own protection.  Their identities are particularly protected.    About the only way is if you know someone who is in the juvenile system, or if you know someone who knows someone.  But you'd probably have to contact them through their family.

"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."    He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments [...]. (1.1-3)       Thought: The very opening of The Great Gatsby sets the tone for a book about society and class. We know immediately that our narrator is privileged, and that he is painfully conscious of it.    From Shmoop/Quotes and Thoughts/Society and Class/The Great Gatsby

yge5WCkKaa	There are in fact some places,  most likely LTC or nursing homes that will train you for free. Sometimes there is a catch and sometimes not. If you have never done it, working as a CNA, I strongly suggest that you do a shadow program where you follow another CNA around for 8 hrs. If the place you are wanting to work is offering a sign on bonus, remember there is always a reason for sign on bonuses. Generally it's because they can't get CNA's or keep them. That's generally because they are understaffed and have way too many call ins and have to work short handed. I am an LPN that worked as a CNA before going to nursing school and know first hand the things that you will go through. It can be a very rewarding career if you choose to make it that and good CNA's are very hard to find and even harder to keep. But remember that the grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence. What ever you go through in one place you'll go through in others. It's only geography. By the way I am a male nurse and worked with lots of female CNA's and their advise for me was to either grow some claws or keep your mouth shut.

Let them know you will be more than happy to flunk them if that's what they want, as long as they realize those who want to learn are going to get priority treatment in the class.    There should always be a place to send troublesome students.  Use it for those that need it, and don't give them the opportunity to establish dominance in the classroom.      That's your kingdom, not theirs!  Make that understood from day one.

M=slope and B= y-intercept.  anything on the same side of the equal sign you can change the order as long as it is on the same side.  For example: 7x+5y= -3                      -7x      -7x   Whatever you do to one side you do to the other.  so then you have 5y=7x-3  (Then divide by 5 on both sides so that you can leave y by itself)  So now you have y=7/5x - 3/5  which is in the correct form.

k24zcshxaa	You only need to take it if the school to which you are applying requires it. Most community colleges have open enrollment, so you probably don't need to take it at all.     You might want to take ACT or SAT though next chance you get in case you decide to go to a regular university after community college. It will be easier the earlier you take since the material you learned in high school will be fresher on your mind than if you wait until after you are done with your Associate degree.|`|SDSmotQiaa	You don't have to, but most schools require the ACT OR the SAT. but not all schools.

vYNOotEMaa	Often they are sheltered by other friends, or even adults.    Those who shelter them, however, could be an assessory to kidnapping, or child endangerment, as parents could bring charges against them for their "act of kindness".    Many ran-a-ways don't really think about shelter, because where they are staying is more dangerous, or risky.  Safer to just leave.  There are some community shelters also, churches, and other such places that run-a-ways often know about.    If they have a car, many just live in their car for months.  They clean up at fast food rest-rooms.  It's often better to seek help from a social agency, or school counselor, IMO, than  to hit the road without adequate resources.

5yuplp8iaa	your parents work on the books? to my knowledge you dont pay taxes unless you work on the books, and you usually cant work on the books unless you have a SSN, in which case you are legal.    i would speak to a counselor at your high school, see what your options are.    also, this website had a ton of help: http://www.finaid.org/otheraid/undocumen...  the very end says "If the parents do not have a social security number or the social security number fails the match, they should use 000-00-0000 as their social security number on the FAFSA form." and it also gives you information on scholarships
3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	"Going off the rails" refers in general to someone's life going in a negative direction, not just to taking drugs.  For example, "Britney Spears went seriously off the rails when she started hanging out with Paris Hilton."    It's similar to how Britney's life was referred to as a "train wreck" before she started getting straightened out - or, to stick with the "railroad" phrasing, getting back on track.    EDIT - in response to your additional details:  **Anything** that would be characteristic of someone's life going bad could be considered an example of going off the rails.  That would include stuff like drugs, cutting (Is that what you mean by self-harm?), driving drunk, excessive gambling, and so on.|`|yWoBYJVEaa	It's a reference to a train wreck.      When a train is de-railed (you may hear this phrase, also), it no longer has any guidance or direction.  You don't know where it will go.

AA10153220	The great thing about Twitter is that it allows for instantaneous communication about subjects, and it can be sent or viewed from anywhere.    Maybe you and your friends just need more interesting things to say or read about.
AA10988215	I'm in Scotland too so I understand your question better than the above answerers! :-)    In Scotland an undergraduate degree is either an MA or a BSc, whereas in England it is either a BA or a BSc.  An MA/BA is an arts degree and a BSc is a science degree.  I'm not sure why Scotland uses MA as usually Masters are postgraduate courses.    When I did my Psychology degree, the actual psychology content was the same regardless of whether it was an MA or a BSc.  MA/BSc was simply determined by whether you chose to study arts (e.g. philosophy, languages etc) or science (e.g. statistics, biology) as extra subjects in first and second year alongside the mandatory psychology courses.    I think you should find that studying for an MA or BSc won't affect the psychology that you learn, but should only affect accompanying courses.  This is especially so if you wish to study for joint honours.    Hope this helps!|`|5c47af8bffbd3c35498c08737caa396faa	One is a degree which you do after taking a'levels.  the MA is the course you do after the degree!|`|3a9f3003abdd986d136bc7307c02868faa	A BSc is a batchelors degree course whereas the MA is a masters degree which you can only do once you've completed the BSc.    Edit: If you are unsure what the difference is in regards to course content and overall qualification then email the University that you want to go to, they will be happy to help.    Edit: Giorgie, I'm in Scotland too, and most Scottish universities are changing to the standard batcherlor's and master's degree abbreviations. This is causing major problems within most universities, and is causing confusion for students and staff alike.

For example, rather than merely saying that a person is rather attractive (or even very attractive), one might say that he is "not unattractive."    By its nature, litotes is a form of understatement, always deliberate and with the intention of subtle emphasis. However, the interpretation of litotes can depend on context, including cultural context. In speech, it may also depend on intonation and emphasis; for example, the phrase "not bad" can be said in such a way as to mean anything from "mediocre" to "excellent".    The use of litotes appeals specifically to certain cultures including the northern Europeans and is popular with the British. It is a feature of Old English poetry and of the Icelandic sagas and is a means of much stoical restraint.    The use of litotes has been criticized by some authors, such as George Orwell in his essay Politics and the English Language.    EXAMPLES  Litotes: As a means of saying:   1."[] no ordinary city." Acts 21:39 (NIV)             "[] a very impressive city."   2."That [sword] was not useless / to the warrior now." (Beowulf)             "The sword was useful."   3."That does not surprise me."            "That is to be expected."   4."He was not unfamiliar with the works of Dickens."         "He was well acquainted with the works of Dickens."   5."The food was not bad."           "The food was acceptable/good (depending in emphasis)."   6."That was no big deal."           "That was nothing."   7."She is not so unkind."            "She is kind."   8."She was not a little cross."            "She was very cross."   9."I am not unwell."           "I am fine."   10."You're not wrong." (Australian English)              "You're right."   11."I couldn't disagree less." (double litotes)             "I agree."

rupIlSpDaa	There were two parody ads on the SuperBowl last night:    Pepsi did one that was a take on the old TV series "McIver".  They renamed the main character McGruber and to reinforce product tie-ins during the commercial he said he had changed his name to "Pepsuber".    A second parody ad was the Coke One ad featuring Troy Polomalu.  It was a take-off of another Coke ad featuring Mean Joe Greene.  At the end of the original, Mean Joe gives the kid his jersey.  In the version last night, Troy rips the shirt off of the Coke executive and gives it to the kid.

This is fairly central to most legal systems and you will have a greater understanding of this than someone who has taken art. A potential employer will also consider you more qualified than an art student (unfortunately) because philosophy is considered a more challenging subject menatally and you need a good brain to become a lawyer.    Art is one of those things though that never stops - you can always pick up a pen and draw something so at the end of the day you can probably achieve more of both by studying philosophy.     I agree about the teacher issue as well though - have a word with both teachers and see if they both make you feel excited about the subject.    Good luck!
AA11112154	Entry level position as a research assistant (RA) in zoology or biology at a hospital for example. But you need a college degree so that's why it would be a "Entry Level" position.    Unpaid internship doing the same thing under the supervision of someone or working at a zoo or animal clinic could be your volunteering opportunity.     I say unpaid because if you get paid, it does not qualify as "volunteering".

Monera are usually very tiny, although one type, namely the blue-green bacteria, look like algae. They are filamentous and quite long, green, but have no visible structure inside the cells. No visible feeding mechanism. They absorb nutrients through the cell wall or produce their own by photosynthesis.    Protista  Protists are single-celled and usually move by cilia, flagella, or by amoeboid mechanisms. There is usually no cell wall, although some forms may have a cell wall. They have organelles including a nucleus and may have chloroplasts, so some will be green and others won't be. They are small, although many are big enough to be recognized in a dissecting microscope or even with a magnifying glass. Nutrients are acquired by photosynthesis, ingestion of other organisms, or both.    Fungi  Fungi are multicellular,with a cell wall, organelles including a nucleus, but no chloroplasts. They have no mechanisms for locomotion. Fungi range in size from microscopic to very large ( such as mushrooms). Nutrients are acquired by absorption. For the most part, fungi acquire nutrients from decaying material.    Plantae  Plants are multicellular and most don't move, although gametes of some plants move using cilia or flagella. Organelles including nucleus, chloroplasts are present, and cell walls are present. Nutrients are acquired by photosynthesis (they all require sunlight).    Animalia  Animals are multicellular, and move with the aid of cilia, flagella, or muscular organs based on contractile proteins. They have organelles including a nucleus, but no chloroplasts or cell walls. Animals acquire nutrients by ingestion.     HOPE THIS HELPS GOOD LUCK :)
t2LOcPkLaa	it sounds like this is a DBQ so it will be hard for people to help you w/o the documents. what you need to do is read them and see which way most of the documents are going. even if that's not what you would agree with, that's the most successful way to answer the question. use the documents that don't support your position as a contrast and say why they aren't good reasons. pay attention to the time period and who each document is from. i am guessing this is either a civil war or a wwii/internment camp question.|`|0hSpsSByaa	I'd argue for.  I'd start out with the enumerated powers of the federal government and argue that unless the power is listed, the federal government doesn't have it, referring to the fact that it specifically says all other powers are reserved to the state.  I'd then argue that the Bill of Rights and other rights guaranteed by the amendments were subsequent to the original Constitution, they were enacted to specifically protect individuals from over encroachment by the government and are therefore superior to the rights of the government.  I'd reference the tyranny that the founding fathers were trying to escape when they led the revolution against Great Britain as evidence they intended individual liberties to come first.

Not retaking the course, I seriously see no legitimate reason to have an F removed unless the circumstance is extreme , such as one who has died and could not complete the course.  Else, a transcript wouldn't be a legitimate evaluation method if student's were allowed to have their bad grades erased on a whim.

What is the purpose, audience, argument, etc.    Your descriptions are good, you just need to organize your content better, revise, and edit.    You have a lot of capitalization errors. Don't capitalize "everyone" and make sure you capitalize band names, song titles, and album titles.    Break up your essay in paragraphs! One huge paragraph makes my eyes bleed.    If you were in my class, I wouldn't penalize you for using "sick" as an adjective, but you may not want to include this in your paper. It's slang.    Also, you may want to define "dub maggots" because unless you are talking to a bunch of Slipknot fans or people who know who that is, chances are your audience (i.e. teacher) won't.    Again, I don't know the assignment so I can't help you much with your purpose, which goes hand-in-hand with your conclusion. But you're right, you need more of an ending. Maybe an attention-getter or your detailed opinion of the concert. How did it make you feel? What did you do afterwards? Etc.    Good luck!
eGpOIV12aa	1) Drer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, have secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatise which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.    2) Renaissance thinkers sought out learning from ancient texts, typically written in Latin or ancient Greek. Scholars scoured Europe's monastic libraries, searching for works of classical antiquity which had fallen into obscurity. In such texts they found a desire to improve and perfect their worldly knowledge; an entirely different sentiment to the transcendental spirituality stressed by medieval Christianity.They did not reject Christianity; quite the contrary, many of the Renaissance's greatest works were devoted to it, and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art. However, a subtle shift took place in the way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life.    3) the impact of Gutenberg's printing press in Europe was comparable to the development of writing, the invention of the alphabet or the Internet, as far as its effects on society. Just as writing did not replace speaking, printing did not achieve a position of total dominance. Handwritten manuscripts continued to be produced, and the different graphic modes of communication continued to influence each other.

EkeDhJw7aa	First of all, don't take IB unless you are COMMITTED to it. IB is very very challenging and it takes around 3-4+ hours a night with studying and homework. There is no specified amount of classes that you have to take to get in IB. To get a full IB diploma you have to complete all sections of the IB Program. Or, if you want to take only 1 or 2 IB classes, you can take those classes and not get a IB Diploma but individual IB certificates. Once you enter IB, you will have the chance to take AP courses. These courses will give you hours on your college resume and if you earn enough hours, you can take up to 2 years off of your regular 4 year college. Doing and completing the IB program with either the certificates or the full Diploma with increase your chances of getting into the college you want %60+. Remember, only do the IB program if you are fully committed.

It is a more mild form of autism and while there may be some social awkwardness, most adults with Aspergers have an interest in something and are able to make a career out of it.    Other degrees of autism vary.  A person with severe autism may require special treatment for the rest of their lives and will not be able to work.  Other people will join the workforce and even have skills that a person without autism won't have.  Imagine a secretary that can type a million words a minute and has every zip code memorized... (That's a specific example from a video I saw recently).    There are groups that help autistic people find jobs and maintain them.  They usually provide meetings with the boss and employees to help with any coping skills the employee may have with the job.

I only cover 10 years on mine.|`|4e7c15c0412290b475dc6c53a1810cd2aa	i would go by relevance to the job your trying to get. you dont ever really have to.  i would go with what ever has most significance.
e2926326f61b2becbde04426fcb444c8aa	Where do you live?  What age students do you want to teach?  What subjects do you have a passion for?  There are many good places to study in order to be a teacher.  The ones close to you home would no doubt be very good if you want to teach k-12.|`|5gkBaGZoaa	What state do you live in?
CtwEFHcqaa	I assume you mean Tues. 2/3/09? It depends where you live in Southern California they are.|`|qitqxOspaa	Tomorrow is not 1/3/09, it is 2/3/09 and for my school district, there is. I don't know about exceptions your district has.
lQIKWXDuaa	Call them and find out . I really dont see the problem in this, if your parents are paying their taxes while you are oversea.    ss
14c2d9089f926798d424d45b85996660aa	www.fbijobs.gov    Try the FBI. plenty jobs there that require the degree you have, especially the "special agent" position.|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	You will be "college educated" and qualify for positions that require a "general 4 year degree".  That's it.   You have zero specialized expertise gained with those degrees; no employer is going to knock on the door for you.
oLI2SJ08aa	First, the word is allowed, not aloud.    Second, athletes need to have a certain GPA to be able to compete. That's why they have a study hall. I doubt your school won't let anyone else ever take study hall during school. Ask your guidance counselor.    By the way, taking study hall because you don't want to take Spanish is silly, don't use that argument.
CAdFHF9zaa	how fast can you make a bannana rot
LKUjbuCuaa	it would help to know about the child's age/grade and where he may be having a problem.

Si5vpwStaa	Point-slope formula: y-y1 = m(x-x1)    y-3 = 4(x-1)       ______________________________________...    Slope-intercept formula: y = mx + b    3 = 4(1) + b      ..just like before, substitute the x's and y's, and                           simplify it.  3 = 4 + b            -4 = -4 + b  -1 = b  y = 4x - 1          |`|RYVKYYnAaa	slope intercept form is y=mx+b    so you plug in what they gave you:    3=4(1)+b    you solve for b, which here you get b=-1    then you just plug in what you have into slope intercept form again:  y=4x-1    and there's your answer.|`|YTwnVAtdaa	for point slope the equation is: Y-Y1=m(X-X1)    so you plug everything in.    Y-3=4(x-1)      Y-3= 4x-4    Y=4x-1    (im pretty sure thats how you do it)
P3bocyujaa	nope, and what do you mean my "advanced math" do you mean that your in trigonometry aka "am" in middle school? or do you mean that your just in an "advanced" math class like geometry for your grade?|`|hHQIUrNjaa	then slap a ***** and raise your grade|`|6S7CgcQoaa	yah it will but you are able to take the teat
RpQfIQXmaa	no, "we" is the same as I or YoU.
tCsFxh5Aaa	What do you have in mind?    I did a class with preschoolers on the body a few years ago.  Here's what we did for the portion that was on lungs.    After explaining what lungs are, where they are and what they do, we did a few different things.    I made a model of a lung using a cut-up soda bottle--cut the bottom off, a balloon that I put around the opening--where the cap would be if I had left it on, and used a large rubber band to put a piece of cut-up plastic bag on the cut bottom of the bottle.  I believe I put some tape on the plastic bag to make a tab to hold.  I explained to them that the plastic bag is like the diaphragm (a muscle inside the chest) and the balloon is like one lung.  Move the plastic bag to see what happens to the balloon--and explain that when the diaphragm moves inside a person the lungs fill and empty, too.    I taught the kids a simple song I made up.  To the tune of "Here we go loopdy-loo".  I explained that our lungs need oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide afterwards.      The Breathing Song:    We breathe oxygen in (we'd all take a deep breath here)  and carbon dioxide out (we'd blow out air here)  We breath oxygen in (we'd take another deep breath)  So we can run and shout (we end with running in place and a shout).    I made pictures of a human body with lungs in them for the kids to color.    We also traced one of the kids onto large construction paper and drew lungs where they would be to "see" where their lungs are.    We tried doing some exercises to see how exercising makes you breath faster.      And we got a stethoscope and used it to listen to each other's lungs.    And we talked about how lungs can get damaged and not work so well from smoking or breathing in too much pollution and such.
VEhj9pleaa	First you +2 to 12 and you get 14 so now the equation is lx+5l=14 and the other equation because the equation has absolute value in it you do lx+5l=-14    to solve x+5=14 you subtract 5 to 14 and get x=9  to solve the next one lx+5l=-14 you subtract 5 from 14 and get x=-19  answers are x=9 and x=-19|`|IsOp79iPaa	x=5 and x=15|`|AA10439008	Add 2 to both sides  |x + 5| = 14    write two equations: x + 5 = 14 or x + 5 = -14 (since both would work)  add -5 to both sides of each  x = 9 or x = -19|`|l7wBoNMvaa	x is 9 or x is -19|`|KvguovfWaa	x=5|`|jnxQDOuraa	x + 5 = 14  x = 9    x+5 = -14  x = -19
2zvlsnlvaa	Hi! I am the Head Editor of Elite Editing & Tutoring, and we provide an online editing service.    How much you charge really depends on the quality of editing you provide and how detailed you are. It also depends on if you plan to provide detailed advice to students on improving their work in the future, or if you just wish to do a simple edit.    My advice is to charge according to the word count, not by page. There is too much difference in word counts on pages due to changes in margins and font etc.    Check out our website (as well as others) to see what we charge. Our service provides for a comprehensive (full) edit, as well as individual advice for students.    www.eliteediting.com.au
