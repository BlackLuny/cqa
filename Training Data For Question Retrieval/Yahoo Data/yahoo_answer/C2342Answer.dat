If he wanted to eat, he had to procure his own food from nature.  This was his excuse for spending the time he did away from civilization.  He was from a fairly wealthy family, although he had no contact with any of them.  Things usually came very easily to him, so now he thinks he is going to impress his friends by learning how to do things with his hands - by doing everything the hard way.  The quote suggests that he is trying to get down to the meaning of life by living close to nature.  He was only there for a few months.  And he was gay.

Private school kids do earn some of the stereotypes they're given (we have many, many wealthy kids), but my school also has a high percentage of students here on tuition breaks. So private school kids are not always what you think.|`|3fccf1045188ac87e477d3dcb20a72bdaa	Who you are isn't and shouldn't be dependent on where you go to school.  I'm sure you can find snobby kids in public schools and nice open kids in private schools.  Just be yourself and don't worry about what other people think.  If you're a genuine person you can overcome any such prejudices.

I'm not even sure what type of "session" you are speaking of.  <br>  <br>  So, think about what defines a summer session and a winter session respectively.  Then try to find personality traits in the characters that match them.  Is one always bright and positive and warm?  Is one free to do as he pleases?   WOuld this be a summer session?  Is the other darker more often, one colder, one short on happiness?

koAaPXKQaa	ABCDE are the essentials and basic principals in first aid. D stands for Disability (or level of consciousness).  E stands for expose (check the patient for injuries) and environment (taking the environment into consideration.) I assume you've already been shown how to check ABC? ABC obviously come first though before D and E, as there is no point checking for injuries etc. if the person needs CPR because they aren't breathing.<br>  <br>  Environment would be a good thing to talk about though as obviously the altitude and change in pressure may effect the patient's circulation, heart rate and will increase the chances of hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels in the patient) and DVT. Hypoxia is often noted by Cyanosis (blue tinge to lips and nailbeds). In this case, Oxygen therapy is essential. Ensuring the patient is sitting upright will also help increase oxygen levels and heart rate if the patient's original complaint was of breathlessness or chest pain.<br>  <br>  If ABC are ok and the patient is NOT hypoxic, insist on the use of the recovery position to ensure patient safety.<br>  <br>  You might want to mention patient dignity also, as aircrafts are a difficult environment to maintain this in, is it more essential because everyone is so close together. The last thing the patient wants is to wake up to find everyone looking at them.<br>  <br>  The main thing to remember though is that ABCDE are the basic prinicipals for ALL first aid situations.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)

There is situational irony, which is basically what I described above. There is dramatic irony, which occurs primarily in plays; it is when the audience knows something the characters on stage do not. Then there is verbal irony, which is similar to sarcasm (meaning, you say the exact opposite of what you mean).

Am 2. Februar jedes Jahres, dem "Candlemas Day" (Lichtmess), wird traditionell eine Vorhersage über das Fortdauern des Winters getroffen. Dazu werden ?ffentlich und teilweise im Rahmen von Volksfesten Waldmurmeltiere (Marmota monax, engl. groundhog) zum ersten Mal im Jahr aus ihrem Bau gelockt. Wenn das Tier "seinen Schatten sieht", d. h. wenn klares, helles Wetter herrscht, soll der Winter noch weitere sechs Wochen dauern.<br>  <br>  Geschichte  [Bearbeiten]<br>   Von den Kelten ausgehend  [Bearbeiten]Im fünften Jahrhundert, glaubten die Kelten, dass Tiere gewisse übernatürliche Kr?fte an gewissen Tagen besa?en, die zwischen Wintersonnenwende und Frühlingstagundnachtgleiche. Das sind genau vierzig Tage nach Weihnachten und vierzig Tage vor Ostern. Volkssagen von Deutschland und Frankreich besagten, dass wenn Murmeltiere und B?ren ihre H?hlen, in denen sie ihren Winterschlaf abhielten, zu früh verlie?en, sie sich vor ihrem eigenen Schatten erschrecken würden und zurück in ihren Unterschlupf flüchten würden, wo sie die n?chsten sechs Wochen verharren würden.<br>  <br>  <br>   Von Pennsylvania ausgehend  [Bearbeiten]Es wird auch behauptet, dass der Groundhog Day ursprünglich in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania am 2. Februar 1887 ins Leben gerufen wird. Jedoch kann man den ersten amerikanischen Verweis zum Groundhog Day im Pennsylvania Dutch Folklore Center at Franklin and Marshall College finden: So schrieb am 4. Februar 1841 James Morris, ein Ladenbesitzer in Berks Country (Pennsylvania) in sein Tagebuch: "Last Tuesday, the 2nd, was Candlemas day, the day on which, the Groundhog peeps out of his winter quarters and if he sees his shadow he pops back for another six weeks nap, but if the day be cloudy he remains out, as the weather is to be moderate." (?Letzten Dienstag, den 2. Februar, war Lichtmess, der Tag, wo das Waldmurmeltier verstohlen aus seinem Winterquartier hervorlugt. Wenn es seinen Schatten sieht, verschwindet es in seiner H?hle wieder für die n?chsten sechs Wochen um zu schlafen. Doch ist der Tag bew?lkt, bleibt es drau?en, so das Wetter gem??igt ist.“)<br>  <br>  International bekannt geworden sind Punxsutawney und der Murmeltiertag 1993 durch den Kinofilm ?Und t?glich grü?t das Murmeltier“ (Originaltitel: ?Groundhog Day“) mit Bill Murray und Andie MacDowell in den Hauptrollen.<br>  <br>  <br>   Von Schottland ausgehend  [Bearbeiten]Es kann auch von einem schottischen Gedicht hergeleitet werden: "As the light grows longer, The cold grows stronger, If Candlemas be fair and bright, Winter will have another flight, If Candlemas be cloud and rain, Winter will be gone and not come again, A farmer should on Candlemas day, Have half his corn and half his hay, On Candlemas day if thorns hang a drop, You can be sure of a good pea crop." (Wenn das Licht st?rker w?chst, W?chst die K?lte st?rker, Wenn das Wetter sch?n und hell ist, Wird der Winter weitergehen, Wenn das Wetter bew?lkt und regnerisch ist, Der Winter wird ziehen und nicht wieder kommen, Ein Bauer sollte an Lichtmess, Halb seines Kornes und halb seines Heues haben, An Lichtmess wenn an Dornen Tropfen festhalten, Kann man sicher mit guter Ernte rechnen)<br>  <br>  <br>   Berühmte Waldmurmeltiere  [Bearbeiten]Das bekannteste Tier mit "hellseherischen F?higkeiten" ist das Waldmurmeltier Punxsutawney Phil aus dem Ort Punxsutawney in Pennsylvania. Die dortigen Feiern sind auch die ?ltesten und finden seit 1887 statt. Durch den Film Und t?glich grü?t das Murmeltier (Originaltitel: Groundhog Day) wurde Phil auch international berühmt. Insgesamt gibt es etwa zwei Dutzend Murmeltiere, die j?hrlich befragt werden, z. B. Balzac Billy (Balzac, Alberta/Kanada), General Beauregard Lee (Stone Mountain, Georgia), Jimmy the Groundhog (Sun Prairie, Wisconsin), Shubenacadie Sam (Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia/Kanada), Staten Island Chuck (New York City) und Wiarton Willie (Wiarton, Ontario/Kanada).<br>  <br>  <br>   Letzte Vorhersagen  [Bearbeiten]<br>   2006  [Bearbeiten]6 weitere Wochen Winter: Dunkirk Dave, Punxsutawney Phil, Buckeye Chuck <br>  Früher Frühling: Spanish Joe, Wiarton Willie, General Beauregard Lee, Staten Island Chuck, Shubenacadie Sam, Jimmy the Groundhog, Malverne Mel, French Creek Freddie <br>  <br>   2005  [Bearbeiten]6 weitere Wochen Winter: Punxsutawney Phil, Shubenacadie Sam, Spanish Joe, Octorara Orphie, Malverne Mel <br>  Früher Frühling: Wiarton Willie, Jimmy the Groundhog, General Beauregard Lee, Balzac Billy, Staten Island Chuck <br>  <br>   2004  [Bearbeiten]6 weitere Wochen Winter: Punxsutawney Phil, Wiarton Willie, Spanish Joe, Balzac Billy, General Beauregard Lee, Malverne Mel <br>  <br>   Weblinks  [Bearbeiten]http://www.groundhog.org/faq...

Wie sollst Du denn die Berufsschule schaffen wenn Du in den Friseurf?chern, die ich beschrieben habe, schon jetzt versagst.<br>  <br>  Einige meinen, dass das Zeugnis egal sei: Das ist es aber nur dann, wenn Du durch Deine Pers?nlichkeit einen guten Eindruck gemacht hast.

In your case, I would say:<br>  "The plan to control the speed of vehicles in the plant should be put in place (or instituted, or implemented)." Use this if there is already a plan made that is not being used. If there is not a plan already made, then you should say "A plan..." instead of "The plan..."|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	A plan should be put be in place to limit the speed  of vehicles in the plant|`|CCkeHYw7aa	That sounds okay,<br>  but there are other alternatives.<br>  <br>  The speed limits of vehicles in the plant need to be controlled, which is why this plan is being put in place.<br>  <br>  This plan should be in place in order to have a greater control over the speed limits of vehicles in the plant.<br>  <br>  Just suggestions!|`|4PcxcCVPaa	OK, I get your meaning, but a clearer way of stating it might be:  "The plan for controlling speed limits in the plant should be instituted."

Lk4aCBACaa	I'm beginning to wonder if any degree is really worth it! I only got an Associate's Degree because a) I couldn't get enough student loans/federal aid for a 4-year school and b) I took AP classes in high school. At the time, the only difference between an Associate's and a Bachelor's was all the "General Education" stuff I had already done. And even though I could have tested out of those classes and saved myself some money, it still wasn't enough of a savings to help me finance a Bachelor's degree.<br>  <br>  When I first started working it wasn't a big deal. Now every other ad for a job opening wants a Bachelor's degree. For what?! I already pay $200 a month in student loans. What good reason is there to bankrupt myself to go get a BA to take English, Math and Science over again? Why do employers look down on people with Associate's degrees? <br>  <br>  At any rate, I've already proved myself in the professional arena. At my last job I was promoted to supervisor within 3 months. I'm excellent at what I do, and I'm just as smart as anyone with a BA. Just because I was too poor to afford a BA doesn't mean I'm somehow worth less, and I'd say the same to any BA who's worried about not having a Master's degree. It's just a shame that some employers set certain degrees as minimum requirements. Maybe in some fields the course work justifies it, but it wasn't the case in mine.|`|b45b0164a7bf8a3902360b10b78ac4b2aa	I suppose in the long run it might be worthwhile.  Speaking from the point of view of a person with NO advanced education.  I came from a very poor family so college was out of the question for all 3 children,  When I left my last job I was making $36,000 a year (Operations Support Manager at an advertising firm in Dallas, TX), that was in 1994 (when I became disabled).  The only "degree" that I may qualify for would be Master Gardener, as working with the earth and plants has always been a passion.  My brother, who dropped out in the 10th grade (he can't read effectively) owns his own business in Florida.  My sister would be an accomplished writer if she set her mind to it.  I am an artist and sell my work.  If I had gone to college I would probably have majored in Botany or gone to Veterinarian school.  <br>  BB<br>  )O(

Ct91F1Tlaa	In England the first castle to be built in the middle ages were the pre- built Norman Castles, which were built in Timber and transported to England with the Norman invasion fleet. The First castle constructed was at Pevensey Bay in 1066. This was known as a Timber Motte and Bailey castle. These were rapidly replaced by permanent stone Norman castles.

DB0LYUGTaa	Nicky Cruz (b. December 6, 1938 in San Juan, Puerto Rico) is the former leader of a New York City gang, The Mau-Maus. He later became a world-renowned religious minister.<br>  <br>  Nicky Cruz was born to a Theistic Satanist family in Puerto Rico, into a home where his parents brutally abused him, both physically and mentally, his mother saying that she did not want him and his father locking him in a room full of pigeons. They soon sent him to New York, to live with his brother Frank, but Nicky decided to go solo and ventured onto the streets alone. He was beaten-up by a gang leader, and then left unconscious, trying to heal for ten days. After it was over, he improved his fighting tactics, and sought out after the gang leader, to teach him a lesson. He found the man, and beat him so badly that he was unconscious and bloodied. Soon he was the talk of the neighborhood, and made friends with a gang called the Mau Maus; named after an African tribe. He agreed to joining the gang, and underwent their initiation ceremony; which left him unable to move for ten days. It was about six months later that Cruz was elected the leader of the gang, and under his rule, they were known as one of the most feared gangs of New York.<br>  <br>  Soon a preacher by the name of David Wilkerson was preaching in Cruz's neighborhood when Cruz encountered him. The preacher told Cruz that God loved him and would never stop loving him; the conversation ended when Cruz threatened to kill him. That afternoon the preacher showed up at the Mau Mau's headquarters to repeat his message, and was slapped by Cruz. David Wilkerson just smiled, and then prayed for Nicky.<br>  <br>  Two weeks later the preacher had an evangelistic meeting in the neighborhood. When Cruz heard about it, he decided to go and teach the preacher a "lesson" and, with some of the members of his gang, he headed for the church where the rally was being held. According to Cruz, when he arrived at the arena, he felt guilty about the things that he had done and started to pray. The preacher prayed with Cruz and Cruz asked God to forgive him.<br>  <br>  The following day Cruz and some of the gang members who converted went to the police and turned in all of their bricks,hand guns and knives. Cruz began to study the Bible and returned to school. He became a preacher and returned to his old neighborhood, where he preached and persuaded some of the Mau-Maus to accept Jesus, including the gang's new leader, Israel Narvaez, who was also converted.<br>  <br>  Nicky Cruz has released two autobiographies. The first one is called 'Run Baby Run', and the second is called 'Soul Obsession'.<br>  <br>  Cruz is the founder of Nicky Cruz Outreach, which is a program that helps teenagers with troubled lives. The program has branches in the United States, Latin America, and Europe. Nicky Cruz is also the founder of halfway houses which help in the rehabilitation of drug addicts.

9x8tOaIyaa	One definition is THOUGHT, THINKING, MUSING, PONDERING, STUDY, SPECULATE, and CONTEMPLATE. <br>  John was in deep reflection after watching the movie the teacher assigned.<br>  Another definition is MIRROR IMAGE<br>  When walking in the mall, she looks at her reflection every time she goes by a window.|`|RkNYgG9faa	A reflection is when you see an image of yourself in a mirror or water. You can use it to see how you look.|`|h8ra3Nbcaa	when i look in the mirror i see my reflection, like when something bounces off another that looks the same thing like a mirror|`|Wj9DUSkTaa	it is when a shape or figure is flipped over the x or y axis making the same picture but across the other axis with different coordinates.|`|paWHOKI1aa	Its a mirror image of something and what do you think it is used for. Mirroring stuff! Duh
JvpSWk1Raa	i like it, it's unique|`|zoD71BuKaa	Did you change the spelling of it yourself? I think the name Andy is cute for a girl, or Andie... But Andii (with the 2 i's) I think might be a little bit too out there... At age 11 it may be fine, but when you get older, you might not like it... Last year at college, I had a friend whose name was JESSICA, but she changed the spelling of it to 'JESSKA' and I just couldn't take her seriously... The name JESSKA looks like it should be a ***** Cat Doll or something... I would suggest changing the spelling to something a little more plausible... I like Andie with an IE best for a girl... Plus, wasn't that the girl's name in How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days? Kate Hudson was definitely great in that movie, and she made it ok for Andie to be a girl's name! :) It's cute, best of luck. :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: But how come underneath your Yahoo! Avatar it says Ashley? Haha. :-P|`|Ahk5jr5Xaa	I think your name is great.<br>  <br>  Webster's says that this name is for a boy OR A girl.

Dont let anyone tell you otherwise.|`|ByxEE8eeaa	I think it's a cute name. When I was in kindergarten, my grade 6 helper was named Andi, and I thought she was awesome.

I had a friend in High School that we called Andy, her name was Andrea, and we called her Andy.|`|KZkUH7wQaa	I don't think it's a bad name at all. I've always liked the name andy for a girl.

Then all of a sudden school goes Reeeeaaaalllllyy sllllooooww...But then your happy its over and it goes fast, which is probably why adult think time flys too fast (which in their case it does).

Skim through text write down a few key factors .Pay attention to bold words graphs , chapter tittles, headings n so forth.  Feed text to subconscious by making the eyes blur. The neural pathways to the subconscious are those that see everything in our Peripheral view or things that are blurred. Study in layers. Go over text few times each time reading things that pertain to what you are studding . Take 15- 20 min  breaks after,  ask your self questions about text . Go over again and again each time taking little chunks from here and there . Follow intuition as to what you will need to read. Flashcard for vocab.

O4oCqaKkaa	Here's a start. See what you think.<br>  <br>  I sit on my mountain top; my precipice, my one true escape. I created this abstract existence all around me, it is not mine, but I created it. It is not mine to tamper with; it is for everyone, to feel free. No one is truly free anymore; not unless they are here, unbound from the shackles of modern life, media and government control. <br>  <br>  There is a war going on for your mind. Cover girl cut-outs throw up pop-up ads infecting victims with silicone shrapnel. No more shall your minds be poisoned, will your thoughts be mummified, and no more shall you cower in weakness to the irrational thoughts of the government.<br>  <br>  What I am, is what you can be, free. Have you ever wanted to watch the sunset in Hawaii, ride a gondola in Venice or eat a four-course meal in France and dessert in Belgium? My world can change to be whatever you want. Would you like to be famous, have people adore you and do anything for you? Have people fired and rehired again at the nod of your hat? Would you like to live in multiple, million dollar mansions, each with three swimming pools, eight bedrooms and four purple billiards tables? Would you like a simple home life; wife and two kids, a stunning private home situated on Lake View Drive, 1 km from camp? The super structure of the house, twenty five ancient and weathered Red River gum trees - powerful and natural. The entrance side of the house is grand, castle-like and is interestingly faced with stones from the hills. The massive pivot door opens into the huge main room and instantly you see incredible views through the front of the house - which is completely open. Or perhaps relaxing on the beach is more suited to you? Think of the most beautiful beach you've ever dreamt of; the shimmering expanse of endless white that caps the crescendo of waves and cushions the tide coming in. The oceans eternal rhythm, beating on the shore. On your own island, you have the freedom to enjoy life. <br>  <br>  Your world consists of two parallel worlds: technology-driven Earth, where you reside, and my world. The transition between the worlds is only possible in dreams and I am able to control this, I  am in a coma. The reason you are watching me, is that I have chosen you. For long enough, I have lived alone in this "perfect" place. I have chosen you because I can see you are worthy of this life. I have always been able to visit this world, "My Real Home" and in my dreams I could fulfil my hearts greatest desires; it was perfect. Now that I cannot leave, and am on my own, it seems like a nightmare. Everything I want is at my fingertips, but it's hell without anyone to share it with. I do not thirst for water; I do not feel my own hunger, I only ache, for companionship. Now my one true desire is to desire again.<br>  <br>  This is why I am calling out to you. I am willing, pleading you to join me in my empty society, wishing now that I had not jumped, headfirst, into this dreamland. I only hope some one is crazy enough to come to me. How do I know you are even there anymore? Maybe my world is the realest thing in all the verses, meaning I’m alone forever. Will someone please answer my pleas, before I’m killed by my own imagination? There will be no sirens, there will be no screams from witnesses, there will be no tears of mourn at my funeral, for I am alone.|`|bD7Yaatkaa	think hard u can do it

uFRIsdC7aa	Among the main philosophical questions posed by metaphor are these:  What is “metaphorical meaning,” broadly construed?  By what mechanism is such meaning conveyed?  How do hearers grasp the meaning, given that what they hear is only a sentence whose literal meaning is something different? <br>      The Positivists offered a single brutal answer to each of those questions:  There is no such thing as “metaphorical meaning” if by “meaning” one means linguistic or even propositional meaning; there is only emotive or affective significance.  Nor is there any “mechanism” by which metaphorical significance is conveyed, if by “mechanism” one means a cognitive linguistic mechanism.  Nor is there grasp of meaning; there is only the psychological effect that hearing a metaphorical utterance has on one’s feelings and attitudes.  Call this the Emotive theory of metaphor, as in the Emotive theory of ethics. <br>  <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~ujanel/Metaphor.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.unc.edu/~ujanel/Metaphor.htm</a>|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	a comparison  between  two things  without  using  the  words "like" or  "as"<br>  <br>  her  eyes  were beacons  in  the  dark  night<br>  <br>  a simile (pronounced  si-mi-lee) is  a comparison  that  DOES use  like  or  as<br>  <br>  her  eye  were  as  bright  as  beacons<br>  her  eyes  shone  like  beacons|`|8HWBODfcaa	Metaphor from the Greek language: Meaning "transfer" is language that directly compares seemingly unrelated subjects. It is a figure of speech that compares two or more things without using the words "like" or "as."

zoD71BuKaa	I'd say an informal essay could be more like creative writing, where it's okay to use contractions and you're allowed to speak in first person. Sentences are more relaxed and you're allowed more room for creative license, meaning you don't have to follow all of grammar's rules to a tee.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, a formal essay should be written with no contractions and one should leave personalizers such as I, we, our, OUT of these essays. Grammar rules should be followed, and sentences should be as structured as possible.<br>  <br>  (I tried to answer this question describing informal essays in a way that would be acceptable to write in an informal essay, and describing formal essays in a way that would be appropriate to write in a formal essay. Good luck!) :)

kynzqmWgaa	Parental...environmental...peers.  In that order I would think.|`|vVh7ex7daa	In my opinion all of those factos have an effect on everyones behaviour. Children can be very impressionable because they dont know any better and things around them can influence the way they act. I think (although i am not a parent) the best thing you can do is teach your children right from wrong and be patient and loving with them and then hope they make the right decisions. I believe that if a child has a prent they can turn to and talk to openly they are more likely to ask for help. Everyone makes wrong choices int heir life and i think it is a good idea to teach a child that making a few wrong decisions isnt the end of the world because it isnt really. They will always be affects by peers when it comes to drinking, drugs and also smallt hings like what they eat and places they go. I believe that pesonality is also slightly biological as i have some similar character traits to my mother-but then againt his good be because i grew up around her. I have knonw people to be similar however, who did not grow up together. As for diet i believe this is important in a childs development. A balanced diet i feel helps control behaviour and too many E numbers and sugar etc can cause children to behave badly.|`|IkIF8iu4aa	I think you left out one important general factor: temporal.<br>  <br>  Children haven't been in existence very long, and this fact has a far more profound effect on their behavior than the other factors (biological; environmental; cultural; peers; and dietary).|`|5Nb98vHtaa	I would say all of them. For instance I read an article the other day saying at least half of your intelligence is inherited. The intelligence of  a child would certainly affect how it behaved. Also cultural, as different cultures have different beliefs on how a child should behave, for instance a child who grew up in a fast paced environment might be more street-wise etc. Siblings can affect a child's behavior  also. If the child had younger brothers or sisters they might be more of a leader or act slightly more mature when it came to socialising with other children. I was always the bossy loud one, but I am a twin and so I think I felt I had to be to stand out, get attention etc. All children are different, living in different circumstances so its hard to generalize one particular factor.

alIO8ic0aa	Don't you get it? The whole point of this saying is that it doesn't make sense. It's what you say to confound your enemies when your argument has been shot out from under you by some pesky counterexample. From the point of view of advancing the debate it's about one jump ahead of "yo mama," but it beats standing there with your mouth open. <br>  <br>  To be sure, a few scholarly types have tried to make excuses for "The exception proves the rule," as the quotation books usually phrase it. They say it comes from the medieval Latin aphorism Exceptio probat regulam. Probat means "prove" in the sense of "test," as in "proving ground" or "the proof is in the pudding." So "the exception proves the rule" means a close look at exceptions helps us determine a rule's validity. <br>  <br>  If Latinists understand it that way, however, they're pretty much alone. I've looked up citations of this saying dating back to 1664, and in every case it was used in the brain-dead manner we're accustomed to today--that is, to suggest that non-conforming cases, by the mere fact of their existence, somehow confirm or support a generalization. Obviously they do nothing of the kind. We like to think proverbs become proverbial because they're true; this one is an exception. It certainly doesn't prove the rule.|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	that there are no absolutes in any subject<br>  as soon as one says" that's a fact" some one else retorts "yes but this does not"<br>  hope this helps|`|dKi2R2oHaa	It is spinspeak for "it was only ever a heuristic not a law".<br>  <br>  Proving doesn't actually mean what people think it does. It is the processess of defining the effective limits of a concept. Something which is proven does not mean that it's functonality is certain, only that it has been tested and thought to be acceptable enough to be useful. Exception's help define the limit's of a rule.<br>  <br>  Take Euler's formula for example ...<br>  <br>  V ? E + F = 2 relating the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedron.<br>  <br>  It is not true for all polyhedra, which is what schoolchildren are taught.  Finding exception's help's us to define it's limits.|`|UORqnFMjaa	You use it in a sentence as so "...is the exception that proves the rule" Excepting ~ proves the rule, shows the rule exists, or ~ would be needless; with the ~of, expect); thing or case excepted|`|Wf8T2bexaa	How long is a piece of string?

I can see your point; two nouns would constitute plurality, thus "were" instead of "was" would seem best.  However, because when you used the word "and" after the first noun, the 'was' could refer to the first noun only, and then youre simply adding another.  The more I repeated the sentence with "was", the more correct it sounded to me.(Example: you would say "It was cold and wet outside yesterday"; rather that, 'It were cold and wet outside yesterday.'  Even though youre describing two things in the past tense, the first noun is what is counts gramatically.  Alas, I am not an English teacher, so my description may not be wholly accurate, but I hoped that helped a little!

Note the two mistakes in it,—that of the verb implying a condition, and that of the objective case of the pronoun. It should read If I were he. This is another illustration of the rule regarding the verb To Be, taking the same case after it as before it; were is part of the verb To Be, therefore as the nominative (I) goes before it, the nominative (he) should come after it.<br>  <br>  subjunctive after wish.  Yet another traditional rule requires you to use were rather than was in a contrary-to-fact statement that follows the verb wish: I wish I were (not was) lighter on my feet. Many writers continue to insist on this rule, but the indicative was in such clauses can be found in the works of many well-known writers|`|fgnQ2vLqaa	It would be correct to use "were" because this involves the subjunctive.

O4oCqaKkaa	1. It could be a reference to the Hebrew name for Satan, Beelzebub. It translates to Lord of Flies. It is obvious that the Lord of Flies in the novel symbolizes the devil, or the evil in every human being. It seems as though Golding choose this title as a representation of the evil in humans. The title Lord of the Flies is just a metaphoric way of explaining the plot in a short text. <br>  <br>  Some believe that it refers to a line from 'King Lear'. "As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods, - They kill us for their sport". <br>  <br>  2.<a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/flies/canalysis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/flies/cana...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/lord-of-the-flies/study-guide/character-list/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/lord-of-the-fl...</a><br>  <br>  3.It approaches the nature of civilization and self-government from historical, anthropological, and sociological viewpoints, where the line between savage tribalism and ordered civilization is a much finer distinction than one might suspect.|`|JoyIIiZ6aa	I agree on the boring part.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	A career college is usually a for-profit institution which trains people directly for a specific job, such as hairstyling or medical assisting.  What they do is usually more what would be considered "job training", rather than "education," so you would only be expected to know those skills needed on the job.  That could include something like math, science, or English, if the job requires it (if you are going to be assisting a doctor, for example, you need to know a little science), but you would be unlikely to find a history or philosophy class at a career college.  Yes, you can go immediately after high school to such a college.  I wouldn't recommend it if you are a good student in high school or if your local community college offers similar programs (which would be much cheaper), but if you barely scraped through high school and don't see yourself going on to any more traditional schooling, they can prepare you for some basic jobs.|`|VZ21gL81aa	ANY degree, even from a career school will require a certain amount of writing, math and other general education courses.<br>  <br>  For example, how can a designer survive if they cannot do a simple calculation for % enlargement or reduction?

BIC8Bc7Taa	Hello, this answer may not help you, however I am a mum of a 7 year old and an 11 year old and this argument reminded me of critics of Barbie which formed part of my own childhood <a href="http://www.yvonnesplace.net/news/barbie.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.yvonnesplace.net/news/barbie....</a> <a href="http://www.playthings.com/article/CA6415261.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.playthings.com/article/CA6415...</a> and it does seem that throughout time, people will say that children are sold sexualised products.  My daughter 11 had a playboy handbag which she loved and i did tell her what the sign meant (semiotics), she was more concerned with the colour pink and not interested in the actual brand symbol.  My opinion of Bratz has been positive, the children play with their Bratz stuff and yes I suppose that you could attach adult perceptions (like short skirts that barely cover the bottom) but they don't notice, pretty much the same as I did not notice that Barbie was slated by feminists or that her body was unachievable.  I just wanted to play.<br>  You are welcome to quote this, so good luck with your research.|`|u9I9jjF5aa	Considering WHSmith doesn't sell to just kids, I'd say Bratz Dolls are more likely for sexualizing and exploiting children.  Children and even adults copy what they think is cool or interesting.  So by making Bratz cool and then putting skimpy clothing on them, what do you think kids are gunna do?  Put on a nice covering t-shirt and some jeans, or put on the little tiny skirt and tube top?|`|09Ht3JyCaa	they should be banned over all. they change people minds. they are horrible things|`|7gfNIajYaa	Well,my friends young girl who is about nine or ten now used to be obsessed with these dolls. I have known this little girl from the day she was born right up untill now. She started off normal like any young kid,loud-curious-happy etc etc. But her Dad (who is such a big influence on her) absolutly spoilt her...and I meant spoilt her as in buying her Christian Dior lipstick to play with while his wife (well girlfriend) had to actually ask her own six year old daughter could she use some (at the time she was unemployed).<br>  This little girl became a complete rude little brat,had no manners,and became almost catty.<br>  Everything became bratz-her bike,her dolls,her toy car,whatever.<br>  But,the best thing that ever happened is that there were only two other kids for her in our estate to play with,they were both boys and simliar to her age. When the girl started becoming good mates with them she became a tomboy playing soccer and cycling her bike with them,not being afraid to get dirty. She eventually ditched the stupid influencial dolls that so warped her mind and her attitude.<br>  My best friend (Claire) said to me once that you can see how torn the kid is still between being a prim and propper girl (in her dadas eyes she will probably be a model when she grows up)or being a tomboy and supporting Munster rugby (which her dad is so passionate about).<br>  As far as Im concerned about Bratz-they are terrible. They make young girls not want to eat their dinners,they become mini Paris Hiltons,its sickning. I can never look at the little girl after the phase (thank God it was a phase) that she went through. Im was so close to her family that I nearly considered part of the blood line.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thanks for reading,hope this helped,I would have given a more professional view on this,but because of this little girls experience,it just felt personal.<br>  <br>  Fionnuala,Ireland,Journalism Student,21.

RaXCko4saa	Joseph Smith, Jr. (December 23, 1805 – June 27, 1844) was the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, also known as Mormonism, and an important religious and political figure during the 1830s and 1840s. In 1827, Smith began to gather a religious following after announcing that an angel had shown him a set of golden plates describing a visit of Jesus to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. In 1830, Smith published what he said was a translation of these plates as the Book of Mormon, and the same year he organized the Church of Christ.<br>  <br>  For most of the 1830s, Smith lived in Kirtland, Ohio, which remained the headquarters of the church until the cost of building a large temple, financial collapse, and conflict with disaffected members encouraged him to gather the church to the Latter Day Saint settlement in Missouri. There, tensions between church members and non-Mormons escalated into the 1838 Mormon War. Smith and his followers then settled in Nauvoo, Illinois where they began building a second temple aided by new converts from Europe. After being accused of practicing polygamy and of aspiring to create a theocracy, Smith encouraged the suppression of a newspaper that had published accusations against him, leading to his assassination by a mob of non-Mormons.<br>  <br>  Joseph Smith's legacy includes several religious denominations with adherents numbering in the millions, denominations that share a belief in Jesus but that vary in their acceptance of each other and of traditional Christian beliefs. Smith's followers consider him a prophet and believe that some of his revelations are sacred texts on par with the Bible|`|XEcoJnt4aa	I think he was the founder of modern day Mormons but, I am not positive on this one.

ktOqm7cgaa	NAVIGATION Acts:<br>  <br>  Great Britain managed its colonial empire, including its American colonies, according to the principles of mercantilism.  The mercantile system was controlled through a series of Navigation Acts. The thrust of those Acts was to keep profitable trade under British control in order to bring as much wealth as possible into English pockets. In general the Acts said that insofar as possible, goods shipped to and from English ports must be carried in English ships. Within the Empire (i.e., between the colonies and Britain), foreign vessels were generally excluded. These Navigation Acts were not primarily pointed at the colonists but rather at the Dutch and others who “took” trade away from the British. <br>  <br>  The Navigation Acts also required that most raw materials be imported into England from the colonies in order to support British manufacturing.  Conversely, the colonies were often prohibited from exporting manufactured goods to Britain because they would compete with British manufactures. For a time, Virginia tobacco could be sold only in England, even though the Dutch might pay more for it. On the other hand, the growing of tobacco in England was prohibited. <br>  <br>  The first major Navigation Acts of 1650 and 1651 forbade the importation into England of all goods except those carried by English ships or ships owned by the producing country, eliminating third-party carriers. Foreign ships were barred from trading in the colonies. It should be noted in all these acts that the colonies were part of the Empire; and, thus, colonial ships were British ships. Also, in the main, these acts were not aimed against the colonies, but rather against the Dutch traders, who challenged British domination of the seas. Eventually these Acts led to war between the British and Dutch. <br>  [Taken from <a href="http://www.academicamerican.com/colonial/topics/britishempire.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.academicamerican.com/colonial...</a>  ]<br>  <br>  For a helpful list and brief explanation of Navigation Acts, including but not limited to that of 1650, and for additional information about the Acts and the American colonies, please see:<br>  <a href="http://www.academicamerican.com/colonial/topics/britishempire.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.academicamerican.com/colonial...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sagehistory.net/colonial/topics/navacts.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sagehistory.net/colonial/topi...</a>   and <br>  <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572230/Navigation_Acts.html" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_7615...</a>|`|Yd3YLIlraa	Deliverance?

0FXVTZf7aa	Yes.  Although I agree with religious conservatives who want to challenge the youth to delay sexual activity for a while, I totally disagree with their message that a condom is a provision for sin. I send my Christian friends to the website below which debunks the whole thing against premarital sex in the Bible. That way they have no excuse not to support comprehensive sex education.|`|kVZoeh9paa	Yea infact I know alot of kids in my school whos parents haven't even gone so far as to talk to them about it. While we were in our family life class this one girl didn't even know what perr pressure was, and she is older then me by at LEAST a year. More and more kids are having sex everyday, so you might as well teach them how to be safe.|`|BNrQSYwhaa	Absolutely,Thats the reason why theirs a 12 year old who "wants to have sex" people don't know of the risk of pregnancy where all your money is siphoned to the baby and you have no spare time and the risks of STD's.People are curious if they don't know about it then they will want to experiment for themselves.I think Abstinence is a little extreme in my opinion  if people are taught about the risks of unprotected sex they will be able to make a informed decision about having sex.|`|ayWyLLOMaa	I think that sex education is a most in schools. If kids are not taught the proper techniques and prevention methods, then they will get pregnant by themselves and possibly get a sexually transmitted disease.

We have always taught our children from the very start that their bodies are wonderful. We have always explained why we should dress/behave modestly and we do not allow our children to do/see many of the things that most families would consider "normal". The reason abstinence education is not working for many children is because it is not encouraged at home. The breakdown of the American family is really what is the cause of so many childhood troubles today. To say that teenagers are going to have sex is a very ignorant statement. While this may be true for some, there are MANY more who are chosing to wait until they are married and are praised for this! When kids know its "cool" to wait and that they should respect their bodies and save them for that 1 person they wish to spend the rest of their life with, then its not so hard. Too many parents give teenagers too much responsibility, allowing them to go to parties with boys and girls, driving places alone, etc... instead of supervising them during a time in their lives that they need it the most! Many parents are so concerned with "controling" their children when they are little and then allow them to be so free as teenagers, when the exact oposite should be happening! Our children know more than most their age about sex because we have taught them that sex is not a bad thing- its a wonderful thing between a husband and a wife. Our kids constantly come to us with questions and we have good communication because we are there for them and they know that while they will of course be given more privileges when they are older, it doesn't matter what "everyone else" is doing- what matters is what OUR family expects and considers appropriate.|`|xGNOrQQCaa	Well yes it should be allowed in school, other wise there would be thousands of other teenage pregnancies and STD's in the world.  Yes they teach that abstinence is the best choice but they also do teach other ways of protection.  They teach to have safe sex, the male and female condum, birth control, the morning after pill, and most of all the really stress abstinence.  See although they teach other options they really strive on abstinence but they know teenagers are going to have sex its just one of those things that are unavoidable, but they also teach on ways to prevent it.  It is not the teachers fault the kids got pregnant its the kids fault they weren't safe, or maybe they were did you think about that maybe the condum broke!  What ever the case may be they teach many ways to prevent it!|`|54OjRZm8aa	Honestly I think its the parents that can drill it into the kids heads better than anyone. I think the biggest problem is parents telling there teenage daughter she cant have sex till 30, and telling the teenage son he can't have sex till age 20. It needs to be equal! A teen girl can get pregnant. A teen boy can cause the pregnancy or I should say participate in the pregnancy. It's the same they both have equal responsibility. Parents need to be closer with their kids and make them realize that you need to be in love with someone before giving yourself up, you need to trust that the person loves you back. I honestly think all these music videos with the slutty girls dancing almost naked dancing with the slutty guys gives children of any age and teens of any age the ok that now days it's cool to be as raunchy as possible. That's my opinion and I hope it helps with the whole thing. :)|`|MSwGh6Cpaa	i think it should be allowed and what i think may seem stupid to yall but...i think they should start it at 7th or 8th grade (JH) because im a 7th grader and i have walked into the JH bathroom and there will be students having sex and its just WRONG! there in jh for cryin out loud so thats my personal oppinion...|`|KaR3nR9vaa	you have mostly answered your question in you questing  abstinence dose not work so sex education should be allowed in schools.

jAPlUn7Iaa	Before I explain my answers, I would like to explain a bit where I come from. I grew up most of my life without a computer. Not only without a computer but I lived through the age of computer growth. An age where have a computer was almost necessary for everyday life. <br>  <br>  Finally at the age of 14, my family purchased our first computer. Nothing special really; however, it was a computer none the less. I grew up most of my life without this machine and I thought my life would go as it did in the past. But with this powerful machine of technology came responsibility. Computer games of course were one of the many pleasures of this new machine. I would spend hours upon hours trying to be the best rollercoaster designer or Rollercoaster Tycoon (one of my all time favorite games). Grades dropped from B+ to B- and then to Cs. And by the time I got to highschool, it seemed by laziness grew to more areas and I began to sleep in all my classes and just cruise control through life. My junior year was when I first got the Internet (the mecca of knowledge). To me, that changed everything. It seemed the flavor of technology was given back to me and I wanted to learn more and more. Now, I do not really know what changed my attitude towards this device, but it changed. Some would say maturity, others would cite parental guidance. But, honestly I did not know what happened.<br>  <br>  So when you ask does technology hamper or aid us in our quest for education, I answer that it is like any other opportunity in life. It is what we make of it. I can personally say this by my experience in life. The first few years with technology I disregarded the possibilities of education growth, but through maturity and responsilbity, I realized that technology is a tool to be used to make yourself a better person. Hence that is why I went into the technology field then as a career. So now I ask you the same question, Does it hamper or aid you?|`|JoyIIiZ6aa	You could argue both ways, since technology opened many new venues to enrich education, but it also created a ton of problems.  I would suggest picking one element of technology, like computers or tv, and concentrating on that as you make your argument.  E.g.: Computers are a wonder of modern technology: lightweight, fast and easy to take along; they encroached on all aspects of our lives, as even the very young spend considerable amount of time staring at computer screens.  Computers made the world shrink to the speed of internet connection, yet they also made our behinds grow and our muscles diminish as we sit in front of them, barely physically active. They allow us for the rapid sharing of information, making new discoveries immediately available, they also leave us vulnerable to data loss and theft.  Children find computers irresistible, but often fall prey to their perils, as game sites, youtube and constant ads issue a siren call, and parents use computers as babysitters.<br>  <br>  I hope this will give you some ideas about how to write your paper.

6Kq1ExFxaa	Get you English right first. "I have applied for the post "Scientist/Engineer  'SC'" at ISRO. There is a written test; what should I prepare? - you don't want to fail because your English is bad. I don't know about the Indian tests but just read through your notes and remember that they might test you on how well you will cope with a situation. Remain calm and collective in the test and get lots of rest beforehand.

If that's important to you, you should pick SUNY Binghamton.<br>  <br>  Have you had a chance to visit either school yet? I know, as an international student, that's not always possible. So instead, you can ask admissions to give you contact information for a current student at the university - preferably another international student, ideally someone from your home country, or that region - and speak to the student about the university. <br>  <br>  Is financial aid/support important to you? If it is, and if either school has been able to offer you some aid, you can consider that in your decision as well.

Yes, anyone who is in college (and it has nothing whatsoever to do with their age) who hasn't yet received a degree could be called and undergraduate but normally they're just called students.  But the baccalaureate degrees are called "undergraduate degrees"  In the USA, most people 18-19 years old are merely High School graduates, and most every degree candidate won't get their degrees until they are 21-22, at the earliest.  And there are no "advanced degrees" available to someone merely because they are older when they start - it still takes 4-to-5 years to get the first undergraduate degree.

EvyY3dUNaa	STALGOMETER<br>  An instrument for measuring the size of drops suspended from a capillary tube, used in the drop-weight method. Also known as stactometer; stalogometer. <br>  <br>  STALGOMOMETER<br>  An instrument for determining exactly the number of drops in a given quantity of liquid, used as a measure of the surface tension of a fluid.|`|cWuumdy7aa	On January 25, 1995, the EPA promulgated national emission standards for chromium emissions from hard and decorative chromium electroplating and chromium anodizing tanks.  On July 9, 2004 amendments were promulgated to add certain compliance provisions, including use of surface tension limits using either a stalagmometer or tensiometer.<br>  <br>  Based on emission test data from on hard chromium electroplating tanks EPA determined that compliance with the 0.015 milligram per dry standard cubic meter (mg/ dscm) emission limit can be achieved when the surface tension of the electroplating tank bath is maintained below certain levels.  Based on those data, EPA set two surface tension limits: . 45 dynes per centimeter (dynes/cm), when measured using a stalagmometer, and . 35 dynes/cm, when measured using a tensiometer.<br>  <br>  The reason for the two limits is that EPA's research and other data show that, when used to measure the surface tension of chromium electroplating baths, tensiometers typically read about 20 percent lower than surface tension measurements of the same bath made using a stalagmometer.<br>  <br>  Most chrome plating facilities use stalagmometers to measure surface tension. Stalagmometers cost about $250. Fewer facilities use tensiometers that cost several thousand dollars.  Conventional wisdom says that stalagmometers are not be as accurate as tensiometers.  I have not done any independent testing to confirm or dispute this conclusion. <br>  <br>  A du Nouy tensiometer is an instrument that measures surface tension by increasing force to a platinum-iridium ring in contact with the surface of the liquid. The tensiometer pulls on the ring and measures the force it takes to break the ring from the surface. The stalagmometer is an instrument used to measure surface tension by determining the mass of a drop of liquid by weighing, a known number of drops or by counting the number of drops obtained from a known volume of liquid. Measuring surface tension with a stalagmometer is sometimes referred to as the 'drop weight' method.<br>  <br>  During the past several years, the state of California conducted testing as part of their proposed rule making, including evaluating differences in surface tension readings based on two types of instruments: a stalagmometer and a tensiometer. There was a difference observed between measurements with the two instruments. While all stalagmometer surface tension readings were higher than the tensiometer readings, no uniform difference was seen (i.e. they did not consistently vary by the same amount of dynes/centimeter, which is different than EPA's conclusion.  <br>  <br>  I believe the variability of the two methods has more to do with the greater difficulty of using a stalagmometer as compared to tensiometer.  However, if a person is well trained and adheres to a well established standard operating procedure, then either method should work.  As such, and considering cost, I'd have to recommend the stalagmometer.

You'll need the academy which isn't part of a Fire Science degree and at a minimum, EMT to be hired on.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to get your standards and EMT, get hired on then pursue your degree while employed. It's easier and you'll understand the material a lot better.

You might not actually need college classes to become a firefighter although it couldn't hurt. I have never had fire oriented classes in college but I took FF I & FF II then Fire Officer I and so on at the state fire academy and was nationally certified and became a paid firefighter. I also have a friend that took Fire Science and then had to take  FF I and so on to become employed. Basically we both got to the same point only I saved thousands of dollars by not taking college courses, but like I said couldn't hurt especially with future promotions. A degree in anything always looks better.

s9tvr0DTaa	The greenhouse effect refers to the change in the steady state temperature of a planet or moon by the presence of an atmosphere containing gas that absorbs and emits infrared radiation.[1] Greenhouse gases, which include water vapor, carbon dioxide and methane, warm the atmosphere by efficiently absorbing thermal infrared radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. As a result of its warmth, the atmosphere also radiates thermal infrared in all directions, including downward to the Earth’s surface. Thus, greenhouse gases trap heat within the surface-troposphere system.[2][3][4][5] This mechanism is fundamentally different from the mechanism of an actual greenhouse, which instead isolates air inside the structure so that the heat is not lost by convection and conduction, as discussed below. The greenhouse effect was discovered by Joseph Fourier in 1824, first reliably experimented on by John Tyndall in the year 1858 and first reported quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in his 1896 paper. The emissions of the UV light is reflected by clouds. To the detriment of the Yasmin pill, it may convey symptoms of bloating and extreme swelling of the urea.[6]<br>  <br>  In the absence of the greenhouse effect and an atmosphere, the Earth%

Waiting that long will obviously create some excited feelings in the two, and you can play that up, but the 'moment' should be tender, gentle. They should both be a little on the nervous and shy side.  As for setting up the scene, I'm not quite sure what you mean.  The wedding night itself needs no setting up, it just naturally follows the wedding ceremonies .  If you mean, how do you establish the setting, as in the physical surroundings, try to think of things that evoke thoughts of purity and innocence.

Towns cities, and villages disappeared. All the groves and forest were destroyed, and all the gardens, and all the works of art. Men, women, and children became lower than the animals. Discouraged and disillusioned, dogs deserted their fallen masters. Books Paintings, and music disappeared from the earth, and human beings just sat around doing nothing. Years and years went by. Even the few generals who were left forgot what the last war had decided. Boys and girls grew up to stare at each other blankly. Love had passed from earth.<br>  <br>  One day, a young girl who had never seen a flower chanced to come upon the last one in the world. She told the other human beings that the last flower was dying. The only one who paid attention to her was a young man. Together, the young man and the girl nurtured the flower and it began to live again. One day, a bee visited the flower, and a humming bird. Before long, there were two flowers, and then a great many. Groves and forests flourished again. The young girl began to take interest in how she looked. The young man discovered that touching the girl was pleasurable. Love was reborn into the world.<br>  <br>  The children of the young man and the girl grew up strong and healthy. They learned to run and laugh. Dogs came out of their exile. The young man discovered how to build a shelter. Pretty soon everybody was building shelters. Towns, cities, and villages sprung up. Song came back into the world, and troubadours and jugglers, tailors and cobblers, painters and poets, and sculptors, and soldiers and Lieutenants and Captains, and Generals and Major-Generals, and liberators. Some people went to one place to live, and some to another. Before long, those who went to live in the valleys wished they had gone to live in the hills. And those who had to live in the hills wished they had gone down to live in valleys. The liberators, under the guidance of God, set fire to the discontented. So presently, the world was at war again. This time, the destruction was so complete that nothing at all was left in the world, except one man, one woman, and a flower.

kBRKu0MAaa	It depends on what route you take really. Me personally, I am in my third and last year of a BEd teaching degree. <br>  <br>  You can either go straight to uni and do a BEd (Bachelor of education) in Initial Teacher Training (ITT) which is usually four years long. I did a 3 year BEd as i chose not to specialise in a subject.<br>  <br>  Or, if you decide you want to do another degree first, you can do your teacher training after, and take what is known as a Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) which is one year long.<br>  <br>  I think it depends what age range you want to teach, i would say if you want to teach primary, take the Bed route, as it is more in depth, and i don't truly believe you can know everything you need to know to teach in 1 year, unless you are super conscientious. PGCE's are more geared towards secondary school teachers, who do a degree in whatever subject they wish to teach so that they have subject knowledge to degree level, and take the PGCE so that they can be qualified to teach this knowledge to children.<br>  <br>  However, it has been known for people to do a BEd then teach secondary, or people to do a PGCE and teach primary, it definately isn't set in stone. People have also done degrees in subjects completely unrelated to education and then gone on to do a PGCE, it totally depends on how you feel. A lot of people do a different degree first so that they have something to 'fall back on' should they later decide that teaching is not for them, but if you are sure it is what you want to do, i'd say do a BEd.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	You have to be formally educated so long as you are within the compulsory attendance ages in your state.  It can be homeschooling the entire time, or part of that time.<br>  <br>  If you mean hours, some states have requirements such as 4.5 hours a day or 1500 a year (for example), some do not.  You would have to do 4.5 hours a day if that was what was legally required, and I guess that if there was an annual requirement the parent/teacher would break it up into the number of days they were going to do the lessons.<br>  <br>  We have no requirements in our state, and we usually finish our lessons in 3-4 hours a day.  Sometimes more.  Occasionally less.  Without any legal requirements, though, it will vary as to how long one family takes.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	As long as you want, and even then you get to define what counts as homeschooling and what doesn't. Some homeschoolers (particularly those who unschool) would claim that they homeschool 24/7. Other homeschoolers might only count the hours they spend doing specific activities, like lessons outside the home, educational projects, field trips, etc. Homeschoolers who do school-at-home (i.e. they pretty much try to re-create the school environment at home) will probably just follow the typical school schedule, so there's no need to try to figure out what to count and what not to count in their annual or quarterly reports. The thing to remember is that, while you might have certain laws and requirements to meet, as a homeschooler you can be VERY creative in how you meet them. Did your kid help you cook dinner tonight? Great, there's one hour of math and one hour of home economics to mark on your schedule.|`|f8169e37dd6c1f4e271f4d2361dfce12aa	Your homeschooling day does not have to be a set amount of hours.

tbGZnkgPaa	First, I have yet to find a school with a premed major that isn't actually chem or bio in disguise! haha! But no, your undergrad major does not affect your admissions process into medical school. It only can help you achieve higher scores on your MCAT and help you out with providing a background for the coursework you will take in medical school. I would suggest a chem or bio major with a premed concentration if your school offers it. If you decide you don't like either of those majors make sure it is not because you can't complete the coursework because it will be 10 times as hard in medical school. I would suggest if you do major is a non science degree, to take a minor in chem or bio at least. <br>  <br>  Good luck in your studies!|`|UYaWH7a0aa	You should also check with individual medical schools that you may be interested in later on to see what their course requirments are and make sure that both your GPA & course requirements fall within their ranges so that you are eligible to apply to them
Lfh0DWppaa	Take the courses that will boost your GPA. If you're strong in arts (or whatever), then use your electives in that area. Admissions committees want that high overall GPA to boost their incoming class profile, regardless of curriculum.<br>  <br>  Of course, they do require medical (bio/chem) prereqs, and the better your GPA in those areas, the more competitive you are as an applicant. So I would say to work very, very hard on your prerequisite science classes to score as high as you can, and all of your electives should be taken in the subject area you're strongest in. This will boost your overall GPA and give you a better edge.<br>  <br>  And be sure to begin volunteer work anywhere (nursing home, soup kitchen, Habitat, etc) ASAP, as committees want to see that you're committed to public interest. Do that at least twice per month until you apply.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|icB7HVxDaa	Most medical schools don't really care what you major in, they only care that you did really well in your prerequisites (biology, chemistry, physics, calculus,etc.) In fact, something different might help you stand out to the admissions committee.

The multiple choice questions are 2 points each, but what about the 2 long-answer questions?  How many points are those worth?<br>  <br>  Exactly how many multiple choice questions you can miss and still pass depends on how well you do with the long-answer questions.

We can't be more specific than that without knowing how many points the long-answer questions are worth.<br>  <br>  EDIT - in response to your additional details:  I still can't tell, unless you tell how many points the long-answer questions are worth.  Because you have so far only told about the multiple-choice questions, you haven't accounted for all of the possible points on the test.<br>  <br>  EDIT again - Sorry, you're not providing enough information to be able to tell.  If you need 80 points to pass the test, and the multiple choice questions are worth 60, there's no possible way to pass the test without getting at least some points from the long-answer questions, even if you ace the multiple-choice section.<br>  <br>  The key piece of information is how many points the long-answer questions are worth.  If you don't have an answer for that, then there's no way anyone can have an answer for how many multiple-choice questions you can miss and still pass.|`|X8ntjNO6aa	Lets make it easy. You need 70% to pass. Multiply 7 X 60 = 42 points. This is the minimum amount of points needed to pass. 60 pts. is the total possible. 70% of 60 points = 42 points. Make sense?  Good luck!!

US News lists it as #22 among liberal arts colleges, which is a separate set of rankings listing Amherst as the top school (as opposed to national universities, in which Harvard, Princeton, Yale, MIT and Stanford top the list).  Liberal arts colleges are usually smaller, focused on undergrads, and have a narrower curriculum than do the national universities.|`|hfH8c1LWaa	distinguishing a top school is always hard, because it never matters. any school can be a top school cause it depends on the ideas of the student. if ur brother loves it and thinks its the best, then its a top school. it just matters what u think is a good school, but as far as rnkings are concerned i have no idea, maybe. lqtm
809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	You might contact the school, but it's quite normal for people to take a year off and travel or work between school and uni.

tbGZnkgPaa	It seems like there are more pros to transferring and more cons to staying! The break between sophomore and junior year is perfect for transfer and when you do get to your larger university there are going to be tons of junior transfers from community colleges or other schools that you will hook up with and meet! It is scary going to a new school, especially if it is quite large but often the larger schools have way more clubs and activities so it's actually a little easier to fit in and find your niche. <br>  <br>  Also you mentioned that the academic program was better. Remember that's the whole point of college! Getting the best education that will get your degree on time (four years or so) and get you qualified for a good job. If you think you the larger school can do that then I would definitely consider transferring! Good luck!|`|AA10023710	It depends on your reasons for wanting to transfer.

Change (maybe).<br>  <br>  First year is always a transition.  Just because medicine is difficult is not a good reason to quit.  Anything worthwhile is going to be difficult and you will be rewarded for your effort.  That being said, medicine is a different career than most.  Medicine is more of a calling than a job.  You should change your major only if you have something else that is meaningful to you.  If you don't have something else to pursue that is truly worthwhile, stay with your studies for a time as your outlook may change.  You will find a meaningful pursuit along the way. The important part is that you don't quit, but change to something significant.  If you stay with medicine, there are going to be aspects of your studies that you will never enjoy, but you may find something  that is so rewarding that it overwhelms any discomforts... something like helping others.  Even if you complete your education, you can always do something else after.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself when you look back in 30 years, how will you feel about your decision.  If you quit because it is hard, you will have regrets.  If you complete your studies, or change to something more meaningful, you won't.<br>  <br>  That is my Big-Picture-Philosophy advice.

BASCOM has not yet rolled out remote access for teachers. But soon!<br>  <br>  2) Log in to the system at gcb.bascom.net.  <br>  <br>  3) Click Add Lesson <br>  <br>  4) Give your lesson a name, a login and password (what your students will use to get access), and set a category (ELA, Math, etc) and subcategory.<br>  <br>  5) Set the Learning Zones to Research Zone.  If you want to focus your students' access, use the Lesson Zone or School Zone (call tech support for an explanation of how that works, but for now select Research Zone).<br>  <br>  6)  Click on Allowed Sites and type or paste in the list of Web sites you want the students to use. Click OK.<br>  <br>  7) Select Custom student Start Page and click Click Here to Modify;<br>   type or paste in the directions/instructions to the students. Click OK.<br>  <br>  8) Click Add Allowed Sites to Student Start Page, select the sites you want to appear on the Start Page and click Add.  Rename the sites if you want; add icons if you want (good for very young kids).<br>  <br>  9) Choose a Start Page Theme<br>  <br>  10) Click Preview to see how your lesson looks, then OK twice, and Save.<br>  <br>  11) Log in to lesson the way your students would: go to login.bascom.net and access the lesson with the lesson login and password you set.<br>  <br>  It's really not as complicated as it looks here.  Do it a couple times with Tech Support and you'll be fine.  And there are a ton of other options. Did you know there are over 500 BASCOM-created lessons already in the system?  Each has an interactive whiteboard tip. Go to teachers.bascom.com for a listing, or when you log in as a Lesson Manager, check the box labelled BASCOM lessons and they will appear.  Have you seen BASCOM's Web Library? From school go to globalchalkboard.com.  <br>  <br>  Now I'm kinda curious where (what district or school) you're from.

OJpjktj6aa	How is an earthquake magnitude scale related to the amounts of energy released by earthquakes?<br>  The Richter magnitude scale, or more correctly local magnitude ML scale, assigns a single number to quantify the amount of seismic energy released by an earthquake. It is a base-10 logarithmic scale obtained by calculating the logarithm of the combined horizontal amplitude of the largest displacement from zero on a Wood–Anderson torsion seismometer output. So, for example, an earthquake that measures 5.0 on the Richter scale has a shaking amplitude 10 times larger than one that measures 4.0. The effective limit of measurement for local magnitude is about ML = 6.8.<br>  <br>  Though still widely reported, the Richter scale has been superseded by moment magnitude scale which gives generally similar values.<br>  <br>  The energy release of an earthquake, which closely correlates to its destructive power, scales with the 3?2 power of the shaking amplitude. Thus, a difference in magnitude of 1.0 is equivalent to a factor of 31.6 ( = (101.0)(3 / 2)) in the energy released; a difference of magnitude of 2.0 is equivalent to a factor of 1000 ( = (102.0)(3 / 2) ) in the energy released. [1]<br>  <br>  What are the major dangers to people from an earthquake?<br>  Earthquakes really pose little direct danger to a person. People can't be shaken to death by an earthquake. Some movies show scenes with the ground suddenly opening up and people falling into fiery pits, but this just doesn't happen in real life. <br>  <br>  The Effect of Ground Shaking <br>  <br>  The first main earthquake hazard (danger) is the effect of ground shaking. Buildings can be damaged by the shaking itself or by the ground beneath them settling to a different level than it was before the earthquake (subsidence). <br>  <br>  Name three methods of improving a building's safety before an earthquake.<br>  An earthquake-loss-reduction program entails three basic elements: (1) understanding the nature and extent of the earthquake risk, (2) taking actions to reduce the risks and (3) establishing policy to guide the development of effective risk-reduction programs. Gori (1984) presents a collection of papers that provide practical information on improving the level of earthquake hazard mitigation and preparedness. <br>  <br>  4) What might people living next to the ocean do to protect themselves if they were given a two-hour warning of an approaching tsunami? <br>  1. If an earthquake occurs that is so strong that you cannot stand up and you are on the coast or on the beach, be aware that a Tsunami may follow <br>  2. If the ocean recedes to reveal the ocean bottom, be aware that this is a Tsunami and the next wave will very soon flood coast lines <br>  3. If you hear a roar like a train, this may be a sign that Tsunami waves are fast approaching <br>  4. Tsunami waves attack for many hours and the first wave may not be the largest. <br>  <br>  Natural warning signs of tsunamis include ground shaking from earthquakes and unusual sea-level fluctuations, wave forms, and sounds. These signs can alert people to impending tsunamis, but no research has explored the recognizability of these signs or the social-cognitive factors that affect human behavioral response to them. Of 663 interviewees, 24% felt ground shaking during the earthquake; 69% saw something unusual about the ocean before the first wave reached land, mostly a receded shoreline; and 55% heard something unusual. Despite these levels of observation, most people did not evacuate. In fact, 65% saw other people in the danger zone at the time of the tsunami impact. Most respondents had to run for their lives but could not identify a safe place. There are major differences in experience among north, central, and southern coastal Thailand, reflecting social, topographical, and hydrological factors.<br>  <br>  If you lived in an area where earthquakes were common, what could you do to make your home safer? <br>  You should contact the local authorities, and ask them for help. While you're waiting, you can make sure there isn't anything that can crash down on you when an earthquake strikes. Also be sure to cloase all windows, and hide in the cellar or basement, but NOT near any glass. <br>  <br>  6) Earthquakes release stress that has built up in rocks. Why do you think aftershocks occur?<br>  It is caused by vibrations (waves) transmitted in the earth produced by rapid release of energy from elastic energy stored in rocks. This energy is built up along faults because of large scale movements in the earth, and is released when the fault moves. The "point" where the energy is released is called the focus and the "elastic waves" are generated here. They spread in all directions from the focus.<br>  We will see that the earth is composed of moving plates and at the boundaries of these plates elastic strain builds up and the rocks deform. The Denali fault in Alaska had lateral movement of about 25 ft. (as shown in the diagram at the right) and had a magnitude of 7.9. This build up of strain along the San Andreas fault prior to th|`|kcrDUF1Xaa	Dont be lazy. Do your own homework

Most faculty don't like to think of themselves as "labor", so we tend to think of it as the union, rather than as a labor union, but it is definitely that.

The bias current delivered to the switch is controlled to be at a high level for bringing about proper retrace, but at a low level at the beginning and ending of the time base sweep itself to prevent undesired transients and nonlinearity effects. The low current is maintained from the end of the retrace period until the start of the following retrace period. A baseline stabilizer loop comprises a transistor circuit for accurately predetermining the baseline reference wherein the emitter current of the transistor is controlled to a substantially constant value during operation for enhanced stability. The undesirable effect produced by inherent capacitance of a semiconductor device current source used for charging the timebase generator timing capacitor is neutralized by means of a matching semiconductor device interposed between the timebase generator output and an input electrode of the first mentioned semiconductor device.

fPsl1DZDaa	I had a teacher that would lightly bop us on the head with the clipboard when we caused trouble, it was nothing more than a tap, but a kid might have gone home to tell mom that the teacher hits him which is a lot different with that one word. Kids can misconstrue things sometimes. How close was your kid to the action? Could he see clearly? Did he tell you everything in the first run or did you ask leading questions? Details can change depending on how you ask a question. "Did the teacher hit you? vs What happened?" can make a huge difference. <br>  <br>  Perhaps the kid was startled by the ball and knocked off the supplies himself. Its hard to tell. Have you met the teacher? Do you think this is something she would do on purpose normally? The best you can do at this point is to talk to the principal and see if there can be a random monitoring or other way to ease your mind. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BJERgbM5aa	No it's definitely not appropriate.

But for the purpose of discussion or answering a question, you assume that it **does** exist so you can tell what it's like.

a36a4f0aa2d7f129af1802cbaa36ec85aa	I am really not sure what NEIT means, but I will tell you that an Engineering degree is far more valuable than an Engineering Tech degree(which is usually an AA degree). If you are taking this type of course load, yeah, I'd definitely try to transfer to a University if you can (if this is a private technology school like ECPI or ITT Tech the credits may not transfer anywhere and you would have wasted a lot of time and money). Engineering Techs typically assist the Engineer who has the BE or BS in Chemical, Electrical, Civil, or Environmental Engineering.

If the child has homework the parents need to motivate them to make them do it. The parents feed the child so if they eat breakfast the kid will be alert and will be motivated. The parents know knowledge as well as the teachers. The parents will have all kinds of books on their shelves whch can teach different things also you've got the t.v and internet (hopefully).Parents can easily provide you with alot of knowledge with different resouces.<br>  Also their daily job can teach you things.

SIhxrxD3aa	Some of those classes can probably be done on-line.  However, be very careful of any course that requires a lab.  Even if the on-line programs claims to include a lab the vet school typically will not consider that acceptable.  You can definitely take the social sciences, english courses and any sciences that don't require a lab.  But, chemistry, physics and biology courses that include labs should be taken on the campus just to be on the safe side.|`|Moz2d806aa	Yes, you can probably take some classes online. However, don't do it through an online school, they often do not have the correct accreditation. Many community colleges offer classes online. This would be better choice. They will probably be really easy. However, don't take any important classes, since you really won't learn much. Just take the waste of time classes like psychology, history, etc.|`|AA11659150	If you have no way of physically sitting in class, than yes, you can take some through a local community college.  However, most vet programs are VERY selective and hard to get into.  You have no guarantee, unless you are in close contact with the schools you plan to apply to (and even then it's not fool proof), that what you take will translate credit wise into what they require as prereqs.  You don't want to find that you've spent money on these classes only to be told that they weren't done at a high enough level, they aren't acceptable, part of the prereq curriculum, yadda yadda yadda... And then have to turn around and pay all over again to sit in a physical class room!  Now THAT is a waste of time and money.   <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd want to show these schools that I am serious as a heart attack about getting in.  Vet school is similar to med, dental, pharm, etc in that it requires high level learning.  I mean you aren't going to graduate as a mechanic, right?  You will be a doctor!!!  <br>  <br>  My advice would be to attend classes in person, not online, and excel.  That way, you will have built a good base with profs for recs when the time comes AND you will have some guarantee that your prereqs taken will transfer and apply to the vet school of your choice or acceptance, AND that the program is accredited.  (Otherwise, they won't give you the time of day.)<br>  <br>  I know it seems long and tedious, but if you want to do something well, you need to do it right and that is usually NOT the easy way.  In person and building relationships for your future profession.  You can't do that with a computer.  I promise you wil see more benefit if you do it this way than the "easy" way.  If you are applying yourself, making the effort to actually sit in class is always the best way to go.  You will learn more, learn it better, and advance more quickly.  (Even in areas that seem dumb like psych, history, etc.  There is a reason they have you take those classes.  It is so you are well rounded as trite as that sounds!  One of the biggest things going to college shows possible employers is that you are trainable and that you have knowledge in many areas, not just one.  See where the history classes come in instead of just the mechanic ones?  Not that there is anything wrong with being a mechanic if that is what you want to do OR your highest possible level of achievment.  But you have a lofty goal!  This goes for admissions boards too.  They won't let you in if you haven't shown that you are trainable.)  Please, please don't scrimp on your education and your future, especially with such a wonderful goal you have!!!  GL!

NPtz1Y4Taa	The culture of Spain is an Iberian culture marked by the period of Roman influences. In the areas of language and religion, the Ancient Romans left a lasting legacy. The subsequent course of Spanish history also added elements to the country's cultural development.<br>  <br>  Spain's culture to some extent. Muslim influences were very strong during the period of 711 A.D. to the 1400s, especially in the area of language. The Spanish language, deriving directly from Vulgar Latin, has also borrowed numerous words and accents from Arabic. Spain's cultural mix became richer during the Middle Ages because of the presence of a large and influential Jews population. After the defeat of the Muslims and Jews during the Christian "Reconquista" (Reconquest) period between 1000 to 1492, Spain became a Roman Catholic country. In addition, the history of the nation and its Mediterranean and Atlantic environment have played a significant role in shaping its culture.<br>  <br>  By the end of the 19th and 20th , the Spaniards (Spanish) government made expressions of cultural diversity easier than it had been for the last seven centuries. This occurred at the same period that Spain became increasingly drawn into a diverse international culture
HCvJ0AGnaa	I have four sons, three have autism.<br>  <br>  My eight year old was started at four on MAKATON, he progressed so well that he was then put onto TEACH which for him was excellent. At five he started a special needs school, as his needs were sever and we knew he'd find it hard to adjust to mainstream teaching. Within a year he was starting to talk with mini sentences and he stopped using TEACH.<br>  <br>  Last year we moved and due to the remoteness of the area we had no option but to put him into mainstream. This was a HUGE concern for us, although he has developed well, he still has sever autism and ADHD and for a while I was really concerned in how he would adapt. When he started we had a meeting with the teachers his LSA, a child psychologist and other professionals, there we all sat and worked out an IEP to suit his needs.<br>  <br>  I have always been very outspoken regarding my children, sadly it seems that this is the only way to get the support and education your child deserves and needs. I remember VERY well being told by some men in suits that My son would be better in mainstream rather than special needs...HOW DARE THEY, to them he was nothing but another statement and money for their council. After telling them i'd take him and his statement out of the borough if I had too they backed down and gave him the place he needed.<br>  <br>  As a parent of special needs children I find it bloody annoying that we are constantly faced with an up hill struggle to get what WE want for our children. There are so many of these SO CALLED professionals that THINK they know what is best, THEY DON'T!!!<br>  No one knows your child better than YOU, no one knows his need better than YOU!!<br>  <br>  TEACH is not just about support and skills at school it is also about your relationship at home. This needs to be pointed out, they should be working along side YOU not the other way around, they should be listening to you and taking on board all your concerns and worries. TEACH if best suited for your son should be used for him, if they have to send member of staff on training then that is their concern not yours. The funding they get for your son will pay for all of these programmes and you should push as hard as you can to get the programme you are happy with.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck hun, it may well be a battle but never give in!!!!!|`|YkseyT7zaa	You need to get down to the specifics of what goals you want for your child to reach.

Having been in the special education field for around 22 years, I have had to sometimes fight for something for my students, but never did I get ANY sense that the person who I was fighting with, thought of a child that way. <br>  <br>  I guess the people at the top may think about dollars more than anyone at the school level. For them it is a necessity. If the school district is not well managed, it goes bankrupt and then we all lose.<br>  <br>  IEP teams are faced with a lot of realities. They don't have the luxury to work for just a few children. They are working for your individual child and a bunch of other children as well. Money isn't in an unlimited supply. IDEA is not even fully funded. The more one individual child gets, the less another one gets. Unfortunately, you don't see the results of underfunded kids, but we do.<br>  <br>  Our children with mild to moderate learning disabilities who are included or mainstreamed are in a world of hurt. Resource teachers are carrying around caseloads of 45 to 50 kids at elementary and 75 at some middle and high school. When I was a staffing person at a middle school, teachers were staffing students they had never met.<br>  <br>  Because they do not get the services outlined on their IEP, they are crashing and burning at great rates. They are getting suspended and sent to alternatives schools and failure is all they have ever known. Many drop out and occupy the lower strata of our economy. Our jails are full of learning disabled people.<br>  <br>  So while you guys worry about your kid getting TEACCH, the teaching staff is worrying not only about your kid, but all the kids. I am not saying that you shouldn't try to get what you want. What I am saying is that I don't think teachers have ulterior motives. I think they have realities.<br>  <br>  And the people who have hired me to intervene with their children at home did not know more than me about everything. I have behavior analytical skills and I was able to help them control their kids.<br>  <br>  Education professionals have some key technical knowledge that you may not have. Teachers don't just rot after graduation. They are required to take classes to renew their certificates. That is a lot of very technical pedagogy.

I personally agree with you (I am a special education teacher) and do not like ABA -- it is way to strict for many kids and can interfere with children just being kids.  I absolutely love the TEACCH program and what it has to offer for students.  It is all based on the individual child and make sure that you as the parent know your child the best and do not let anyone tell you differently.  Fight for what you feel is right and what you need for him.

cMZEmpp0aa	Yeah, I have no idea what you're asking either, but going with the first poster's idea (what factors influence a homeschooler's curriculum choice), we decided not to use a curriculum when I was homeschooled. We took a more eclectic approach and chose all of our materials based on my abilities, learning style, and preferences. For example, I used textbooks for math and science, but after the first couple of years of homeschooling I decided that the history textbooks I got from the school district were pieces of junk barely fit to be door stoppers and settled on using good history books (a combination of factual and fictional) instead. <br>  <br>  We did try using part of a curriculum for English once, while we were searching for some good grammar books, but we put it aside quickly because it was way too religious for our tastes...and this was during the same time that I considered become a Catholic nun. Even our incredibly religious friends thought it was crazy. <br>  <br>  If I was going to choose a set curriculum for any child of mine, it would have to be secular and flexible with a good reputation for academic content. Given how tough it can be to find secular curricula, and how curricula tend to be the opposite of flexible, I think I would be better off designing my own study plan for my children.|`|LsAArkUyaa	Can you be more specific?<br>  Are you asking what influences a homeschooler's choice in curricula?<br>  If so, then the most important factors for us is that the curricula we use be secular, well rounded, and meet the learning style of the student.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	Over all, I choose secular products. Subject specifically, I look for fairly scripted programs for English, chronological history texts, science that will teach the scientific method rather than only content and real life focused maths.

LVZdzPmpaa	There are, as you know, many, many shades of the color yellow. To differentiate, some paint companies, clothing and decor catalogs and decorators draw on the world around us to better define the exact color.<br>  <br>  Butter is yellow, mustard is yellow and dairy cream has a yellow cast to it. Each of those "yellows" is different, however. We might have a better understanding of the exact shade if we attach another name to it, a name that people more readily understand.<br>  <br>  Instead of describing a shade of yellow as "dense and rich with orange undertones," we would do better to call it "daffodil." This allows people to bring up a memory picture and better understand what we're getting at. <br>  <br>  In the end, the terms you list mean different things to different people, and some of the terms will escape some people entirely. The naming system is not entirely effective.

AA10023710	Harvard, for example, specifically states that it recommends that applicants take, in high school (not including middle school and etc.), four years of the same foreign language. They specifically state this, as do a lot of the Ivys. <br>  <br>  Does that mean that you won't get in if you drop German now? Not at all. If your application is otherwise strong, you may still get in. It's a recommendation, not a requirement. <br>  <br>  But might dropping German put you at a disadvantage? It might. But if you replace German with something worthwhile, it could work. If, for example, dropping German allows you to take AP Physics, and your plan is to be an engineering major, then that's probably not a bad thing at all. If dropping German allows you to take extra music classes, and you love and adore music, and are in band, orchestra, private lessons, etc., then it can work even if you plan to major in English. But if you're dropping German just to drop it, then no, not such a good idea.|`|UYaWH7a0aa	You should check wiht the schools you're interested directly because while your state may only require a certain number of courses the schools you are interested in may require more.

AA10080614	Children often excel in things adults can't simply because we no longer have the time or concentration necessary.<br>  <br>  An example is video games, go through youtube for a minute and you'll see children beat the highest levels in guitar hero or DDR. Since their minds are young, they easily learn new steps and patterns and build upon them quickly.<br>  <br>  Also, children can be underestimated in how they take risks. Since they're young and heal easily, some children aren't afraid to go to the height of the monkey bars even though it's ten times their height. <br>  <br>  This topic isn't so hard if you look at it from the right angle. Good Luck.|`|273vsUezaa	Just some stuff off the top of my head:<br>  <br>  Cardio fitness - Kids tend to have a better muscle to weight ratio and can do things easier than some adults think (sports, hiking, running etc)<br>  <br>  Attention- Even though kids often can't focus on ONE thing as easily as an adult, I find that kids can do much better at noticing things as a whole. For instance, While playing Rock Band with my nephew, he can play the guitar on a song that he's never played before and still notice the expression on the Computer generated Drummer's face while also reading the words!<br>  <br>  And lastly, I think children's memory can be underestimated. I remember random things from when I was a kid. There's really no telling what a kid will or will not remember.  My nephew from above remembers a time when he was 2 years old when his Grammy farted. he remembers when he was 4 years old and he accidentally said Space noodle instead of Space Needle.|`|QCdpBqhHaa	Children are often unheard or underestimated because of the 'superiority' and ignorance among some (or most) adult human beings.  I think the underestimation of children is sOmewhat another form of  inequality that still lingers in this generation.  Just because they're children and are assumed to be too young to think properly, their thoughts or opinions don't matter to society.  That's life!

If your teacher just waved his/her hand and said<br>  "Do what ever, just make it look good" Then you have a lot of ideas to play with.<br>  <br>  I did this project last year on that book, and the year before, in fact.<br>  <br>  Last year I did journal entries, you know? Writing as if you were being held in a concentration camp?<br>  <br>  The year before that I did an artistic interpretation of the book. I did a collage of a whole bunch of really crazy pictures I found of the holocaust played with each one on photobucket, giving each of them a different finish then the last. And then I did a couple paragraphs explaining what it meant to me.|`|xH3uz3biaa	i haven't read the book but perhaps you could go to sites on the internet and copy some of the pics.  if they are not copyrighted, you can print them.  Crop them similar to a scrapbooker in dark colros like balcks and grays.  The cropped pictures on a small 12 x 12  or a 10 xx 13 frame you could get cheap from Walmart.  This would be a very beautiful collage that would depict the horrors of the holocaust.

lzEuuseJaa	Go to college. Even if it's community college. Check out courses at the college's websites, there are many classes that will help you make a decision on what type of business you'd like to get into. There might be a technical community college near you that can teach you a profession that you can turn into a business.<br>  <br>  Start thinking about it now, what do you like to do? What are you interested in? What intrigues you? You might take an extension course at a community college in something that interests you to see if it's something you'd want to make a career out of. <br>  <br>  You didn't say how long until you graduate. But right now and for the next year, maybe longer, it would not be a good time to start a business. You could have a wonderful idea, but it could fail just because of the economy. So spend some time in college, getting your skills ready for when the timing is right. <br>  <br>  Being your own boss comes with a lot of headaches! It's way harder than working for someone else and you are ALWAYS working! But it's very rewarding too!<br>  Good luck!

SIhxrxD3aa	Basically, it doesn't matter what you major in.  Pick something you enjoy.  Vet schools don't care what your actual major is, but they do have a specific list of courses you have to take before you apply.  These will include those biology, chemistry, and physics courses.  Most students major in either animal science or biology, because those majors overlap very well with the pre-vet courses.  Ultimately, though it doesn't matter as long as you take the pre-vet courses.|`|9VClLV1Vaa	Yes, you can still apply. Find a school with a good animal science/biology program.

Likewise, double punctuation is incorrect and unnecessary. <br>  <br>  Hello!<br>  <br>  In the online culture, too, these spaces become a real concern as they take up so much space on the servers and yet make no contribution to the text. <br>  <br>  Two spaces after a period used to be the accepted format. For several years now, only one space is standard after final punctuation. More than one space is considered an error.

IPS3hWweaa	I used to be really good in math, but instead of answering all the time, I'd only answer when the teacher called on me. I didn't want to give away that I knew the answer all the time, but after a while, classmates still noticed so by high school I had been partially labeled a nerd even though I had been working on avoiding it completely. I was okay at other subjects, but math came the easiest to me.|`|a7ciEFgvaa	In my opinion, instead of hiding it, just don't blab out so much.  You know the answer, instead of showing people that, listen to how they would answer things.  That way you're not flaunting how your smarter and they aren't, and whatnot.  You may not be really bragging, but to the less smart its annoying.  I'm a less smart and my brother, 5 years younger, is a braniac who flaunts it.  Instead, just be there without challenging people to feel the need to get the right answer or keep up with you.  If that doesn't make sense... I dunno, e-mail me.|`|AA10928079	Yes, I have. Many times, I would pretend to take a long/longer time figuring out something or solving a problem just so people wouldn't see I was smart.

As if saying, how did you do that?!|`|kz8WFm5eaa	I have done this many a times before. It's like your afraid of people thinking your kissing up to the teacher or your afraid of people thinking your just a big know it all.

There is absolutely no reason to remain quiet if you have the right answer.|`|2bkV73gpaa	I wouldn't say I was embarrassed, but I would try not to put my hand up to answer questions unless a few other hands went up as well.
2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Because your problems have been caused by medical issues, I would say that if the medical issues have since been resolved, there is a good chance that, given your high SAT score, some of your earlier grades may be reduced in importance.  However, if not, they may not want to take the good chance that this would happen again in college.  Ignoring that, your better chance is with USC, which is more likely to consider your freshman grades, than with UCLA, which is not.|`|eIQ5T2amaa	Wow! I think you could get in anywhere. Your academic record is great. Colleges will definitely understand your health problems. Besides that, most colleges look more at SAT scores and Senior GPA than anything. USC and UCLA are not Ivy League colleges (at least, not according to most people; I appologize if that is incorrect). Still, they are very good schools and probably hold very high standards for their students. But, I think with your success in Junior year and if you take the APs and have a high GPA Senior year, you should be good to go. Remember, though, you should probably apply to more than these schools just in case they don't accept you. I, for example, would love to go to Rice University. My SAT score is high (not as high as yours, but still good), I've taken several dual enrollment classes at the local college, and have made A's on them all. Still, I don't know if Rice will accept me. The best schools are hard to get into, but if you work hard and do your best you will probably make the cut. Good luck. Hope you can get into your dream school!|`|6od5lOFoaa	you'll be fine.

They both grow apples  but one has a better taste than the other - in my opinion, the heirloom are tastier, but depending on who you are and your tastes, you could choose either. <br>  <br>  I think the best way to convince doubters is my kids.  It's like that cliche, "You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar";  Nobody likes to be told they aren't as good as someone else.

It was very cool... really explained why homeschooling *isn't* something that should be debated.  Raising my children *my* way should obviously be allowed.  We don't force families to give up home gardening/cooking because mass options are available... why would anyone think they should be required to give up their *children*? <br>  <br>   Wish I had a clue where the full original story was... it said it so well!
MIqdsUdnaa	I don't hide it, but I don't necessarily bring it up of my own accord either.  I really love it, though, when people compliment me on my children's behavior and then ask me where they go to school, at which point I can proudly reply that they are, in fact, homeschooled.  Over the years, I've found ways to politely, but informatively, deal with the stereotypical questions.  I'll discuss it if someone is genuinely inquiring.  But if they're being rude or biased, I choose not to converse.|`|zhJOZhKEaa	At earlier ages I was more likely to answer for him... because I was worried about him being 'put on the spot'... but we never tried to hide it.

And then my mom would sometimes say oh it's easy to home school just call 1-800-D-U-M-B.  Don't ever do that to your kids cause I hated it.  Be proud of them.|`|kiD47XbTaa	To tell you the truth, when I first began homeschooling I was too embarrassed to tell anybody that I didn't go to a 'proper' school which was extremely silly, since I was in fact, learning more then the girls I went to school with. I used to try and avoid the subject of school when I met people, and when they started asking I made excuses up saying "Sorry, I'll be one sec, just going to the bathroom", and then when I would come back, they wouldn't remember the question. <br>  But now, I am the complete opposite, I am proud to say that I get homeschooled because I love it! I love the flexibility of it and i am not at all embarrassed about it. <br>  Even though sometimes it can get hard, I always try and stay on track and seriously, I believe its great experience for when I get into university. <br>  Plus, I know some awesome people who also get homeschooled. And even though most people classify homeschooled kids as 'weird', 'unsocial', 'freaky' blah blah blah, I entirely disagree with them. Homeschooled kids, I believe, are more intelligent and aware of their school work then normal school kids. <br>  I am proud to say that I get home-schooled!|`|8h5DyQvvaa	I used to try to make excuses but then i got smart and relized that homeschooling had improved my life in every way, so now i am proud to say i do homeschool.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	Well, let me put it this way...I don't go out of my way to tell people I was homeschooled, but I don't go out of my way to hide it either. I just don't see the point in bringing it up if it isn't relevant. For example, "Hi, I'm shiori_hime and I was homeschooled" strikes me as a funny way to introduce myself to someone, kind of along the lines of introducing myself and telling people I'm adopted or an only child. The thing is, there ARE stigmas attached to homeschooling whether we like it or not, and frankly I would rather have people evaluate me based on things like my personality or my accomplishments than on something I finished doing almost a decade ago. On the other hand, if mentioning that I was homeschooled suddenly becomes relevant (e.g. "Hey Shiori, what was your senior prom like?" "Oh, well, I was homeschooled so I didn't really have a senior prom, but my friends and I did have a little dance party-thing together") I have no problem mentioning it. People are usually curious and ask me questions, but I almost never get questions like "How did you learn to socialize" or "omg didn't you suffer academically" simply because by the time the Great Homeschooling Revelation is made, people usually know me well enough to know that those issues are irrelevant.
mGEwdQyvaa	"I'm socializing here/with you, aren't I?" <br>  <br>  I usually use this one when someone on the college campus I take a few classes on says it, or if it's said while I'm out and about with my friends (which ironically happens a lot)|`|CXgPkEPFaa	lol<br>  <br>  ok<br>  I was homeschooled for 7 years and fit the description of the very sheltered stereotype. Then I went to public school in 8th grade, and it took some adjusting but then I fit in my own little group.<br>  In public high school I am (daresay) well liked and cool.<br>  <br>  Personally I am alot happier being in school but I see how homeschool is a better option for some people. <br>  <br>  So don't go dissing public school kids. And don't go dissing homeschoolers. They're all different. There's jerks and losers in both.<br>  <br>  WWHHHY ALL THE JUDGING??!!??!?  <br>  <br>  TELL THAT PERSON TO GET A LIFE AND STOP THEIR JUDGING OF EVERYBODY|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	I tell 'em how it is.<br>  <br>  Social Bashing: "Home schoolers are recluse spiders!"<br>  <br>  My response: Home schoolers have just as much or even better, of a social life than public schoolers. They're not locked up in a zoo all day, while home schoolers can come and go as they please. They can go where they want, when they want.<br>  <br>  Public schoolers may be around a whole bunch of other kids all day, but it doesn't mean they have friends. Some kids' social lives at school is just bullying.<br>  <br>  <br>  Academics: "Home schoolers get barnyard education!"<br>  <br>  My response:<br>  <br>  Home schoolers get a better education. Know why? Because they're not exposed to distractions and bullying, so they can actually concentrate on school work.<br>  <br>  They can also learn at their own pace, as opposed to rushed public school days.<br>  <br>  Home schoolers have an IQ and GPA that is grades ahead of public schoolers.<br>  <br>  Stats show that home schoolers score higher than public schoolers on standardized testing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Behavioral Criticism: "Home schooling makes kids weird!"<br>  <br>  My response: Define "weird". You mean weird as in not being sheep? Weird as in not doing drugs, drinking, smoking, sex, etc.?<br>  <br>  Home schoolers are more mature, and more friendly than public schoolers, because they actually have morals, and a better personality.|`|a8IRxC4raa	I hear you.<br>  <br>  I simply don't get into these discussions.  I tell people that I support their right to educate their children in the manner that works best for their family, and I expect the same from them.  <br>  <br>  All the best.|`|MIqdsUdnaa	It's takes a great effort, on my part, to not reply in a rude or snarky way.  There are lots of things I'd love to say, but I don't.  People are so entrenched in their stereotypes, though.  While my daughter was in her ballet class yesterday, my other two children found quiet, out of the way places to play.  My little one had markers and a notebook, my older one had a box of Magnetix.  The ate a snack, put the wrappers in the trash and spent the remaining 30 minutes quietly keeping themselves busy. Meanwhile, most of the other siblings were tearing around yelling, climbing up on things, fighting and indulging in various unfavorable habits.  I overheard one of the other mothers remarking that my kids were not "normal".  Their behavior was "weird".  I burst out laughing.  She realized I had heard her.  I said that if the way her kids were acting was "normal", I'll take "weird" any day.   She chose that moment to ask, "well really, what about the social?".  Once again, I had a good laugh.  We only need to "school" in the mornings, so our afternoons are spent at field trips, workshops, sports, arts, park meetings, outings, visits, volunteering and so on.  My kids have more friends than they ever did in school and they're not afraid to be themselves.  They can like science without being a geek, sports without being a jock, ballet without being a princess and math without being a nerd.

Two pecks make a kenning (obsolete), and four pecks make a bushel.<br>  <br>  In Scotland, the peck was used as a dry measure until the introduction of imperial units as a result of the Weights and Measures Act of 1824. The peck was equal to about 9 litres (in the case of certain crops, such as wheat, peas, beans and meal) and about 13 litres (in the case of barley, oats and malt). A firlot was equal to 4 pecks and the peck was equal to 4 lippies or forpets.<br>  <br>  <br>  Conversions:<br>  1 imperial peck = 9.09218 litres <br>  1 U.S. peck = 8.80977 litres <br>  <br>  Just in case you were seeking a serious answer.  :)<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Maybe the joke WAS my serious answer, ding dong.|`|e0faada9a8147280b25584d40c598fb3aa	Peter Piper didn't pick any pecks of pickled peppers 'cause pickled peppers aren't pickled when they are picked.<br>  <br>  Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

With the first sentence I thought you were in trouble, but the essay does a good job of telling the story of why you're applying again and what you hope to achieve as a result of your time at SCAD.  It also persuades me that you're a hard worker with a definite goal and that you'd benefit from the education the school provides.<br>  <br>  The first sentence should say "This is the second time I have applied to SCAD..." since you will have already applied by the time they read this.<br>  <br>  Also get someone to proofread, for commas in particular.

Almost every organization outsources in some way. Typically, the function being outsourced is considered non-core to the business. An insurance company, for example, might outsource its janitorial and landscaping operations to firms that specialize in those types of work since they are not related to insurance or strategic to the business. The outside firms that are providing the outsourcing services are third-party providers, or as they are more commonly called, service providers.<br>  <br>  Currently, outsourcing takes many forms. Organizations still hire service providers to handle distinct business processes, such as benefits management. But some organizations outsource whole operations. The most common forms are information technology outsourcing (ITO) and business process outsourcing (BPO).<br>  <br>  Business process outsourcing encompasses call center outsourcing, human resources outsourcing (HRO), finance and accounting outsourcing, and claims processing outsourcing. These outsourcing deals involve multi-year contracts that can run into hundreds of millions of dollars. Frequently, the people performing the work internally for the client firm are transferred and become employees for the service provider. Dominant outsourcing service providers in the information technology outsourcing and business process outsourcing fields include IBM, EDS, CSC, HP, ACS, Accenture and Capgemini.<br>  <br>  The process of outsourcing generally encompasses four stages: 1) strategic thinking, to develop the organization's philosophy about the role of outsourcing in its activities; 2) evaluation and selection, to decide on the appropriate outsourcing projects and potential locations for the work to be done and service providers to do it; 3) contract development, to work out the legal, pricing and service level agreement (SLA) terms; and 4) outsourcing management or governance, to refine the ongoing working relationship between the client and outsourcing service providers.<br>  <br>  In all cases, outsourcing success depends on three factors: executive-level support in the client organization for the outsourcing mission; ample communication to affected employees; and the client's ability to manage its service providers. The outsourcing professionals in charge of the work on both the client and provider sides need a combination of skills in such areas as negotiation, communication, project management, the ability to understand the terms and conditions of the contracts and service level agreements (SLAs), and, above all, the willingness to be flexible as business needs change.<br>  <br>  The challenges of outsourcing become especially acute when the work is being done in a different country (offshored), since that involves language, cultural and time zone differences.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	Outsourcing is a form of subcontracting.<br>  <br>  I work for a number of companies that are not large enough to maintain in-house writers or editorial staffs.

Lots of company outsource jobs like custodial work and security to other local companies who will get the job done for less. <br>  <br>  That's the deal: the company which is actually performing the work that an employee formerly did (and was undoubtedly laid-off from) pays lower wages and fewer benefits. So they may offer the former employee his job back at half the wages it used to pay with no benefits.

s9tvr0DTaa	B<br>  <br>  In plate tectonics, a divergent boundary or divergent plate boundary (also known as a constructive boundary or an extensional boundary) is a linear feature that exists between two tectonic plates that are moving away from each other. These areas can form in the middle of continents but eventually form ocean basins. Divergent boundaries within continents initially produce rifts which produce rift valleys. If the rifting process stops, a failed rift results. Therefore, most active divergent plate boundaries are between oceanic plates and are often called mid-oceanic ridges. Divergent boundaries also form Volcanic Islands.
cMZEmpp0aa	I can't really answer your first question because I don't know much about education psychology. My guess is that your guess of possible career paths is right, though.<br>  <br>  Regarding your boyfriend, it sound to me like he is in a good position to move onto the Master's he wants. Basically, in my time of searching for graduate schools, I have found that they fall into three categories:<br>  <br>  1) Schools that will ONLY accept students with relevant undergrad degrees (e.g. you would have to have an undergrad degree in education or English to go into a program for teaching English as a second language)<br>  <br>  2) Schools that will give you a provisional acceptance if your undergrad work is in a different field than your proposed graduate work. Basically what that means is that you have to fulfill certain requirements before becoming a full, regular students. Requirements could include something like taking a few undergrad courses in your chosen graduate field, or taking certain specific graduate-level courses that may not be required of the other students. In both cases the goal would be to make sure you have the foundation you need to handle graduate-level work in that field.<br>  <br>  3) Schools that will accept anyone with a good academic record regardless of whether or not their undergraduate degree has anything to do with their proposed graduate work.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend should really check with the schools and departments he is interested in to see what they require. Departments are usually pretty happy to share their requirements with prospective students, so he shouldn't have a hard time getting that information from them.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	It depends on the program and the school.

LVZdzPmpaa	"Correlation" means that two things are related and that one causes another. A simple example: There is a direct correlation between winter and sledding accidents.<br>  <br>  Of course, in winter, people go sledding, which they do not do in warmer months. When more people are sledding, there are sledding accidents, which would not happen in summer. BUT this does not mean that winter directly CAUSES the accidents. The accidents are of course caused by carelessness, etc.<br>  <br>  Another: There is a correlation between the sale of ice cream and drownings.<br>  <br>  The correlation is due to the fact that the sale of ice cream increases in the summer. More people go swimming in the summer and sometimes there are drownings. But despite the fact that ice cream sales AND drownings rise in the summer, this does not mean that ice cream CAUSES people to drown.<br>  <br>  The fact that one thing correlates to another does not mean that it causes it. "Correlation does not imply causation."|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	It means that it is not a coincidence that two things are happening at the same time, but one does not necessarily cause the other. <br>  <br>  For instance, if somebody went to the doctor and took a test for some condition, like pregnancy, they would test for certain hormones in the blood. If they are elevated, the woman is likely pregnant, as there is a correlation between being pregnant and having these elevated hormones. <br>  <br>  The pregnancy caused the elevated hormones. But obviously the level of elevated hormones is not the cause of the pregnancy. <br>  <br>  There are plenty of diseases that can be diagnosed through unrelated blood markers. The test reveals just that the patient is high risk and should be monitored. ∠°)|`|NPtz1Y4Taa	Correlation does not imply causation is a phrase used in the sciences and the statistics to emphasize that correlation between two variables does not imply that one causes the other. Its negation, correlation proves causation, is a logical fallacy by which two events that occur together are claimed to have a cause-and-effect relationship. <br>  <br>  Some of the most common examples of the confusion between correlation and causation are to do with family life (many others are to do with health). Consider the following statements: <br>  <br>  (1) "Children raised by single parents do less well at school (and later in life)." The conclusion is supposed to be that parents should become and stay married. <br>  <br>  (2) "Children where the mother stays at home do better at school (and later in life)." The conclusion is supposed to be that mothers should stay at home. (Or occasionally, but rarely, that mothers and fathers should stay at home, but usually this kind of survey is just a crude attack on working mothers so fathers are never mentioned.) <br>  <br>  (3) "People who are married are happier than people who are not." The conclusion is supposed to be that everybody should be married (and in particular the government should force non-married people to subsidise married people via the tax system; note that normally other words are substituted for "happy" when the tax argument is made, but it amounts to the same thing). <br>  <br>  (4) "People who are married are more likely to divorce than people who are not." (Well, obviously married people are the only people who will ever divorce.) The conclusion is supposed to be that married people should pay more tax than non-married people because divorce (which occurs in a third of marriages) is costly to the government (because of the courts) and so should be paid for by the people who cause the expense. <br>  <br>  Actually, (4) is the only point which would never be discussed in the media, because it does not confirm the prejudices of the chattering classes, most of whom are married and most of whom assume they are more moral citizens as a result. And as it happens (4) has the only conclusion which has any merit (although whether people should be forced to pay more tax for undertaking dubious activities like marriage or rock climbing is not generally accepted, with smoking being the prime example of having to pay lots of tax in these circumstances).|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	It means that if 2 (or more) things are often seen together that a relationship may exist but it can't be proven to be a cause and effect type of relationship.<br>  <br>  example: higher rates of teen pregnancy in lower socioeconomic groups. This doesn't mean that poverty causes pregnancy. There can be other factors involved like: parents working and not keeping tabs on the teens, no $$ to buy birth control, etc. There are infinite possibilities for other factors.|`|nhQvToBXaa	Ok, I believe this refers to a logical fallacy called "post hoc ergo propter hoc" (don't bother trying to learn that, it basically means "after this therefore because of this").  <br>  <br>  What it is saying is this: <br>  Just because two things are related does not mean that one caused the other.  For example, just because aerosol hairspray is bad for the environment does not mean it caused global warming.|`|Ql6qFk85aa	A simple example is this:<br>  A rooster crows at sun up. Thus the rooster's crow is correlated to the sunrise.  Does this mean the rooster's crow was the cause of the sunrise?  Obviously, not. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps. :)

I pointed out that half of the work is mainly figuring out what I want to talk about, and once I'd got that sorted then it was easy to write and talk about.<br>  She wasn't exactly convinced by this, but I went on; I said I just had to think about a subject on which I could probably talk without difficulty for about 5 minutes. Even now, I can think of several topics that I have enough knowledge on to prattle about for 5 minutes; I could talk about computers and some medical conditions, life in general or even the weather.<br>  But I'm digressing. Getting back to the point, I said to my sister, "What do you want me to talk on?" and she didn't know. Well, that's a fine way to begin a monologue! I said that I couldn't talk on a topic when there wasn't a topic to talk about, because when that happens there's just silence or a little small talk about the weather and the aches Aunt Mabel has been having and how she won't see a doctor - that wouldn't even fill 1 minute, let alone a monologue.<br>  I told her again that I need a topic to talk about and said again that I can't just talk about monologues, and she said, "Isn't that what you've been doing?"|`|63d39edd821952e38c5dbce9762a0d7baa	The best thing is to read it out loud - or get someone else to.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	Have a look at Alan Bennett's Talking Heads series - and particulalry how a few well chosen words conjure up a whole life.|`|XJX48Bdvaa	When i've ever wrote a monologue i try to think of something quite dramatic thats happened to me, or my friends to write about.

There are significant Irish, French, Dutch and Spanish, German and Scandinavian influences left over from the age of colonization, not to mention later Asian influences too, but most of North America speaks English and governs with some basis in English common law.

ImQPqxEgaa	It is a document that regulates a firm's external activities and must be drawn up on the formation of a registered or incorporated firm. <br>  <br>  As the firm's charter it (together with the firm's articles of association) forms the firm's constitution. Also called 'memorandum,' it gives the firm's name, names of its members (shareholders) and number of shares held by them, and location of its registered office. <br>  <br>  It also states the firm's (1) objectives, (2) amount of authorized share capital, (3) whether liability of its members is limited by shares or by guaranty, and (4) what type of contracts the firm is allowed to enter into. <br>  <br>  Almost all of its provisions (except those mandated by corporate legislation) can be altered by the firm's members by following the prescribed procedures. The memorandum is a public document and may be inspected (normally on payment of a fee) by anyone, usually at the public office where it is lodged (such as the registrar of companies office). Called articles of incorporation in the US<br>  <br>  The unilateral aspect means that the terms of the memorandum (or charter) pertain to a contract in which the ***obligation rests on only one party**** (themselves and mentioned parties).

The NHIS National Center for Health Statistics reported in 2003 that in the US 43.3% of the population are smokers, 19.2% women and 24.1% men. Why are the numbers so high? The pressure and lack of education experienced by young teens are significant factors. When teens are pressured to use drugs they usually do not consider about how it will influence their future; they are more concerned about the opinions of their peers. If I were pressured to use tobacco, I would think about how is it going to affect my body, my life, and those who love and care about me?  How would I feel about those effects? If everyone considered these questions before succumbing to peer pressure, we would have this crisis off our shoulders.<br>  If we were to stop selling tobacco products, we would have less cancer, emphysema, and other health issues. Although we would be taking away money from tobacco companies and from the doctors who treat those suffering from tobacco-related illnesses, we would decrease the risk of losing lives. If we make all tobacco products against the law, then we have another drug that must be regulated by law enforcement, like crack/cocaine, marijuana, inhalants, ecstasy, methamphetamine (meth), LSD, and heroin. We would have more drug dealers and criminals, even though fewer lives would be at risk.  Is that a compromise we are willing to accept?<br>  The American Lung Association reports that almost 6,000 teens began smoking under the age of 18; 2,000 of those become regular smokers. (NOTE:  you need to state the year of these stats) If we were to make tobacco products illegal these high numbers would greatly decrease.  Wouldn’t that be nice? <br>  How do we get our teens out of the atmosphere of tobacco use? One, they should have a good environment at home: a place where there is time with family and parents that are in touch with their children’s lives. Two, they should have a safe environment at school. If the teachers know what the children are going through with friends, they could take preventative measures against tobacco use. Third, when teens are just out with their friends, they should feel okay saying “no” to their friends when tempted to use tobacco products.<br>  The health of the new generation is at risk, too. With secondhand smoke, children are being exposed to potentially deadly substances everywhere in their daily life. We have to stop this. How? We build treatment facilities to assist those who need help quitting.  We need to stop this addiction to nicotine. People are dying because they made wrong choice when they were young. Teenagers need to understand the dangers and consequences as well as what options they have when faced with peer or societal pressure.<br>  What if everyone had a goal in life, never to use or be around anyone who is using tobacco products? Our country would have one more thing off its list of troubles. I have a goal in life. It is NEVER to use or touch tobacco products. I will not even be around people who use tobacco, that way I will never have to worry about secondhand smoke, or being tempted to use tobacco. This country needs a change and this is one step I can take in the right direction.

2UDbOpxTaa	Yeah you definately have a chance. They tend to try and interview most people that apply. What are you hoping to apply for?<br>  <br>  My advice would be, don't focus on the extra-curricular stuff too much, rather try to get really into academic things. For example, of you're applying for English, try to read plenty of classic literature, and take a specialist part of it (a random example could be medieval poetry) and then pursue that - find out lots about it and perhaps ask your English teacher at school if you can do a lunchtime presentation on the subject or something. Then you would write on your personal statement that you're especialy interested in Medieval poetry, then try to engage in a conversation about that in your interview. They'll be extremely impressed at your independent research and enthusiasm.<br>  <br>  They are far more interested in your academic enthusiasm and potentials than in your extra-curricular activities/responsibilities.|`|7gpDLc6daa	If you get all As then you have a chance. Oxbridge are interested in extracurriculars (as all unis are) but you must relate how this is important to your studies in your personal statement. If you say how much you love history and then write a sentence saying "and once a week a volunteer at a girl guides group" then that doesn't show anything about your passion for history or academics so bear that in mind when your write about your hobbies - always relate everything you say back to why you want to study the subject at degree level. You must portray your passion for your chosen subject and show yourself to be an interesting person who has something to offer them.|`|7ec003bf8ae9c47625285990f7c9317caa	I doubt anyone could give you a straight answer, the only way you can find out is if you apply. go for it! :)|`|QXFn2YsEaa	go for it coz if you dont you'll neva no wether u would of got in or not

Mvblzfizaa	The advantages of the metric system is that everything is based on ten, hundreds, thousands etc. <br>  For example: 10 mm = 1 cm<br>                      10 cm = 1 dm<br>  and so on. It's much easier to remember than:<br>  12 inches = 1 foot<br>  3 feet = 1 yard<br>  and so on.<br>  <br>  I don't think the US does not use the metric system because they want to be original and they want to do their own thing, even though their own thing is 10 times as hard to remember as the metric system.<br>  <br>  I think the US should change to the metric system because the metric system is way easier and less confusing than whatever system we use now (sorry, I forget what it's called). If the US started using the metric system, we would have the same system of measurement all around the globe, so when Americans go to Europe, they won't be confusing Europeans with their own system.<br>  <br>  To get America to use the metric system, we should start using it instead of the American on (whatever it's called) and tell our friends to use it, too. Instead of 1 inch, we should say 2 1/2 centimeters. In school, I learned an easy way to measure in decimeters is by using the width of your palm, and you can measure centimeters by using the width of your pinky.|`|VSWl45cKaa	There is a humorous treatment of the subject here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/metric_system_vs_imperial_system" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/metric_system_vs...</a><br>  <br>  The US hasn't changed because of political reasons and a belief that the US system is the best. Going metric would be seen as having another system imposed on it from outside its borders. The fact that metric is easier and based on 10 does not matter. <br>  <br>  The fact that you see both systems on products in the US is a reflection of globalization of trade. Industry in the US does not have a problem labelling contents in both systems. <br>  <br>  For example, in Canada all large paint tins used to be an Imperial gallon and once Canad went metric, all paint can became 3.78 litres which is the same as a US gallon. Why? Because it is easier and more cost-effective to make one size of paint can for the North American market. <br>  <br>  It likely will not happen for reasons of cost and will certainly not happen anytime soon in the current economic climate.

When people talk about sports at colleges and universities, though, they are often talking about intercollegiate sports, and that is a different matter altogether.  For that, you have to have been put on the school's official team, and most of those players are specifically recruited  to come to the school to play on that school's team.  They get scholarships for this, but are required to play on the team, and don't just do it as a hobby.

In today's dynamic world as there is nothing certain around ourselves, but you still want to stay and raise up leaving behind all the impacts. This is what the typical mentality of an individual. So here you need to have a GUIDE in every step of your life, right from the childhood till your last breathe. Every one wants to gain success with very little effort (THE MANTRA OF TODAY'S GENERATION) .<br>  COACHING CLASSES ARE A TYPE OF GUIDENCE TO THE STUDENTS WHO COULD NOT SPEND THE QUALITY TIME TOWARDS THEIR EDUCATION DUE TO MANY PERSONNEL FACTORS. I BELEIVE THIS HAS BEEN A FACILITY TO THE ABOVE SAID CATEGORY OF PEOPLE. BUT THE CHARM OF GAINING KNOWLEGE FROM OUR SCHOOL, COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN REDUCING AS THE TIME PASSES. THE QUALITY WHICH WE COULD GET FROM OUR SCHOOL, COLLEGE & UNIV. CANNOT BE COMPARED WITH THAT OF COACHING CLASSES. AS THEY ARE FOR SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME. YES I WOULD SAY THE COACHING HAS BECOME A TREND FOR SOME AND ALSO NECESSITY FOR OTHERS. BEING IN THIS PROFESSION I WOULD SAY THE GAINING, SHARING AND SPREADING OF CORRECT KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST AIM OF EVERY PERSON, ESPECIALLY TEACHER'S LECTURER'S PROFESSOR'S........!

M8Bz0aYuaa	I agree wholeheartedly with TB and drip.  <br>  <br>  Times are tough for people of all races, creeds and colors, but that should not prevent you from getting an education if that is truly what you desire.<br>  <br>  Most people have the idea in mind that if they don't live on campus at a big, well-known university that they are not in "college."  Don't get it twisted.  English 101 is still worth 2-4 college credits, whether it's at Central Texas College or Texas Tech University.  There's nothing wrong with starting at a community college (where tuition is cheap and financial aid dollars stretch farther) getting an associate's degree and then transferring to a larger school to get your bachelor's degree.<br>  <br>  If nothing else, you have to complete the following steps, or you won't be getting an education at all:<br>  <br>  1.  Complete the FAFSA, <a href="http://fafsa.ed.gov" rel="nofollow">http://fafsa.ed.gov</a><br>  2.  Apply to at least 5 colleges, large or small, and get accepted somewhere<br>  3.  Research some scholarships<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Money is only a barrier if you allow it to be.  I worked my way through college, and I'm doing alright!  Best decision I ever made!|`|0WASp0bHaa	Many people of all races don't have extra money for college. You can start by going to a community college. Tuition is much cheaper  My son worked and took  CC classes while living at home. Then you can transfer to a four year college. An in state college will offer you a lower tuition, than an state college out of your state or a private college. <br>  <br>  But a  private college sometimes offers more scholarships. You are going to need to bring your GPA up in CC. <br>  <br>  Apply to several colleges. Fill out the FAFSA and see what kind of financial package you get. <br>  many students have to take out loans to get through. And all colleges have 100's of jobs right on campus. <br>  <br>  go to your local library. there are a lot of books out there on how to pay for college, scholarships, financial aid and grants and loans.|`|SDuR5VhCaa	talk to any counselor at school and teachers.|`|7ae938d47fa5ab107ff81fe42738c6a4aa	You need to do your research.  I assume you have access to a computer.  You should take a look at the websites of the colleges that you are interested in.  Email the Admissions Offices about entrance requirements.  Email the financial aid offices about applying for aid.  If not, start with your local community college.  Stop by and talk with an Admissions Counselor and a Financial Aid Counselor. You can always start with a Community College and then transfer to a bigger school.

rOOCJbEKaa	Students and parents who must deal with the high cost of a college education have available to them a wide range of student loans. This article offers details on three general types of student loans. Unlike other student loans, application for a specific Stafford Loan should be preceded by the filing of a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA application should be made in the name of the aspiring student.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.worldbestloans.com/student-loans.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldbestloans.com/student-lo...</a><br>  <br>  Like some other student loans, application for the Signature Loan permits the use of a co-signer. In fact, there is a real advantage to applying for a Signature Loan with a co-signer.

However, if your 2008 Federal Tax Return is much less, you should be able to file an income appeal which might qualify you for some grant assistance.|`|6gL4uRYHaa	I agree with the previous answer.

If he is annoyed at you, which he obviously was, he can yell at you, even in front of the class.  He can also call you something you don't prefer to be called (it might have been different if you could prove that he treated you one way because you were a girl and he treated the boys differently, but since he was fine with the other girl, that isn't an argument here).|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Well words are one thing but touching is another.

IWbFqtQ3aa	experience|`|FRfz2Tewaa	Work experience, paid or unpaid, helps develop knowledge for a future job that you may be interested in.  It helps you prepare for the career of your choice by enabling you to see all aspects of the job from the bottom, and see the opportunites that there are to advance your position for that company.<br>  <br>  Managers of a company will prepare you to be successful in the future by showing you the aspects of the company, and by the time your work experience is completed, you will have at least gained some good experience, and could very well maintain a a salary or maybe hourly position at that job, which would result in you being able to advance your way through the company -- you wouldn't have to re-train somewhere else if you liked where you do the work experience.

This transition wasted my whole academic year. But i dont regret it. Find your interests and then look for career opportunties in that category. THere are so many options that you will be overwhelmed. Maybe you just want to major in finance, be an artist, or be a forensic specialist. I overcame my situation after realizing that I could no longer waste my time and had to get an education no matter what. It depends on you whether you really want to learn or just get your degree.

It might make it easier to have a natural sciences major though, since the above requirements will be part of your major. If you have a different major, like economics, then you will likely have to take these classes as electives, in addition to all of the regular classes in your major.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you don't want to take a lot of classes in a major that you aren't really that interested in.<br>  <br>  So balance your own interests with the premed course requirements for the school you are interested in attending when choosing a college major.

Although strong demand for electrical devices—including electric power generators, wireless phone transmitters, high-density batteries, and navigation systems—should spur job growth, international competition and the use of engineering services performed in other countries will limit employment growth.

Although the use of information technology continues to expand rapidly, the manufacture of computer hardware is expected to be adversely affected by intense foreign competition.

EmvPIWUOaa	First, i salute you for taking the responsibility.  <br>  As harsh as it sounds, you should let her know that you are in charge now, dont let her push you around and there must be a consequence for being disobedient. Then in the same time, show her unconditional love, praise her for being good, spend alot of time with her and her interest. I am a fanatic to supernanny when it comes to educate little children.<br>  Dont worry to offend her in this difficult moment when it comes to discplining and to obey you, it will worth heaven in the long run.<br>  I have a 4 y.o. and i believe they can understand if you tell them the "hard" fact. You should tell her that mommy is not coming back for a reason that is easier for her to digest if the truth is too harsh for her. She may be upset for a while and traumatize, but eventually she will cope, just make sure you will be there for her. 4 y.o. is the age when my daughter start understanding and questioning death from being exposed to disney moving picture ie: lion king, snow-white, etc.<br>  Half of the truth of she is wanting her mommy is to avoid you disciplining her, you must show authority. They are smarter than you think, and now she is testing the water.<br>  Best of luck!|`|gyzMxjAiaa	You need to deal with the tremendous sadness and loss this child is facing before you worry too much about discipline. Of course she is angry! She needs to know, in terms she can understand, why Mommy left. Do not try and convince her that her mother is a bad person and doesn't love her, just explain why she is unable to care for her. For instance, if there were drugs involved tell her that mommy is sick and isn't able to help herself get better. She also needs reassurance that you are not going to desert her. As she feels more comfortable and is helped to work through the grieving process her behavior should improve. Don't let her do anything that endangers herself or others, or destroys property, but ignore the verbal abuse. Stay calm, reassure her that it is OK to miss Mommy, and that she is safe with you.You might want to consider some counseling for her if it is available.Whatever led up to the separation must have been pretty traumatic in itself.|`|2mTC4wVkaa	I think it is important to validate the 4 year old's feelings, by stating that you acknowledge and understand that she is missing her mommy.  Do not try to smooth things over by giving her unrealistic hope that maybe someday she will come for her.  Try and explain to her in terms that she can understand that it was not possible for her mom to continue taking care of her, but that this was not her fault.  At the same time she needs to feel reassured that you are there for the long haul, and that you will not ever abandon her or her sister.  You must let her know that there are clear consequences for all of the disobedient and defiant behaviors, and follow through each and every time.  You may have to take away a toy, or restrict the privledge of letting her do something she finds pleasurable.  Hopefully if you are absolutely consistent she will respord favorably.  You are to be commended for taking on such a tremendous responsibility.  Being consistent with home routines will also add to her feeling more secure.

0qJfXlURaa	Decoding almost always refers to printed words. In very simple terms, it is matching print to sound. Decoding means taking the letters in a printed word and making the appropriate sounds in order to generate the correct spoken word.|`|XfEiUAT6aa	Decoding is the ability to apply your knowledge of letter-sound relationships, including knowledge of letter patterns, to correctly pronounce written words. Understanding these relationships gives children the ability to recognize familiar words quickly and to figure out words they haven't seen before. Although children may sometimes figure out some of these relationships on their own, most children benefit from explicit instruction in this area. Phonics is one approach to reading instruction that teaches students the principles of letter-sound relationships, how to sound out words, and exceptions to the principles|`|i5tOQGgFaa	I, personally, tend to group that together.  However, in the resource book titled "Jump into Literacy" by Rae Pica she simply states that decoding is "understanding that letters represent something" (layman's definition, I guess).  :-)  So understanding that the letters each have a name and a sound and that we put those sounds/letters together to make a word.  I'd love to hear from you if you come across a spectactular definition because I too agree it's not really clear in many of our early literacy resources.  :-)|`|9quQNSp0aa	I know at the first grade level, we use the term decoding to describe  the relationship between the written letter and spoken sound.  I think that when most people refer to decoding, it means printed words.  But, really it could mean either.  The definition of decoding on dictionary.com says "to extract meaning from (spoken or written symbols)"  So really it could be either one.

AA10176626	Evs:<br>  <br>  Whether they call it the "preferred" deadline, or the more common "priority" deadline, the result is the same - this is the date that you want to have your financial aid application (and all supporting documentation) submitted by.<br>  <br>  Certain forms of financial aid are - for all extents and purposes - unlimited. The US Department of Education will award a Pell Grant and a Stafford loan to any applicant who qualifies. For these types of aid, the financial aid deadlines are irrelevant - which is a good thing, because these are the two largest federal financial aid programs.<br>  <br>  However - other forms of financial aid are NOT unlimited. Every year, the Department of Education allocates a certain amount of money to your school -- money that will allow the school to award those forms of aid to eligible students. For example, the school gets an annual allotment for Perkins Loans and FSEOG Grants. The government says to your school "here's this year's FSEOG grant money", and "here's this year's Perkins Loan funds".<br>  <br>  On priority deadline day, your school begins processing all of the financial aid applications that have been received. They take stock of everyone's application, and they rank order those applications in terms of financial aid need. They then begin dividing up the limited amounts of aid, trying to help the most needy students as much as they can.<br>  <br>  As you might imagine, the funds that come in limited supplies are pretty much exhausted in that first batch of aid awards. If your application is included in that batch, you will be considered for these limited forms of aid - if your application arrives later, you will only be considered for any remaining funds that your school still has available.<br>  <br>  As I said earlier - you'll get your Stafford loan offer, and a Pell Grant (if you qualify for a Pell Grant), regardless of when you submit your application. However, if you want to be considered for every possible form of financial aid, you MUST meet the priority aid deadline every single year. Don't forget - financial aid application is an annual process - it's not once-and-forget-it. You must complete a new FAFSA every single year that you want to apply for aid - and you must meet the school's priority aid deadline every year, too.<br>  <br>  If your school says that March 1st is the "preferred deadline" to submit your FAFSA to the federal processor, that means that you would be doing yourself a huge favor if you made certain that your FAFSA was completed and submitted to the US Department of Education on or before March 1st. You can still submit your FAFSA any time after that date, but your school is warning you that they are unlikely to receive the results from your processed FAFSA in time to consider you for the full range of financial aid programs.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you - I hope this helped.|`|8IHfytEvaa	It means that everyone who meets the deadline gets the first shot at financial aid.<br>  <br>  The university will look at all student's applications ( who have met the deadline ) and decide how much aid goes to who equally without regard to when they filed, as long as they met the deadline.<br>  <br>  There is no preference given to those who filed on Jan 15 or Feb 15 or Feb 28.<br>  <br>  If a school has $15 Million in aid available and all those who met the deadline qualify for $20 Million in aid, means they will award those students 75% of their need.  In other words they will equally divide up the pie.<br>  <br>  Those who apply on March 2nd are told, there are no funds left, sorry.<br>  <br>  Now let's say all the students who met the dead line qualify for $18 Million in aid.  Those get 100% of the need met and those who students who did not meet the deadline have $2 Million in leftover aid which will be awarded on a first come first applied for basis.<br>  <br>  If you are the child of a Baptist Pastor, a Baptist University might still give you a preference anyway.<br>  <br>  Colleges and Universities are free to give preferences to any class of students they want to.<br>  <br>  Religious schools often give preference to the children of that denomination's Pastors.<br>  <br>  Some schools give preference to Veterans who have come home from the War.<br>  <br>  This happened right after WW 2 and it happened to me when I came home from the Vietnam War and its happening today as well.<br>  <br>  The best source of information for questions like this are to call the Financial Aid office of the school you plan to attend.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  You and your parents don't have to file your taxes before you submit your FASFA but you do need to prepare at least a first draft of your tax returns first.<br>  <br>  If the numbers change on the tax return you or your parents file from numbers you submitted on your FASFA, you should then file an Amended FASFA.<br>  <br>  However its best that you file by the deadline even if your taxes aren't done.  Use the best guess for the numbers you believe will be on your tax forms, then amend them later.<br>  <br>  Missing the deadline might mean the difference between getting a grant which you don't have to pay back instead of getting loan which you will one day have to pay back.|`|fDj2uZxUaa	I don't really know what that means, but usually you file your FAFSA yourself after you have filed your taxes. You can do this online. You have to put in the school code.The sooner you file the more likely you'll recieve aid.

You will also need to go to interviews and do a standardised entrance examination (such as UKCAT/BMAT).<br>  <br>  Entrance requirements commonly included: A Level Chemistry and at least AS Level Biology. You need at least 3 subjects at A Level and need to obtain around ABB-AAA. You will need to look at specific medical schools to see what their requirements are.<br>  <br>  After graduating as a doctor (which takes about 5yrs) you will need to work as a Foundation House Officer for 2 years, where you will experience the different specialities of medicine and also learn a lot. After this you apply for a Speciality Registrar in Psychiatry post. If accepted you will be involved in this specialist training for about 6yrs during which you must pass examination for Membership of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.

ayMYfxcfaa	I'll call the number of sides in each of the shapes "n", and I'll call the distance from the center of the shape to the middle of a side, "x".<br>  <br>  It sounds like you're dividing each of the regular polygons into triangles (with a base of length 1000/n).  After finding the area of one triangle, you times that by n to find the area of the whole polygon.<br>  <br>  For the circle and square, we don't need this process because there are other ways we use to finding area of those shapes.  For example, since you know the side length of the square, we find the area by simply squaring the side length.  The side of the 4 sided shape is 1000/4, or 250, and so the area is 250*250 = 62500.  Using the triangle method, we'll get the same answer.<br>  <br>  After dividing the n-gons into n isosceles triangles, we further divide those triangles into two congruent right triangles. One leg of the right triangle is length x and the other is half the polygon's side length (or [1000/n]/2 which is the same as 500/n).  The vertex angle of the isosceles triangle was 360/n degrees, so half that (which is 180/n degrees) is an angle in the right triangle.  <br>  <br>  To find x, use the fact that <br>  <br>  tan(180/n) = (500n)/x<br>  <br>  and solve.  Once you have x, use the fact that it is the "height" of those isosceles triangles we had in the first place.  We already know the base length.  Recall that the area of a triangle is half of the base times height, and that we had n isosceles triangles in the n-gon to begin with.<br>  <br>  I think some of the answers you have look good (the square) or close to what I got, the differences could be from rounding, but I would recommend going over them again because some look far off (maybe a decimal place?), which you noticed, too.

The film, which released globally on January 26, 2006, was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2006 BAFTA Awards. The film was also India's official entry for the Golden Globe Awards and the Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category, though it was not nominated for either ceremony. A. R.

hVKYVJ89aa	Bed hair is when you wake up in bed in the morning with messy hair, like surf hair.|`|Iunl1aBuaa	Are you sure it didn't say "bed head"  It's how one's hair looks all crazy in the morning or after sex|`|ukjxFnqDaa	this is a derogatary term used against the people of bread.  This is a very hollow planet and the iniginous peoples dislike foreigners commenting about their loaf-shaped head. Their history is very long and involves many civil wars and political controversies.  They are a culturally diverse people with many 'tribes' within which roughly 12,000 people would live.....<br>  Sorry, i just realised my error........oh.....|`|roE7xTgVaa	bead means a stone.wen he said her bead headed it he was calling her a fool|`|nBaRuZ5xaa	its called "bed head"<br>  it means when u wake up your hair is maybe flat on one side from sleeping on ur side or your hair is just crazy looking when u wake up.<br>  does this help?
Ne9rXERpaa	That really depends on what part of the gaming industry you want to get involved in.<br>  <br>  Check around at your local university -- a lot of them are offering degree programs in computer game design; and they'll generally have different specializations you can choose from, whether art, animation, programming, or whatever.<br>  <br>  At the very least, you should take courses in level design, 2D and 3D art programs (Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya), and maybe some courses in Flash and web design for online games.  I'd also recommend some basic courses in C++ programming, just to get a grounding in how programming works in general.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	I'm thinking IT?|`|6W7nJYskaa	I only know of one course for game designers and that's one run by the Tipperary Institute here in Ireland. <br>  <br>  Google it and you will get more information. I am certain there are others, that's just the only one I have come across :-)|`|xh2ZOL2Gaa	Geekography

Nin6IawVaa	Are you in America?<br>  <br>  Your financial status has changed. Your son should show himself independent and apply for financial aid. Tell him to go to F.Aid office and pick up an application. He shouldn't include you guys in teh application. Even if he is living at home, he can say he is paying you guys rent. If he goes to full time school, he can get approved. If he gets denied from grant money, they automatically, give him stafford loans. But tell him to apply for F.Aid each year, yuou never know...he might get free money. Tell him to get good grades.|`|lw7ydpndaa	why dont you contact the college and see if you can work something out. I think If you can explain your financial difficulties then maybe you can get some type of relief or even they can give you sometime.|`|gc6uS1sMaa	Call the financial aid office. They may have emergency aid, and should have advice. I've never heard of anyone getting kicked out midsemester for not paying tuition, but I have heard of students not being able to register/ send transcripts until the school is payed in full. Thus, he can't apply anywhere else until the school receives his $$.<br>  <br>  Your son may not be eligible credit wise for a private loan, but there are government loans he should be able to get if he hasn't already. <br>  <br>  It's nearly impossible to get independent status these days if your son is is under 24.  It doesn't matter if he pays you rent/ his own taxes. Independent status can be determined here: <a href="http://www.fafsaonline.com/fafsa-blog/2007/05/18/dependent-vs-independent-status/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fafsaonline.com/fafsa-blog/20...</a>|`|t4DP30r6aa	Are you paying the school directly or a paying a parent plus loan? If you are paying the school directly, he will not get kicked out. He just will not be able to register for the next semester until the bill is paid. If you are paying a loan, they have no power on your son's education. They can report poor credit, report you personally to collections etc but whichever bank you got the loan from cannot call up the college and tell them to kick your son out of classes.|`|AxK0PWxEaa	this is an era of economic crunch and alot of people are facing hard times as well..i think you should try and apply for a scholarship for him or if you can move to a country you can afford. Africa is a very good place to go to especially Nigeria, people do not know this but Nigeria is the best place to be in this period of crunch. you can invest big time there and make a fortune and your child can attend american schools there in Nigeria.this may not be the best option for u but think about it intently. You dont need much to live a good life in Nigeria.|`|IcwE3T57aa	tell him to get a job,There alot of kids paying for their own school.not everyone is lucky to go to school you should more be lucky he has no illness and his salvation. what can school do for you if you spend eternity in hell,you didn't ask for this answer but im telling it anyway this economy is so bad and people without jobs and homes from crooked banks why dont you give to the poor and worry about more important problems in the world before karma hits.For kids to go to school both parents should work that is if the woman is not lazy .In 2009 both should work and if you have good job then pay for school if you cant afford it then you should not be in school if he lives in france school is free but in reality people need to start caring about real problems ..war..death...the economy..dead soldiers..no jobs...if you didn't like my comment .. dont put your question on the web....you will get a answer even if you don't want it and don't like it.The truth is alot of people only care about themselves faithless people building a home with no god and one day they will die and it wont matter what they have and where they are. and you cant take it with you no matter where you think you are going.If you want money for school?Give to the needy give to the poor and you will get double back ,give to the church,School is only good if you are becoming a doctor or a lawyer or medical field or something important ,most kids go to school to screw around and don't become anything that's why there is 70percent rape in school and drinking,and school is anti god there teach evolution ,go to bible college.. become something.but if he just wants to go to school he wont become nothing most billionaires or corps i talk deal with wont hire a kid  out of school..as they say  big deal.... he knows how to read..and he can go to school..but has no experience in anything..most my friends who have masters lol are poor and cant get a job...BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO EXPERIENCE only in books..all businesses hire people with experience in WORK or the y went to school for what we are hiring.80 percent of college kids don't get a real job out of schhol..what are they going to apply for school work?lol  i dont hire anyone with book knowlege i need experience in the field i am hiring for.He needs to find out now what he wants to do for his life and start preparing for it and make it happen! and go to school for exactly what he wants to be, trading school,computers..police...lawyer....dr.... need to know no ones hiring a person out of school because they graduated from school!And im with employment agencies and business owners... We have about 60 today come in with masters degree..they get pushed at the bottom or thrown in the trash.....if you want to debate and say atleast hes getting a education! is he really? and if so good he will have a degree in books and have no job.you wont get a job when you  there will be 100 people over you looking for a job and ones with experience in that job will get hired..and as they say big deal you have knowledge in books and experience in school and partying and you read.FOOD FOR THOUGHT and fact! Banks and school are cracking down op people who cant pay their fees and looking to put leins on homes.If you do have God and are a real christian meaning a relationship with jesus..then have faith and let god do it..if it dont work out IT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE!! ceo-employmentagency   THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE ......AND NOT RIGHT NOW...FOR THE FUTURE HE VERY NEAR WE GROW OLD FAST ADN A SHORT LIFE . most people die at any age so its time for him to look what he wants to do now and do it real quick before all the jobs are gone,and be in a field where you will always have a job,hospitals are closing businesses are closing its part of end times anyway soon no food .The people who survive or the rich so what do they need..look at that..computers ..repair....house builder..wiring...mechanics..plumbing...... reality sucks..and we need to give our kids the truth.Even if it is not what they want...its better to have your own business,if he has a talent?then do a business he puts his talent in on the web or for the public.THE END wouldnt be fair if you cant pay for school and they drag you in court and you loose something like your house or yoru only car and he wont be in college and no place to live  or drive....just think it out.Besides that if he becomes one of those things i suggested he can rank his prices up he will make alot of money.no skill means no job
