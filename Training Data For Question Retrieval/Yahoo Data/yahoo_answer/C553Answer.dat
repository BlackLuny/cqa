GAHFiIqSaa	Your symptoms indicate a spiritual presence (a ghost). The rapid beating and twitches (called hypnic jerks) are caused by a spirit trying to get your attention. Also, anxiety symptoms are typical of people who are having encounters with spirits. The psychology (thoughts and feelings) of such is imparted by the associated spirit.<br>  <br>  Now the interesting part. When an individual has such spiritual interactions about the head, it is indicative of sainthood. Just think about the art you have seen depicting the saints and their halos. The halo represents the Holy Spirit, which is the entity you are experiencing. When you feel lightheaded, you are feeling this spirit.<br>  <br>  As evidence, when you next experience your symptoms try to communicate with it. How one talks to oneself, in the mind, is how one communicates with a spirit. Start by thinking, "I feel you, can you hear me." You will hear its responses in your mind - telepathically - as if you thought them.

LrGmpacOaa	When you feel the relationship is heading in a sexual direction, sit down and say, "I'd like to let you know something about me, because I care about your safety and health and I want you to be informed."<br>  <br>  And then tell him. And tell him what you're doing to prevent spreading it (condoms are a must, avoiding sexy during outbreaks is a must, and medication helps a lot too).<br>  <br>  You can't control his reaction, but if he's worth your time in the first place, he won't freak out. And if he does, well, good riddance.<br>  <br>  I dated a man with herpes for a short while, and I was so glad when he told me. It showed that he was an honest guy and that he cared. I never wound up having sex with him (distance reasons, had nothing to do with him having herpes), but I was still glad he told me.|`|ZqGlQTFDaa	The stats are 1 in 5 sexually active men have herpes and 1 in 4 sexually active women have it. Females have a higher % of having it simply because of biology. <br>  <br>  I think most people are so ignorant about herpes. I find it interesting that 80% of Americans have the HSV-1 virus. They get it as children by kissing an adult. Most people call them "cold sores" but they are really Herpes 1 virus. Most cases of genital herpes are HSV 2, but from oral sex HSV -1 and HSV 2 can still transmit to their less-desired area. Interestingly, HSV-1 will have a much harder time adapting to the genital area. Did you ever see what type you were? if you are HSV 1 then you should have less outbreaks.<br>  <br>  but the fascinating thing is that HSV 1 and HSV 2 are really the same virus under the microscope. The only difference is their sits of preference. HSV 1 loves the face and HSV 2 loves the genitals....<br>  <br>  I think if you explained that all to your partner. they would understand...It's just a social stigma. People are igorant. They think herpes is a horrible disease but its really n ot. It doesn tcause health problems...just sore sonce in a while....and valtrex can lessen the breakouts severely.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|kprKXEOSaa	Well, yes, you might get rejected because of it.

qnD5RfbPaa	Whenever your room is freshly painted, it is recommended that you allow your room to air properly before attempting to sleep in it - over 24 hours is what is recommended.  However if you must sleep in that room you should leave at least a window open and also have a container - a face basin, plastic bath, or something with considerable amount of water (2 to 4 quarts of water) left open in the room.  This will help to absorb some of the toxins of the paint.  You can do that every night until the scent is completely gone.|`|yezbmlaKaa	Is it possible for you to open a window and keep it aired out while you sleep? It would be best if you could keep a window open and a door open in the room to keep it airing out, however, you'll be fine sleeping there either way (you just might wake up with a massive headache).

It has helped me a lot and hope it will help you too.|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the information and weblinks for social anxiety/shyness, and self confidence, in sections 9, and 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as If." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior. (I PRETEND that I'm an ACTOR, PLAYING a PART).<br>  Research shows that when you "act as if" continually, your image of yourself begins to conform to your new behavior. In this case, you will gain self-esteem and self-confidence, and begin to see yourself as socially normal, not shy. You will become more socially successful, and this will motivate you to continue your new social behavior until it becomes a habit. Try this for a month, in every situation you can. I am confident that you will become much more comfortable and outgoing.<br>  <br>  One form of therapy is to go somewhere that nobody knows you, and deliberately make an utter fool of yourself: put on a paper hat, and yell out: "I'm queen/king of America!", or something else ridiculous, (make up your own - have some fun, safely) then get back in the taxi, (warn the driver of your intentions, first) or car, and leave. People will point, and say: "Look at that idiot". But, you may not be up to the stage where you can do that, yet (I can, and I used to be shy). Or, preferably in the company of a friend, or family member, on a different train, or bus route to your regular one, call out the names, or numbers of all the stops. It will teach you that, although it isn't actually pleasant, (EXPECT MODERATE DISCOMFORT) you will survive; be stronger for the experience, and the next time (should you need to repeat this type of therapy) will be considerably easier. Remember: "A fear avoided is a fear strengthened; a fear faced is a fear reduced." Regard it as your final test: once you have accomplished it, the barrier will be broken; just don't go too far, the other way! Learn to laugh at yourself, and give a big, cheesy grin when others see you do something foolish, as we all do, occasionally.<br>  <br>  It is endearing, if you don't do it too often. Use positive affirmations: for example: "I am very likable and other people feel comfortable around me". Write down all of your self limiting beliefs; then write down the positive counter of them, (exact opposite) and repeat them and imprint them into your mind. Most importantly: Force yourself to approach somebody and initiate some sort of communication. Start out small by asking the time and directions and gradually go bigger. Although there are anti-anxiety medications (anxiolytics) available, these come with risks, and the possibility of side effects, habituation, even addiction, and withdrawal problems, and are unsuitable for young people. <br>  <br>  Try having a cup of "Tension Tamer", herbal tea, by Celestial Seasonings, (from supermarket tea, or health food aisles) or make some at home, and cool, then bottle, and drink as needed (I find it so strong tasting, that I need to drink it quickly, followed by something like fruit juice, to take away the taste, but others may find it more tolerable). C(h)amomile tea is a more palatable option. As with all herbal/green teas, use lemon/lime, and/or a little sweetener (NOT ARTIFICIAL!!!) but no cream, or milk. Xylitol, or Stevia is preferable, (health food stores) or fruit sugar (fructose, such as "Fruisana", from supermarket sugar aisles).

CJvHQl5vaa	I think 5 years old is too early to diagnose her for sure with ADD.  I highly discourage you from putting her on medication just yet.  I think the best thing you can do for her is to put her in activities that will help increase her attention span and concentration, like Yoga and Meditation, both of which they offer for children her age.<br>  <br>  I also recommend that you look very seriously into food allergies being the cause of her attention deprived behavior.  Food allergies ranging from being allergic to wheat to reacting to the red food dye that is in much processed food could be contributing to her behavior.  Sugar itself can be suspect.  Do some reading and some research, there is a ton of info out there about the correlation between what one eats and ADD.  I know a couple of kids who suddenly stopped having ADD symptoms when their parents stopped giving them the food that was triggering their problems, in one case it was artificial color and wheat, and in another case it was sugar.<br>  <br>  My husband and I are both ADD with no hyperactivity.  My husband still uses medication to manage his ADD, but for personal reasons I have had to go off of most of my medication, and when I don't drink coffee or eat sugary processed crap I have much better control over my attention span.  If I slip, I can honestly end up wasting the day just by eating food that isn't healthy for me.  I would emphasize fruits, veggies, some whole grains, dairy and protein.  It might be a good time for the whole family to kick any soda/processed cereal/candy etc habit that y'all might have for the sake of your kiddo, and your over-all health.|`|AA11256693	There are behavioral exercises that you can do and nutritional therapies also.  But, coming from an adult who deals with this, she will probably always be more prone to drift off into her own world and have more trouble finishing tasks. <br>  My family gets mad at me and accuses me all the time of "not listening", but there isn't much I can do about it. If they take the time to make sure my attention isn't spit, it helps a lot. LOL, I just can't absorb people talking if I'm sitting in front of the TV, aquarium, computer, or there is music going. Make and keep eye contact with her if you want her to absorb what you are saying.<br>  And above all be nice about it - few things are more frustrating than having people furious at you for something you cannot help.<br>  Drugs really don't help with this and can screw up the rest of your health in the effort.|`|9qfX3d5Caa	I have ADD, but i am not hyperactive. Im fourteen years old, so there might be some difference here, but when i take my meds im more "under control" than without them, because the medicine ussaully helps with attention problems, and not just hyperactivity|`|mERvGxb0aa	I have ADD and when i was on medication, i was just so depressed and suicidal. So i wouldn't suggest giving her anything, even though it affects people differently. I wouldn't take the chance though.  In school i just get cut down on tests.|`|VSYhHiOeaa	Medications that treat ADD and ADHD are antihypertensives. They could potentially be dangerous, as they lower blood pressure. I wouldn't give her anything if it isn't needed.
NhF9sM5jaa	Encourage her to open up about it to you on her own terms. Tell her that as her friend, you care about her so much that you don't want to see anything happen to her. Ask her why she is doing it, and if it is because she wants to lose weight, offer to go walking or jogging with her. If it is because of something that is bother her in her life, try offering suggestions to eliminate the stress.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you both<br>  I know how hard this is first hand as someone who has been on both ends
lTxeGDfgaa	It's possible.  <br>  Just do a LOT of situps.  Try doing like 20 early in the day and 40 or so later in the day, or even more.  <br>  Crunches.  <br>  Pushups and pullups will work your arms more too if you want the whole upper area to be toned.
UhscXgbvaa	i think there isnt because muscle feeds off of fat. so if you have more muscle and then you do cardio, you wont lose fat quicker or more of it. but if you do weight training, the muscle will feed off of the fat thats left after cardio. and the more muscle you have, the more fat you burn.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	Both my husband and I had different personal trainers.  My trainer had me doing cardio before weights.  Hubby's trainer did the opposite.  <br>  <br>  I don't think it matters...just personal preference.  Maybe you can mix it up day by day.|`|AA11070360	after. for many reasons it;s best, specially to loose weight. and when doing cardio constantly vary your speed, kinda like what spinning classes do, constant variation of speed actually increases the amount of fat your burning. even when your slowing down your burning more than if you stay at a constant speed.|`|Tb4RW8LLaa	it doesnt really matter. either way works. you should defiantly try Guarana, its a new weight loss supplement that will boost your metabolism and suppress your appetite along with giving you energy throughout the day, I have been using it for the past 2 months and have already lost 23 lbs.! check it out at <a href="http://www.tomsgrantblog.com/weightloss" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomsgrantblog.com/weightloss</a>|`|efce1e1b217dc87e814781a424a53829aa	before....always before|`|qfSKgxDsaa	ya do cardio first because it gets your muscles ready|`|XHUxW8p6aa	Cardio after-- your muscles take so much oxygen to lift, you can use what is left to run or exercise

And celery is GREAT... eating it burns more calories than the celery had to begin with!!  Don't eat much peanut butter either it has lottts of calories.<br>  <br>  Yoga is great, 10 minutes of it will burn 50 calories and you will feel really good too.<br>  <br>  <br>  Do not change too swiftly, I mean, don't start running miles per day and living strictly on celery, introduce changes gradually, it's much healthier.  Just write yourself a plan on how to:  Lower calorie intake, and increase activity.  Tell yourself new things you have to do each day and just DO them.  Stop drinking soda and drink LOOOTTTS of water.  Going on a flush is actually very healthy so you could do that!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!!!|`|3BYKloQgaa	Here's basically what I abide by to lose and maintain my weight in a healthy range. I've always had a tendency to gain weight very easily and although it takes forever to lose it, it's definitely worth it. I hope this tips help you in your trip!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #1. Eat specific foods. A number of food additives, like spices, can help to speed up your metabolism by creating a thermodynamic burn that has been shown to last a few hours after you eat. <br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #2. Time your meals. The majority of your calories should be earlier in the day. Your meals should contain less total calories as the day goes on. Try to eat little or preferably nothing at all after your evening meal. Don't skip any meals. You should be eating 4 - 6 meals each day. <br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #3. Make sure you eat enough. One of the biggest mistakes people make when trying to lose weight is they don't eat enough. <br>  If you don't consume the proper amount of calories you will send your body into what is known as a survival mode. This happens when your body does not have enough calories, so it conserves energy to prepare for possible starvation.<br>  On the opposite side of this, is if you eat too many calories the excess will be stored as fat. You need to exercise in order to burn more calories than you eat. Therefore, moderation is the key when it comes to calorie intake.<br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #4. Increase your daily activities. To prevent fat storage and to drop any excess that you might be carrying you must increase your daily activities.<br>  This needs to include weight training and cardiovascular training. The more calories you burn, the faster you will lose weight. It's that simple. An increase in lean muscle mass results in a dramatic increase in fat burning.<br>  One more thing try to exercise first thing in the morning. Research has shown that you can dramatically increase your fat burning ability if you exercise after a fasted state. Meaning just after you wake up. <br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #5. Do weight lifting before doing any cardiovascular work. The only exception of course is to perform 5 - 10 minutes of cardio before your weight training in order to warm up your muscles.<br>  This is important because you need the energy in your muscles for weight training. By the time your weight training session is complete you will have used up all of your preferred energy sources. <br>  This means that you will actually be burning fat cells during your cardio session.<br>  Here's what happens if you do this in reverse.<br>  First, you will only be burning carbohydrate sources of energy during your cardiovascular workout. No fat cells will be used up for energy. Next, you will not have the energy in your muscles in order to get the most out of your weight training.<br>  You will not be able to increase your lean muscle, which is very important if you want to lose your excess weight.<br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #6. Change up your exercise routine on a regular basis. For the most part you should change some aspect of your workout every 2 - 3 weeks. This can be anything from the number of reps or sets per exercise. The exercise order you perform and the exercises themselves. <br>  If you do the same thing week after week, month after month your body will start to get used to what you're doing to it and will eventually stop making changes. You will also stop adding any more lean muscle.<br>  The more muscle you have the more calories you will burn even when at rest. <br>  <br>  Fast weight loss tips: #7. Meal combinations. Always eat protein / carbohydrate meals earlier in the day. Eat protein / fat combination meals (meaning little to no carbohydrates) in the late afternoon and evening. <br>  The only exception is if you normally exercise in the evening. Then your first meal after your workout should consist of protein and carbohydrates. <br>  Never eat carbohydrates and fat together in the same meal. <br>  With these seven fast weight loss tips you will speed up metabolism and burn excess body fat at a much faster rate.|`|Tb4RW8LLaa	30-45 minutes of cardio a day, also try eating more often with small amounts. if you want to see faster results you should defiantly try Guarana, its a new weight loss supplement that will boost your metabolism and suppress your appetite along with giving you energy throughout the day, I have been using it for the past 2 months and have already lost 23 lbs.! check it out at <a href="http://www.tomsgrantblog.com/weightloss" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomsgrantblog.com/weightloss</a>

AA11048920	The diseases that mimic multiple sclerosis include but are not limited to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, systemic lupus erthematosus, Sjogren's Syndrome, myasthenia gravis, sarcoidosis, lyme disease, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1, central nervous system angitis, dual arteriovenous fistulas, fibromyalgia, B12 deficiency, ALS, Bechets, and Arnold-Chiari deformity.<br>  <br>  <br>  The fact that all the tests you took came back negative doesn't mean a darn thing. First off, there is absolutely no definitve test for diagnosing MS.  Secondly, the majority of  cases of MS are   relapsing /remitting meaning that the disease comes and goes. You could have had an attack of MS that left those lesions. If so, it may take months, years or even decades for the disease to come back and leave more lesions so the doctor can make a positive diagnosis. Thirdly, if you have MS, it takes time for the lesions to appear and for the organic matter in the spinal fluid to show up. Fourth, there is an almost limitless list of reasons that lesions can form. <br>  As a consequence of all of the above, MS is a very difficult disease to diagnose. <br>  <br>  One of the best things that you can do for yourself is to go to an MS website yourself and do some reseach. The best one to go to is the National Multiple Sclerosis Society website at NMSS.ORG. Secondly, try typing "diseases that mimiic MS" into your web browser. Once you do that you will find the symptoms of many of the diseases I mentioned. You can even rule some of them out yourself. Others only a doctor can rule out. Educating yourself makes you far more capable of advocating for yourself.|`|SsfnitjXaa	I thought lesions were a positive diagnoses.  My problem turned out being drinking diet pop with artificial sweetener aspartame.  Are you drinking diet pop?  I also started making sure I get 8 hours of sleep a night.  Good Luck.  I hear new meds are coming soon for MS.
fqVxw8HMaa	for a diet you don't drink lemon juice you just eat healthier and a little less. keep away from that lemon juice.|`|houhW71Waa	PLJ is not the Lemon juice Bina Khan recommends, thats the cheap stuff, if you want loose weight you need to invest in the proper stuff.<br>  I have tried the diet it does work, but not suitable for everyone.<br>  She recommended this one Welljuice Diet Lemon, It works!!!!!!

UF9MVdSXaa	Sorry that's been happening to you. Maybe you could talk to your Doctor about it and have your Doctor, talk to them about their smoking. Or you could always be like," Hey, could you guys go outside and smoke? The smoke is really bothering me." <br>  <br>  Hope I could help!<br>  <br>  And best of luck!|`|MQCT1FXjaa	has your house been checked for radon?|`|ON84EQaBaa	Advair is to be taking only once a day. if you have a rescue inhaler you can use it when you need it up to three times a day. it would help if you had a nebalizer to take a breath treatment, or maybe you need to see a doctor. second hand smoke is as bad as if you smoked yourself, my husband smokes but we have only 1 room for smoking. maybe you should talk to your parents about that.|`|GQZDcfUiaa	I'm sorry this is happening to you, I have asthma and I don't wish it on anyone.<br>  You should call your doctor and let him know the what's going on about your meds. Also, inform him of what's going on at home, he might be the one to do something about it, and that way your parents won't have a beef with you for turning them in. It is your doctors job to do what is in your best interest. Get well soon.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	I'm quite sure you love your parents but they know very well that you have asthma and are putting your life in danger by smoking. Maybe they could smoke outside the house and act like responsible parents. Otherwise you should mention it to your doctor. He/she'll know what to do from there.|`|eD81oFgwaa	i'm sorry to sound blunt, but instead of asking for help from random strangers on the internet you should go straight to a doctor and ask for help. do you have other trusted family members you could stay with while your parents smoke? that is NOT cool|`|GVT7bwDxaa	take the ciggars away, call the police.<br>  its 2nd hand smoke, do you want cancer?
RHWqdpDZaa	Hi That's a very good question. You should follow your instincts as being a supportive friend is a good thing to do. Being there for your friends in times of difficulty is a rare skill as most people will avoid them and not give them channels to discuss their problems and get help in finding solutions. You cant fix their problems but you can help them find a way through it by listening and supporting them. When it gets difficult try to suggest doing something different like walking , going shopping , go to places where there are other people relaxing which will encourage them to relax ,<br>  <br>  Keep up the good work.<br>  <br>  Ask me any questions/<br>  <br>  my website is www.teigncounselling.com. completely free advice<br>  <br>  Roy
jf1o7TFHaa	maybe like half a grilled chicken breast and a small salad with light dressing?
yQDxgLBPaa	No she is ok I had a calcium lump and got a ultra sound just to make shure it wasn't cancer it was about 2 years ago im fine!|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Ask for an ultrasound exam then just wait and see. She could go see an actual breast surgeon but keep in mind that their answer to most problems is going to be surgery.|`|52cGZS3caa	Sounds like your sis and her docs have it under their scopes. They are doing what needs to be done and she is going to be just fine. The people that have the serious problems are the ones who don't do what you sister is doing - that is being aware of the possibility of cancer and having regular checks for it.
2805c250ba013ac4e6a04ede2b88a221aa	The trick to losing weight is to eat healthy, but eat fewer calories than you burn off.<br>  <br>  Don't starve yourself, but eat like 1700 calories out of a 2000 calorie diet and exercise 3 to 4 days a week.  If you're still not sure ask a physician, nutritionist or check with a trainer in the local gym.|`|AA10358331	Yes.. to lose about a pound a week (which is healthy), you would need to eat 500 calories less per day and exercise as well.
c9a1f0964ec1c52f2b99f929391af5d7aa	No.|`|10mOHSZTaa	Size is affected by fatty tissue. That's why when obese women slim down their cup size goes down too. Don't worry about it though.

Use 20-50 oil for best results. As for how often, it has to be for 23 hours/day to be effective. Go ask at a health club to see if they provide that service.
85KL0eUUaa	no more than 110 (from a girls point of view. no homo)|`|Qnswjc6kaa	100 pounds.
sNE6qwAOaa	This is false, it's not proven that soda does this.  It could be a plan of your mom's to try to get you to stop drinking soda haha but no, UTI's happen, but not from soda :)
qzkWahFeaa	Try some running, and pedaling(either on a bike, stationary bike, or on your back).
AA11707645	Hi<br>  I think you should stick to the laber instructions , as they have been tested.<br>  Wishing you good luck .<br>  Freddy
f8mLpPXlaa	You'd have to tell me what they found with the second incident. I'm quite sure they put a tube into her lungs if she was choking that bad. While doing that they would have visualized any anatomical abnormalities, such as "webbing'. But you don't mention a second trip to the ER when she was choking.<br>  Sorry my friend but not being able to swallow properly is quite a different problem than choking severely.<br>  Did her Gastroenterologist not follow up with her.  Actually it would have been with an endoscopy. There are no "webbings" that show up on x ray. And if he saw it with the endoscope he would have treated it right then.<br>  Sorry I can't give you an answer.
OLkFzLd8aa	Thats normal. I'm 13 and around that height :)|`|4NiGsqnCaa	I was 13 and 5'5.<br>  I'm 27 and still the same.|`|85KL0eUUaa	its normal i think<br>  i was about 5'6, i'm 5'8 now (i'm a girl)<br>  guys keep growing until around 21, and the average male is 5'9 (in america) but i can safely say you'll end up 6' or close to it.
sNE6qwAOaa	Haven't run a mile since high school? Haha that is a long time!  I think you definitely need to ease into it.  It doesn't sound like you're out of shape or anything but when you run, you should take it slow at first.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend taking tomorrow off, and see how you feel the day after tomorrow.  I run and lift weights, and my back was hurting pretty bad.  I took 1 week off of everything, and resumed after the week and I felt fine.  You should be generous with the amount of time you take off before you  start again.  Make sure you're feeling really good when you start up again.  Exercising while injured does you no good, and you don't want to aggravate anything!<br>  <br>  Make sure your shoes have good arch support, running shoes would be better than regular tennis shoes or basketball shoes.  Work your arms as well.<br>  <br>  So this is what I would do: Day 1- once you feel good, run the mile at an easy, slow jogging pace.  Day 2- Take a day off.  Day 3- If you're feeling good, run again at a similar, slow pace.  Day 4-Take a day off.  Then after this, just do whatever feels right, and don't strain yourself! Do what you can, but not too much.  It sounds like you work hard at your job, but that doesn't necessarily mean your legs and core are in the greatest shape haha.  Hope you get to feeling better!|`|qzkWahFeaa	Make sure you have on good shoes when running to absorb impact and give yourself spring. Also, stretch before you run. Hurdle stretches (one leg out, the other bent in and touching the back of the stretched out leg's knee, then try to touch and hold your toes slowly and with both hands), jumping jacks, and other ways you can come up with will help loosen the muscles before strenuous activity. Cool down my pacing after running. Also, try running a long distance five days a week, and on the other two run short distances or rest.<br>  <br>  Another way to help would be alternating your excercise regimen, so different muscles are targeted.|`|Nmi2NpjJaa	your, body has not got used to the work yet. i would say stretch before working out. and work out only 2days out of a 5day week or 4 out of a 7day week. until your body gets used to it. hope i could help.|`|ZY2GT7edaa	you should probably leave one day where you take a break, but other than that keep it up. try stretching. this helps relieve some of the soreness. plus alternate your workouts. doing the same thing everyday works the same muscles which may be why you are so sore.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Basically, what you want to do is look up on google:<br>  <br>  Lactic acid buildup
k6em0k88aa	HMM well, Toast (no butter) with honey? or just toast alone, it have carbohydrates and it wont stick weight to you :)<br>  <br>  Most celebs actually have a couple of slices in the mornin,to keep them going till lunch or dinner, cus of the new " size 0" trend.
MXpW48lFaa	I would kill to be you. Be happy with what you got. A lot of women out there would love to have bigger boobs and bigger butts.|`|MQCT1FXjaa	wear three sports bras, first one two sizes too small, second one size too small, and third just your size.<br>  <br>  not sure about the butt..|`|nOvpKNYdaa	breast reduction surgery. its safe and covered by insurance|`|77cjP6z1aa	omgg woww<br>  im gonan cry :P<br>  i would die to have mine bigger
xO1LQWbZaa	The antibiotics will persist drainage in your sinus.  Beleive it or not, your sinuses will fill up when you get strep throat, and make your throat itchy.  I'm going through that right now.  Suck on hard candy or a cough drop to soothe your throat.  If your throat isnt sore, hard candy will be better because it tastes better and cheaper.  lol, I'm going through the exact same thing except with a sinus infection.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, hun!|`|7pxJdyRcaa	Coughing is caused by sinus drainage.   Go to the Drug Store and ask the Pharmacist for his suggestion for over the counter medication to stop the drainage.  There are many that are good.
5Qo6OWNzaa	www.getbig.com is a great site with a forum that has pro and am body builders, lots of info on competing, nutrition and training.. I would suggest looking there
KLuSgXPMaa	A lot of water will flush out your system of some things. May not be of all the stuff you want but it won't hurt you for sure. And as long as you don't cheat all the time it's good to treat your self every once in awhile.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Your body digests food then what is  not absorbed into the body, is eliminated via bowel movements. Drinking water tonight will flush out the impurities & toxins in your body, but not what's already been digested. Next time you go to the movies, eat some snacks but don't overdo it.  Get up the next day, & decide how to work off the calories you consumed the night before. (walking, biking, swimming, basketball, etc.)|`|8dnwrn1Vaa	Warm it up in the microwave so it kind of "melts" the food out and I guess eases things in there. Next time, drink the warm/hot water before going out, it works better.
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	There is no way we can give you an answer because we don't know enough about your age, height, weight, etc., to give you a guess.  I am sure you will grow when you are supposed to.<br>  <br>  good luck..
2uOhDMKjaa	Your not getting your period because you dont have enough body fat (Which is perfectly normal) If you have a high metabolism or other reasons why you dont have much body mass (like dwarfism or just small stature) you often times will take longer to start your period. 13 isnt even bad for not having your period... there are tenth graders who havent started yet. Your might not gain weight, but your gonna get taller, which means more body mass... leading to starting your period. Dont worry about it to much, your young yet and it will happen in time.|`|AA11553245	You're not growing because you haven't had a growth spurt. I didn't grow from the time I was in 4th grade to 8th grade, and in 8th grade I was 4'6" tall, and i'm in 10th grade now and I'm 5'3''<br>  <br>  we just have fast metabolisms. Don't worry about it.|`|fK18ewGuaa	It's sad, I'm 14 and 4'7, and I'm a gymnast. But, I have gotten my period (Just last month for the first time)! So, I'm pretty sure you will grow and such, if the rest of your family is short, then maybe not.
f30d8af191e3f75b76ad08ab74b32fecaa	No doubt Gillette Fusion.  Not the powered Fusion but just a plain old Fusion.  However, if for some reason you got a Quattro or a Mach 3, you almost certainly wouldn't notice a difference.  In my own unscientific tests, the Fusion won every time over the Mach 3.  I personally couldn't tell much of a difference, but my wife was able to correctly pick the Fusion side of my face every time by feeling for the better shave.|`|E64juLwJaa	The Phillips fusion mach 5:you never cut yourself and shave as smooth as can be<br>  Colors|`|06NbP7Ihaa	Well a straight razor really will give the closest and most comfortable shave when used properly but the next best thing would be a double edge razor. The kind that opens at the top and the blade drops in. There is a bit of a learning period with these as well but not nearly as involved as with a straight. <br>  <br>  But the razor is only half of the story, make sure you use a quality shaving soap and brush to get your whiskers to stand up. Shave with the grain and use very light pressure.

s0wBK9eYaa	I've looked into this quite a bit and Jordin Rubin's cleanse in "The Maker's Diet" or "Perfect Weight America" is the best I've found yet. I would advise against the supplements he recommends though as they don't work all that well. Look here:<br>  <a href="http://www.cbn.com/health/beauty/ballestero_detox2.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbn.com/health/beauty/ballest...</a><br>  <br>  Really you don't need to cleanse that much (if at all) is your diet is already "clean" (devoid of processed food).

N2O is dissolved in the fat of the cream so that it can be used as a propellant to move the cream out of the can. When it leave the can it becomes a gas again and as it becomes a gas it foams the cream. The reason N2O is used instead of other gases like oxygen is because the foam it causes in the cream is four times the volume of the unwhipped cream, oxygen only increases the volume two times. Also oxygen decomposes the fat in the cream and N2O doesn't.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
CJvHQl5vaa	You don't need to hear "diet and exercise" again, so since you know that part, I will say it sounds to me that if you eat when you are bored, sad or mad, and you are gaining weight, the thing is to change those things.  I think that if you could find new ways of handling your emotions when you are bored, sad, or mad, and also try to take charge and not feel those things as often, that might be a good strategy.  Meditation, deep breathing, exercise, writing in a journal or venting to a friend might be things you can do to deal with your negative emotions besides eating.  I know that eating is more instant...I am a stress/emotional eater too, but it is causing you more stress because you aren't happy with your body.<br>  <br>  Also, I suspect that part of the weigh gain is from sleep deprivation.  Is the baby sleeping through the night?  There are recent studies that say that people who simply get enough sleep can lose some serious weight.  SELF magazine did an informal study and it proved exactly that.  If you aren't getting enough sleep, see if you can fit in a bit more.  If you can't do that right now with the baby's crazy sleep schedule, then you might just have to cut yourself a little slack.  If some of those women lost as much as 15 pounds by only getting enough sleep, then it wouldn't be crazy for some of your current weight to come from a lack of long enough quality sleep.|`|wGTisY1aaa	visit my website and see if there is anything on there  that might help you.

If anything, doing this will only get rid of your water weight and when you're satisfied and start eating again, you will gain more weight than you lost because your body is preparing itself to go into starvation again.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight, you should go on diet, but with your weight and height, you shouldn't lose anymore weight. If you lose more weight with your body the way it is, it will make you look less attractive due to the ribs and abnormally skinny you would be.

h2kMk88faa	Why not do both? If you do sets and reps to gain muscle, you still are going to get stronger. If you do sets and reps for strenght, you'll still gain muscle.<br>     I'd recommend doing 2 weeks of muscle building...sets of 4 for each compound exercise and sets of 3 for isolation exercises and shoot for between 8 to 12 reps. with moderate weight. Then do 2 weeks of strenght building where you do all compound moves, 4 sets of between 4 to 6 reps with heavier weights.<br>     Doing this, you'll keep your workouts fresh and accomplish both goals.|`|k6em0k88aa	Heres the world wide rule - Look sexy first, be sexy later.<br>  Meaning - get the abs, pecs and everything else, THEN get stronger.<br>  <br>  GL

OHfcGAgIaa	6 weeks you'll see a definite change (that's if you're going at least 4 times a week solid). Use free weights instead of machines ( a lot better to build muscle) check the net for free weight exercises, there's loads. Also up your protein intake (dramatically if you don't get enough already) make sure you're eating a lot of meat everyday. Also protein shakes help a lot they also give you a lot more energy because of the high number of carbs.

s0wBK9eYaa	You can't get fat overnight. One binge isn't going to cause you to gain weight. You have to continually eat bad over a period of time. Also ice cream is better for you than say if you at cake, donuts, etc (fat and sugar is better than carbs and sugar). so don't feel too guilty. Plus its great that you cut off eating 2 hours before bed (although if you had a really hard strength training workout you should consume an easily digestible protein before going to bed otherwise your muscles might break down)|`|8SRjELNBaa	gah... out of all things your going to eat ice cream?

GGmaSpHDaa	Strength training does not stunt growth. That is a myth that just won't die.  See links below or my other posts for more details.<br>  <br>  Box squatting is a bit risky.  I would pay attention to the feedback your body is giving you and change to a different form of squats.<br>  <br>  My experience after lifting for many years is that avoiding injury is one of the most important factors in reaching your potential.
aXnVFFUkaa	you need to give your muscle time to repair and grow <br>  <br>  if they are worked too much they wont have time to grow, so giving yourself a few days break was so effective as your muscle had plenty of time to repair themselves|`|uJKTR4d2aa	It could be. Maybe your body just needs those rest days to catch up. Sometimes i dont notice my weekly weight loss until i rest on the weekends.
MHg9JhEKaa	Measure in inches around your chest, under your boobs. <br>  Then measure around the chest over the top of your boobs around the fullest part. The difference in inches between your first and second measurement gives your cup size.<br>  <br>  e.g. measurement under boobs = 30 inches<br>  measurement around boobs = 32 inches (1 extra inch per cup size)<br>  Therefore you'd be a 30B, if you were 34 inches around boobs, you'd be a 30D<br>  <br>  The cups get bigger as you go up the 'under boobs' size. So someone who is 40D will look like they have bigger boobs than someone who is a 30D.|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	Honestly, it's simpler and better to get professionally measured.<br>  Theres nothing intimate about the service and it's free of charge, you can even keep our top on.|`|CBgDc1Auaa	I am pretty sure it depends on your height also!!! could be D for her size!|`|aa913a7742ee895eca3af1ab4fef085aaa	victorias secret does it for free!|`|xSqAe2t3aa	Get a tape measure (a loose one obviously, not those flicky ones from B&Q!) and measure around the bust line, under your boobs. For example, let's say it measures 34 inches. Then turn the tape measure up so it's vertical and measure from the bust line to the fullest part of the breast. However many inches it is, convert it to letters (ie: 1=A, 2=B, 3=C etc... So if you were to measure 34 inches around the bust and 3 inches vertically to the fullest part of the breast, you'd be a 34C.|`|h7W5jytOaa	i really dont know<br>  i have this problem<br>  i went into marks and spencers and got measured and they said i was a 34A i was wtf no lol<br>  cuz i wear 34B and they fit<br>  personally it depends on the shop :S|`|GHefTsUyaa	Put my hands on them and guess.|`|Hn3aBIb1aa	Han's answer is correct :)

56q4sy3Haa	Any hormonal contraceptive can cause weight gain, it's just less likely to occur with Mirena, which releases tiny amounts of hormones, than, say oral contraceptive pills. <br>  There's no need to remove it, just try to eat healthy foods and get regular exercise.

dM1IsKdZaa	You simply have to burn more calories than you take in to lose weight, so you probably will. That's it.You really should feed yourself something small and healthy every couple of hours (apple, handful of nuts, yogurt, etc) to keep your metabolism going- if your body doesn't get food very often (like the way you are eating), it thinks it's starving and makes it harder to lose weight. And Nicole is right- you really need to make time to exercise 20-30 minutes a day, most days of the week- even if you are in a healthy BMI/weight range. You need to be heart healthy, and it prevents cancers, reduces stress, elevates mood, etc. Think of it as an investment in your future.|`|qtVCb9EKaa	No you will get more.....when your body is famished, it absorbed storage fat....simple as that|`|EDiJe38Taa	Restricting your food intake will give you short-term weight loss for a short period only. It is NOT the way to lose weight. Once your body notices that you are taking in less calories, it will go into starvation mode. This means that it will hold onto the fat and calories that you ARE taking in because it doesn't know when it will get food again. Also, once you return to a normal diet you are WAY more likely to gain the weight back and then some. Just eat healthy and exercise please.|`|dwLIMV5Saa	This one <a href="http://strip-that-fat-review.com/lose-belly-fat.php?cb=ftuley69&tid=08" rel="nofollow">http://strip-that-fat-review.com/lose-be...</a> helped me lose my tummy fat and I wish I had found this years ago.

I like women who are in fit shape.<br>  <br>      I would use brewer's yeast, because it is cheaper than the protein supplements, even though it's got 50% protein, and all the amino acids, + B vitamins and trace minerals. The B vites help metabolize fat, and the calorie count is negligible. It's not a "bulk up" supplement for those who burn thousands of calories pumping iron. Some people hate the taste. I take mine straight in water, because if I mix it with anything else it just messes up the taste of the mixer.|`|vx2MaQg0aa	The best protein shake would be ON 100% whey protein, its packed with 24g protein 4g glutamine and low fat and sugar, thats the one i use and it helped big time i also use n.o xplode its a pre-workout drink but u really dont need it, it gives you lots of energy and a bit of strength and make you stay longer in gym, so just get the protein shake..|`|jCeylLsIaa	Weider's Mega Mass.

Once u cut ur fat by doing cardio; jogging, elliptical, etc... Then start taking WHEY protein, then u'll start getting bigger, and more toned and ur muscles will show. Then switch to, HIGH weight, LOW rep weight lifting routine.... U gaine strength so fast like that. 2 1/2 months ago i was benching 105 pounds..... now i am benching 205 pounds.....

wTihIKnyaa	alright. First off the condition is not certain to cause diabetes. I have been to several doctors to talk about this and none of them told me I was going to get diabetes from it. Mostly I went to the doctors about my diet. You should try to stay away from lots of carbs and try to avoid most refined sugars. Except when she is really low, in which case she should have a sugary drink like juice or lemonade to get it up. However, if she only feels a little off she should eat something with medium carb and really high protein because the sugars in proteins burn slowly. She should eat the medium car, high protein snacks every 2-3 hours whether she feels weird or not. <br>  <br>  Those eating habits should keep her from getting low throughout the day. Before she sleeps she should eat something really high protein and low carb. She should also never ever skip breakfast.<br>  <br>  The diet shouldn't rule her life though. It is flexible and it won't hurt to go an extra hour without a snack. She actually can have some sugary stuff as long as she eats a high protein snack afterward. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps! <3BellaB|`|sw2R5A9iaa	follow the doctor's advice.  avoid refined foods, eat small balanced meals frequently thru out the day, and eat plenty of healthy snacks.|`|393937af488718541406397401ee4284aa	You shouldn't ask here.

WExooMfDaa	i used to pierce people and honestly, people get so worked up over the sight of needles because as children we associate needles with pain. if you think about the pain of an injection vs say... stubbing your toe or hitting your funny bone, it would be the same amount of pain or even worse. if you breathe in and exhale as soon as the person sticks you, your body is a little more prepared for it. when i pierce people i tell them to exhale as soon as i am going to poke them. the only thing i could suggest is breathing exercises and remember that it is only for a few seconds and the pain is worth whatever you are getting poked for. what is more painful, a blood test to see if you have something wrong with you with just a prick? or chemo treatments or other procedures that involve MORE needles and pain? you just have to weigh the pros and cons. overall: people psych themselves out for something that truely isnt the most painful thing in the world.|`|NSzmBW7caa	I had the same problem.<br>  I sucked it up, and went and got my bellybutton pierced.<br>  I knew that needle was bigger than any needle the doctor will stick me with.<br>  I also donated blood to the Red Cross even though I was scared.<br>  I had to realize I was bigger than this fear.<br>  Now I'm not scared anymore.<br>  It will all be alright.<br>  Just take it one step at a time.|`|vtxlicJ0aa	Well, im the same way when i go to get my blood drawn. First you can ask the docter to give you a while to calm down, then when your ready dont stifen up just relax and keep your hand straight and dont look at the needle, tell the docter to just get it over with.|`|MT9bImb3aa	...i was like that..<br>  <br>  u only cry becuase of the fear..not becuase of the pain you " THINK"<br>  ur gonna feel...<br>  <br>  dont be afraid...let them do whatever thay need to do and be strong..put a smile.. and then you WILL realize , its not that bad.<br>  <br>  it works..u MUST be confident.|`|HJdsty5uaa	It only hurts for a second.

I get myself so worked up sometimes that my blood pressure drops and I often pass out.  Horrible phobia for someone with health problems to have.<br>  First of all, talk to your doctor about the problems you are having.  If traditional coping methods (counting, looking away, etc.) aren't working for you, there are prescriptions that can take the edge off your anxiety and also numbing creams (ask about emla) that you can apply before the injection ... you don't feel a thing!  <br>  Best of luck from someone who knows what you are going through!|`|FkXt4XLvaa	Many people have a fear of needles...and for various reasons. It's common and you should not be embarrassed of it. Most doctors, nurses, or phlebotemists will be kind through the process as well especially if you tell them you don't like needles.<br>  <br>  First off, don't ice your arm anymore. Doing that may actually make the pain worse because it makes the vein hard and can make it difficult for the nurse to draw blood from it. <br>  <br>  Really, the only thing you can do is relax - remind yourself that you are there for your health or to help someone else - and not make your body so stiff and resistant to the needles. Tensing up can make it hurt more or can make it difficult for the nurse to get a good vein...in which case she would have to try the other arm and you'd go through it all over again.|`|h9q1wMbQaa	you just have to realize that needles are the lesser of the two evil.<br>  <br>  you get injections to prevent serious diseases (which would require MORE injections).  You get blood drawn to detect abnormalities that can usually be treated unless you let them go then wind up having a serious health crisis (and you guessed it, MORE injections and blood drawn).<br>  <br>  Needles pinch and some nurses are better than others.  When you go to get jabbed just keep it in your mind of where it is they are going to jab you.  Tell yourself, I am going to feel a pinch on my arm and that will be it.  You can also work yourself up and think that you are going to have the most unbearable pain from that shot at that particular area.  The adrenaline can actually release natural painkillers in your brain early.....I've tried this and believe it or not, I was actually disappointed that it didn't hurt.  lol  I missed it!<br>  <br>  No matter what, you need to keep yourself healthy and it does involve things that don't always feel good.

If you have not then this "problem" may take care of itself when you do.  During puberty the body proportions change, metabolism changes, musculature changes etc.  Just wait and see and try to keep active (walking, running etc).  If you have already gone through puberty - just walking as far as you can in a "15 minute out and 15 minute return" format. Then after 2 days go to a "20 minute out/20 back" and keep trying to go faster to stretch the distance out and back.  Work up to "30/30" and after 6 months you'll be surprised how much can change.

BbJv9nlwaa	I think you should focus on toning, cause you sound thin. I would suggest joining the YMCA (love it so much!) and go there about twice a week. They have wonderful workout equipment (seriously) especially for muscle toning. Just walk around looking at the pictures on the machines that show its for arms and stomach. If you don't want to join the YMCA, I would suggest swimming laps, pushups (for arms), and curlups/situps/crunches for stomach :> Hula hooping is for your waste, IDK about arms.
LpcqKrZtaa	Eat two banana's every day - this raises the potassium intake in your blood which highers the pain threshold (making it less painful).<br>  <br>  Take painkillers ONLY when it gets too bad.<br>  <br>  Buy lavendar mist and spray it on your pillow and covers before you go to sleep.  You can also wash your clothes with lavendar.  This creates a calming remedy and also helps you sleep better and eases headaches.<br>  <br>  If your stomach pains become really bad, get on all fours and arch your back upwards.  Take several deep breaths then relax.  Repeat three or four times.<br>  <br>  Of an evening, raise your feet so your legs are "level" with your hips.  This decreases ankle swelling.<br>  <br>  Don't consume lots of coffee or sugary items.  You may feel that you crave for sugary items, but please go easy as this could agrevate your headaches and stomach pains further.<br>  <br>  Last resort is to visit your GP.

3VeqE9Oaaa	Hi ChaCho!<br>  <br>  Most people think that if you do aerobic exercise, you'll lose weight, but the reality is that their are two other factors that they are missing out on, weights, and diet. If you make some changes to your workout plan, and diet, you will have better success. Start by lifting weights 3 times per week, space the days out, and do full body workouts, till you get more advanced. What you call, your "usual routine," you can still do, but do that on non-weight training days 2-3 times a week, and get 1 or 2 days rest(to repair and recover, so you build more muscle)! You don't want to do running, or the elliptical on the days you lift EVER, because that will burn up your muscle that you worked so hard to build. For your question about the eliptical, don't go so hard, preserve your muscle instead, same goes for the running. Also, you need to change your way of thinking about lifting weights, because you will get defined by lifting, you don't need to go heavy, and the muscle mass you gain, will help you burn fat. Muscle does weigh more than fat, so the scale isn't a good guide to where you are at physically, so don't concentrate on the number, especially when you do start lifting. For your diet, you need to eat 5-6 small meals per day(use a protein drink if you need to), all balanced, but watch your carbs, to many get stored as fat. You do need carbs to fuel your activity though, and to hold onto that muscle you'll be building, so this is why you eat more often, plus it will boost your metabolim. <br>  <br>  Results take time, so be patient, don't do anything drastic. You have pretty good ideas, make these changes, see what happens.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  D|`|N956bVxhaa	I think you're friends are right about gaining muscle in place of fat.  There's truth to that and it sounds likely because your workouts are really intense.  If you're building muscle, rest is an important part of that building process, so yeah, make sure your muscles are rested and not too sore before working them out again.<br>  <br>  Bottom line though, if you want to drop weight you'll need to cut out some calories.|`|1Qz0cZ2Waa	You're eating way to many calories. You have to remember, in order to lose you have to burn more calories than you take in. Drink tons of water it helps keep you hydrated & tricks your stomach into thinking it's fuller than it is. <br>  <br>  Muscle weighs more than fat too so while you're gaining muscle and losing fat... you may not lose weight|`|GQuk9AIpaa	Just to let you know, that acai berry comment, disregard, probably a spam agent. I asked a very similar question so I'm not of much help, I know, but I do know they say muscle helps increase your metabolism so it is good to engage in strength building though most people's bodies don't trade fat for muscle very well, usually one tends to lose muscle while burning fat and in addition to strength training you might be lucky to break even. I could be wrong and it definitely depends on your unique situation. Sorry I couldn't help you with why you're not losing weight, that's my problem too.

A recent study of moderately overweight women found that L-carnitine did not significantly alter body weight, body fat, or lean body mass. Based on the results of this one small study, claims that L-carnitine helps reduce weight are not supported at this time."

The working out part seems a lil extreme if its the beginning of your routine.  The calorie intake for someone your age seems very low.  Remember, you are still developing in to an adult.  Not giving your body what it needs now will hurt you when you reach your adult years of 30 up.  Weight Watchers has a very healthy diet plan.  Talking to your family doctor about what would be healthy.|`|OGx9vBkXaa	*sigh*<br>  <br>  You will lose a lot of weight by this....and then as soon as your diet is over, you will put it ALL back on, and more....<br>  <br>  However, 40-50lbs is A LOT of weight to lose in such a short amount of time. Although you will lose a lot of weight, you won't be able to lose that much.<br>  <br>  Why not start a healthy diet now, with reasonable amount of exercise?<br>  Rather than doing it quickly, but damaging your body and not being able to keep it off?<br>  <br>  If you are still growing, then this could seriously effect your body (growth, concentration, etc)|`|DBorgJsKaa	i doubt you will loose that much weight that quick. you will loose quite a bit though. sounds like a good plan. but if it was me i would get burnt out quickly by all those videos. also, dont do the same thing everyday....rotate your routine and mix it up or you will stop seeing results. drink LOTS of water. and add in some strength training. I focus on legs one day then arms the next and I do abs every day...i just work on a diff part of my abs each day. i lost 40 pounds in 6 months JUST by drinking slim fast twice a day, eating one normal meal a day and drinking water, no exercise. I still do the slimfast, but now I have added in the exercise and it is a HUGE part of loosing weight. Hope this helps you : )

wBPNE73maa	As a runner, I recommend that you run for at least 20 minutes every day.  If you can, work your way up to 80 minutes in a day, but try to mix up your week with some short, long and mid sized runs.  Also, do not go by mileage; it is best to go by time.  If you do not want to run all the time you could bike or swim, but running really works the best.  Try lifting weights, too.  They really help!|`|zB7Gz8R5aa	Go to the gym.<br>  <br>  Especially if you are looking for "toned". The best way would be go to a gym and get a personal trainer, next best would be get a membership and go 4 to 5 days week, alternating the parts of your body you want to tone.<br>  <br>  To tone your body requires working on muscles. If all you wanted to do was get thin that really depends but a diet is a good place to start, but add a little bit of muscle to that and you will look thinner faster.<br>  <br>  By diet I recommend something balanced, things like the atkin's diet will get you to lose weight quick, but it will come back as soon as you are off the diet, and usually worse.|`|1487d1674981b6aea0adec310c43a272aa	I would recommend you do weight training.

ZkwtldYlaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|sw2R5A9iaa	you will know your full height by age 25.  till then, enjoy your life.|`|AA11251285	You can APPEAR taller with shoe lifts and other tricks, but you cannot make yourself taller than your God intended you to be.<br>  Better to avoid activities that can hurt your chances of getting taller.<br>  For example, if you eat a diet of junk food, do heavy drugs, don't get enough sleep, etc, then your health is compromised and your height might be affected that way in the negative.<br>  You can practice standing with proper posture and do healthy yoga stretches to make sure that you get as tall as possible.|`|YnlplIOOaa	Yeah probz.

Are you doing your job well ? Does he/she have an issue with your job performance ? If not, then he needs to stop this extremely unprofessional behavior.  Have a meeting !|`|3VeqE9Oaaa	Hi Steven!<br>  <br>  That is a very cruel thing for your boss to be doing! Some people need to put others down, to feel good about themselves, I suspect this is the case, and the boss wants to be the boss! You do need your job, so what can you do? How do you feel about your weight? Are you watching what you eat, and exercising? Do you want to make a change? Sometimes going along with the joke, is the best thing to do with a boss, but the next time he says something about it, laugh and say, "yea, I'm working on it!" Don't show any signs of weakness or anger or bad blood. <br>  <br>  Start making some changes! Make sure each day, you eat 5-6 small meals per day. These meals should be balanced, with carbs, protein, and healthy fats. Stay away from the lunches with the guys that include pizza, fries, or anything fried. You can have a plain burger or grilled chicken sandwich instead(no mayo). It's your right to be fussy when you eat out, so order the good stuff. Watch your portion sizes, and your carbs. You also do need to workout. If you don't have a gym membership, just go buy some dumbbells. I can give you countless weight training plans, but I don't know if you workout, or ever have, so I don't know your experience. But, do weights no more than 3 times per week, and if you are new, make them full body workouts(eventually you can do bodypart splits, check out flex magazine). On the other 4 days, walk for 40mins, preferably early in the morning on an empty stomach, because this will help you burn fat. <br>  <br>  This will be a good place for you to start! You don't need to workout countless hours to lose weight. Remember this, you build muscle to burn fat, then recover so you can build more, and with each meal you eat, you are holding onto the muscle that you have built.<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone discourage you, maybe your bosses rotten ways, will be life changing for you.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps! Good luck!<br>  <br>  D

d7f2c01962fe4f1fd4ed854d458d9f91aa	Very often the cause of acid reflux is not what we eat, but HOW we eat. And eating large meals which over-stimulate acid production in the stomach is a major cause - this is especially true if a number of hours have passed between two meals. (I know this from experience!).  I've found it best to eat small amounts often, rather than large amounts infrequently.  Try to always include carbs in your meal (bread, pasta, or rice) as these are great at 'mopping up' acid. Avoid high fat foods (including fast foods) , as these take longer to digest which prompts the stomach to produce even more acid. Another thing that helps is to keep a good upright posture for about an hour after eating - no laying down, or slouching in the sitting position after a meal, and avoid doing jobs that involve bending over too soon after eating (I find this a real trigger for heartburn).  Alcohol, especially beer, can also aggravate the stomach into producing more acid, so limit alcohol intake or cut it out altogether and, of course, smoking is a 'no-no'!. Stress is another cause; you may have found that when you're anxious or 'strung-up' about something, the problem is worse. If you do recognise that you are easily stressed, attend relaxation classes or read books on the subject in order to gain insight into the art of relaxation. Do hope these ideas may be of help in alleviating your problem - they certainly help me.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	odd that you're doctor didn't fully explain this to you.  call and ask for advice.|`|ezT7xruoaa	Well, instant solutions are only possible with things that dilute the stomack acid, like water or even better, milk.

If I can do it so can anyone out there trust me.|`|JO4cPARdaa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se if you want to lose weight, the sole method that really showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I shed 30 pounds, it really does produce success!|`|s0ipAwcNaa	I have used every diet known to man but nothing worked as well as acai berry.

dM1IsKdZaa	If you start right now and are dedicated, you just may. I count 122 days until June 30th. 122 days divided by 7 days a week is 17.43 weeks. Take 17.43 weeks multiplied by 2 pounds = 34 pounds (a little more than you want to drop). I use 2 pounds because that is on the the high end of weight you would want to lose per week (1-2 pounds a week is a healthy rate of weight loss).  <br>     So here is what you do:<br>  You simply have to burn more calories than you take in. That's it. I didn't say easy, I said SIMPLE. Go to a website like freedieting.com and determine your calorie needs for your age and exercise level. I imagine your needs will be around 1600-1800 a day to lose 2 pounds a week. You need to do some fast walking or lighter cardio exercise 20-30 minutes most days of the week (not too intense). Start lifting some weights, do push ups and pull ups if you can Eat several small meals a day. Don't skip breakfast- it's critical (oatmeal, eggs, whole wheat toast with peanut butter, etc). Eat more fruits and vegetables. You really should feed yourself something small and healthy every couple of hours (apple, handful of nuts, yogurt, etc) to keep your metabolism going- if your body doesn't get food very often, it thinks it's starving and makes it harder to lose weight. Think of your stomach as a fire- you want to keep feeding it a little bit frequently, don't smother it all at once. Write down everything you eat- I bet you are eating way more than you realize. Stay away from fad diets, WATCH PORTION SIZE and watch liquid calories (coke, fruit juices, etc). Indulge in an occasional sweet or special treat or you'll likely gorge.<br>     Also, there is a little book called "The Calorie King" that tells you how many calories are in just about every food. Good luck.|`|oz2mOkmyaa	if you want to burn fat and build lean muscle tissue, you need to do interval/circuit style training. these workouts combine both strength training(to build lean muscle tissue) and cardio(to burn fat). <br>   <br>  example: squats, push-ups, pull-ups & moutain climbers--do 15 reps of each exercise back to back without rest. that equals 1 set. rest 30-60 sec and repeat the 4 exercises. do 3-5 total sets. Do this routine 3-4x/week.<br>   <br>  you can plug in any combination of exercises and can be done from home, the office or at the gym! <br>   <br>  good luck|`|IdCJMrhKaa	aside from lifting light weight@high reps, you need a lot of cardio!!!

AA11849131	Endometriosis and infertility<br>  <br>  by Ros Wood<br>  <br>  Overall, women with endometriosis find it harder to become pregnant than women in general. However, little research has been carried out into this topic, so it is not possible to give you an accurate indication of how much endometriosis will affect your fertility.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, studies indicate that women with minimal–mild endometriosis take longer to conceive (become pregnant) and are less likely to conceive than women in general.<br>  <br>  It also appears that the more severe the woman’s endometriosis, the more likely it is that she will have difficulty becoming pregnant. Thus, women with moderate–severe endometriosis tend to have more difficulty conceiving than women with minimal–mild endometriosis.<br>  <br>  However, it is important to remember that having endometriosis does not automatically mean that you will never have children. Rather, it means that you may have more problems.<br>  <br>  Many women with endometriosis have children without difficulty, and many others become pregnant eventually — though it may take time, and may require the help of surgery or assisted reproductive technologies or both.<br>  <br>  See also: Endometriosis and assisted reproductive technologies<br>  <br>  In one Australian study involving 3895 women with endometriosis, 54% of the women who tried to become pregnant did not succeed in the first 12 months of trying. However, 70% of them ended up having at least one child [1]*. In comparison, in 1995, the incidence of infertility in US women was 10.2% [2].<br>  <br>  * This study included women who tried to conceive in the 1970s and earlier when assisted reproductive technologies were not available or were less successful than today. Therefore, the figure of 70% may be an underestimate.<br>  <br>   <br>  CAUSES<br>  <br>  <br>  In most cases, it is not understood why it is harder for women with endometriosis to become pregnant.<br>  <br>  The exception to the rule is when the woman’s endometriosis is severe enough to cause damage to one or more of the organs involved in conception. For example, if the ovaries are covered in thick adhesions, the egg may not be able to escape from the ovary to be fertilised. Similarly, if the ovaries or fallopian tubes are stuck in abnormal places by adhesions, the newly released egg may not be able to ‘find’ the entrance to the fallopian tube. Such damage is usually found only in some women with moderate or severe endometriosis [3].<br>  <br>  Many theories have been proposed to explain why it is harder for women with endometriosis to conceive. However, as yet, none have been proven. It is possible that there are several causes and that different causes are relevant in different women. Some of the theories include:<br>  <br>      * pelvic adhesions inhibit the movement of the egg down the fallopian tube<br>  <br>      * eggs are of poor quality<br>  <br>      * chemicals produced by the endometriosis inhibit the movement of the egg down the fallopian tube<br>  <br>      * inflammation in the pelvis caused by endometrisis stimulates the production of cells that attack the sperm and shorten their life span<br>  <br>      * eggs are not released from the ovaries each month (also known as anovulation, which may also occur in women without endometroisis [4].<br>  <br>  MISCARRIAGE<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  There is no evidence that endometriosis causes women to have repeated miscarriages [5].<br>  <br>  Also, there is no evidence that treating endometriosis results in women having fewer miscarriages [6, 7].<br>  <br>  <br>  HORMONAL TREATMENT<br>  <br>  <br>  Minimal–mild endometriosis<br>  <br>  In women with minimal–mild endometriosis, hormonal drugs are not an effective treatment for endometriosis-related infertility, as none of the drugs leads to better pregnancy rates. Therefore, they should not be used to improve fertility in women with minimal–mild endometriosis [8].<br>  <br>  Moderate–severe endometriosis<br>  <br>  In women with more severe disease, no published studies have looked at the effect of hormonal treatment on infertility. However, it is assumed that they are not effective, so they should not be used to improve infertility in women with moderate–severe disease [9].<br>  <br>  <br>  SURGICAL TREATMENT<br>  <br>  <br>  Aim<br>  <br>  Surgery for endometriosis-related infertility aims to remove any endometriosis and adhesions present. If the endometriosis has damaged any organs, or resulted in them being stuck down in abnormal positions, the surgery will also try to repair the damage and restore the anatomy of the organs to as close as possible to their normal positioning [9].<br>  <br>  Minimal–mild endometriosis<br>  <br>  In women with minimal–mild endometriosis, laparoscopic surgery is an effective treatment for endometriosis-related infertility, as it leads to better pregnancy rates than a diagnostic laparoscopy alone [10].<br>  <br>  Moderate–severe endometriosis<br>  <br>  In women with moderate–severe endometriosis, no well designed studies have looked at the effect of surgery on pregnancy rates [9].<br>  <br>  However, three studies seem to suggest that the more severe the endometriosis the lower the pregnancy rates following surgery [11, 12, 13]|`|mo3PnlXXaa	Using google to find some related info or you could try using answer engines such as yahoo answer or yedda.com to obtain some useful ideas.however,If you want some direct infomation,here  <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a>  is a nice one from my experience.|`|3kCBeVrHaa	I have had endo since I was about 14 yrs old. I am now 22. I have had a surgery, a round of lupron, and am fixing to start another round. I found out formally that I had endo when I was rushed to the ER with uncontrolled pelvic pain. My periods have always been extremely heavy and most months the first day I couldn't even get out of the bed to go to school. I am sorry to say that there is no cure for endo. The surgery I had was a laproscopic surgery to clean out the adhesions and then Lupron sends your body into menopause so the endo can't grow. So even if it is endo the doctor will probably send you to a fertility specialist. There's not much more they can do.

XXdlvm4daa	youd be right to say your blood pressure is low. However this is the only thing I can comment with any sort of certainty. <br>  <br>  You did not mention why you were having an echo in the first place; people usually have echocardiograms after heart attacks or for instance if there is a suspected valve problem. With regards to heart attacks, there is usually a loss of tissue so thickening is not seen. The heart itself can become 'thickened' but this is usually concerned with high blood pressure. <br>  <br>  So based on what you have said, I would have to assume that the result is with regards to a heart valve. <br>  <br>  The other part of the result is also of relevance, the upper limit of normal. This means its still in a range where no intervention is required! so dont worry<br>  <br>  To the answer below: <br>  <br>  This is exactly the kind of problem yahoo answers poses and one of the reasons I feel I should answer questions on it! Although some hypertrophic hearts (where the whole muscle becomes thickened) can be due to genetic causes, but the golden rule of medicine is that "common things happen to common people!" i.e. if you were to have a hypertrophic heart, then the odds are you would probably need longstanding hypertension to develop this. The heart is like every other muscle, it will not become bigger by itself!!!!. No incorrect information listed below, but it does not have anything to do with your question and will no doubt worry you. One part of medicine is knowing all the signs/symptoms the other half, probably the harder part, is applying them to appropriately. This is also why 'diagnose yourself' websites are a very bad thing. Please pay no attention to the info listed below. You have what would appear to be an abnormality that is the upper end of normal, and I reiterate, this means that it will not warrant treatment and therefore is really not worth your time worrying about|`|AA12266052	Most normal blood pressures fall in the range of 90/60 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) to 130/80 mm Hg. Hence the blood pressure maintained is optimal and not low.<br>  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. The thickening makes it harder for blood to leave the heart, forcing the heart to work harder to pump blood.<br>  The heart muscle thickens greatly without any obvious cause. In most cases the disease is hereditary, resulting from a gene abnormality.<br>  The disease is thought to affect at least 125,000 people in the UK.<br>  The muscle mass of the left ventricle is larger than it should be, causing the mitral valve to touch the dividing wall between the two sides of the heart - the septum.<br>  The effect of the narrowing of the passage is to obstruct the blood flow out of the heart. The valve may leak.<br>  The muscle is stiff and has difficulty relaxing, increasing the amount of pressure required to expand when blood flows into the heart. This reduces the blood holding capacity of the heart.<br>  The condition can be present in the foetus and cause stillbirth, or may develop in infancy. But, more usually, it develops during childhood or early adulthood.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	there are no "docs" on Yahoo -follow up with your cardiologist.|`|WadzK6ejaa	Where is the thickening ?

LgNGYs5iaa	Definitely possible. You have to be really careful about doing it properly and in a healthy manner, though.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a healthy target weight in mind, first of all. 20 lbs is quite a bit, so make sure that losing it is actually healthy for you (i.e. you're not getting too skinny).<br>  <br>  Now, if losing that much weight is your (healthy!) goal, more power to you! The general rule of thumb that I hear is that healthy weight loss amounts to about 1lb lost a week. You're looking for a little under 2 pounds a week to meet your goals. Again, be careful and be healthy, or else it's really easy to gain the weight back when you're done!<br>  <br>  Usually, people say 3500 calories = 1lb. Find out how many calories you burn per day currently (I highly recommend this calorie calculator: <a href="http://www.healthzone.ca/Toplets/calorieCalculator/calorie_calculator.html)," rel="nofollow">http://www.healthzone.ca/Toplets/calorie...</a> and you basically are looking at burning 5800 calories per week more than you eat (about 830 more calories per day than you eat). This is quite doable with a healthy nutrition plan and some working out.<br>  <br>  My personal experience, I try to eat healthy and I work out just about every day, so I know for example I can burn 500 calories in 30 minutes on an elliptical machine (varies depending on intensity of the workout). Combine that with even small changes in what you eat, and you can start to meet that 830 calorie/day goal!<br>  <br>  In a rather extreme example, I worked as a treeplanter for the summertimes, and I drop about 30 pounds in 3-4 weeks (the average person may burn around 2000 calories per day, treeplanters are about 8000). This is NOT a healthy approach, but just saying, what you're aiming at is doable! Stay healthy, you can do it!|`|AcARmgG1aa	i did. <br>  <br>  i jsut didnt eat ffast food or comfort food anymore :)<br>  <br>  but..i was also physically active.|`|N956bVxhaa	Jumping rope is a good aerobic exercise for burning calories.

Start with getting your diet in order before worrying about exercise.|`|g8pRhElsaa	yes, it's definitely possible. in order to do so, you'd have to average losing about a pound and a half a week. to do so, you'd have to subtract about 4,800 calories a week from your normal diet. so start counting how much you eat a week (thecaloriecounter.com is a good link for help), and try to subtract 4,800 from your weekly total via diet and exercise.<br>  <br>  with exercise, about an hour of moderate cardio burns 300 calories, although it can differ depending on your weight, age, and muscle mass. so any kind of cardio you can think of will work! you could rent exercise videos or walk and jog around your home...anything that gets you moving!<br>  <br>  good luck and hope this helps :)|`|OflbswHKaa	If you weigh more, you lose alot more at the beginning.

K4zsztkRaa	You might be tugging on it too hard and tearing it. Or you might have a frenulum breve. Just work on stretching it out slowly and without pain.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|Yb99bIdnaa	That's your frenulum. It's sensitive to tension, and if used gently, can add a lot of pleasure to your experience. Just don't overdo it! Try modifying your grip so you're not pulling on the underside of the foreskin.<br>  <br>  If it's so short that you can't roll your foreskin back to expose the whole head, then it's considered "frenulum breve" (breve means short, like abbreviated) and it should be treated. A urologist can prescribe a cream that'll make the skin stretchier, and after a few weeks it'll be long enough that your foreskin can move normally.|`|EwmHsEoiaa	See this page for normal retraction of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  The string at the back is called the frenulum.  Everyone has one (unless you have been circumcised).  It might be a little short.  You are only 15 though so I wouldn't worry too much.  <br>  <br>  If the doctor tells you to get circumcision .  Say no.<br>  <br>  The foreskin contains many specialized nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability to masturbate easily as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.

V8dXNAGeaa	Personally, I would be asking a doctor or fitness trainer of some sort this question.  Add the details.  They'll know much better than any of us.  But since you are asking...you seem really healthy, with and without the diet and exercising, so I'm pretty sure it's not fat that you've gained.  It could just be as simple as your body isn't quite used to Crossfit yet.  Sometimes when you pick something up that dedicated, the running, Crossfit, and your 'healthy "grazing" style diet', your body reacts differently at first.  Give it some time.  In the mean time, don't drink diet sodas.  There is absolutely nothing good for you in them.  In fact, they actually harm you in every way.  Go to this link to see what I mean:  <a href="http://www.dentalgentlecare.com/diet_soda.htm#Diet%20Soda%20Drinkers%20Beware" rel="nofollow">http://www.dentalgentlecare.com/diet_sod...</a><br>  Anyway, like I said, ask a professional on this subject.

b30a23ba47d8c8ab0e7b89d3bb8e0487aa	Well, if you are sure that you are not pregnant...I don't know how old you are but younger girls tend to have irregular period cycles. Has this happened before? I have a very abnormal period cycle, but this is because I have a thyroid issue. Every 4 months I have a period. It isn't healthy and you should probably go to the doctor if you haven't already. Be honest and answer all questions and tell him everything you can think of. Also, if you have undergone any significant stress lately, this can cause a hormonal imbalance which then triggers an imbalance in your period cycle. If you are a younger girl and have just recently started having sex, this can also cause a hormonal imbalance.

1vaqtRI2aa	"Cervical cancer begins with abnormal changes in the cervical tissue. The risk of developing these abnormal changes has been associated with certain factors, including previous infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), early sexual contact, multiple sexual partners, cigarette smoking, and taking oral contraceptives (birth control pills). <br>  <br>  Forms of HPV, a virus whose different types cause skin warts, genital warts, and other abnormal skin and body surface disorders, have been shown to lead to many of the changes in cervical cells that may eventually lead to cancer.<br>  <br>  Genetic material that comes from certain forms of HPV has been found in cervical tissues that show cancerous or precancerous changes. <br>  <br>  <br>  In addition, women who have been diagnosed with HPV are more likely to develop a cervical cancer that has genetic material matching the strain of virus that caused the infection. <br>  <br>  <br>  These findings demonstrate a strong link between the virus and cervical cancer. <br>  <br>  <br>  Because HPV can be transmitted by sexual contact, early sexual contact and having multiple sexual partners have been identified as strong risk factors for the development of cervical lesions that may progress to cancer. <br>  Cigarette smoking is another risk factor for the development of cervical cancer. The chemicals in cigarette smoke interact with the cells of the cervix, causing precancerous changes that may over time progress to cancer.<br>  <br>  Oral contraceptives ("the pill") may increase the risk for cervical cancer, especially in women who use oral contraceptives for longer than 5 years."

3vya5f49aa	I feel like this sometimes too. Life can appear hopeless and purposeless at times, especially when you don't have anyone close to speak to and enjoy life with. But at these times, I try to be grateful for what I have. Be thankful that you can even get an education and have opportunities. Try volunteering so that your life has more purpose. Try not to judge others so harshly, as I tend to do too, because no one is perfect and it's important to have good friends. Do things that make you happy, like hiking or going to the movies. Appreciate the small things. Happiness, therefore sadness, is a state of mind.

OLXv3DEAaa	Neurofibromatosis is a hereditary condition, if you have the disease then you have a gene for it that can be passed on to your children. If you had children with someone who does not have the disease or the gene then the child would have about a 50% chance of getting neurofibromatosis. I think if both parents carry the gene the risk would be higher. <br>  <br>  Depending on what type you have, your child could have a more or less serious version of neurofibromatosis, or basically the same version/seriousness as you have. Your doctor should be able to give you a better idea of that I think. <br>  <br>  In terms of learning disability- I'm not sure if those run in families or not.

AA11020187	You should get your pain checked out to find the cause because you have had it for 4 months. It is doubtful there is a hereditary pancreatic cancer in your family as cancer is rarely hereditary and it occurred in your family members at a typical age for this disease. It is very rare for it to occur in someone under 45 years old.|`|52cGZS3caa	I think you really should see your family doctor and if you don't have one, go to a free clinic. They exist in almost every city in the country. You also might try getting in touch with one of the cancer societies - they all have free screenings. You are far too young to be having "crappy" health and there is no reason for you to settle for it. Do something! Please, what you should NOT do is take a lot of the opinions you read here as gospel. The net is just loaded with quacks and their quack ideas. An honest to goodness member of the medical profession is who you should rely on with something as serious as your health and your well-being for the rest of your life. You have a lot of it ahead of you and I hope it is great for you!|`|701e569ee07080e1366aa69e1faa1cefaa	Heredity has been studied as a possible link to "some" types of cancers, but has not yet been seen as a causation. Even if heredity plays a visible role in some types of cancer, pancreatic cancer has a relatively low rate. of 6.2% of pancreatic cancer patients have a family history of pancreatic cancer. However, the recorded people who had a prevalence of pancreatic cancer in the family are mostly Male, Aged over 60, African American, and obese. From what you have told me, you have none of these major heredity "traits" when it comes to pancreatic cancer. Obviously, if you smoke drink more than 2 alcoholic drinks a day, and have a high fat diet you are more prone to cancer and many other diseases. If you are having pain (of any kind) for more than a few days, I suggest that you go see your doctor or go to an emergency room. The pain you describe sounds more like an upper gastrointestinal tract disorder or a muscle sprain in your side and back.|`|2uOhDMKjaa	Well you probably have nothing to worry about now, but plan to have regular checkups in the future. This very well could be hereditary, and you might want to have your entire family get checkups occasionally, that way if they did find cancer they can treat it in the early stages. You could always go to the doctor now and just see what he has to say about your health and risks of getting cancer.|`|AA10220566	ok, calm down, you probably dont have pancreaitc cancer. my dad got it 4 yrs ago at 56 and died 6 months later, my paternal grandmother has had it for 6 months now and shes still hanging in there...there may some genetic connections but its very hard to prove it and even if it is shown its very hard to to preventive care and screening. what you should do is try and maintain a healthy lifestyle... -eat right, exercise, dont smoke or drink.... also you should see a gastroenterologist about that pain but your pancreas is on the left side behind the stomach.|`|0nyWiro9aa	Promise me you will look into this although it's still in research and don't know if it's available where you live.

My Dad and brother have a back condition called degenerative disk disease.  I most likely have the same thing, but was never diagnosed.  Basically if we lift too much we throw our backs out for days.  We are all over 6 feet 4 inches, which is one cause for the back problems.  Bad posture and lifting heavy objects the wrong way is also a causative factor for back problems. <br>  <br>  If the pain is really bad, go to a real doctor.

1vaqtRI2aa	Taken from iVillage.com, and I agree. This is what I experienced.<br>  <br>  To make the pain of the speculum stop, try breathing exercises and ask the doctor if you can "lower" yourself onto the speculum. I've found this a million times more comfortable than if she just shoves it in there.<br>  <br>  Also, try talking with her. I did it and it put a lot of thought away from the discomfort. Which is what it is: uncomfortable. But it will go away soon!<br>  <br>  <br>  "A typical gynecological exam should include a full physical or at the very least should involve an assessment of the thyroid, breasts, heart, lungs, abdomen and pelvis. <br>  <br>  A thorough history is taken prior to the exam and the woman should be instructed in how the exam will be conducted, the collection of specimens, the sensations she may experience and what follow up might be necessary. <br>  <br>  Before the exam begins, ask for a mirror so that you can see what is going on and you can learn more about your anatomy. <br>  <br>  A metal or plastic speculum is placed into the vagina in order to do the pap smear. They come in several sizes so ask if your provider can use a small one, especially if you have never had intercourse. They should be kept warm in the drawer or the blades can be run under warm water for your comfort. <br>  <br>  The pap is a screening test performed for the detection of cervical cancer. The procedure varies somewhat depending on the site, but in general it is collected with two separate devices. One is a thin soft bristled brush which just fits into the cervical opening. It is gently turned and cells are collected and placed onto a glass microscope slide. The second device is usually a wooden spatula that is shaped to match the external contour of the cervix. This is passed gently around the outside of the cervix and again cells are placed onto the slide. This specimen is then sealed with a fixative or spray and sent to the cytology lab. Results are typically back within one to two weeks. <br>  <br>  Some women have no sensation during the pap smear and others experience it as a "pinching" or "tugging" feeling deep inside the vagina. Very few women have pain during the collection. Occasionally, the cervix will bleed for a few minutes after the pap, so a provider should explain this to the client and provide protection for her. <br>  <br>  Cultures may also be taken at this time. If a woman has symptoms of irritation, burning, itching or abnormal discharge, a sample of any secretions are taken and viewed under a microscope. Frequently, a diagnosis can be made in a few minutes and treatment and preventive strategies can be discussed. Women do not generally experience any discomfort during the specimen collections. A cotton swab is used for cultures which may be done for chlamydia, gonorrhea, or beta strep. A herpes culture, when collected from the actual lesion, is the only culture which may actually be "painful." <br>  <br>  The second part of the gynecological assessment is the bimanual or "pelvic" exam. This is done to feel the size, shape and consistency of the uterus, and tubes (if palpable) and the ovaries. Two fingers are introduced into the vagina and a hand is placed on the woman's lower abdomen. With both hands working in unison, the structures and any deviations from normal can usually be felt. Relaxing the abdomen and having an empty bladder make the exam easier to perform and much less uncomfortable. A recto-vaginal exam may be done at the end. The entire exam (which may take only five to ten minutes) may cause discomfort but it should not be painful. <br>  <br>  Make sure you explain to the nurse that this is your first exam so a special effort can be made to put you at ease and to explain the equipment and the sensations you will experience. <br>  <br>  Fear of this exam has resulted in significant morbidity and even mortality, as well as pregnancy. You might want to consider making your initial visit with a nurse midwife or nurse practitioner. This exam provides an important opportunity to discuss normal physiology and anatomy, to share concerns and do some preventive screening. "<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qLuodu3Raa	all it is is a cotton swab up your stuff it doesn't hurt|`|oB1TH9Auaa	Pap smears don't hurt - they are exactly what the name says. <br>  <br>  The doctor will use a very long q-tip to wipe on your cervix, this will give a sample of the cells of the cervix.  That q-tip will go to the lab and the doctor will get the report.<br>  <br>  Be sure to ask your doctor if you qualify for the HPPV vaccine (Gardisil), as it will help protect you against several types of cervical issues.
HcoYZdy1aa	Brand name medications that do not have a generic available is because of a patent on the medication by the drug company who owns it. Once that is expired, other drug companies are allowed to copy it. They use the same ingredients and make the same exact medication. <br>  <br>  <br>  They are exactly the same ingredients, just made by different drug companies. <br>  <br>  Every generic in United States that big pharmacies use are AB rated and FDA approved. For example (Walgreen, Wal-Mart, CVS,) <br>  <br>  There are few patients that swear only brand works and will pay extra for the brand. I agree there are rare instances where the generic might not work well as the brand. I believe it may be because the source of the ingredients used by the different companies come from different places. However there is no reason you shouldn't try generic|`|g6bBORHxaa	Name brands are just the fancier packaged and more expensive versions of the generic. Society leads us to believe the product is better when it is more expensive and more well-known. However, when it comes to drugs it doesn't matter. The medicine is the exact same compound. The reason that the name brand exists however, is because they were the first to develop or patent the drug. When the patent is still in existance generic drugs can't legally be made so the drug companies can hike up the prices to whatever they see fit. After the patent expires they can still have the price much higher because people will still end up getting it just because of the brand name recognition.|`|dHg78Phdaa	Name Brands are fancier looking and more expensive. Sometimes higher quality depending on what you are getting.<br>  <br>  Generics are basically the same thing, are not as glorious looking but they do get the job done.... for a cheaper price. Stick to Generics. <br>  <br>  The reason why there are generics is because of 4-7 years the patents on the specific drug run out, making it easy for other companies to adopt and sell the same product for cheaper.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  "Best Answer" If you liked it! :)
7oYpbSjIaa	this sounds nothing like diabetes.  he could be having side effects from the Adderall.|`|XayiqDyUaa	What is Diabetes? <br>  <br>  Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder which affects 18 million people in the United States, over two million of whom have its most severe form, childhood diabetes (also known as juvenile, type 1 or insulin-dependent diabetes). <br>  <br>  How do Insulin-Dependent and Adult-Onset Diabetes differ? <br>  <br>  Type 1 diabetes appears suddenly, most often in children and young adults, and progresses rapidly. In this form, the pancreas ceases to manufacture insulin, a hormone necessary to convert the food we eat into energy for the body. Victims of insulin-dependent diabetes must take one to four daily injections of insulin to stay alive. But insulin is not a cure. <br>  In adult-onset (type 2) diabetes, the pancreas can still make insulin and treatment is usually through oral medication and strict diet. <br>  Is diabetes serious and life-threatening? <br>  <br>  Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death by disease in the United States, killing close to 200,000 people each year. One in 16 Americans is afflicted. <br>  The mortality rate of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes increases dramatically after 15 years of disease duration. <br>  665,000 new cases of diabetes are diagnosed annually. <br>  Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in people between 20 and 70 years of age. <br>  What are the complications? <br>  <br>  Virtually every major organ system in the body can be damaged by diabetes. Complications can include blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, stroke, amputation of extremities, loss of nerve sensation, early loss of teeth, high-risk pregnancies and babies born with birth defects. <br>  <br>  Is Diabetes costly? <br>  <br>  The cost to the healthcare system for the medical treatment of diabetes and its complications is in excess of $100 billion per year. <br>  <br>  Diabetes can cause: <br>  <br>  Retinopathy: Nearly 39,000 Americans lose their sight to diabetes each year. <br>  Nephropathy: One out of three people with insulin-dependent diabetes develops kidney failure and the need for a kidney transplant. <br>  Arteriosclerosis: Diabetes can cause arteriosclerosis which leads to heart disease, gangrene and loss of extremities. People with diabetes are 2-4 times more likely to have heart disease than the general population. <br>  Neuropathy: Diabetic neuropathy leads to severe pain or loss of sensation in extremities. Intestinal problems may also occur. Over 54,000 lower extremity amputations are performed each year on people with diabetes. <br>  What are the symptoms of Diabetes? <br>  <br>  Insulin-Dependent <br>  <br>  Onset is usually sudden <br>  Frequent urination <br>  Excessive thirst <br>  Excessive irritability <br>  Extreme hunger accompanied by loss of weight <br>  Nausea and vomiting <br>  Weakness and fatigue <br>  <br>  Non-Insulin-Dependent <br>  <br>  May develop slowly <br>  Tingling or numbness in hands or feet <br>  Recurring or hard-to-heal skin, gum or bladder infections <br>  Fatigue <br>  Blurred vision <br>  Itching <br>  Any of the insulin-dependent symptoms

8hIUOajLaa	Sounds like you are doing just fine.<br>  You can also wrap the area with a bandage, as this provides support by bracing the arm.<br>  Time wise its hard to say, depends on you and what you did. Start to carefully exercise the forearm and if necessary put ice on immediately after, continue to do this every day and gradually get your strength back. Don't rush it or try do heavy movements as you will only hurt yourself more.<br>  Give it a few weeks.

Poke a hole in the capsule and apply. Your face will be sticky, but after a few days, you may see some improvement. I had so many scabs and now i just have one tiny scar. Keep using until you notice an improvement. Obviously, before applying again, wash your face to remove the residue of the oil. Use once a day.|`|822da6b7b24693d516953606bfb56517aa	you dont<br>  thats what a scar is<br>  its there forever<br>  haha sucks for you!|`|fkqPs9QRaa	you and me both have this problem.

I found out i had a chemical imbalance caused by my birth control Have you been anything differently  medication new stresses etc? . If you can, talk to a doctor. Talk to your husband and make sure he knows, and let him help you. Its not good to be alone on these things. Find someone you can talk to. Good luck!|`|AA12059837	You are human.  But you should know - death is very peaceful. I was at my husband's side when he died and it was peaceful.  Death is not the end but a new beginning. What you are feeling physically is a manifestation of your anxiety... Set your fear aside and live life.  Death will come when it is to come but we need to live now.<br>  You are not insane!|`|GWyKZ3aiaa	Sounds like a chemical imbalance that is causing you to have anxiety. Make an appointment with a Psychiatrist (MD) and have them prescribe you some mediacation such as Klonipin, Xanex etc you can take when you feel these feelings coming on.|`|dHYVE076aa	My boyfriend gets the same way.

Treatment for them is shown in section 8, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> PANIC: COMPREHENSIVE POST. Anxiety; see section 6.<br>  <br>   It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is a version for use in public places, (you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> refers: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Or Google: "neurofeedback; therapists" Herbal remedies, such as chamomile, passionflower, or St. John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect.|`|ETcBRko3aa	No.  Are you depressed?<br>  <br>  I think about killing myself every minute because I am really depressed.  Therapists suck but see a psychiatrist for antidepressants.

Its like an online personal trainer/nutritionist and its free.  The message boards can be really helpful in sticking to your goals.<br>  <br>  Goodluck<br>  <br>  You'ree 11 years old? Ok, well then you need to talk to your family and maybe even a doctor. Its not a good idea to go on a dramatic diet at that age because your still growing. At your age, you need the support of your parents as they are ones who buy the food for the household. To lose weight; give up the junk food and start exercising, simple as that. You could pick up a team sport like basketball to give the extra motivation.
6AjqyBTFaa	Eating:<br>  Try eating 6 small meals a day instead of 3 big meals. This keeps your metabolism going so it is always burning food. Put more vegetables into your diet and ditch the comfort eating.

You can find all these items cheap on Ebay.<br>  I find swimming to be best when loosing weight. I went from 60kgs to 55kgs on just swimming about 15-20 laps.

All the other symptoms make it sound like the flu, though, so I guess I'm no help. I would go to the doctor and get checked out.|`|VRSUyeqbaa	you might have a strep infection or tonsillitis, id go to the ER right away, could be serious|`|4i2e231Oaa	Sounds like streptococcus infection (better known as strep). If that's what it is get to a doc you'll need antibiotics to get rid of it. The white plaques on the tonsils are a definite indicator of strep.
HcoYZdy1aa	I wish there was a definite answer for this. Here is what my co-worker did<br>  <br>  Just last week, my co-worker lost her uncle.<br>  Everyone knew his time was coming and they were happy when it came because he was in so much pain. The nurses weren't giving him much pain medications because they wanted him coherent so he would be able to communicate with them all the time<br>  They struggled with spending time with him, taking care of him, watching him deteriorate for about 3 months<br>  <br>  The one thing he asked was that the family members not cry in front of him and continually make him laugh<br>  <br>  You have to be strong for your dad and make the most of what time is left which is not easy. However, you have to be the strong one for him and just do it<br>  <br>  Cry, Cry, and Cry. Try to get it out of the system. But in front of him, put on the happiest face you can and make his time left worthwhile<br>  <br>  Good luck, you and your dad will be in my prayers.|`|52cGZS3caa	I think the most important thing you can do and by far the hardest is to be as cheerful as possible around him - at least for as long as possible. You can probably take your cues from him as to how he prefers you to be acting. Also, minor things become very difficult for cancer sufferers and if you can watch for and take care of them before he has to that would be really important to him. I'm talking about such simple things as getting out of a chair to get a drink from the fridge - things like that. I have cancer myself and my kids are a tremendous blessing to me - I couldn't handle it without them. May God bless the both of you and I'll remember you in my prayers.|`|d5cd40a9a7f4215411f86af9ca4cea4eaa	you are doing the right things. you WILL mourn, but be grateful that you have this time with your dad. when hospice gets involved, listen to what they say...they are angels on earth and will help both you and your dad so very much.|`|GVT7bwDxaa	dont cry, be happy that he still is with you, dont cry to make him worry.<br>  Take him to another doctor, it might not be too late! :)
xk0GAkSEaa	I suppose it makes sense. People who have experienced something in a certain area usually grow up to be someone who helps said person.<br>  <br>  Some people who have been in extremely traumatic situations become Grief Counselors, because they have experience in that field.

On the contrary You have to enjoy sex with your wife only and with her consent. she should also get happiness in sex act. You are quite young and you need not go for medicines unnecessarily.
GWyKZ3aiaa	cleanse it good with peroxide and then use a topical anti-biotic cream on the wound. Do this 2-3 times daily. Keep it clean.

Trust me on this one.|`|G0zolaYMaa	have her talk to school counselor.|`|0QT8laMOaa	Write an letter to your councelor or go talk to her and tell her you want Hannah to get better but that she doesn't know where the information came from. They will keep it confident (secret) and Hannah will never know. You can from there try to help hannah if she doesn't push you away. Just stay strong and understand that she does have a problem and may deny it. Stick by her side no matter what. Thats what BFFs do for eachother. She is sick and really needs you the most now.|`|AA10220566	she might suffer from borderline personality disorder and during these times she may be suicidal, which is very serious. she needs professional help and you should try your best to get her to see someone. if not you should try really hard to maintain open communication with her so you can try and know whats going on. if she ever expresses suicidal ideas you should question her about it and if shes serious and has the means then you should call the police immediately and then contact her family.|`|Wad5ToEFaa	Talk to a responsible adult ASAP, or a Consuler.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you don't tell somebody soon it will get worse, or else tell their parents.<br>  <br>  Also talk to you friend too, I've gone through the same thing as hers.|`|hgabtLluaa	13??<br>  her dad needs to smack the living sh it outta her

bf5cDEyZaa	If the paralysis is caused by swelling in the surrounding tissue, it is likely temporary. If it is caused by a severed spinal cord, it is permanent - for now anyway... in the future, stem cell treatment might be able to reconnect the severed spinal cord, reversing the paralysis.<br>  <br>  There is a fairly new stem cell technique that can reconnect the severed spinal cord, as long as the treatment is given within 6 weeks of the injury. The procedure is currently done in Israel. <br>  In the USA, the FDA recently approved human clinical trials for stem cell treatment, they are currently recruiting patients. <br>  <br>  If you know someone with a recent spinal cord injury, I would gladly dig up the application info.
Dvawm8Ezaa	1200 calories is considered low calorie intake for someone on a diet, be careful you are not starving your body if you are eating 750 calories a day. Your body will start to store fat for survival. <br>  <br>  If you're sore it typically means your muscles are working themselves which is good! After awhile you won't be sore from working out.
hqFTWFc9aa	It is better not to use any over the counter product as it would make some patches to appear when the braces are removed.<br>  however Some of the basic home teeth whitening tip or methods of teeth whitening, used by people around the world are as follows:<br>  <br>  1. Application of a paste of lemon juice and salt in the yellowish tint of the teeth is a wonderful way of eradicating that dull color of the teeth.<br>  <br>  2. Rubbing the inner white part of an orange peel in the discolored teeth gives a lovely white shine.<br>  <br>  3. Regular use of paste of bi-carbonate of soda with water removes the surface stain from the teeth.<br>  <br>  4. Dried and powdered Bay leaves combined with dried orange peel also acts as an excellent whitener.<br>  <br>  All these home teeth whitening methods when done regularly can give an excellent result.|`|p2eXwYCHaa	yea it would look weird. i got mine off this past yr and since i just brushed them normally they were fine but if you whiten them while you have your braces on there is a chance that youre gonna have a rectangle on your teeth from the brackets. i would just advise you to wait till you get them off and then theyll all be more evenly white|`|5X9kaIOXaa	Well once you get your braces off, the area where the bracket was glued to your teeth will be the same color as it was before you got braces. So your teeth would be white except for one square on each tooth. I recommend waiting until you get them off.<br>  =]|`|v9XrDhR0aa	i don't know how sorry..|`|uf9pZFlzaa	You would be bleaching all of your teeth except for the part that's covered by your brackets - definitely not worth it because you'd end up having yellowish spots on your teeth when you got your braces off. Just wait until you get them off.|`|MtQ9ea2Uaa	No, not a good idea. The part where the brackets are will not be bleached white and will just leave the stains of where the brackets were.<br>  <br>  I would always brush my teeth when I had braces yet they would look disgusting! I was so worried that once I got them off they wouldn't be as white as I wanted them to be. Trust me, they're going to look so different once you get them off. My teeth were blinding white (given, it went down :(  ) and I got a kit to make them whiter.|`|qs6RMGvdaa	They have to take the braces off when you get them cleaned, then they have to put them back on.
d8JfuBt8aa	don't listen to the cancer scare thing and don't pop it.  Go to the doctors, most bumps on the tongue go away by themselves but sometimes they need a bit help.  The main thing is don't listen to the scare mongerers!!!!|`|4d40c0ff93b1f383704442cd34eff5a1aa	It probably is a cancer sore, do not pop it, get some meds or gargle with salt water.|`|yVRnOawlaa	pop it :)
0QT8laMOaa	Absolutely. There are many reasons why. It may be the up of the bipolar or the down or depression of it. There are many reasons.

Talk to your doc about changing your meds if you are still depressed.
2BmGwbvYaa	Take deep breaths (if you don't breathe they can't take blood) and make sure you have someone there to hold onto. Also don't tense up, the muscle just gets in the way, relax and pretend your somewhere else ect. Remember, that once it's over you can go home and you'll feel better.

bQ4RAi07aa	While Tylenol (acetaminophen) is normally a very safe drug -- hospitals use it all the time because it doesn't have the problems of most other painkillers -- if you take it when you're drunk, the alcohol interferes with the acetaminophen's metabolism, and you risk damaging your liver. <br>  <br>  Normally, if you take too much acetaminophen, the metabolic breakdown process gets overloaded and your body activates a backup system to help. Unfortunately, as this backup system metabolizes the acetaminophen, it produces a substance that is very toxic to your liver. A big overdose of acetaminophen alone can damage the liver permanently, and even kill you. <br>  <br>  In the presence of ethanol, this backup system is activated with a lot less of the drug. So even taking a few tablets after drinking could damage your liver. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, Advil (ibuprofen) and similar drugs (aspirin, Nuprin, Aleve, Vioxx, Celebrex), known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are OK to take (as directed). They not only reduce pain but actually suppress the inflammatory processes in the body. Plus, they do not cause liver injury the way the acetaminophen does. <br>  <br>  However, they are not without their own side effects. When you take high doses or use them for a long time, they may damage the stomach and promote bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, as ethanol does. <br>  <br>  If you want to avoid pharmaceuticals, there are a wealth of other cures that have been tried, including primrose oil, peppermint tea, honey with soda crackers, aromatherapy cocktails, raw owl's eggs and sheep lungs (favored by the early Romans), tangerine juice, orange juice, strawberries and Gatorade. Although there is no research supporting the claims, all these are said to help metabolize alcohol and restore the vitamins lost during dehydration -- or to "flush toxins." Crackers may help settle an uneasy stomach, and any noncaffeinated fluids may help if you have really lost a lot of water. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps always check with your dr. on any medical advice given.|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	No, that could cause stomach bleeding.|`|2JaqL91Baa	the alcohol that you drank last night is metabolized (gotten rid of) at about 1 drink per hour.  It is fine to take tylenol or excedrin the morning after you drink, as long as you are not still drunk.  Take the indicated dose of tylenol ( my personal recommendation) and drink with three full glass of water.  You have the headache because you are dehydrated.  Taking medicine alone will not do anything for you.|`|M6uIbKXRaa	its ok to take it as long as your not drinking tonight i take it when i have a hangover all the time and im still alive i also take asprin for it to that would probably be better|`|d5eb8d58dc84e054dc3f0c879a471deaaa	It can cause bleeding.

8hIUOajLaa	Practically, nothing.<br>  You cant lose any true weight (ie: fat or muscle) by sweating, all you lose is water.<br>  Your body needs water to love, so any water you have lost by sweating should be put back into your system by drinking more water, thus you don't truly lose any weight.<br>  You are more likely to lose by walking up and down the boardwalk all day, that is at least exercise.|`|N8g6scrPaa	it depends on how much you sweat and the Temperature of The room, but since sweat is Water weight  you might on average lose maybe a pound or half a pound per day|`|jw6Lpt37aa	drinking water will clear your body from all the toxic in your blood and that through the sweating so how much do you drink and that what will make the difference . so just keep drinking clean still water to get the most of it|`|KhfFeve9aa	Yeah, but it's just water-weight.<br>  You gain it back anyways, and don't try to stop drinking as much water, then you'll just be unhealthy.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	No. Because you're just losing "water weight"... -& you'll need to drink that BACK- in order to stay Healthy!

Although heart palpitations can be worrisome, they're often harmless. Common causes of heart palpitations include: <br>  <br>  1-Anxiety <br>  2-Stress <br>  3-Exercise <br>  4-Caffeine <br>  5-Nicotine <br>  6-Fever <br>  7-Hormone changes associated with menstruation, pregnancy or menopause <br>  8-Certain medications, such as pseudoephedrine, an ingredient in some cold and allergy medicines <br>  Often the cause of heart palpitations can't be determined. However, occasionally, heart palpitations can be a sign of a serious, underlying problem such as hyperthyroidism or an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Arrhythmias may include very fast heart rates (tachycardia), unusually slow heart rates (bradycardia) or an irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation).|`|nxMi4adjaa	try google or  webmd<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307190412AAErJ0y">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|vo6ZenTUaa	I'm not sure that I have ever had them but here is a link I found on webmd.<br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/search/search_results/default.aspx?query=heart%20palpitations&sourceType=undefined" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/search/search_resul...</a><br>  Hope it is helpful.

YAeHKy7Naa	well that's why i do it. i love it in every way...i don't have any reason for doing it except for the fact that i like the pain. i also like the rush that u get right before you do it and the when you do it you can feel your blood rushing out and to me that feeling is so incredible. so to answer your question...i cut because i like the pain and have no other reason for it. im in the same boat as you...i hate people who judge you by what you do because its like its your body so you should be able to do what you want with it|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	I did a few times when I was a teen.

Much happier now.|`|wU3mgjAKaa	Enjoying it isn't the sole reason why I self-injure, but sometimes that's part of it. I think every self-injurer has different motives. I cut because I want to feel, because I don't want to feel, for punishment, out of boredom, to feel in control, to make a point, to have something to take care of, to experience the euphoric feeling that is often present after self-injury takes place. Everyone is different. <br>  <br>  I realize that you do not want to be talked down, all I ask is that you please be safe.|`|LOfZNNdfaa	It seems like your looking for attention.  You say that no one can stop you, that you don't want to be talked down.  I ask you, then why bother telling us in the first place?  It's because you want attention.

I mean, I just don't see any appeal. It's a matter of preferences........I guess. Just, erm...try somewhere that's not obvious. Like lower stomach. Wow, that's bad advice.

44dcc209645e25a90756133f2c64c1e5aa	Migraines are the worst kind of headache anyone can have. To me they come as they please. I don't know why you're getting them all of a sudden but try a very dark room, no noise or light and see if that helps Did your doctor prescribed anything else besides Excedrin Migraine? There's a pill call Topamax that is suppose to prevent future migraines. Talk to your doctor about it. I often eat chocolate when I have a migraine and it helps. Very weird. Good luck!|`|GaHXxlS7aa	Many things can cause headaches, but if you don't have one when you go to bed, yet have one when you get up perhaps something around your bed is causing the problem. So thoroughly clean, dust, vacuum, pick up, and basically remove all dust from around your bed. Also, make sure your air filters are clean so when the heater/air kicks on you are breathing clean filtered air not the opposite. Other possibilities are allergies, or sinus infection, or grinding teeth in sleep. Hope you figure it out and soon. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and staying up late can cause migraines.

Some women get more wet than others. Some leave wet spots on the sheets, some don't. The amount of wetness women experience is unique to each one. Each woman is different. Women who squirt when they orgasm are rare, but wonderful. Women who squirt when they orgasm are not in control of this bodily function. It can be kinda of unsettling if it has never happened before. Don't be afraid of this action if it happens, and be glad that you can turn her on so much that she does this. I hope this helps.|`|rwdxGU7Saa	Normally it just happens on it's own.

While in some cases it has been reported that it has result in a permanent liver damage, in other cases where the victim was taking the dose for a long and continued period it has resulted in organ failure one by one.<br>  <br>  Some more side effects are unsteadiness, blurred vision, ringing in the ears, gastrointestinal, nausea plus vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, probable loss of blood in intestinal areas or stomach or both, headache, agitation, drowsiness, incoherence and confusion etc. Sometimes more serious symptoms are also noticed in some victims though very rare such as seizure, gastrointestinal bleeding, metabolic acidosis, respiratory depression, hyperkalaemia, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, coma, hepatic dysfunction, renal failure, cyanosis, and cardiac arrest etc. Until and unless the victim is allergic to ibuprofen, there is a slim chance that the victim would die from Ibuprofen Overdose.<br>  <br>  Ibuprofen Overdose can cause stinking vomiting, profuse sweating, severe abdominal pain, and can land you straight in the mental hospital for attempted suicide, where you may be medicated with things like liquid carbon or charcoal. Charcoal has the ability to absorb the drug before it can enter the systemic circulation. Another form of treatment to fight Ibuprofen overdose is gastric lavage which is not very popular, but is considered if the intake is potentially life threatening. This treatment can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion of Ibuprofen.|`|zTeW6BIIaa	my friend (male, 15, about 150 lbs) took 14 ibuprofen in one day. he tore something in his stomach.<br>  <br>  don't take more than 6 a day. not a good idea.|`|EN32vSsCaa	Yep.  Kidney failure.|`|zvN64drnaa	yeah it will leave your liver damaged|`|DM2M5LK4aa	Yes.  My friend's dad is a paramedic and saw a case a year ago just like this.  A young girl wanted attention so she thought it would be a good idea to take a handful of ibuprofen and hospitalize herself.  Well, she got what she wanted.  This drastic overdose of ibuprofen in her body caused her to need immediate hospitalization after taking the dosage.  She was in unbelievable pain as her liver was beginning to shut down and suffered for about 2 days.  Eventually, and inevitably, her liver did shut down and she died in the hospital.

1vaqtRI2aa	Simply: Every vulva is different in shape, size, color and length. However, it's not supposed to be a perfect circle. It's a more oval like shape. So yes, that is very very normal.<br>  <br>  Unless you notice any changes in your vulva and vagina, don't sweat it. Changes include a change in length, size, strange and out of the ordinary "fish" smell, color, shape, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck! And don't worry about what guys will think if they see it when you do become sexually actice- guys seem to think all vulvas are gorgeous and are just lucky to be there.|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	yes..you are fine...everyones is different..not like i would know but its obvious there is no "perfect" vaj-j.lol.<br>  but you are fine and its fine how it is..i talked to my obgyn and complained about how mine looked and she said mine was fine<br>  and no one has a perfect shaped one..dont worry.|`|764Hudunaa	no guy will ever complain how you look , its what makes you unique! all of them are different yours sounds normal to me ive seen many|`|BIL1AHIiaa	i've learned all vagina's look stupid, none of them look the same, and you will never be happy with it. haha, but yeah, its normal, everybody's different.|`|Lsy3tLUKaa	And you're worried why?

ZkwtldYlaa	You should be happy with what you have.<br>  <br>  However if you really feel the need to increase your penis size,then you should try out these :<br>  <br>  Here are four good natural penis enhancement techniques I recommend for rookies. Done properly and consistently, they should add close to an inch or two to your penis in six weeks.<br>  <br>  1. Penis stretches. This one is very simple. Just take your flaccid penis and stretch it as far out in front of your body as it will go. Do it gently and gradually and hold it there for thirty seconds. Rest ten seconds between sets and repeat this at least ten times.<br>  <br>  2. Jelqing. This is another great technique for rookies. Get your penis halfway erect, apply lubrication, and grip it tightly at the base with the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Slowly slide that hand up the shaft toward the tip, pushing as much blood into your penis as possible. When you reach the tip, immediately grip the base the same way using the other hand and repeat. Do this nonstop for ten minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Ulis. This is a great exercise to increase girth. It is also very easy and does not take much time. Achieve a full erection and grip the base of your penis the same way you would if you were jelqing. <br>  <br>  Squeeze as hard as you can without causing discomfort. Your penis shaft should swell and your penis head should get big and shiny. Hold for ten seconds and rest for ten seconds. Repeat this three or four times.<br>  <br>  Do this routine every other day and make sure you warm your penis up before each workout by wrapping it in a hot washcloth for five minutes.<br>  <br>  4. A larger penis can be achieved with the use of penis enhancers. There are many forms of penis enhancement products such as pills, patches and topical oils. However, one unique natural product that can produce significant results and makes use of the body's natural abilities comes in the form of a liquid called super-vir <a href="http://www.super-vir.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-vir.com</a><br>  <br>  Always remember, if you are not satisfied with what you were born with, it is never too late to do something about it!|`|GvEsaVYeaa	As an aethist, I believe that anyting that makes promises and goes under the name "... bible" is usually false.

Sounds like Strep to me.<br>  I have a sore throat all the time from nasal drip, but it is not intolerable....just aggravating and slightly painful.|`|bQ4RAi07aa	according the symptoms you have mentioned especially regarding the white spots on throat so I advice you get some advice from medical care professional just to get the accurate diagnose and therefore the proper treatment which would probably be some sort of antibiotics such as penicillin or amoxicillin. It often happens that those strep throat symptoms along with those white spots on throat go away on their own but I would always advice some antibiotics to be taken for if those white spots on throat are caused by some bacteria that could also trigger some more severe complications such as rheumatic fever, ear infections, joint pains and so on...|`|AA11833633	responder Leslie is totally right!..most likely strep or maybe something worse...see a specialist ear nose and throat..what is wrong with your doctor...this is not normal..so why settle for a crappy diagnosis....go to the ER if you have to...please go|`|xO1LQWbZaa	Your throat could be sore from a few things.  You could have a toncil infection or algeries. You should see a doctor ans ask questions.  If your lymph nodes are enlarged,  you should see a doctor. it could be serous.

AA10358331	If you're at your house then there really should be nothing wrong with wearing a pad. The toilet paper will leak.. I promise you. Wear tight fitting underwear with your pad so it doesn't move when you walk.. and 2 pairs of shorts :) If you are really worried about leaking on the bed, sleep on a towel. <br>  If your friend finds out.. its totally fine. She's a girl too and I'm sure she has dealt with the same thing too. <br>  <br>  Yes a pad will last through the night if your period isn't super heavy.

tvtZV32oaa	700 calories are not healthy at all <br>  just make substitutions<br>  like when you grab a drink, try watering it down with water, or just drink water because it has no calories.<br>  your diet (if adult) should consist of about 2,000 calories a day.  <br>  avoid trans fats because theres healthy fat, and not healthy fat, and trans fats become not healthy fat. <br>  eating lots of fruits and veggies are not only great for you, but they substitute as a potentially unhealthy snack, try eating more of these because they have lots of vitamins and minerals to make you feel awesome =D.<br>  also, dont cut out protein, because it is vital if you are building muscle tissue, and make sure you have vitamin D (milk has it in it now) so you can better absorb calcuim. (note if you are working out, and you notice that you are gaining weight instead of loosing wieght, don't worry, you are just building muscle tissue, and that is a good thing!)<br>  its not how much you it, it is what you eat<br>  (you are what you eat)<br>  so just try eating healthier, not barely anything at all<br>  (also it is better for you to eat 6 tiny meals in a day instead of 3 large meals)|`|P5nrBj1baa	Well it depends on your height and body weight, and given that you are a girl that certainly allows for lesser amounts of calorie intake.  Nevertheless,  If you can maintain that little amount of calories and still have energy or not faint - I would see no problem with it.  However, I'm not a nutritionist nor a doctor, thus heed my advice lightly.|`|6FOKld0uaa	well you should mostly be worrying about what you eat<br>  and not worrying about the calories.<br>  Truth be told, (haha sounded really old!)<br>  your daily diet isnt as healthy as it oculd be.<br>  Try subbing the grilled cheese for something healthier<br>  and drinks as just water and milk<br>  and cut out popcorn.<br>  but do you feel like its right?<br>  as long as youre full i think its fine|`|LY1k1xvLaa	No! I did the same thing all last summer and I lost about 30 pounds in 2 months. You'll start getting very depressed and miserable. You will barely have enough energy to go to the grocery store.

13kMNf0faa	1. Depends on how radically Christian you are. I imagine that if Christians (or anyone else for that matter) have no problem dropping bombs during a war, then having an orgasm is entirely permissible.<br>  2. No, you're not gay. Since you're going through puberty, you get turned on by nearly anything, including "bulges." Entirely normal/natural.<br>  3. When I was 14 I believe, but I don't feel comfortable sharing that sort of information publicly.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you obviously had an orgasm, and what came out was semen, also called cul\/l. Just don't get addicted to that online pornographic stuff, now Christianity would be perfectly justified warning against that.|`|Z4OeKTToaa	1 no<br>  2 could be bi curious<br>  3 fkin wicked<br>  4 i no there aint one but msg me|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	just because you like looking at sexual images it doesnt mean that you are gay. you are going through changes and its perfectly normal to be curious about new things. <br>  <br>  abo ut the christian thing, i have a ton of christian friends and they all masturbate. they say that they wait for sex until they are married because of sharing that intimacy with someone else. but when you masturbate you arent affecting anyone. it feels good and its natural and its healthy and do it all you want:)|`|eELS8zSRaa	1. No<br>  2. You could be, doesn't really matter either way. You could be bi or something and not even know it. It isn't something that you should be ashamed of none the less.<br>  3.

Can't share.|`|aAcjC22gaa	1) No it isn't bad to have had an orgasm before marriage, you are just supposed to wait to have sex <br>  2.)

I just heard about orgasms in school and tried to see if it was true|`|DW9EHSUKaa	OK OK OK OK, HOLD ON, DO NOT BELIEVE THE CHRISTIAN STUFF, SAYING YOU CANT MASTURBATE IS A BUNCH OF CRAP... OK? ITS LIKE SAYING YOU CANT SCRATCH YOUR NOSE, SO MASTURBATE, IT FEELS AMAZING AND IT MAKES YOU HAPPY AND IT IS ACTUALLY HEALTHY. NO, YOU ARE NOT GAY, MOST GUYS DO THIS ITS CALLED BEING CURIOUS AND YOU ARE GOING THROUGH PUBERTY. NO IT IS NOT BAD TO ORGASM BEFORE MARRIAGE.|`|GvEsaVYeaa	1) Not Christian, can't tell you.<br>  2) You may be bi. Very, very few people are straight.

You are experiencing the development of your sexual awareness. God created humans to be sexual beings. Satan has worked very hard to destroy the wonder of God's creation. If Satan can get us messed up about our sexuality, he'll do it...but it's our choice. Sure we can choose to prefer sexual partners who are men or women. It's our choice.<br>  <br>  If you want to have gay relationship, you will. If you want straight relationships you will. Now to answer your questions.<br>  <br>  1) Bringing yourself to an organism before marriage, you may become somewhat self-satisfying in your sexual desires; however, I do think that masturbating as long as it is not an overpowering "horniness" is OK.<br>  2) Do YOU think you're gay? All the literature I've read, all guys wonder about their sexuality at one time or another. Checking out other guys in the locker room. "Sizing" yourself up to other guys is "normal" and "natural" for males of all ages. As long as you do not have sexual desire for other men...then you may be gay.<br>  3) Are you requesting other men to tell you about their first orgasms? If that's what you're wishing, this is not the place for that. If you really want me to tell you my experience...please Email your request.
t2R3mEMoaa	I'd like you to think that there are people out there that actually do care. Some of us have had it pretty rough in our lives and others don't know what it's like to lose a friend to say nothing of being in great emotional or mental pain. This is you and it was me, but I found the hope I needed to hang on, way down deep in my heart. I believe people are basically good and try to be decent, but then someone comes along and alters our life with the touch of their hand or the feel of their breathe, and our life goes away to where we don't know or understand. I think you are one of these little ones whose life has been altered into something you no longer understand. But like so many others, we got through, we found hope and someone reached back and took us by the hand and we were given a second chance at life. Your hand must reach out for someone to take it and help you. I wish I could but I'm here and you are there, but there are others who are just a phone call away. There is a children's/youth hot-line. Use it and fight to get your life back and then keep going no matter how difficult it may seem, there is good waiting for you. It has to begin with you. Believe in yourself enough to know you are meant to be here and you have much to offer this world. It's your choice now.|`|k5X78IM3aa	Perhaps you should talk to a mental health professional...a therapist, psychologist, or maybe even a psychiatrist.  I have found them to be very helpful.|`|kTCVysn7aa	You could be depressed, a lot of girls go through that in early high school.

cv222GL1aa	The healthiest way to lose weight is neither crash diets nor bursts of exercise. The body likes slow changes in terms of food and exercise.<br>  <br>  For example, someone who has not exercised for years should not rush into running miles a day or pounding the treadmill. Not only will the struggle to do so leave you feeling disheartened and demotivated, you're also far more likely to injure yourself and set your fitness levels back further.<br>  <br>  The same goes for people who suddenly start starving themselves. Diets that severely restrict calories or the types of food 'allowed' can lead you to be deficient in the nutrients and vitamins that your body needs.<br>  <br>  So if you need to lose weight, what should you do?<br>  <br>  Energy needs and weight loss<br>  <br>  Your body uses food for energy. It stores any excess energy as fat. This means if you eat more food than your body needs for daily activities and cell maintenance, you will gain weight.<br>  <br>  To lose weight, you need to get your body to use up these stores of fat. The most effective way to do this is to:<br>  <br>      * reduce the amount of calories you eat<br>  <br>      * increase your levels of activity.<br>  <br>  This is why experts talk about weight loss in terms of diet and exercise.<br>  <br>  Introduce changes gradually<br>  <br>  Small changes can make a big difference. One extra biscuit a week can lead you to gain 5lb a year – cut that biscuit out of your diet and you'll lose the same amount.<br>  <br>  You are also more likely to stick to, say, swapping full-fat milk for semi-skimmed or making time for breakfast each morning than a diet that sets rules for all foods.<br>  <br>  You should think of weight loss in terms of permanently changing your eating habits. While weight-loss goals are usually set in term of weeks, the end game is to sustain these changes over months and years.<br>  <br>  Increase your activity levels<br>  <br>  Someone who increases the amount they exercise, but maintains the same diet and calorie intake, will almost certainly lose weight.<br>  <br>  No matter if you hate gyms - even light exercise such as a short 20 minute walk will be beneficial if done most days of the week.<br>  <br>  Every single time you exercise more than usual, you burn calories and fat.<br>  <br>  There are lots of ways to increase the amount of activity you do. Team sports, racket sports, aerobics classes, running, walking, swimming and cycling will all improve your fitness levels.<br>  <br>  Find something you enjoy that's easy for you to do in terms of location and cost. You are then more likely to build it into your routine and continue to exercise, despite inevitably missing the odd session through holidays, family commitments, etc.<br>  <br>      * Get out and about at the weekend. Leave your car on the drive and walk to the shops. Try to incorporate longer walks into outings to the park, coast or countryside and take a picnic so you are in control of what you are going to eat that day.<br>  <br>      * Every extra step you take helps. Always use the stairs instead of the lift, or get off the bus a stop before the usual one and walk the rest of the way.<br>  <br>      * Use commercial breaks between TV-programmes to stand up and do exercise, or consider using an exercise bicycle in the living room while watching your favourite programme.<br>  <br>  Reduce your calorie intake<br>  <br>   <br>  What is overweight?<br>  Doctors use BMI to assess weight.<br>  A BMI of 18.5-25 is healthy.<br>  If you have a BMI of more than 25 you are overweight.<br>  Over 30 is obese.<br>  Over 40 is morbidly obese.<br>  To calculate your BMI, you'll need to know your weight in kilos and your height in metres, then follow the example below.<br>  1. Multiply your height by itself, eg 1.7x1.7= 2.89.<br>  2. Divide your weight (eg 80kg) by this figure.<br>  3. 80 ÷ 2.89= 27.7.<br>  27.7 is the BMI.<br>  If you are overweight, you can't continue with your current eating habits.<br>  <br>  It's not possible to reduce body fat while eating lots of food, cakes and sweets. This doesn't mean you can never have any treats, but you need to learn how to limit these foods to small quantities - say, for special occasions.<br>  <br>  In terms of weight-loss, you can get your body to use up existing stores of fat by eating less and making healthier choices.<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean crash diet (anything less than 1500 calories), which usually ends up with you either getting weaker or giving up in desperation. Quick-fix diets can lead to a yo-yoing effect of drastic weight loss followed by weight gain, resulting in a vicious cycle.<br>  <br>  There are no shortcuts to losing weight in a healthy and reasonable way.<br>  <br>  Eating 300 to 500 calories less per day should lead to a loss of between one and two pounds per week. This is a realistic target. It may seem slow, but would add up to a weight loss of more than three stone in a year.<br>  <br>  Fat contains the most amount of calories out of all the food types (protein, carbohydrates), so a good way to achieve this is to cut down on fatty foods and eat more wholegrain bread, fruit and vegetables.<br>  <br>  Below are ways to reduce calorie intake without having to alter your diet signific|`|4d3Md9pnaa	...what?<br>  If you lose weight too fast, you're just going to bounce back to your old weight :/|`|biKMQ2I1aa	OK...sooo..you need to lose weight...what is the question...this just looks like a statement of facts|`|xQsMPtFGaa	how about you use punctuation so i can understand that|`|u0S5N5wDaa	try weight watchers... they have a really good program...|`|v811KD7raa	stop eating junk food eat more fruit and veggies and do some exercise|`|fuji1c1Aaa	Just minimize your portions. Cut foods that are high in sugars or carbs like soda (or limit yourself to 3 diet sodas per day if you must) and bread. Eat a larger breakfast (studies have shown that eating eggs for breakfast decreased peoples appetite throughout the day) but keep your other meals small. Drink a lot of water throughout the day preferably with ice. Your body will burn more calories if you drink cold water. Try to eat foods that contain a lot of water (veggies like lettuce and celery) also eat foods with high fiber. Snack on almonds or something else high in fiber.<br>  EXERCISE! Any activity that is out of your usual routine will help. Start off by walking an extra mile or dance around your house.|`|5NYTZyclaa	be balimac or aneraxic|`|cik8brUsaa	do a sqat for 10 minites a day
7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	The exercising won't actually make your legs skinnier, but it won't make them exactly bulk up either.  What'll happen is they'll be slimmer.  Meaning, more toned.  The cruches actually help your abs.  If you keep up with the 100 crunches, you'll eventually notice an outline of abs, usually you'll start seeing about a "4-pack."  And the wall sits will help tone your upper legs.<br>  <br>  Eventually, you will also see some weight loss if you're eating right.  Just don't expect it right away because muscle does weigh more than fat.
0e3034d2280fb2b424be0eff3932f8e1aa	It's unlikely that you are eating right and the brackets come off your teeth. You have to cut all your food into bite size pieces, avoid hard or sticky foods and chew slowly. Avoid touching the brackets and chewing on things (like pens, pencils, fingernails). <br>  <br>  The brackets are placed on teeth with a cement that bonds to the enamel.  Unless excessive force is put on the bracket, it should stay on. <br>  <br>  If you are looking for an 'excuse' to tell the orthodontist why you keep knocking the brackets off I have a better solution:  Why don't you just do what you are supposed to do so you can get through the treatment in a reasonable time? The more you knock brackets off, the longer the treatment takes because you can't progress as you should.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5GcmU8gNaa	They should not come off you need to make sure you cut your food like for a baby and do not chew on pens pencils nails etc. Don't brush to hard or rough. Do not make up an excuse for your orthodontist you need them to trust you. Just tell the truth.

xZavLsF4aa	Moles are growths on the skin that are usually brown or black. Moles can appear anywhere on the skin, alone or in groups. Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. These cells are called melanocytes, and they make the pigment that gives skin its natural color. There are various types of moles, and most types aren't dangerous.<br>  <br>  Freckles are small brown spots usually found on the face and arms.

It isn't "just a phase".  <br>  <br>  I think you feel a little over shadowed by your sister.  Is it possible for you to go to another school?  Maybe there you could establish your own identity and you won't feel like you have to compete with your sister and her image all of the time.  <br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with not being like your sister!  I am sure that you have been lumped together all of your lives.  I'll bet people in you family even refer to you two as "the twins"  there by effectively melding you two into a single entity.  Find something that your sister doesn't do...maybe volunteer to tutor younger kids, read to the elderly, just something that will take you out of yourself, get you doing for others, and forging ahead with your own life.  It wouldn't hurt to talk to someone outside your family, such as a guidance counselor or your doctor, either.

g6bBORHxaa	The placebo effect doesn't only apply to medicine. It is basically the theory that when you think something is happening in your own body it actually does (to some extent). However, it usually applies to when you take medicine that actually has no chemical effect in your body but you are lead to believe that it does. Therefore you think you have a prescription for your anxiety (you really have sugar pills) and you become less anxious due to the placebo effect.|`|a3bq277Gaa	It's medicine they give you.

In studies some patients respond to a placebo the same way the respond to real pain medication.

It is used to test the effectiveness of a drug against something that is known.  In this case, the known is nothing.  The doctor knows what "nothing" will do for the patient.  The reason that this is used is because the doctor needs to "trick" the patient into thinking that they are possibly getting the medication in order to test its effectiveness.  The mind is a powerful thing and can impair test results if the patient knows that he/she is not getting an active drug.
iAv9P3HTaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Do NOT stop taking the medication without talking to your doctor.<br>  Every individual reacts differently to antidepressants and anxiety medication.Sometime it takes long months till one finds the right medication which can have some side effects.<br>  <br>  In case of a panic attack,<br>  use these simple steps over and over again until you become the master of your thoughts and emotions.You create your panic attacks not your environment .<br>  Take full responsibility.<br>  <br>  I was suffering from panic attacks for 14 years.<br>  I did a lots of research and reading on the subject.<br>  <br>  Here is a six-step approach to self-control when dealing with an  anxiety attack:<br>  <br>  1.ACCEPT--Recognize that you are feeling anxious.Accept your body feelings as a symptom of your anxiety and a sign that something is bothering you.<br>  <br>  2.PERMISSION--Give yourself permission to feel anxious about whatever it is that is bothering you."Of course I feel anxious because.... and it is okay to have anxiety.I know what this is and why I feel this way."<br>  <br>  3.BREATHE-- First, inhale through your nose slowly for two-seconds,mentally counting one, one-thousand, two ,one- thousand.then exhale through your mouth to mental count of four-second-again by one-thousands.Do this for at least 60-seconds.<br>  <br>  4.INNER DIALOGUE--Use truthful, positive dialogue to talk yourself through  the anxious time.It WILL pass. Examples of dialogue might be,"It's just anxiety.It will go away. I will not lose control.<br>  I can still go about my business feeling spaced-out.It won't hurt me."<br>  <br>  5.DISTRACT--Get busy.Do something to release some of this self-induced stimulation.Your body is like a car in high gear with the brakes on .Don't just sit there! Walk,jog, clean closets -but do something.Distract yourself from the way you are feeling.<br>  <br>  6.LET TIME PASS-- and try to see a little humor in the way you feel.You may feel weird ,you don't look weird.Give yourself permission to feel weird for a little while. It is no big deal.Try to figure out what is really bothering you. Is it some type of conflict that you don't want to deal with?Is it a scary thought? Is it a ridiculous expectation you have about yourself? How about the television program you watched  last night?What is bothering  you?<br>  <br>  <br>  It takes time and lots and lots of practice.But the only way to stop fearing panic and anxiety attacks is to experience them .Then, work your way through them and begin to see that they won't hurt you.<br>  <br>  There is no need to avoid or fight .<br>  <br>  YOU are your safe place and your safe person .<br>  YOU can make yourself feel better.<br>  <br>  Feel good!<br>  <br>  Praise to Lucinda Bassett !|`|k5X78IM3aa	I take meds for mental health issues too.  I have found that there are some meds I cannot take.  They have an adverse effect.

I would suggest talking to the doctor about this to see if there are still other meds that might be better suited.  Good luck.|`|AA12059837	Medications take a while to kick in but make sure you keep track of when you start what and what symptoms you feel and what side effects.  Some can make it worse and some can make it better.  Don't stop without talking to the doctor.<br>  I would suggest some hypnotherapy to find a way to control the anxiety.

rcPnnfmmaa	Turning white is typical for scar tissue. The same thing will happen anywhere on your body. I can't imagine going through life without acquiring scars; consider yourself lucky that you did not know this.<br>  <br>  A hard round lump that's probably turning red is an ingrown hair. Sometimes a hair will become meshed in with a wound as it heals. I just open them with a very clean knife. If you ever develop a similar problem from ordinary shaving and clogged pores a warm washcloth will open things up.<br>  <br>  A diffuse jagged lump is a mass of scar tissue. Usually wounds heal back to the level of the surrounding skin, but some (especially large ones or those that become infected) take on a mottled lumpy texture. I have some on the palms of my hands from an old injury.|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	Nope, as long as it doesn't look infected. I got a scar on my finger and what your describing looks similar to my scar.

W1tx1p2iaa	I think OT will go the way of PT just as they did with the masters degree.  There is a lot of information to cram into a 2 year graduate degree.  OT as in PT needs to learn more and more information such as evidence based medicine.  DPT graduates are more prepared with more clinical time than an MPT.  OTD will be the degree of the future.  Unfortanely the salaries have not improved with the degree but I think they will|`|ShhSpZjJaa	In my opinion, there aren't any advantages. I considered going back to school after I get my master's in OT for a while, but it's only really needed if you plan on teaching at a university. and in the school systems, pay is based on your degree level, so you'd be making at least 6 figures.  That's it! If you are in the clinical field, don't bother, it is a waste.

In fact I'm still kinda sick. I went to the doctor because I smoke and I was freaking out.<br>  <br>  So, they did a chest x ray and said I didn't have pneumonia or bronchitis.

E64juLwJaa	Buy Fix:put a dab in a container add hot water and hang over it with your face your head covered with a towel:breath in deep:you will cough ike crazy but the stuff in your throat will dissolve.Keep your eyes closed otherwise they will hurt.<br>  If you cannot buy fix:buy very strong mentholated cream.<br>  Success:Colors|`|0TT5q0cUaa	few tips to cure cough at home:<br>  Increasing humidity in the air helps relieve coughing. A vapourizer and a steamy shower are two ways to increase the humidity. <br>  <br>  Drink extra fluids to help thin secretions and make them easier to cough up. <br>  <br>  Glyceryl guaiacolate (guaifenesin) is available without prescription and may help liquefy the mucous. Drink lots of fluids if taking this medication.<br>  <br>  When a cold and a stuffy, runny nose accompany the cough, it is often caused by mucous dripping down the back of the throat. A decongestant that opens the nasal passages will relieve this postnasal drip, and is the best treatment for that type of cough. <br>  <br>  Decongestants such as phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine or combinations of these two decongestants are available as over-the-counter cold medications. Don't give decongestants to a child under six years of age unless prescribed by the doctor. It is important to talk to your physician before using any cough medications for children under two. <br>  <br>  If you have high blood pressure (hypertension), consult the doctor before taking decongestants. <br>  <br>  Coughs due to chronic postnasal drip are probably caused by either sinus infection or allergy. If allergy is the cause, it is typically treated by avoiding the trigger (allergen) that is causing the allergy. In addition, anti-histamines and a steroid nasal spray are sometimes used to suppress the allergic inflammation. <br>  <br>  Dry, tickling coughs can be relieved by sucking on cough lozenges or hard candy. (However, never give a lozenge or hard candy to a child under 3 years old because it is a choking hazard.) <br>  <br>  Codeine is a very effective cough suppressant, but has some side effects, can lead to physical dependence and addiction and requires a prescription. <br>  <br>  Dextromethorphan (such as in Vick's Formula 44 of Robitussin DM) is an effective cough suppressant that is available without prescription.|`|2JaqL91Baa	That sounds pretty bad.  You sound like you have a very bad cold.  The normal cold and flu medication will help for the cold symptoms, but for the throat you need something different.  Try guafenisin.  It is called "mucinex" and is available over the counter in many pharmacies.  It will be in your cough and cold section.  Use as directed on the box and drink with a full glass of water.  <br>  <br>  It will cost you probably about 10-15 dollars.  Remember, if things get really bad, you  HAVE to see a doctor.  Don't be cheap about your health.
0c63fdd0630be2f6cbd717d497ab2474aa	A certain amount and quality of vaginal discharge is normal for all women. I suspect that this has more to do with you going through puberty than anything else. If you're having any pain or itching, then you should go to the doctor. But otherwise, don't worry about it.|`|AA10358331	Nope. Discharge is the body natural way to cleanse the vagina. Since its an open portal to the world the body uses acid and the discharge to cleanse and kill any bacteria that enters into it.|`|40jOMwENaa	i have that problem too. but ive come to learn many things about it. its just 'gina cleaning herself out. you may start to have a bacterial infection[your pH is out of wack, not serious problem to fix]. the only time you should be worried is if it is some funky color or smell. if it starts to have a cottage cheese look and/or the outer is itchy, dont worry, its just a yeast infection. sex can also cause you to discharge alittle more then usual[if your doing it]. try keeping it really clean and dry down there. <br>  <br>  ive been on an antibiotic for my skin for over a year now, i have alot of discharge, i have yeast infections that last for weeks sometime months. at first i thought i might have an STD, but i did alot of research and got tested and found it was my antibiotic that is causing it.  i have to keep it REALLY clean and very dry all the time. but sometimes i get bacterial infections, its like really watery discharge with a yellowish color[like pee] that comes from the vagina[ not the pee whole]. it clears up the same as the yeast infections.<br>  <br>  all i can say is. keep it very clean and dry.|`|OuAyBZQmaa	are u sexually active? sometimes it is normal. during my whole pregnancy i had discharge...its gross but hey dr said that was normal at the time.|`|ZOzPOPJ7aa	its all good (:
f8mLpPXlaa	Yeah it's just your laryngitis resolving. If it doesn't clear up in a few days or if you cough up any color mucous other than white or clear you might want to call your doctor. Keep checking your temperature for a couple of days, rest and drink plenty of fluids.

1vaqtRI2aa	The longer you wait to take the morning after pill, the less effective it is. I've taken it about 5 hours after unprotected sex and didn't become pregnant, and didn't have any problems. However, everyone's different.<br>  <br>  The pill indeed screws with your period, and it was definitely normal what happened. This happened to my friend.<br>  <br>  Just pay attention to your period and see if you get it.

Now if you were already pregnant before you took the Plan B it wont work at all! I will say this your already a week late.. if your not on birth control plan b will really mess with your cycle. I would wait several more days take another test or go to the doctor. The doctor would be able to help you more than a pregnancy test can! :) i hope i was of some sort of help to you! Good luck with everything.. and i hope all goes well for you!
zLpsu8GBaa	Here are three things that I did growing up to improve my BB skills as well as my fitness while doing the drills....<br>  <br>  1. Jumping over a yardstick suspended by two orange parking cones. Jump back and forth over the yardstick. Do it for one minute at a time. Will help your aerobics, but also will increase your vertical jump.<br>  <br>  2. Dribble basketball length of court in between chairs set up at specific intervals. Pretend the chairs are individuals you are trying to keep  the basketball away from. Good aerobic activity and also helps improve your basketball dribbling abilities as well. <br>  <br>  3. George Mikan drill. Hookshot layups over and over again underneath the basket for one minute at a time or until you are absolutely tired. <br>  <br>  After each of these drills my old basketball coach would make me shoot 10 free throws. If I made 10 then he would knock a certain percentage off each drill. If I made 9, a different percentage. If I made less than 9, then I would continue at the same rate.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, I became a great jumper, rebounder, dribbler (for a big guy, 6'5") and free throw shooter<br>  <br>  Earned a college basketball scholarship, which helped put me through college without my parents paying an arm and a leg.|`|qzRDh8Rgaa	Basketball exercises, like go to a football field nearby.<br>  Do high knee run, kick you butt running,frankenstein like kick your leg up to your arms reached out, jogg then run then sprint for 40 yards, gain explosive movement by running then every 10 yards do like a quick move right and then left, kinda like a cross over or a football juke.....<br>  <br>  Get your body fat down and you will gain speed and quickness.|`|qpXPJ1pLaa	Work on your coordination skills for bball for a set time each day.. whatever you need more help with.

lvqrtRoVaa	My cousin recently chipped her tooth, & she just went to the dentist, but it wasn't a big deal so all they did was filled it up or whatever.<br>  <br>  But in your case, if the nerve is exposed, you are most likely going to need a root canal. But please, don't get worried because I just got a root canal done, & I swear, it only hurt a tiny bit. People say it hurts, but that's just a myth because in the old times they used to hurt but the technology now makes it much easier & less painful. <br>  <br>  If you are feeling any pain I suggest you take some advil or tylenol to ease the pain a bit. <br>  <br>  As for brushing your teeth, don't apply too much pressure on the teeth that are chipped for now. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped,<br>  <br>  =).|`|giBfNMX6aa	If the nerve was exposed, you'd know it as you would be in excruciating pain.  It's OK to wait until you can get to the dentist, but you do need to be careful - like I wouldn't bite into an apple or anything that hard.  Your tooth hurts when you put pressure on it because the dentin is exposed.  (Dentin is the layer under the enamel.)  Good luck.  Oh, yeah, there's no way to grow it back.  Sorry.|`|mjC5XldXaa	Get to a dentist asap.  He will take an x-ray to make sure that the roots have not fractured.  He will also want to follow it for some time to make sure that the tooth does not die and need a root canal.  Then depending on your age or how bad the chips are the teeth can be fixed with bonded fillings, porcelain laminates, or crowns.|`|o5ZfMIA1aa	It would be nice to have your teeth grow back once they get chipped but the sad truth is, they don't really grow once you get the adult teeth. There's a theory that they can grow but it's not conclusive and we're still a LONG WAY from coaxing them to grow. Perhaps in the near future....<br>  <br>  In the meantime, you should go see a dentist so he or she can fix your front teeth. I don't imagine it's quite pleasant to go around with a broken set of teeth especially at the front. You can also expose them to future fractures as they're no longer whole so it's best to fix the small chips now rather than wait for them to get worse.<br>  <br>  If the nerve is exposed, you'll be feeling a lot of pain not just the little pressure. You would be able to see tiny one or two red dots which  means you can actually start seeing the canals.<br>  <br>  Recommend that you see your dentist as soon as you're able.|`|qrGLcTh4aa	There is nothing you can do at this point but see a Doctor. If you're in pain I would say it's urgent and try to go as soon as possible. That kind of pain is hard to tolerate.<br>  You're going to need root canal more than likely. But don't be afraid. They have a bad reputation but they are not a big deal. Trust me I have been an Endodontic Assistant for 10 years, I have seen thousands of root canals and people handle them just fine. You'll do fine.<br>  Whatever you do DON"T eat on it. Do not bite into anything with it. I wouldn't want you to break it even more OR in such a way that it cant be fixed.

As I've gotten older its gotten a bit worse, happening when I get blood drawn or am in a lot of pain (like when I'm on my period) However, mine is just a result of low blood pressure. You could also have your doctor check you for anemia or a thyroid problem. Mine never was that though, just the low blood pressure. My suggestion is to get up more slowly, it'll give your blood a chance to go from your feet to your head again. Make sure they have you lie down if you ever get blood drawn, and dont faint near 4 post beds:) I did that once, mad busted lip:):)<br>  Hope this helps sugar, there's nothing really wrong with you, just one of those funny things our bodies do:)|`|F5NQqTwJaa	you are weak because your diet is poor, bacon is nothing but fat, ice cream has tons of sugar, an apple is just a source of fiber...you should look what you eat, get enough protein in the morning, like eggs or get a good protein shake, eat plenty of vegetables, don't mess up your body eating junk food..take care of yourself girl you can do it.

That can cause burning and dryness.  It could also mean that you are not taking care of them well.  Or, being non-prescription, they could be poorly made.<br>  <br>  Really, you should see an eye doctor, get your eyes checked, and get fitted for contacts.  If you have no eye problem, they can prescribe colored contacts with a planar prescription.  This is the safest and most comfortable route, and you will be instructed on how to keep them clean and safe.<br>  <br>  Most people have some sort of irregularity in their eyes and may have a low level of astigmatism, myopia, hyperopia, or high order refractive error.  Even if you do not, it is still good to get your eyes examined to detect things like cataracts, retinal problems, and glaucoma.

MtQ9ea2Uaa	Add baking soda! Squeeze out your toothpaste like usual onto your toothbrush and then add enough baking soda that will cover it. Add baking soda every time you brush your teeth in a day. (Hopefully that's two or three times a day) You'll see results after two, three weeks. I have been using this method for about a month now and I can honestly tell you that I've been noticing the results.

That will just make it worse.<br>  <br>  People say that baking soda isn't safe. Nope, it's safe. My orthodontist suggested doing this.<br>  People say it tastes gross. People have different opinions on the taste. Given, don't swallow it but it doesn't leave a bad taste in your mouth for the most part.

DXZK6eMNaa	Talk to your doctor, you might have a cyst or something.|`|VBdli1ILaa	maybe your pregnent. my gf had no period, then a baby.
VC5mEULTaa	You may have torn something in your chest area, thus when you breathe in deep, you get a pain. If it only happens when you breathe in deep, it probably isn't your heart.<br>  <br>  I am in no way a doctor, so if you think its serious go get it checked out.
T4uZeVXjaa	Colloidal silver will not help.<br>  <br>  If you have both glaucoma and iritis, you need prescription medicine from an eye specialist.  Not using it will result in blindness.|`|JTJ3Xza3aa	Using colloidal silver will give you that hot Smurfette look that many skinny nerdy geeks with glasses find attractive.  So why did you post your question twice?
Dvawm8Ezaa	Most diet pills don't work for everyone, you have to do a lot of exercise and dieting as well as taking the pill and following the directions on the bottle. It will not help you lose 50 pounds but it will assist you with 1-5 pounds. Although most don't do anything at all. Good luck.

KAX9FURMaa	It is perfectly fine. Taking 2 painkiller tablets a month will not lead to addiction. Some people will take more then 8 painkillers a day!!<br>  <br>  Painkillers target the nerves in your body, to stop pain signals (such as when you have your period, they stop pain signals coming from your uterus). They do not have any impact on you being able to have children in the future. It is perfectly safe to take pain killers, when you don't abuse them.<br>  <br>  Painkillers can be harmful, if you take more then the recommended dosage, and if you take them every single day!! But you don't..<br>  <br>  There is no need to feel pain when you have your period, and it is good that you manage it so well with just 2 tablets :) Some women take alot more then that when they have there periods.<br>  <br>  Ana above suggested taking ibuprofen. I suggest staying with the same pain killer you are taking now if it work or taking tylenol/panadol (paracetamol). ibuprofen is not as safe as paracetamol, it can be harsh on your stomach and is bad for people who suffer asthma. Paracetamol (500mg) is the safest painkiller (if taken in appropriate doses).<br>  <br>  Only take ibuprofen, if paracetamol does not work.|`|uf9pZFlzaa	Nope! I promise you that the majority of women have to do this, and we're all fine. I would recommend taking ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil) because it does the most for cramps by easing your muscles - you shouldn't need any more than 400 mg of ibuprofen to help for 4-6 hours. If you usually need more, you should talk to your doctor about it. Hope this helps!
0e3034d2280fb2b424be0eff3932f8e1aa	It's not a silly question, it's a legitimate one, lol :) <br>  <br>  What you could possibly be feeling is the jaw bone.  It takes some time for the extraction site to heal and hole to 'close' up. Sometimes the jaw bone can be felt until it heals.  You could also have a piece of loose jaw bone in there too that is working it's way out.  <br>  <br>  I would give it another couple weeks...as long as you are not experiencing any pain.  It will drive you crazy until it heals, the tongue is a nosy critter that can't keep away from something foreign...I know,  I burnt the roof of my mouth this afternoon eating soup and I can not keep my tongue away from the spot :) <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|keX0rz1oaa	by the sounds of it it sounds like theres a piece of bone from the tooth trying to work its way out..... when i had my wisdom teeth pulled 4 weeks after i had a piece of bone come out of the hole. and it does feel wierd after getting it pulled. another thing you might have food stuck in the gap, what you need it a syringe and flush it out everytime you eat if the dentist didnt tell you that it needs to be done. cause it keeps it from getting infected. But if the dentist didnt tell you that, you should go get a syringe or something from the stores and flush out the hole after eating and continue doing it till the hole isnt as deep for food to get stuck in.|`|YJV2TU6taa	That is most likely all it is. I had the same thing when my wisdom teeth where pulled a couple months ago. It's really weird feeling. Just make sure it's not a piece of food since it's really easy for things to get stuck in the sockets. But most likely it's just skin.|`|om3N441xaa	Maybe it is a piece of bone fragment slowly coming out...it happens....nothing to worry about.<br>  Call the Dentist if this continues.....
GfwjOVGdaa	Theres different lifts that can affect different muscles of your body.<br>  <br>  Arm Workouts-<br>  Bicep Curls: Lift dumbbells by isolating your bicep (upper arm-front side) and curling the weight from as far down as you can go until it is raised to your shoulder height. Continue doing this 8-10 times a set for 3 sets.<br>  Tricep: Grab 1 dumbbell by making a triangle with your hands,  rest the dumbbell behind your neck until you start,  then when ready, extend your arms so that they go from a 90 degree angle to a 180 degree angle, then bring it back down to the 90, repeat 8-10 times with an appropriate weight for about 3 sets.<br>  Shoulder Shrugs: Hold 2 dumbbells at you your sides and shrug your shoulders and try to make your shoulders move in a circular pattern.  8-10 times for 3 sets.<br>  (all can be done using dumbbells)<br>  <br>  Abs workouts (6 Pack)<br>  Sit-Ups: From a laying position slightly bend your legs then keeping your arms crossed across your chest or behind your ears rise your torso to a sitting position, do as many as you can for 3 sets.<br>  Leg-Lifts:  from a laying position with your hands at your side, raise your feet while they are touching each other, then move them as far apart as you can from each other, then bring them back together and then to the ground. try to keep your heels about 6 inches from the ground. 8-10 reps for 3 sets.<br>  <br>  Pectorals (Upper Chest)-<br>  Bench Press-  Remember to have a spotter but do reps of 8 for 3 sets.<br>  Push-Ups- As many as you can for 3-4 sets.<br>  <br>  Try to get a lot of Protein in your diet as that builds/repairs muscles and makes them larger,  have a low-fat diet and if your workout is tiring you more than you think it should be, try adding more calories to it, but watch what calories you eat because "Calories from fat" are unhealthy and will not help you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|jw6Lpt37aa	running for 45 minute daily for 5 days a week and weight lifting twice a week and cutting your intake of calories and eating square complete meal protein + carbohydrate + fibre that will give the muscles the fuel to build up and be strong and always keep in mind that your abs actually is there you need to burn the fat over it to appear and just workout to make it stronger best of luck|`|MzCL0dzjaa	Alright well I can start off by saying that your diet is how you get ripped.

9EAIMt0Baa	First of all. That's blood, not just typical "wetness."<br>  <br>  My girlfriend bled a lot in the past. I'm guessing this happens with you during sex (not before). The inside of the vagina is sensitive for a girl who is starting sex. Give it a few months and she will never bleed again because the vagina will be tougher. <br>  <br>  Basically. Don't worry. It's normal. Unless she has some kinda of tract infection which is probably way unlikely if it only happens after sex.|`|Oq7gDQPzaa	Well even if she isn't on her period sometimes if you two have rough sex she can bleed.|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	Either you two are having extremely rough sex and the friction is causing bleeding in her vagina or she is not lubricated enough and her vagina is irritated, causing bleeding.|`|KAX9FURMaa	Either you are being a little rough, not using enough lubrication, or she has an underlying health condition. She could also be starting her period. But it sounds like this is happening all the time.<br>  <br>  Tell her, she needs to see her doctor, to make sure everything is fine down there.<br>  <br>  Some girls also bleed, during the first few times they have sex, it is normal. But if she has been having sex for awhile, or if this is a new occurrence (the blood, not the sex), she needs to see her doctor.|`|KBL6sE7Naa	haha|`|qLuodu3Raa	could be that you are a idiot|`|40jOMwENaa	some times this happeneds to me. after we hae sex my lubricant is alittle red. my boyfriend loves trying new positions, he always ends up ripping me every time, it doesnt really hurt but it looks like im bleeding enough to color the clear stuff.<br>  dont be so rough with her. go strait in and out, no weird angles. instead of pumping in and out like your jabbing her, go strait in and rub up and down, omg i love it when my boyfriend does that, the fastest we both did it in was 1minute. he likes it alot too.<br>  dont be rough unless she asks you too. ask her what she wants. and why are you wanting to know why it happends, why dont you take her to a clinic to see if she's ok down there.|`|FKOBpMcMaa	Go to your nearest planned parenthood<br>  and ask them your question and they should be able<br>  to answer your question<br>  <br>  maybe it was her after mate in her period that<br>  it just suddenly came down.<br>  <br>  but she should really get that checken out <br>  or have an check up with her doctor about this situation<br>  cause it might be something horrible or not|`|aVPd5uBWaa	It is blood. She does not have to be on her cycle in order for you to see red when you get done. She may not have told you but she may be on her monthly... or just got off and is trying to go at it too soon. I hope you are using a condom...|`|PB9EklObaa	Dude it seems to me she is excited and your making her feel good nothing to worry about it's just the juices flowing keep it up.|`|g58FHSbYaa	go to the doctor it could be something bad..<br>  or was this just once?<br>  first time yall had sex?<br>  that would mean you "poped her cherry" causeing blood to come out.|`|BYY4sQjyaa	Well, either she was a virgin n u made her bleed on her first time or you are extremely rough and she bleeds everytime.|`|FeV8JSs2aa	OMG you don't know probably because your a guy she is having her period....|`|4jLzZzR9aa	seriously, either thats blood or she have some serious issues.

3vya5f49aa	I get that sometimes too. Try to stretch more. This should increase the circulation of blood to your lower legs and feet. Hold a stretch for about 30 seconds or it won't do much. Hope it improves.|`|xnCizA7Daa	in the morning punch yourself in the face and you will not worry about your legs and feet|`|Av8H7eRNaa	You do not say what age you are.  If you were older, your "poor circulation" would really be due to Peripheral Arterial Disease. That is when the small arteries in your legs become clogged with cholesterol, etc.  Maybe you just do not do enough exercise and your legs are weak.<br>  Do you sit around lots watching TV and using the internet?  You need to get up every half hour and walk around a bit and really exercise at least 30 minutes twice a day.  Maybe you do not sleep well at night.  Or you could have restless leg syndrome.  If your legs have circulation to very poor, you could develop a blood clot which could travel to your lung.  I encourage you to have a doctor check you out.  After you receive a professional examination, I invite you to check out my Great-Health-Inside-Out.com website for general health guidelines.|`|WwLoTbD2aa	If your feet hurt and it goes away after moving around for a few minutes, it could be from injury to  the plantar fascia (tissues on underside of foot)  You tighten overnight, and it takes a while for things to stretch after awakening.  Can go away on its own eventually.  Try putting on shoes with good support immediately when you get out of bed.  Don't go barefoot.  I messed up my feet in the summer by walking in flip flops and barefoot, and it's taken over a year to correct.  Of course, my age doesn't help (55).|`|Mr1Oayovaa	idk. i have that same problem. i think after you lay down in a certain position i guess it's like if you sit on your legs, your nerves go haywire and you get a tingly sensation in your legs.

AA10494978	Discipline.  There is no magic bullet.  You have to stick to your program no matter what happens!  Don't put yourself into a situation where you can be tempted to overeat.  <br>  <br>  You are doing what is generally considered to be the healthiest way to lose weight AND to keep it off.  Diet and excersize.  I know at your age you may not think long term, but you have to realize that you will have to do this for the rest of your life.  WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT STOP!!!!  I use an online program to keep track of what I eat - its free to use.  www.fitday.com.  I like it because even a computer idiot like me can figure it out.  <br>  <br>  Potions and pills and megic herbs may help you lose in the short term - but you have to look long term.  This is a lifestyle change.  Let me tell you, there is nothing better than waking up in the morning and going for a power walk and feeling great!  It is fantastic.  You will get there.  I know in the beginning it is difficult, but you seem to have the desire to make the changes you have to make.  So just stick to your program.  <br>  <br>  Usually what happens initially is the weight you lose will come very rapidly - but it is only water weight, not fat.  You have to drink lots and lots of water.  With that you will also go to the bathroom a lot - and you will lose essential minerals and vitamins more quickly.  So look into maybe taking a multi - vitamin.  Eat lots of fruits.  Kiwi and banana is great.  After a month or so, you will start to lose the fat.  It will probably be slow.  <br>  <br>  Here is what i would suggest.  Go to Wal-Mart and get a large piece of paper.  About your height.  Put it on the floor and ask someone (someone you trust!) to draw your body shape on it as you are laying on the paper.  Then date it and fold it up and put it on the shelf for a month.  After a month of dutifully sticking to your program do it again.  You will see results and you will be more likely to stick to your program.  When you see yourself every day, you may not recognize the progress you are making.  Just stick to it.  <br>  <br>  A year ago I was where you are - except I am 26 years older than you.  So it was very difficult for me to start.  But now I run 5 miles 3 times a week, rain or shine.  I do 200 pushups every second day, I dont' care where I am at - at home or traveling for business.  I swimm 3 times a week.  BUT - when i started, i started by barely being able to do 10 pushups!!  I felt exhausted after 5 minutes of walking!  So stick to your diet and very very importantly, stick to your excersize.  The only way you can lose weight is if you burn more calories than what you put in your body.  That's the only way.  Everything else is just temporary.  If you need motivation, go to the library and check out a program called Personal Power from Tony Robbins.  It is an excellent way to stay motivated.  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK TO YOU!

Most people fear that their family will feel false guilt & mournful. In my case, I fear them not caring. If I died by accident or illness, my family wouldn't care, & they'd spread false rumors, saying it was suicide, anyway. They're evil.|`|rsYbDHWRaa	well theres no one thing, its a whole bunch of things combined. <br>  <br>  im scared of what will happen after i die, because no one really knows. im not sure i want to find out. <br>  <br>  im scared ill fail. i dont think i could look my family and friends in the eye when i wake up in the hospital. i know it would kill all of them to know i was even considering ending my life. that and id probably get made fun off and get called "emo" or something dumb like that. not to mention all the possible medical problems i could have from the pills, or nerve damage from the cutting. <br>  <br>  i think about my future, and all my asperations for life. it kind of makes me sad to think id never graduate highschool, go to collage, fall in love, have kids and all the things i want to do. <br>  <br>  the possibility that it caould all be better tomorrow. <br>  <br>  my best friend. i remember one day she told me she wouldnt know what to do if i died. she said she didnt think she would be able to handle it - probably just lock herself in her room and cry for months. not eating or sleeping, just lying there. just thinking about putting her through that makes me get all chocked up. sometimes i feel like she doesnt even care about me, but i remeber that one moment in time when she said that, and i know she does. <br>  <br>  all my friends in general. i just think of their faces when they get the news.. whatd theyd do.. whatd theyd think.. the school assemblys about me.. my funeral.. i just dont think i could do that to people. <br>  <br>  and i know you said not to say this, but my family. my parents are probably the biggest reason why. my dad once told me hed probably be dead somewhere right now if it wasnt for me. im an only child, and i know my parents would pretty much just stop living if i ever died. i know they love me a lot, and again, i just couldnt put them through that. i dont know what would happen to them.. i dont even like to think about it.|`|E70A7aqcaa	Well, the "family" answers that  you rule out are most likely THE most important reason I have for not committing suicide over the years.  I guess, along with that one is my fear of just exactly what God, as in Jesus our Christ, would think and feel about it and whether I'd have to spend eternity in hell or He'd forgive me and accept me into Heaven.  As a mental health professional with 20+ years experience, now retired, I've had to treat individuals who were considered suicidal for all those years, and so a natural curiosity about suicide and what it would feel like and what "life after death" would feel like, very much depending on God's response to my suicide, have always developed a strong interest or curiosity on the subject in  me, and combining that with my occasional depression and whatever, have consistently allowed suicide to be my "secret friend" that I could always call on at any time, for any occasion.  But, finally, despite your restrictions on what answers you want and don't want, I have a son and a daughter whom I love VERY much, and I'm not sure how they could handle it, and what that would leave them thinking of me over the rest of their lives.  And I don't feel I have "the right" to unload such a crisis on them to deal with all the rest of their lives.  And my wife, not the mother of my kids, is such a very loving and trusting and "innocent" individual that I think it would shock her and hurt her beyond my capacity to imagine and want to accept.  And even my kids' mother, who divorced me some 23 years ago and yet maintained very superficial contact over the years because of our kids, would be hurt mentally and emotionally, and even though I haven't had the kindest feelings for her over these years, I don't feel it gives me the right to hurt her to that degree, and I'm pretty sure it would.  I don't worry so much about friends since, at my age, they're old enough and maybe mature enough to handle the situation, but I'm sure they'd be upset as well.  So, as sorry as I am that I HAVE TO include family as one of the two most important reasons for why I haven't committed suicide over the years, they're right up there with God as THE reason I haven't done so.  I hope you can accept my answer, and I won't be worried about any 10 points for Best Answer.  I'm sure other answers will be great, and another 10 points isn't going to improve my lot in life.  God, as in Jesus our Christ, Bless you.|`|EJSdI25Naa	Suicide is forever.|`|in6Iw3BEaa	I've lost 2 people to suicide and they left behind such devastation.  I also lived with survivor's guilt and wouldn't want anyone to feel that same guilt because I commited suicide.<br>  <br>  Another reason is religious reasons.  I'm not very religious but the thought that maybe it is true you get a one way ticket to hell for suicide is enough to scare me away from it.|`|b26Dp8LKaa	My belief in reincarnation: At one point while thinking about suicide a thought popped in my head that if I did (commit suicide), I'd have to come back & re-live everything in my life over again until I got past the struggle I was having (going through divorce, finding out my son has autism).  I really didn't want to go through my life up until that point over again!  <br>  <br>  There are times I've thought no one would miss me or care if I were gone.  And that actually it might be better (for others).  Depression plays weird games with  your head. Anyway, a girlfriend of mine told me that losing me would cause a great sense of loss in her life.<br>  <br>  I now know how much the loss of good friends of mine have impacted my life. Losing someone b/c of suicide is an even greater loss.<br>  <br>  I've had periods of depression when suicide seemed like a possible answer to my pain. I've gotten beyond that & had some good years.  Times when I realized I would have missed the good had I given in. <br>  <br>  I know you asked for "one thing".  But it has been different things at different times that have gotten me through those periods of overwhelming sadness & pain.  My life today is so much better.  I still have moments.  Bad memories never go away completely. Yet I can finally enjoy most of my life - my family, my friends.  <br>  <br>  PS "Family" means my kids, husband, step children and my closest friends.  I've had no relationship w/my a.mom f/12 yrs. My a.dad & 1st parents have passed away. <br>  <br>  Hugs...<br>  Wish I had words that could help ease your sorrow.|`|S2tBYhCKaa	I need two physicians who must first determine I have less than six months to live.  Then I must submit written request to my attending<br>  M.D. requesting I be allowed to end my life.  There is a fifteen day<br>  waiting period required before I'm again obliged to deliver request<br>  anew to same doctor.  Only then will an assisted suicide be issued <br>  medical prescription for lethal drug.  I'm obliged to take the drug <br>  without assistance of anyone else while following the prescription<br>  directions.  I then may choose my time to die.  Most people who have had this legal recourse do so at home at a time of their own choosing.  This law became legal at my<br>  place of residence last week.  Yes, I voted for it.<br>  Bottom line - The methodology of dying is by my choice.|`|kf7XLE8kaa	I don't know.  For a long time, I teetered on the edge, and just never followed through.  I'm glad I didn't.  Firstly, things have improved, VERY slowly, and in VERY small increments...but now my life is pretty manageable.  Second, my grandma committed suicide.  I've known, and even been close to, others who have committed suicide, but after my grandma's death, I realized what it really does to those left behind.  Not just myself (I dealt with it better than most everyone in my family, because I had been working with elderly people for years at that point, and I kind of understood the desire to just have it over with already...she was tired, and even though I miss her a lot, I respect her choice).  But those around me were really hurt and angry.  I'm just now (8 years later) beginning to grieve for my grandma's suicide (I was always the "caretaker" in my family, and I'm starting to realize that what that meant for me as a child, was that I didn't allow myself to feel anything...I had to "stay strong for the family", etc.).  Although I'm not angry with her like so many other family members are, it is really hurtful now to realize that she took herself from me, and from all of us.  I understand that she was hurting, and I do respect that.  But at the same time, I would much rather she had reached out and let us know that she was hurting, and given us a chance to hold her and tell her how much we love her (holy crap, I'm bawling right now, this is rough) than to just take her beautiful, wonderful self away from us.<br>  <br>  Even if you think you haven't touched anyone, I promise you, you have (you've touched me, and we've never even met).  Your presence would be missed.  And I don't say that to guilt you at all.  This is your choice.  I'm saying that because I know from experience that it is REALLY hurtful to those who are left behind, even if they didn't know you very well.  Back in October, a woman who I barely knew (we were both on the same message board and had sent emails a few times) committed suicide.  We had both been sexually abused (which was the purpose of the message board, and why we had "bonded").  I'd be willing to bet that she felt that she had no one.  But I have had a really hard time with her death.  I wonder if I could have said something better, or if anything I had said had contributed to her death.  I will never get answers to those questions...I'm stuck wondering for the rest of my life if I could have done anything.  That's a really horrible place to be.  A month or so ago, I broke down and just cried and cried, and sent her old message board account a long, detailed email about how I felt.  I had to get it out somehow.  (But I'm pretty aware, beings that I can barely see the screen right now, that I'll never get it completely out.  This sucks.)<br>  <br>  I kind of feel at a loss for words right now...not sure how to end this.  But I know that you are cherished, even if it is by people who don't know you very well.|`|UO1QE8phaa	Honestly, my DH and I were just discussing this tonight.  We've both been there and both still 'go there' sometimes.<br>  <br>  Here's my thing.  Being an adoptee and (like you) not "owning" a lot of the things that have happened and still happen a lot in my life I've become a bit of a control freak.  At least in some ways.<br>  <br>  The one thing that has prevented me -- I still "own" that choice.  I can still choose to end my life at any time AND I still own all the other possible choices.  Since we don't really know what happens after we die (if anything happens at all -- and those who say they know, by the way, are selling something...), I'm not so keen to find out because although I do think it could end my pain, I have to acknowledge that since I don't really know it will, the possibility also exists that it could make things worse.  That would just suck.  If there is "something" after this... I mean if I still exist AND I am aware that I have taken my life, I would no longer "own" that choice.  I would have chosen that and it would be 'done', so to speak.<br>  <br>  I haven't because I'm not ready to find out what's next, if anything.<br>  <br>  ...and because I still can later, if I find I am ready.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the "family" pushers and the religion peddlers.  They don't get it.<br>  <br>  Take care!<br>  <br>  FWIW, I would miss you terribly!|`|6w7FKrlfaa	i'm 28 now and since i was about 14 i began to have suicidal thoughts... i have severe anxiety and ocd..  sometimes depression...  i've always believed that one day i would committ suicide..  i know that so many people think it's selfish.. but a person that goes through with it.. would have to be in sooooo much pain.. that they can't see any other solution...  i understand that...  so the one thing that would keep me from suicide and has... is my gf of 10 years and our chihuahua who is like our son...|`|DJMPQlFDaa	Well after oh so many failed attempts I have to say God.<br>  And now that I have children I have to say their well being.|`|DZP8b9sXaa	Being too stubborn to give in to the dark side|`|7bnfkYIaaa	First of all, it's not selfish. I posted a few questions and if you care to read them they explain why suicide isn't selfish. It's your life. You shouldn't be burdened with others' wishes about your life. What prevents me from suicide? I guess I'd say that I'm not quite ready to leave yet. I'm still here, whether I'm really trying to get better or not, and I'm not quite at that point where I'm ready to give up. It could eventually go either way, suicide or continue living, but I haven't quite reached that point where I've decided...not to stay. So basically I still have a few wits left, but I would consider myself rotting at this point, not living. Family and friends wouldn't prevent me from suicide; that's my own values. I feel that if the guilt of hurting others is so great that it prevents you from suicide, perhaps then the pain you were going through weren't so severe after all. I condone suicide as long as it is well though out and it has been decided after extensive thinking that it is the best decision.|`|h9oT1pBoaa	i know "no family" answers...<br>  but my 4 and 6 yr old brothers are the main reason why i got help when i attempted suicide.<br>  2) i thought about how much money mom and dad would have to pay for my schooling if i was gone ( someone has to pay the debt, and you would be putting the burden on someone else)<br>  3) i thought maybe things could get better. i still feel like they never will get better but hope someday it changes<br>  4) it is a selfish act, you don't think about how everyone else is going to feel when you are gone. you don't have to worry about anything anymore and you will end up hurting a lot of people|`|o83jqZwOaa	1.

01kEv36Faa	Yes and you could be dehydrated, which is more dangerous than not eating.  I don't know why you don't  eat.  But you need to drink or you could have serious health issues|`|IggGQ4GEaa	Yes! Most definitely. Your blood sugar gets very low throughout the day if you do not eat which causes you to feel light-headed and dizzy.  The stomach pain is because your stomach is constantly creating acid in preparation for digesting food. When there is no food for a prolonged period of time, the acid can irritate the walls of your stomach causing it to hurt and sometimes even burn. I suggest that even if you don't want to eat very much that you consider eating some sort of fruit or a piece of wheat toast at 3-4 hour intervals during the day because your current plan is not only unhealthy is dangerous.|`|0l88fiUTaa	yes it is, I have the same problem.....I pretty much have a bad appetite,( and I just went on a weird diet for my health.....so on top of barely eating I'm limited with my food choices too! : (<br>  Anyways, I usually feel exactly how you described and it is because you're barely eating.  In your case, I think that you are eating way too little....that is definitely not healthy. If you just have a lack of appetite (and you're not starving yourself on purpose) then that might still mean you have some sort of problem so the best thing would be to go see a doctor about this just to be safe ( for example: depression/ anxiety, thyroid problems, certain medications you might be taking, or parasites can cause a lack of appetite)~ but there would probably be other significant signs accompanying any of these health issues.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with improving your health and please eat more(and eat healthy not junk food!) : )|`|AA12290212	Yes its because your hungry that you get the pains and light headedness is usually low blood sugars which occurs when you don't eat! <br>  <br>  <br>  Eat!|`|3635359c200983593a83844b9f4a76bbaa	yes it is from not eating enough.<br>  your body needs energy to work properly<br>  and food + sleep = energy <br>  <br>  :D|`|w2si6gFMaa	yes. im sure you have low blood sugar...eat more!!|`|V7IdZplIaa	yes its from not eating. your body also breaks down your muscles and eventually extra fat stores for energy. i bet you haven't taken a shi* lately either? not to sound crude but its because your body is starving and literally holds onto every bit of morsel of food you DO eat so nothing is wasted. Eat more because your metabolism is also slowing way down too, which is probably why you feel very lethargic during the day...i could go on but your body is in trouble unless you fuel it.|`|AA10281378	I can tell you personally, yes. I remember there was a point in time where I practically had no time to eat normally. I used to eat once in the morning *~8am*, once when I got home *~6-9pm* and then later on around 11pm-midnight. I suffered pretty gnarly stomach aches, tension headaches, I was lightheaded and felt weak. My body is used to me eating a lot, so that was just a consequence. If you aren't eating as much as before, whether you have no appetite or no time...I suggest a meal replacement drink...like Ensure *regular or Plus...vanilla ftw!*...Ensure saved my *** plenty times.|`|buYhmffxaa	It is definitely from not eating enough!

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Who says there is anything wrong? You are inserting a dry wad of chemical soaked rayon into your moist delicate vagina, so it's common to feel pain, particularly for the first time, if it does hurt then try again later and relax as forcing it will make things worse. If you can't use tampons it's no big deal as you can use menstrual cups, softcups or sponges instead which are healthier and easier to use than tampons anyway, or even some types of pads can be used for swimming. Menstrual cups are far superior option to tampons as they can be worn at any time for up to 12 hours without leaking, also nothing shows outside your body so more discreet. As a note you can’t use tampons when you are just spotting! One of the things that make tampons so harmful to health is that they absorb vaginal fluids, with less menstrual flow it means tampons will absorb more vaginal fluids, this causes the vaginal walls to become dry, split and ulcerated which plays a big part in contracting TSS and vaginal infections. It’s never a good idea ot use tampons, but please if you are going to use them then you need to be responsible and mature enough to follow the precautions or else you’re risking not only your health but also your life. <br>  <br>  Stabbing pain as you move is common at first, if a tampon isn't in far enough lower vaginal muscles push against it causing pain, so try again with a fresh tampon pushing as far up as you can towards the small of your back, and try non-applicators as you have more control. Stinging around vaginal opening is common due to damage from friction and dryness, help this by using lubrication like KY jelly also use organic tampons such as Cottons or Natracare. Organic tampons are cotton so softer than synthetics in commercial brands like Tampax so not as irritating or damaging, commercial brands also contain chemicals and bleach that you may be allergic to. Tampons can break or stretch your hymen so if in tact or partly broken this cause cause pain, just keep trying. Always use the lowest absorbency as higher absorbency is not only have higher health risks but can cause more irritation and are larger in size so not as easy to insert at first, also remember to never use tampons when not menstruating or when flow is light. A great tip is to masturbate before inserting a tampon the first time as when aroused your vagina opens, doubles in size, relaxes, and lubricates is easier to insert.|`|RqQ0K32Baa	Some tampons are harder to put in.<br>  I couldn't get in the cardboard applicator ones comfortably until after I tried the plastic applicators.<br>  They're smoother and easier to get in.<br>  I use the Tampax Sport.<br>  It's round and some of the plastic applicators are more rectangle like.<br>  Then after that others should be easier.<br>  Make sure you get the light flow ones, which are yellow for the sports.|`|OpwMuboqaa	Use a junior size tampon.

E64juLwJaa	No they do that normally after you turn 40.<br>  The chance something is wrong with your prostate is remotely small.<br>  And yes:you have to wear a gown,with nothing under it:the crotch area will be inspected too.<br>  Colors|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	how else are they going to do a rectal exam if you dont want a finger in your ***? lol..silly...but they are most likely not going to do that..if they do just go in and maybe ask for a gown that you can change into?|`|BTpNkxoeaa	No doctor is going to give a rectal exam to a 26 year old man unless there are some kind of medical problems to justify such.  Even if you are a crossdresser, why would that fact even matter?  And why would you ask if you have to strip naked for it?  This is kind of question that give people the impression that crossdressers have issues.|`|3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	If you are joining the military they will conduct a physical where they ask you to drop your drawers and spread your cheeks.  They they just look at your behind to see if you have hemorrhoids. <br>  <br>  If you are going to your regular doctor for a general physical, then the doctor may ask about doing a prostate palpitation.  This is where the doctor sticks his finger up your behind and feels if your prostate is enlarged.  Normally this is not done on a person under 40 years old.  The doctor will not do it without your permission.  In your case, just politely say you don't need a prostate exam.|`|AA12022261	wow their is definitely diversity at yahoo answers.. i was pretty sure they became routine after you turn 40 but i'm sure they can start earlier and im not sure why you would HAVE to take off your socks as it has no relevance to getting a rectal exam|`|FIG58FVpaa	No. They normally won't give you a rectal exam at 26 unless you're having some sort of prostrate problems.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't strip off your clothes unless they ask you to.
k9YaLawCaa	100% liquor? (or 100% alcohol?) And 1/2 a klonopin? No, not safe, either way. Why bother with the klonopin if you are drinking that much!|`|dnMXvVM3aa	Never mic prescription medication with alcohol.  Especially if the bottle specifically says not to.|`|RyZXJU1Aaa	Um, DUH? Those warnings are on there for a reason, when you have a narcotic like clonazepam (Klonopin) and take alcohol with it, it can be bad news.. Both alcohol and chlonazepam are depressants, which means the effect of both chemicals is to depress the central nervous system. The biggest problem with this is when taken together they potentiate (worsen) the effects of the CNS depression and autonomy of breathing. In short, it can make you STOP BREATHING! I have seen people die as a result of doing this. The worst part is it only takes one time, every time someone drinks and takes a benzodiazepine they can react differently to the CNS depression. Do you really wanna take the chance? To put it bluntly if so, people like you are my job security.|`|WAl3vvNnaa	I really do not think that is a good idea. Mixing any medication even half with alcohol can be fatal. Someone I knew took sleeping pills with alcohol, they ended up passing out, there heart from what the doctors say slowed down to the point where it failed. Not sure what anxiety pills would do but I would not even try it. Alcohol doubles the effects of any pills. I would not even chance it.
zMD0VeOmaa	1st off all people before me that answered the question were wrong.<br>  <br>  Spicy food such as jalapenos increase thermogenesis(production of heat) in the body, which means that digestion burns more calories than foods with less thermogenesis. Foods that stimulate thermogenesis are also described as having an increased thermic effect.<br>  <br>  Also, eating spicy foods will raise your body temperature temporarily, and your body will use an increased amount of calories to combat this increased temperature.<br>  <br>  However, spicy foods should be eaten in moderation as they can trigger acid reflux(which can ultimately damage the lining of the esophagus). They can also induce stomach ulcers, an irritable bowel, and even damaged taste buds.|`|fsiXYWEvaa	I think?|`|bHRCT786aa	Does playing with your butthole make you gay?

UIYKRs1Zaa	oh dear god.<br>  <br>  I only pray that you become a sociology major when you go to college. Only then will you realize how insignificant your crappy days are. And only then will you realize that the world is a pretty terrible place to live in.<br>  <br>  You're what, a junior? Yes admissions process is hell. It's designed to make you suffer. But a billion other people are also going through what you're going through. And then a billion more people are out there trying to find jobs because their degrees did nothing for them in today's economy.<br>  <br>  Also, talk to your adult friends. Ask them how many high school people they keep in touch with. That will make you feel better. Oh, and don't forget to ask them how many "friends" they realized were idiots by the time they got out of the high school bubble.<br>  <br>  And just as an fyi, about .05% of high school relationships actually work out permanently in life (and I'm not including the pregger teens, druggy friends, and the wife-beating relationships in this statistic). Chances are your pretty friend is going to be hella ugly later in life. And do you look around you? Chances are that about 90% of the people near you are ugly as well. Pretty people are hard to find, and just because your HS has low standards for "pretty girls," doesn't mean you have to get all sensitive about it. <br>  <br>  Moral of the story:<br>  - college > trivial high school life<br>  - pop your sheltered high school bubble<br>  - realize almost everyone in this world has a lot of UGLY in them<br>  - realize that you're basically screwed because you're living in a capitalist country<br>  - suck it up<br>  - get over it<br>  - go find yourself a new hobby<br>  <br>  Good luck with life.|`|9ALQfpbwaa	U need to RELAX ok? You're a teen ( I am too) and while the future is important u NEED to make time for friends. When I totally focused on school I felt depressed and alone. No duh!

Instead of having it bring u down why don't u use it to motivate u to get up a little earlier to try a new hairstyle or put make up on?

gSo4dR7oaa	More than 98% of people who have HIV would test positive within 3 months after getting infected.  In very rare cases, it could take up to 6 months for someone to test positive.  This could happen if the person's immune system is weakened by something  (Chemo, radiation, taking antirejection drugs after organ transplant)  prior to HIV infection. <br>  <br>  Testing is designed to detect antibodies to HIV.  The body produces antibodies in response to infection.  If the immune system is damaged prior to HIV infection, it could take up to 6 months for the body to produce those antibodies.<br>  <br>  Testing at 4 months can be considered accurate unless you have any of the other issues I mentioned above.
ej6OdnDBaa	well first of all you need 2-3 times more protein <br>  also, do more than 100 crunches<br>  try doing bycycles, cliffhangers. etc<br>  heres some other excercises <a href="http://www.shapefit.com/training.html#1" rel="nofollow">http://www.shapefit.com/training.html#1</a>|`|E4UT1fi9aa	Ab muscles are no different than other muscles.  In order to develop them they need to work against resistance.  Regular crunches don't provide much resistance.  You need to do crunches with a medicine ball, hanging knee raises, wood choppers, plank, etc.  Exercises that overload your abs.  That will make your abs pop. You're selling yourself short by doing such high reps.  Add resistance!!<br>  <br>  Lots of ab workouts here: <a href="http://www.free-ab-workout.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-ab-workout.com</a>|`|WI8wRpYCaa	I had to work on my abs for 30 minutes every 3 days for 3 months before I got a six pack. Make sure you get your obliques, and mix up your ab routine with several kinds of ab excercises, since doing only one will unbalance your core muscles, and not result in super visible results. If it doesn't feel like you are literally going to die at least 5 times during each workout, you aren't doing it right.

W0hNoMSsaa	Please don't be scared. A pelvic exam usually only takes a few minutes and doesn't hurt.  The more relaxed you are, the more comfortable the exam will be. If you understand everything about what is going to happen, you won't be anywhere near as nervous. So here is what you can expect:<br>  <br>  When you go in for your exam, the doctor's assistant will give you a paper gown.  You will take off your clothes alone in the exam room (don't worry, no one will be watching).  When you are finished putting the gown on, you will sit on the edge of a padded exam table. The doctor will tap on the door and make sure you're ready before entering. <br>  <br>  Next you will be asked to lie on your back on the table. Your lower body will be draped with a paper cloth the size of a small blanket. You will then raise your legs and put your heels into two stirrups that are attached to the end of the table. Then you will be asked to scoot forward slightly so that your bottom is close to the edge of the table.<br>  <br>  Be sure to tell the doctor that this is your first exam so he or she can use the smallest speculum, go slow and be extra gentle. Most doctors are very understanding about this and will do everything they can to make the exam as easy for you as possible. If you feel any discomfort at all, speak up. It will help you to relax if you take slow, deep breaths while you rest your hands on your tummy.<br>  <br>  Before starting the exam, the doctor will put on a pair of latex gloves. He or she will sit at the end of the table and shine a bright light in your pelvic area. (This actually feels rather nice, like warm sunlight shining down there.) Then he or she will insert what's called a speculum into your vaginal cavity. The speculum looks something like a duck bill. It has two rounded blades that will open slightly so the doctor can see inside. It will be lubricated, so it won't hurt you. <br>  <br>  You may feel a stretching or pulling sensation during the exam, but it's really not painful. The doctor will press down  on your abdomen to locate your ovaries and uterus and make sure they are OK, too. If you are having a pap smear, the doctor will take a little snip of cervical tissue and put it on a slide to send to the lab. This part might feel like a pinprick or pinch, but it's not any worse than that.<br>  <br>  There, now you're all done. See, it wasn't that bad, was it? If you feel embarrassed, remember that your doctor does exams like this all day long and has no interest in you besides making sure you are healthy. After the exam you might feel a bit gooey down there because of the K-Y jelly. If the doctor did a Pap smear, there might be some very slight bleeding which is nothing to worry about. It will go away quickly.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and please don't worry.  You'll be just fine, I promise.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	make sure you tell the doc that it's your first exam.  they should spend time talking to you, which can really help to calm your nerves.  the discomfort is really helped by your being relaxed.<br>  <br>  1)  the nurse will put you in the examining room, and leave you alone to undress.  you will be given either a sheet or a gown to cover yourself while you wait for the doc.<br>  2) the doc will come in and talk to you.<br>  3) she will ask you to lie back on the table.<br>  4) she will pull out the stirrups from underneath the table.  she will ask you to scoot down towards her end of the table and to place your feet in the stirrups.<br>  5)  when you are perfectly positioned, she will cut on a light that allows her see what she's doing.<br>  6) she will use a little lube on the speculum and insert it into your vagina.<br>  7)  she will then adjust it so that it holds you open while she takes a long q-tip and takes a swab from your cervix.<br>  8) depending on why you're going in, she may also feel around the bottom of your stomach to see if you have any cysts or growths (like fibroids) that she can feel with her hand.<br>  9) you two will talk a little more. she leaves you to get dressed. and that's it, unless there's a prescription or you need to set up a return visit with the nurse.|`|mGTjFgCwaa	Seriously, I nearly passed out my first time, and afterwords, I laughed at myself.<br>  <br>  It's uncomfortable, being exposed, I suppose, but that's all you have to worry about.<br>  <br>  He/she will ask you about your sexual activity, any unusual discharge, and the date of the start of your last period. Since your problem is with the irregularity of your period, you'll just have to briefly explain your problem. No big deal.<br>  <br>  for the actual exam: You lay on the table, put your feet up in the stirrups. Then, you feel a little cold, and a small amound of pressure on the inside of your vagina. Then, (s)he will put a finger inside to make sure you don't have any tears in the muscles, and you are done. It literally takes 30-60 seconds.<br>  <br>  There is a paper sheet between you and the doctor, so you don't really see him/her down there looking, and you can't feel all that much of what they're doing. I talked to the nurse at my head the whole time about school and stuff, so I didn't notice much of anything. It took about as long as to ask "so is this your last year of school? are you liking it? excited about graduating?" and hear the answer, and it was over. Then you get dressed, and it's over. There is no lasting discomfort. It's uncomfortable to think about, but there's nothing too weird about it.<br>  <br>  It's no no no big deal, don't worry about it.|`|OpwMuboqaa	Don't be scared.  She should tell you what she is going to do.  If she doesn't tell you then ask her what she will be doing.  They are there to help you and millions of girls and women just like you will have this exam at one time or another.  Make sure you answer her questions truthfully.  Whatever you tell her only stays with her.  Doctors have an oath to keep and they do not talk about their patients unless it is to consult on something.
kUGxGnGyaa	It's probably not a good idea. According to the article cited below, a person with celiac disease can tolerate around 10 mg of gluten a day without showing symptoms.

It may also relieve hoarseness. However, don't let your room become uncomfortably cold or very damp.<br>  Use a shallow pan of water to provide moisture in the air through evaporation if you don't have a humidifier. Place the pan in a safe location where no one will trip on it or fall into it.

It takes a few days but do your normal cardio but during the set put in some intervals that are much much faster. If you use a treadmill try upping the pace for 30 seconds and go back. Keep doing this and it should help push you through a plateau.
qLuodu3Raa	i just had surgery for this on thursday and what i would use for pain relief was pure peppermint essential oil rubbed it all over my stomach where i was hurting and it helped me more than anything i know it sounds weird but if you can find some try it also if there is any way if you could let me know how long it took you to get over it i would very much appreciate it i am still having  a lot  of pain where i had always had it and starting to freak out thinking maybe surgery did not work email me or something and let me know i would really appreciate it|`|jnOiqcAlaa	My sister had it, also. At first she got that surgery you did, and the same as you, it came back. Her doctor also made her go through menopause for 6 months, which also didn't help. She mainly took vicodin and tried to not do anything too strenuous. Now, I know this may sound extreme, but if you had children/do not want any, you can get your ovary removed. My sister got her right one removed last year, when she was 20. She is perfectly fine now, and can still have children. So maybe that could be the route for you. Gah, I hope this helps.
0EaA6IACaa	it really depends on the person and their pain tolerance. they clamp your tongue before they stick the needle through, and honestly the clamps hurt more than the needle going through, and when it does goes through you barely feel it. on a scale of 10, i'd give it a 1. but the nest couple days will be a litle worse because of the swelling, and i'd give that a 3/10. if you take advil like the piercer tells you too and suck on some ice,  you'll be fine<br>  <br>  i can't compare my ears to my tongue because i got them pierced when i was really little... sorry =/|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	I'd say a 10, it's afterwards the pain will kick in along with swelling.

It's sore for a few days, especially when you wake up in the morning (5/10). If you take advil regularly and suck ice it helps a lot.

pzLDXL6gaa	Most guys got it done at birth so they don't have a clue.<br>  <br>  It's unlikely to affect the ability to achieve orgasm unless something went wrong, but it can do with a tight circumcision (too much skin removed causing erectile problems). So some guys do have trouble orgasming.<br>  <br>  Most guys who do foreskin restoration say it feels better afterwards, which is interesting, even though it's not the same as a real foreskin.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	I can achieve orgasm but I am sure I am missing out on a lot of pleasure. Circumcision removes over half the skin of the penis (about 15 square inches or 40 square centimetres, in an adult) and it's not just simple skin. It's packed with nerve endings, special anatomical features like the ridged band and has a unique elastic gliding action, allowing it to slide on itself and act like lube. This action is what most males use to masturbate with. Circumcised males use what skin they have left, except those who are cut so tightly that they have to use lube or just rub it dry. The intact male can stroke the entire length of his penis using his foreskin and also has the option to use lube too, if he wants to. During intercourse the foreskin acts like lube on entry and may act as a dam, preventing lubricating secretions escaping from the vagina. In one study women reported that sex with an intact partner was gentler and more satisfying since he doesn't have to thrust as hard to feel enough stimulation. Removing the foreskin turns the surface of the glans from an inner mucosal membrane to outside skin. Newly circumcised adults usually go through some weeks of intense discomfort as the glans is constantly exposed to rubbing on clothing, until it develops a thicker keratin layer and becomes less sensitive. A recent study has shown real differences in fine touch sensitivity between circumcised and intact penises and that the most sensitive parts of the intact penis are those that would be removed by circumcision.<br>  Studies show that a significant number of men circumcised as adults report loss of erectile function and sexual sensation.<br>  Geoff|`|CNW6eAjoaa	Well, I was cut as a child for no reason other than an over zealous doctor wanting another car payment.  I have since started to restore my foreskin so I can speak from both sides of the table here.<br>  Being uncircumcised would definitely have been better.  I cannot believe the sensitivity I have gained since I started to restore my foreskin.  My restored foreskin will never be as good as the original.  It will not contain 75% of the sensitive sexual receptors like a normal intact foreskin does.<br>  Also, after years of my glans (which was designed to be an internal organ) rubbing on my clothing, I had built up a significant layer of non sensitive scar tissue that made reaching orgasm very difficult by comparison to my semi restored status today.<br>  As one contributor suggested, it sounds like you are considering this procedure.  If you are, you need to make a well informed decision.  There are thousands and thousands of guys who wish it had never been done to them, and are involved in foreskin restoration.  That should warn you away from a circumcision procedure right there.<br>  Go to:  www.norm.org and read up about the reason and function of the foreskin.  The reasons for circumcision,....cleaner, better, healthier are all myths promoted by the medical industry to make money.<br>  A bit of research will show you how much better it is to be intact.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	supposedly there is a 30% decrease in sensitivity bc of scar tissue forming on the head but they can still have an orgasm|`|eELS8zSRaa	Aren't all males? And yes I am and all, and I wouldn't really know how it has an effect on me seeing as I haven't had sex while being not circumcised. Unless you mean someone that had it done when they were adults.|`|flCA0CpRaa	It's the same.|`|E64juLwJaa	I was cut when i was an adult age due to complaints<br>  For me it only got better<br>  Colors<br>  No more pain and blood every time.|`|K4zsztkRaa	Oh absolutly!<br>  <br>  I was circumcised at birth. <br>  Sex felt great circumcised I'm not going to lie. and you can't ask this question to guys who are circumcised and haven't felt what it's like to be uncircumcised through restoration or being circumcised later in life.<br>  Sex felt really good and I didn't think that circumcision took away that much sensitivity. Well I started restoring my foreskin and wow, there is a huge difference.<br>  My orgasms are more powerful, they last longer, they go throughout your whole body more, sex feels so much better and you don't have to try to get an orgasm. All the time and effort I put into my pleasure I can put into my partner and they can enjoy sex more. Because sex is more enjoyable for me and my paretner now, the sex lasts longer we go for a longer time to enjoy everything more.<br>  <br>  Circumcision does reduce sensitivity in a big way. If it didn't I wouldn't have noticed the big change it made.<br>  <br>  -Connor

By that criterion, a person on a 2000-calorie diet should consume no more than 50 grams of carbohydrate in the form of sugar. (One teaspoon of sugar provides 4 grams of carbohydrate.) On the other hand, the National Academy of Sciences Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) sets the cut-off at 25% of calories, or 125 grams of carbohydrate from sugar on a 2000-calorie diet.

Here are some basic suggestions for meals.<br>  <br>  Start your day off with fruit, an egg (not fried) and even a low-fat yogurt.<br>  For lunch, eat a tuna sandwich on pita bread or low carb bread (w/low-fat mayo, as well), a salad and a 1" chunk of cheese.<br>  <br>  Stay away from Soda, cookies and cake!<br>  <br>  Limit the other types of carb heavy items, like potatoes, pasta and bread.<br>  <br>  For dinner have another salad, any amount of skinless, white meat chicken you want(prepared in a broiler) or unprocessed meat/fish, unbuttered or sauced veggies and a unflavored or lightly seasoned rice cake.<br>  <br>  Snack on fruit, a breakfast bar or chunk of cheese during the day if you get hungry...DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF!<br>  <br>  Drink 8 glasses of water a day...especially during your hunger hours and before a meal; besides your body needing it, it fills you up so you eat less.<br>  <br>  As long as you eat right and avoid high carb items...Don't worry about weighing or calculating items, it will only make it harder to maintain after you've lost weight.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.
AA10271093	It does happen. When it first happened to me, I was quite young. I woke up with a start and found my left arm "gone," and I panicked because I thought I was paralyzed. I couldn't even raise it -- the arm was hanging like a hunk of meat from my shoulder. I had to use my other hand to raise it! It got completely OK in 10 minutes, though.<br>  <br>  When it happened again, though not so bad, I asked a doctor-cousin. She said it indicated a circulation problem, and it should be investigated if<br>  (a) It happens in a pattern, or if<br>  (b) It happens too often, like twice a week or more.<br>  <br>  So that's your answer... as for me, it was there for about two months, then it stopped.|`|AA11833633	ya sometimes instead of the pins and needles feeling you can sometimes lay or sit on it the same way but this time it takes away all feelings..its weird..i sat weird last week and when i got up i almost snapped my leg back the wrong way because i went to stand on it and couldnt feel all the way to my knee...its weird...just as long it disappeared after you walked around then you should be ok..if not your doctor needs to send you to a neurologist|`|Wdi4QRPsaa	Happens to me allllllllll the time! It doesn't have to have the tingling feeling!|`|gsyhNAiRaa	most likely you feel asleep in a weird position and the blood supply to you lower half was cut off for some time. It was probability nothing, but if it happens repeatedly seek medical attention or get a new mattress.
Xkq5kHLNaa	Have you ever seen Kate Moss? Google her. Huuuuuuuugggeee supermodel. Super hot. Totally small busted. Youre fine, love, every girl is different. Try to enjoy your body, your own sexiness. Once you know that about yourself, everyone will see it too:)|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	and you are how old????|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Well your boobs can grow into your 20's<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|OaCs5bLPaa	Everyone grows at different rates, and the more you actually look at yourself, then the smaller you think they are. Just relax, take it easy, and if your friends tease you about it, just say, "At least I don't knock out people when I turn" or something like that. Don't be embarrassed or upset, because I'm sure you'll find a few girls stuff their bra's ;)|`|sKMHSHNcaa	okay, im 12 and a can almost fit into an A<br>  i wish i had bigger boobs.<br>  i get teased about it a lot, <br>  and honestly i have been searching for a while<br>  for tricks on how to make myself look bigger. <br>  the only thing that seems to work,<br>  is to cross your bra straps or like tie them up in the back so that they are an X and to take eyeshadow and put a little bit in the crack, and around the sides.|`|tvTnjozqaa	Theres nothing wrong with having small breasts.  If you are small, that is how your body is supposed to be.  How old are you? You might still be growing.  If you are 5'4'' and weigh 100 pounds like me, double D cup size would just look ridiculous for you, ya know?|`|UBBe1YIXaa	not everyone likes em HUGEEE.... ; )
5s5qrYeKaa	curvy|`|xqQO81Omaa	Maybe a pear or you might be a mix of hourglass and pear. But either way, it sounds like a good figure. Both hourglass and pears shapes are associated with a curvy waist/hip ratio.|`|yFdKtjQVaa	curvy-hourglass thing going,<br>  and  big hips does not mean pear shape.<br>  <br>  here is example of pear shape:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/08/01/health/adam/19265.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007...</a>|`|v811KD7raa	big hips is a pear isnt it?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pear_shaped" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pear_shaped</a><br>  <br>  The comparison is less literal when the term is applied to people, where it means wide at the hips, a use that goes back to at least 1815, and one that can have either positive connotations (as in Venus figurines) or negative, depending upon the context.|`|VaZTTjQQaa	your not fat but you are not thin... You sound like your average|`|I6Yomm21aa	i say sexy hott :D|`|DaCG7ougaa	Usually when you have larger hips, the body type you associate with would be a pear. <br>  Think of the the shape of a pear, smaller up top and gets slightly larger.<br>  <br>  An hourglass shape is just as it sounds, larger up top, slim waist and larger behind. Hourglass is also associated with being "curvy"<br>  <br>  Although, you are quite small you may also have a petite pear shape.<br>  Alot of people don't fit into one perticular classification.
FLXQ56DMaa	Your mother has manic depression. I'm an adult and my mother has it also. Over the years it became progressivly worse and eventually I had to say to myself I can't be responsible for another persons actions.  As for college you can absolutly go without your parents, there are grants(you don't have to pay back) and loans (you do pay back). You need to tell an adult in your world before she seriously injures you or another member of your family. When you said her eyes were red ect. thats a point that they do not have control over their actions anymore.  Thats why people can plead "by reason of insanity" . Your right she is literally not sane at these moments,and theres nothing you can do to change that.You need to protect yourself because no one else is from the sound of it. I saw an answer saying "you add fuel to it ...be kind to your mother" but I'm sorry to say "kind" does not fix mental disorder..tried that for years. Seek adult help and intervention. Violence is unaccepable and will continue to escalate. It's not her fault. I'm sorry for you and the path that lays before you, I have walked many miles on it. You can still be ok even if your parent is not. Best of luck. GET HELP TODAY.|`|Z2bBA2rUaa	talk to your dad about it .. your mom has problems. or takl to a counselor.<br>  <br>  yah it really helps bieng a  christian!|`|F0sfmZFnaa	My heart really goes out to you. I can't imagine how hard that must be, and i want you to know that I will pray for you tonight even though I don't know you - God listens and knows who you are. I really will. <br>  <br>  That being said, the very first thing I can suggest to you is to fall on Jesus. If you aren't a Christian, that may really tick you off...but let me tell you, in my life, when all else has failed, He has pulled me through. I know this girl who tried to kill herself so many times - she tried drowning herself, suffocating herself, slitting her wrists...the list goes on and on. But then one day, someone introduced her to Jesus and her life has never been the same. Let me tell you, Christ can get you through ANYTHING.<br>  <br>  Next, your mother does need help. That is not normal at all. First of all, you are being physically abused and that needs to be reported. You don't have a healthy home life and someone needs to know. The first person I would see is a mature adult you trust very much, or your school counselor or a teacher you trust. You don't need to stay in this situation any longer, and neither does your sister. Also, you are being neglected by your father when this happens...yet another problem. Yet you are right, your mother DOES need help...but if she won't go get it herself then you have to take the initiative and tell an adult. It may seem like a bad idea now, but if this escalates anymore, you and your sister could be in very severe danger. Imagine, if your mother accidently hits her head next time to hard, and then tries to blame it on you - then the authorities are going to come to you for answers. <br>  <br>  This scenario is terrible and I am so sorry it its happening to you. But first, call upon your Savior, Jesus, and just ask Him for help. Open up a Bible - it has some truth in it that you will find no where else. Then, realize that you can't help this by yourself. It is time to get another adult involved. Find someone you trust, and tell them. I am praying for you tonight!!!! :)|`|zxaqL885aa	First off, i want to say that im terribly sorry that you have to live with that kind of a life. Second i think you should talk to maybe an aunt or uncle, grandparent even. Tell them what she does and tell them what you think should happen. Whether that be she go to a doctor to find out if something if actually wrong or w.e it may be. <br>  I hope i could help and good luck!<br>  P.S-It sounds like she has Bipolar. Maybe check into the signs of bipolar and see if they match up with your mothers behaviour|`|qBS4b7Kjaa	My mother is even more insane, she accuses me of **** she does.  When I was seven I was called manipulative, but she gets everything out of her husband by manipulating him.|`|JTVzERXhaa	Yes, your mom is unstable.<br>  But you're a partial fuel for it. BE KIND TO YOUR MOTHER!<br>  There's obviously something wrong, you need to love her too and she will love you back.<br>  You both are acting very immature and it isn't working out. Mediate things now or you'll regret it a lot in the future.<br>  Does she raise you by yourself? That can be a lot of stress.<br>  <br>  Some things can be hard to understand, but you must try your best because, regardless, she is your mother.<br>  <br>  Your mom shouldn't be doing that stuff anytime to you, but never allo her to inflict herself or you harm. Be reasonable.|`|JsQHs2y5aa	First of all. I am so extremely sorry.<br>  your situation sounds horrible. You sounds like you are handling it very well and maturely. But It sounds like your mother is bi-polar. My half sisters mother is..and she does things just like that. Talk to you dad convince him to get her to a doctor.|`|LOfZNNdfaa	I believe your mom has bipolar disorder.  That would explain the mood swings that last a couple of months, maybe sometimes longer?  Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder.  In  a depressed state a person can have suicidal thoughts.  In another state people can be really irritable.  Anxiety, paranoia, extreme highs, extreme lows., irritability are all part of bipolar disorder.  I think your mom needs help.  Your going to need your Dad's help on this.  I would try calling the psychiatry department at the local hospital.  They might be able to give you ideas.  I don't know to much about these things, but, If you tell them your mom abuses you they might take her away from you,  I'm not sure about that, but they might.  So it's up to you whether or not you share that with someone.  People with this disorder, well their mood swings get worse with age.  Once she gets medicated and finds a medicine that works for her ( which could take months) you will start to see her stabilize.  If your bipolar it doesn't mean that you are insane or crazy.  It is simply a mood disorder.  It's very common.  Two percent of the population is Bipolar.  Abraham  Lincoln was bipolar. Robin Williams is Bipolar.  I believe Issac Newton was.  There are several more brilliant people who were Bipolar.|`|drGeNPUIaa	gosh i'm sorry.  your mom is pretty insane.  that must be pretty hard.  She abuses you, so depending on how old you are, i would get her help.  Get your dad to help you get her in an institution, if thats what you think is best.  But yeah thats not too normal
f8mLpPXlaa	sinus drainage.
FC9J4aiuaa	The right frontal lope is used for non-verbal memory. <br>  So i would expect that would be affected. <br>  As for sight and hearing damage, that can only be answered by the doctor working with you, no one here can fully tell you the effects or complications with out knowing about your medical info or history.|`|f4df9712869843dd814c1e02d77242eaaa	as with any surgery, there are going to be some risks....Open surgical procedures such as ATL which is probably what you are having, have inherent risks including damage to the brain (either directly or indirectly by injury to important blood vessels), bleeding (which can require re-operation), blood loss (which can require transfusion), and infection.  no surgery is ever really risk free.  however, you should still listen and consider what your doctor tells you. and you should ask them about the risks and complications etc that could happen when they remove the rest.
c6ff08c632b9e5165a8a3d098d3a1710aa	Green Tea is Good!! :-)<br>  It has low amounts of Caffeine and is really actually great for you|`|AA11881831	Many people find exercise invigorating, or a brisk shower. If the latter, I recommend that you dry off with a plush, absorbent towel, and that you air-dry your towels after washing them instead of putting them in a dryer, in order to maintain the nap.|`|TZhfrmwHaa	an apple awakes you up better... i swear.. coffee gives you more energy though.... but try an apple:)|`|57Avg06Waa	Tea! ^_^|`|zrFzbDHUaa	SEX|`|k6M48eUMaa	Exercise or a warm shower!<br>  And food/drink wise, try tea (but without sugar and use low fat milk)
ke1SgRxTaa	you could be simply overly tired from lack of sleep try not watchin tv in the first place b4 you go to bed shutt off the tv and don't turn it back on
krTu5cftaa	most definitely, like stated above, you can do pushups and situps.. but there's always more. For your arms, I don't know what the name of this is, but sit in a chair and move out so that your butt hangs off and your hands are only supporting your body weight. then bend your arms to a 90 degree angle without pushing your butt to the ground. This is definitely a workout for me. Another would be for the arms and stomach at the same time. Do a push up. When you come back up, twist your body so that you have all of your weight on one hand while you hold the other hand to the sky and count to ten. This gets really tiring. <br>  <br>  I like to use my body mass as the weights so that I don't have to worry about going to the gym and stuff.|`|E4UT1fi9aa	Do push ups (do them from your knees if necessary until you can do full ones), dips (which Leslie described above) and some of the ab exercises here: <a href="http://www.free-ab-workout.com/best-ab-exercises.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-ab-workout.com/best-ab-e...</a>|`|TwqpkWfZaa	good old fasion push ups and sit ups are the best|`|fsSQrbjOaa	Do some push ups.Trust me they work.I am strong for being a girl.
L1FUcmb0aa	Based on your description by itself, it seems like you just got stressed and dreamed of a teacher as evil or made an adversary or something, and decided to strangle her. Sometimes, dreamers act upon their dreams during their sleep. Maybe you didn't realize it, but you were just slightly dreaming during the REM stage of your sleep. Sometimes, I dream of someone chasing me. When I run and I am about to jump in a dream, my legs, (i'm not sure if voluntary, but I think it is involuntary) just move. I kick, raise my leg, or something. Maybe this is the same with you, except a bit more extreme, like a bit more into the sleepwalking stage.
DKYNxb7aaa	extreeme swelling (about the size of a golf ball to a tennis ball)<br>  <br>  severe and unbearable pain ( bones are the site of red blood cell formation and hold a large majority of nerves)<br>  <br>  bruising ( usually not a lot of brusing, or hardly any in not too severe)|`|kt7kkOtqaa	You definitely wouldn't be able to type. You'd probably have trouble making a fist, and you'd have pretty severe pain and plenty of swelling. It might also make your arm look like it's not aligned correctly, depending on how it broke. But mostly, it hurts a lot.|`|EF9LHIPpaa	You should be able to tell, if its broken youll see it.  If its fractured itll hurt like hell and you wont be able to lift much, it might also swell.  Ive only broken two bones, but i heard the snap both times, so i knew.  If you think its broken you should definitely get an xray to be sure.
KyShUk8kaa	Free weights and crunches.|`|GL920Xv5aa	Cardio|`|fOfqPATaaa	Well I find it hard to believe you are fat if you are 5'5 and only 109lbs. so if anything you probably just need to tone up.. Grab a pilate's dvd and do a 20 minute exercise every or every other day =D Hope I helped!|`|I96VRgmNaa	start running everyday, it will be hard at first but you should get used to it. You can even join your cross-country or track team at high school. That will really help. Long distance will get you healthy and feeling good about yourself.|`|ZtKzg1pCaa	running and exercise helps. u have to eat fewer calories than the ones u lose during exercising. BUT, don't starve yourself just do exercising that is specific to your needs. like working on your abs :)|`|uXFdeKGPaa	this worked for me try it|`|1bvl5zbkaa	Go to the gym or go for a run.|`|rG8dPYvwaa	cycling helps u to tone up muscles in calf area which is ur skinny ones and gain muscles  and it reduces fat from belly and waist area try doing outdoor cycling. besides u can do swimming, running, skipping all these helps in overall body structure. <br>  and i dont want to comment on diet because i think a good exercise can reduce any amount of fat and it has nothing to do with what u eat it doesn't matter what u r eating but in a proportionately.|`|v7GI8Lpaaa	Runnnnn :D|`|LkV1SC2vaa	have u ever heard of a diet simple as that
7M3JTnbxaa	Honestly?..<br>  <br>  The only way you can lose your virginity is by a REAL penis entering your vagina. That is, a penis with a live man on the end of it.<br>  <br>  You can tear your hymen by doing non-sexual activities, but just because your hymen is broken does not mean you aren't a virgin. Like I said, the only way to lose your virginity is by having sexual intercourse. Also you can have sex without breaking your hymen, but it is rare that this happens.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	definition of virgin is to be unpenetrated. If you bang yourself with a rubber dong or a real one I would imagine if you busted your cherry then you aren't a virgin anymore....Welcome to sin sweethart, there's plenty of room here...lol|`|dd83ec34a7001b938f4187223bc6e654aa	It sounds as though some of those girls need to be on here asking these questions because they are clearly clueless. A person is a virgin until they have intercourse with an actual person.|`|NhF9sM5jaa	sex is : penis to vaginal intercourse<br>  <br>  whether your hymen is broken or not<br>  it can break from sports even<br>  or may not break the first time you have sex|`|3HmeRqpfaa	Yes.|`|PNrJS4OKaa	You're considered a virgin until your hymen is torn, but because a hymen can be torn in many ways, you're a virgin until you're penetrated by a male. Your hymen might not tear the first time if you're not penetrated enough (for some it will hurt, and not for others, some people don't bleed either.). You can tear your hymen many ways, horseback riding is one of them, not sure about popping your legs (like splits?)|`|lEVn5w0naa	WEll the true thing that i asked my mum which is a sexual health doctor. she said that when ur hymen breaks by a man its when ur not a virgin because u just gave up u virginity to a man. and yes if u pop ur leg it might cause ur hymen and break it because the bones in the leg are attached to bones around the bones that are holding hymen and poping moves bones and if you pop it hard enough it might break and usually ends up with breaking ur leg.|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	whhaatt?? hahah<br>  you are not a virgin if a penis is penetrating inside of you whether or not your hymen breaks.
DKYNxb7aaa	ok well first off there are over 210 bones in the average human body.  to break every  bone is near impossible.  second off, the ribcage protects your most vital organs, and if those bones were broken, then major damage to heart and lungs.  third off if the skull were to fracture, then you  could die in a matter of minutes.  if the brain surrounded by the skull is deprived of oxygen for more than 3 min then goodbye.  fourth, if the spinal chord is broken then instant death.  the brain stem is what keeps your heart and lungs from stopping.   so if that breaks then death.  the most you could break and live is arms, legs, pelvis,  scapula, clavicle, and mandible.|`|bBICSdS4aa	probably not., haha .|`|Jq4TdGShaa	YES EVIL KANIEVIL DID IT TWICE AND LIVED BUT HE IS DEAD NOW FROM OLD AGE|`|c55O7jqXaa	Well I suppose you could be kept alive by a machine, but as for living probably not. I would say breaking every bone in your neck and back would do you in.
VWvI5RyBaa	Are you sure it's a bump or could it be something similar to a pimple?  It happens to me once in a while.  I would wait a few days if it doesn't hurt too much and see a doctor to be on the safe side but I really don't believe it's anything to worry about.  I had a bump on my forehead for a few years now.  I went to see the doctor, had x-rays the same day and there wasn't anything wrong, nothing to worry about anyway.|`|KHC2oE8iaa	wow i will pray for you. i don't jump at the sight of every little thing that hurts but that's just me. try taking something that will help bring down the swelling. is it a swelling? i mean how big is it really? because from what i've dug up knowledge bumps are fictional. you can't tell if a person is smart by looking at them lol. but seriously though take care.
icgTII3Maa	Read all about Muscle Relaxers here:<br>  <a href="http://www.pharmacyreviewer.com/forum/blogs/ladypam/20-muscles-need-relax-too.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pharmacyreviewer.com/forum/bl...</a>|`|FIG58FVpaa	It's a muscle relaxer.|`|esLsR6keaa	Soma is a muscle relaxer.  The generic name is carisoprodol(sic?).  It is sort of like Valium.  It usually comes in 350mg doses.  Be careful with Soma, it's very easy to become dependent on this medication.  It's also easy to overdose on it.  If you're Mom is going to take Soma for a short period she should be ok.  It's a pretty strong muscle relaxer.|`|3usRDmQhaa	i thought it was the drug use in the novel, Brave New World|`|oJHMMRilaa	i dunno|`|Ze25ovEiaa	What hbb said.|`|JEAsvaVXaa	You can check and get full info at webmd, What I do know from all I heard is that it was giving as a muscle relaxer, it must be very strong and addicting to alot of people because they end up abusing and it knocks them out. Tell your mom I hope she gets well, but please be careful and keep an eye on her. Hope this helped a little :)|`|MDsufhrZaa	it's a muscle relaxer.<br>  it makes you feel drunk when you take it, i've taken (abused) them before.<br>  don't abuse drugs, it's awful for your body, and it's addicting and unattractive.|`|zn42cMfTaa	Soma is a muscle relaxer
c3c4c27ec88e366dbdf39ae257e73554aa	You'll most likely need a referral to a Rheumatologist. I went and saw 3 GPs before I was finally referred to one and diagnosed with Fibro. <br>  <br>  Don't give up. Some doctors don't believe in Fibromyalgia, so find one who does and don't give up until you do!<br>  <br>  ...|`|MoN9BmJVaa	What make you think you do is the first question the doc is going to ask, I have had fibro for 15 years, I went to all kinds of specialists, and dr.s go in like your telling them and they will listen, gp or special it doest matter some will want to send you to others to see if their is a underlying cause,tell me what you feel like and I can let you know how to go about what to tell the doc.
qLuodu3Raa	g string is just like a string in the crack a thong is wider|`|CvsZVTUTaa	A g string is just like a thong but a very thinner version. Like its name says, its practically a string.<br>  A thong is considered a thong if it just goes up your ***, not matter what width or how thick it is.|`|tgIohzO6aa	a thong actually has material at the rear...<br>  and a g-string is just a piece of elastic that is in the shape of a T|`|VoQN7ADvaa	G string is just a string. A lot of times, it's like bra strap material and sized. Thongs are wider and stuff.|`|aY08TZIaaa	A form of underwear for women. Risky in the sense that some women who wear it shouldn't. Consists of an *** string and a very thin frontal portion. Worn on the right women, it is extremely sexy.|`|bdkV3eVUaa	I thought they were the same thing but differing cultures use different terms...|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	g string= butt dental floss|`|3zl6DrjVaa	thong
LSI6JaJxaa	OK. Here's the scoop. You may think you are not hungry because your mind is preoccupied with other things, so you are too busy to eat. Then, when you either smell or taste something good, your body reacts to this, sending signals to the stomach (causing it to release digestive juices) and to your mouth (causing it to release saliva) in preparation for an appetizing meal. This is why many people eat an "appetizer" or have a glass of wine first when going out to dinner at a nice restaurant. It's simply a way to get their body ready to eat all that expensive food!|`|73fa1d799d3ce3c53b01984cb818b944aa	Because your body told you to eat, however if you are not hungry probably you are not needed much.|`|TORBP6QIaa	Yes...the same happens to me...I don't know why either and am interested to hear from someone who has an explanation for this.|`|jLenXALXaa	A hormone released in your body.

k86KdyYOaa	It's because the pressure on your legs when you run is something that your body isn't used to. The pounding that happens when you run causes the circulation in your legs to increase, making all of the blood rush to that area. That's why they turn red. And they itch because the blood is rushing toward the surface. Have you ever sat at one of those foot massager things that they have at county fairs and malls and stuff? You're supposed to put your feet on it, and it vibrates really hard. Then your feet get itchy because the vibrations cause all of the blood to rush to your skin. It's the same concept. It kinda sucks that it happens, especially if you are running in public and your legs look like tomatoes.

There's no way for you guys to look after her if you were trashed yourselves.You know you need to change and those scratches should motivate you to end this kind of lifestyle. Now, since you are still in high school, your parents may actually be an essential part of your effort to change. Don't worry if they feel like complete failures. Just let them know that you need a little help and as parents its their responsibility to be there for you. Since you're in pretty deep you probably need to seek help from a support group. Its hard, but letting go of "friends" who influence you to do those things may also be necessary. Take care

I have had many many back injuries thru out the years and I constantly strain my back. The best thing you can do is ice it for 20 minutes on and an hour off and 20 minutes back on and so forth. Then I suggest Ibuprofen or something that will help with inflammation. A back brace helps quite a bit to immobilize it while it heals and to keep from pulling it over and over. <br>  <br>  It wouldn't hurt to go to the doctor though they usually don't do much, but to ice, back brace, and rest. <br>  <br>  It is just gonna take some tie to heal. Once it is healing nicely you can slowly stretch it out again. <br>  <br>  I am sorry this happened.

VkVyuq5baa	Yes, when I get extremely nervous. It happens when I am at university sometimes.<br>  <br>  PS. When you avoid eye contact it is known as a "safety behaviour". Safety behaviours allow you to feel calmer if you meet their conditions, but the basis of any such behaviour is avoidance. I attend a weekly class for tackling anxiety and we are taught to ignore these (for example, you would not be allowed to avoid eye contact). The main treatment for anxiety is exposure, which means you have to confront and feel the anxiety head on. It teaches you that anxiety cannot harm you and the practice makes things easier. That said, facing anxiety head on is extremely difficult and it is easy to fall back into a deep-rooted pattern of avoidance.|`|Z5g7hCXraa	Mildly, not to the extent that you describe.  It happens to me occasionally when I am nervous while talking to people and I'm uncertain.  After a while it usually goes away if I calm myself and determine what my "role" is in a situation.  I hope that makes sense.<br>  I can tell by your question that you are a talkative person.  Relaxing and not stressing out can require WORK.  It takes a long time to get past it.  <br>  In my experience, anxiety wasn't always related to social situations, but I can tell you that identifying the physical reaction as separate from the emotion was key for me.  The elephant on my chest was there because I was responding incorrectly to an irrational fear.  I had to sort of have a little conversation with myself.  "You are okay here.  You don't need to be afraid of _______, because ________"  Then taking some deep breaths and deliberately changing my line of thought would help me over that bump in the road, until the next one came along.<br>  <br>  Please consider consulting a pastor as well.  This was crucial in my recovery.<br>  <br>  I hope I've helped.

However, each case of anxiety is somewhat unique to the individual. I know that feeling of detatchment, its called depersonalization. It is that feeling of things seem not to be real. I do know that feeling. Just out of curiousity, do you feel like you are falling when you go to sleep? That is another symptom of underlying anxiety. <br>  <br>  Talking to people and engaging in a conversation usually takes me out of the depersonalization experience. Doing a physical activity will do the same, but it usually takes more time. <br>  <br>  However, these are all symptoms. Anxiety itself is usually a symptom and not the disease. What is going on in your life? Do you have a lot of achievement goals? Do you strive for perfection? Do you tell yourself I have to do this or else? These are all things to consider. Also, what is your self-talk like? Do you tell yourself the most negative crazy things? I did. <br>  <br>  Control, control was a lot of my problem. The need to feel in control of my environment. We are not perfect, we are human. If we were all perfect the world would be dull and meaningless. Nothing would have value if it was not for pain, struggle and failure. Without failure we can never truly learn. I try now to think of the anxiety as something to learn from and experience to learn from. I have learnt from so many when I went through the same symptoms that you are going through. And some day you will be able to help, connect and share with others the same problems that you are going through. <br>  <br>  Our society breeds anxiety. We expect perfection nowadays. It is insanity. It is our imperfections that make us unique, that make us different, but also help us come together. <br>  <br>  Love, start to open the compassionate heart. Try helping someone in need, try talking to someone that is going through the same thing we are. You are not alone brother, I am right there with you. I know anxiety too. This does not mean we should not strive to do things or to do good, but it is our approach that causes a lot of anxiety or value on the cure and not care. Cure is part of the perfection aspect, but the focus should be on care. It is through care that we can heal in all aspects and share the experiences...Its part of the healing process.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, what has helped me is knowing there is a God that loves very dearly no matter what. I used to focus on what I can do for God or how much I love God, but I forgot that he loves me no matter what, God does love whether you think so or not. Love God, other people, the animals and the earth. Question things, question your self-talk and your negative self-talk; debate with it. Questioning leads to a deeper truth, seek. I am with you in this, I know how that perception of a lack of control can creep on to us. Like you may be going crazy and not in control of yourself. Let go of that need for control and just love. <br>  <br>  Now, love does not mean that we let everything go on, even evil. We must speak and question things that we think are wrong, otherwise, we no better than Hitler. But all our questioning and actions must be done with love and betterment of the eachother in mind.|`|UAh16Trtaa	hmm Well there is a symptom of physical depression that is a external reaction to your internal depression and anxiety. I know exactly what you mean. You have to keep yourself with people in a group because it makes you stop reflecting from the self all the time.
DT80y28Maa	Yes i do. I went to the E.R yesterday for an asthma attack<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit: when someone puts "20 characters" that means they were trying to fill up space because Y/A says to enter AT LEAST 20 CHARACTERS when asking a question.|`|Pg3M8EvNaa	Yes. I use an inhaler and a nebulizer to treat chronic respiratory problems including asthma.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	What's with the 20 characters?
PGkR813Jaa	You have a nasty infection.<br>  Possibly a stye, Pink Eye or conjunctivitis.<br>  <br>  Either way, wash your eye with a wet, warm cloth. Use toilet paper if you have to. ONLY use it ONCE. AND only on that infected eye.<br>  WASH YOUR HANDS!!!!!<br>  DO NOT touch your other eye.<br>  <br>  Contact your Doctor for an appointment ASAP.|`|AHnDTl0Zaa	Are you sensitive to sunlight?  Have you woken up with your lids shut?  do you experience itching?  Is the discharge yellowish or greenish?<br>  <br>  If you said yes to 2 or more questions, you may have conjunctivitis, known as pinkeye.  Antibotics help but generally it just needs to run its course.  Wash your hands ALL the time but especially after touching your eyes.|`|Rem7xsCUaa	its probably pink eye, and its contagious so u should go to the doctor and keep it covered up. wen i had it the doctor gave me a cream and a eyepatch, so the germs wouldnt spread and i couldnt rub my eye.|`|fSpaklrraa	may some kind of infection. try anti-biotic eye drops like gentamicin , or ciprofloxacin. but better consult ur physician.|`|ke1SgRxTaa	pink eye
c55O7jqXaa	Yes it will eventually heal up. The younger you are usually the quicker it will heal, but if you are older like me arthritis tends to set into those joints and it takes forever to feel better. The last time I broke my toe- my big toe it took over 2 years before I was actually not feeling pain in it when I would bend it. I have also broken my pinky toes several times and also stubbed them too many times than I care to say, but they do eventually heal up. It is different for everyone. <br>  <br>  Do you still have your orthopedic shoe? If not I would consider getting another because it helps in the healing process if you don't wear a shoe on that foot.|`|TORBP6QIaa	I feel your pain....I fractured and dislocated my pinky toe about 6 years ago and every year or two I will stubb it again and end up dislocating it etc...<br>  Do the ice routine and take ibuprofen for the pain and raise your foot at rest.<br>  It is likely always going to be vulnerable to this sort of injury and what I have done to try minimise doing it again is get some shoes like those Croc shoes (the original clog style) that I can slip on quickly and wear them so my toe isnt so vulnerable.  So far so good...
HNFGjUZOaa	guys get erections in school all the time, i guess we are just really damn good at hiding it... unless you are the type that just really does not care... but guys just tuck their penis up under their underware elastic band or belt buckle.   then the only thing they have to worry about is their shirts lifting up because if that happens....  <br>  <br>  hope this cures your curiosity :)|`|FQ6To7LAaa	do what Seth said in superbad, tuck it up to the waistband, and plus when i do it and someone says something i say I'm fixing myself, other guys would understand. but girls don't have any extra "materials" down there so sometimes there weird-ed out but all they have to do is worry about there underwear riding up.. :)|`|qifK7Eepaa	No, we sit there and think of things that makes it go away...... Standing up and going to the bathroom with a hard-on can be embarressing.|`|mWEQzvOzaa	We just tuck it way under the elastic of our drawers...We dont jerk it...|`|IfZz1hOgaa	carry a folder in front of it if i hae to get up|`|qS89FopZaa	I usually just sit with my arms folded on my lap and i make it go parallel with my body by taking that part of my pants and moving them lower but with subtlety|`|gTS6xTO4aa	I'm 17 and it still happens occassionally<br>  it always happens in my history class for some reason.. i dont know why. maybe cause its just so boring<br>  <br>  normally i don't do anything, because there is a desk over me covering it.. but i would definitely avoid standing up. <br>  also i just think of really disgusting stuff.|`|MAdFY7Vlaa	When i get one at skool, i jus try 2 think of something else so it can go down.

32d13f28431aba8eab0ec9d21a5bdf42aa	Try BASE jumping. It's the ultimate high for folks leaning towards self destructiveness. A chute costs1G.|`|0QT8laMOaa	Seek counceling. Your first step is admitting you have a problem. Next one is to talk to someone about it. They will figure out what triggers these feelings and help you find ways to deal with the feelings. If there is anything that really calms you down, reading a book, listening to music, sitting on a swing at a park, anything you enjoy doing then do it when you feel this way. When you want to drink call a friend instead and talk to them. Dont be afraid to ask for help or to talk to them.|`|EJSdI25Naa	First you have to realise and accept that your way of coping is not doing the trick. Okay?<br>  <br>  So, if, say, somebody tells your makeup looks awful, doing your block is not going to help any, is it? You might say or ask that person what would she recommend you do to correct it. That is simple enough.<br>  <br>  Let's imagine you have lost your false teeth. Bleating about the fact is only going to give others the reason to think that you must be silly. Shut up. Look. It's okay to feel frustrated about the matter but don't let it get the better of you, you get the better of it.<br>  <br>  Now this is very hard to do. For you particularly because you have always done your block about it. Nobody cares and the way you carry on makes them unbothered about you, the person.<br>  <br>  Just shut your trap. I guarantee you, you will find your false teeth still in the same spot that you left them, probably in the bathroom sink. <br>  <br>  Just practice that. After a few times you will be perfect. Everybody will come to realise that there is substance in you. Please do not disappoint them.
NPQ17XfHaa	Blood is not flowing properly to them, and thus not enough oxygen is getting into those parts of the body. That's how they fall asleep. The "pins and needles" sensation is when the blood is flowing back and oxygen is going into your limbs.
0Ye3d4C3aa	alot of people have had dreams about having sex with someone they shouldnt be. unless this becomes a common occurance, i would just brush it off as a bad dream. it just may mean that your dad (or someone like him) is making you feel taken advantage of (even in an insignificant unsexual way). if it starts to happen alot, though, id see a therapist incase it is a supressed memory or you were abused by someone|`|5BmnSiqUaa	.<br>  Eeeewww ! ! !<br>  .|`|1GngWPDiaa	usually that means he sexually assaulted you as a young, young age.<br>  that's happened to several of my friends.<br>  <br>  my gosh..i'm so sorry though..that's such a scary thought.<br>  feel better about it..or hopefully they end or something!

TTqU2U4laa	It depends why you have the headaches. I know that if it actually is related to the neck pain, the chiropractor should be able to help. Tension and migraine headaches are frequently associated with cervical muscle spasms and joint dysfunction. This is probably the most common type of headache out there. The next most common reason would probably be something dealing with nutrition, but the chiropractor should be able to make the correlation. Headaches and low back pain are the areas chiropractors really shine!|`|7d7873da0c168e2a1cbda90dc29fd444aa	A chiropractor might be able to help. That all depends on the cause of your headaches. If the cause of your headaches is muscle tension, I would suggest seeing a massage therapist.
R0CUhaAtaa	Well, like the other girls out there, you'll need to slowly learn the 3 things about blowjobs that will get you your Phd in blowjobs;<br>  <br>  1. How to stroke it (in and out of your mouth without interruption) 1000 times...providing your guy can last that long<br>  2. How to swallow and not lose a drop<br>  3. How to take the whole penis into your mouth...all the way to the balls without gagging<br>  <br>  So take small steps and get good at them over time. Maybe get a little in your mouth and then let him shoot on your face or chest, and over time learn to take more and more.<br>  <br>  Let me know if you have any other questions.<br>  <br>  love.cc|`|jnOiqcAlaa	I don't know why guys find girls drinking their juices attractive. If you don't want to do it, don't! Get him almost all the way there, and then with your spit, finish him off into a tissue. Guys should just be happy that girls are willing to put their junk into their mouths!|`|cxJSW5p4aa	i would say to finsh him off your hands. if you don't like the taste of it .. then you dont like the taste of it and he shouldnt be so selfish to expect you to do it|`|19a8rUvCaa	have your man drink pineapple juice. it adds a sweet taste to the *** and it takes away the salty taste. <br>  good luckk (:|`|KUhZX3Hbaa	Throwing up on his legs and crotch is half the fun!

Then smile|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	hah.brush your teeth...or use mouthwash.<br>  for me if i use listerine mouth wash and then do it. the listerine numbs my mouth in a way so its hard for me to taste anything...<br>  <br>  not so much anymore since i'm use to the taste...no dont judge me, i have a husband :P not a slt! LOL!|`|utivEuTfaa	Find a guy who won't make you swallow his come. That's gross. That's probably not what you want to hear, but trust me, there are guys out there who will respect you enough to not expect you to do things that you don't want to. <br>  If a guy ever did that to me I'd hold it in my mouth, kiss him and spit it all into his mouth. He deserves to be thrown up on!|`|XAkLPdhqaa	Use mouthwash prior to giving him head, when he cums it will be easier for you to swallow. Also, swallow the semen quickly without thinking about it too much. It should help you from having the gag reflex. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qLuodu3Raa	yeah you don't let him do that in your mouth if you do not like it it isn't all about him you know if it makes you gag don't do it tell him swallow some if he thinks it is that important|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	u DONT Surpose to Swallow it! its Not Food|`|hhuLmaOpaa	he he that's funny. what your friend suggested of letting it out from the sides of your mouth is a good idea but this is another... i read it in a magazine so i put it to practice and it helps me and he loves it.. run your tounge in circles on the head of his thingy (penis). he will love the feeling and with that you are kinda mixing his liquids with your saliva so you notice it less...swallow often and concentrate on how you are MAKING HIM FEEL AND NOT SO MUCH ON THE LIQUIDS YOU ARE TAKING IN...ENJOY.HAHA- oh by the way- i do not swallow his happy ending c*m it's way too much ew. just keep going with your hand or somewhere else
MeKe9i7Qaa	On top of lowering your calories, you want to look for foods that are low in fats and carbohydrates but have lots of fiber.  Staying away from the fats and carbs will help you loose weight, and the fiber will keep you full in between meals.  Also make sure you follow the serving size indicated on the label.|`|WvbqAeSOaa	Sodium. Salt will make you retain water.|`|iQOqQGEpaa	ok u need to look at calories from fat if it is more than 30 it is not good.<br>  Then Saturaded fat and other fats if they're more than 5% than it is not good.

N2LLUmEkaa	So I took the time to research this because I really was intrigued and found a few things it may be. It may be a Bartholin cyst (<a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/bartholin_cyst/page11_em.htm#Multimedia" rel="nofollow">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/bartholin...</a> ). Another woman's gynecologist told her that "there's tons of blood vessels in the labia and that it engorges with blood when excited or aroused..forming a pea sized lump. Seems to only get large when i'm aroused....so i think she's right!" That sounds like your case. But neither of us are doctors, so please check with a gynecologist in case it may be something serious. And get back to us, please!|`|EvZNjL9haa	you sound very young, and while i'd like to think you wouldn't do this, i'm going to say it anyway- PLEASE do not send one of these pervs a picture of it. for the love of god. lol. just tell your mom you need to to go to the gyno because you have some questions you want to ask, or you think you might have a yeast infection, or whatever excuse you prefer. and when you get to the gyno, don't be afraid to tell them. it's okay that you get aroused, trust me they have heard and seen WAY worse things then what you're going to show them. i have never heard of anything like what you're describing so i'm not much help, but a gynocologist would be. look on webmd.com for similiar symptoms or use the symptom checker, or google your symptoms. good luck!|`|T3JmWOZHaa	I would have to say that sounds like an abnormal growth. I would definitely get it checked out by a professional.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	yes, definitely ask a doctor...no one here will be able to answer your question or give you a proper diagnosis. hopefully a doctor can ease your mind better than we can. good luck!|`|5GW5xGCwaa	Well, eventually you should at least ask the doctor about it. <br>  <br>  But my guess would be that its a gland that becomes swollen when you become aroused.  If it doesn't hurt and it's only when you are turned on it could just be from the hormones that are released during arousal.  Make sure it doesn't change drastically, if it does DEFINITELY get it checked out.
DyuXD9Evaa	at a certain point of sleep deficiency your focus is worse than that of the average drunk driver...if you can reach R.E.M. in those few hours before work or school no matter for how long your body will respond positively...|`|sI5jTpoRaa	Its better to sleep so your body and eyes have some time to rest|`|ZllkWRIOaa	If you do fall asleep you wont get up.|`|sgjjwXwwaa	Its better to sleep...

qifK7Eepaa	There's tricks to the trade my friend, it depends on the pressure and the speed you're exposing it to. If you feel that you're about to climax and your girl isn't then you slow it up and pull farther out in between thrusts. Of course you can 'train' yourself to last longer, the longest I've lasted has been around 30 minutes and that was the greatest sex I've ever had. Like I said it's all about the tricks and 'training' yourself for stamina.|`|lEVn5w0naa	Well i had sex alot its between 1hour to 1 hour and 30mins.<br>  because u have to spend 10 mins takin clothe of and touching and talikng.<br>  30 mins to do some kissing on body like oral.<br>  20 mins to actually get it done and *** on each other <br>  the sex mostly ends when the boy cums because they energy is wasted and he get tired.<br>  some advices:<br>  tell him not to be rough otha wise it'll hurt alot and it gonna finish soon|`|kvCa4xCmaa	i think good sex lasts like 10-15minutes...  but sometimes its shorter when its really good and sometimes its longer and that can be good too|`|XgO9HUm9aa	That is not long enough for a woman.

OR BY MASTR? SEE GP.|`|RBM3ncOJaa	Maybe you repulse him.|`|NnatPbU7aa	He might be gay|`|XgO9HUm9aa	Sarah, here's a list of reasons as to why this problem might be happening...<br>  <br>  Are you using a condom? It might be difficult to ejaculate with a condom on if someone is used to masturbation/oral sex/sex without one.<br>  <br>  Don't get offended, but you might have a bigger than average vagina. Some women are just built that way it's nothing that you have done it make it that way. If this is the case, there might not be enough friction/pressure inside to stimulate his penis enough for an orgasm. Or maybe he has a skinny penis.<br>  <br>  The most likely reason for this happening is that he has had 1000's of orgasms in his life...by himself. If a man is used to masturbating and ejaculating 1000's of times from the time he is a young boy, sex will be a different feeling. Even though he has been having sex for 11 years, he has probably given himself more orgasms than any woman will in his life and has conditioned his penis to ejaculating from masturbation.<br>  <br>  If he is masturbating still, tell him not to at all for a month. This is something that will help to reset his nervous system and allow him to *** from a different sensation like sex.|`|2f26838b56bf3bf335cfd0076639a2dcaa	From someone elses experience the reason they also had the same problem was because of issues in his head and pschyological problems (he was very odd indeed). Did your boyfriend have any issues/problems when he was younger?<br>  <br>  I am Suprised he hasnt had it sorted out earlier, 27 is pretty long time to have not ***! I think it can also be dangerous to not ejaculate because i think it can increase your chances of testicular cancer and its not going to have any posotive effects for his sperm, ie make it harder for him to concieve|`|ABIPeUsJaa	Well it seems that he is not that into you because for him not to c*m is very strange. I work in a doctors office and have never heard or read anything like that before. You should ask him if he really is into you or if he is just with you for something other that love cause if a guy really wants to be with you he will *** even in his sleep cause he desires you.|`|OSBGf8teaa	Get him to see a doctor|`|8ZrhxYK8aa	tell him to go to the doctor

1vaqtRI2aa	Like the woman above me said, it sounds like you have an ovarian cyst. <br>  <br>  Go to your doctor and scedule a sonogram.

UIYKRs1Zaa	First off, stop calling them "friends." They're called acquaintances.<br>  <br>  Second, stop think you're great at making people think your life is perfect. The fact that you think people think you have a perfect life makes your act not as great as you think. Only naive and ignorant people think that people are capable of having perfect lives. I bet that at least one person you has come to this conclusion.<br>  <br>  Cry every night? Talk to your family, talk to a counselor, talk to your wall. Personally, I think walls are the most effective because they can't blab back to you, nor are they egocentric. Don't keep a diary that you hope someone stumbles across. If you're going to write, make sure you burn it later (but careful not to burn your house down).<br>  <br>  As for your pain, meh. This world is a pretty terrible place to live in but it doesn't give you any reason to feel worse about yourself. In my opinion, satisfy your curiosity by challenging life and it's terrible institutionalized social structure. <br>  <br>  Avoiding mediocrity is key to survival.|`|0XI5eP70aa	Maybe you should start praying daily and ask God to fill your emptyness. Try going to church on Sundays (Pentecostal church) and maybe even read like 1 chapter of the Holy Bible a day.

Good luck :)|`|Tb5OoHrQaa	tell your friend, you said he's really close right?...well if you trust him i suggest telling him...any "real" friend will stick by you thru the thick and thin<br>  <br>  also there are plenty of self help sites out there with guidelines to follow|`|FMEHpZZFaa	First of all you need to talk to someone. The best thing you can do is to talk to a counselor or therapist. The second thing you need to do is to talk openly with your parents and maybe even your doctor who can make referrals for insurance coverage.<br>  What you are experiencing is more common than you might think. I know because I have treated adults and teens for over 20 years in the mental health profession.<br>  Do not let anyone that you tell respond to you by saying "It will all be OK... you just have to smile and be happy... it will pass..."<br>  Talk to someone soon, and when you do...no faking it. Let them know how you truely feel, especially a therapist or counselor. It is the only way that they can really help you. <br>  Hope this helps.|`|4sOjoi8Oaa	The only way to get rid of the pain is to deal with the pain.  Hiding it will only make it worse and is  akin to self loathing.  You feel your problems are so bad that no one will like you if they knew what you are hiding.  Well, maybe you are right...but I doubt it.  <br>  <br>  Please talk to a counselor either at school or call your doctor and make an appointment.  You are old enough to make your own appointment and go on your own, probably.  I know in my state, you have to be at least 12, but you sound older than that to me in your letter.  If nothing else, call a suicide hot line.  They have lots and lots of resources at their disposal.  <br>  <br>  God be with you.  My prayers go with you as well.|`|8vXPZnHkaa	Please, please ask one of your parents or relatives to take you to a counsellor.

0TT5q0cUaa	One pound of fat contains approximately 3,500 calories, so to lose one pound a week, a person should consume approximately 3,500 fewer calories per week. This can be done by reducing the daily intake by 500 calories per day (500 x 7 days will provide a deficit of 3,500 calories per week). To lose 2 pounds per week, a deficit of 1,000 calories per day is required. If this seems impossible, physical activity also contributes significantly to weight loss. The deficit of 500 to 1,000 calories can come from a combination of increased physical activity and reduced intake on a daily basis. Therefore, one does not need to experience significant food deprivation. The lowest intake per day recommended for females is 1,200 calories, unless they are in a medically-supervised, very low-calorie regimen which may have a daily level of 500 to 800 calories per day. The lowest level recommended for males is 1,500 calories per day. A very low-calorie diet can also be used by males if they are in a medically-supervised programme.<br>  <br>  Few tips to bring about weight loss as well as ensuring good health:<br>  <br>  <br>  Eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, and grain products like wheat. <br>  Increase the consumption of complex carbohydrates like whole wheat, millet (jowar) and barley (bajra)<br>  <br>  Restrict refined products such as flour (maida) and its products such as bread, noodles, macaronis and pastas in regular diet<br>  <br>  Restrict fat and cholesterol rich foods. Only non-vegetarian foods (like eggs and dairy products) are good sources of cholesterol, however saturated fatty acids present in butter, ghee, vanaspati and coconut get metabolised to cholesterol in our body<br>  <br>  Reduce the amount of sugars consumed<br>  <br>  Consume raw fruits and vegetables in form of salads and raitas in every meal. These provide adequate vitamins, minerals and fibre. Fibre is essential as it aids in digestion, has an effective role in managing obesity and cardiovascular problems<br>  <br>  Limit salt intake<br>  <br>  Have small portions of food at a time<br>  <br>  Do not skip meals<br>  <br>  Have regular meal timings<br>  <br>  Do not eat while cooking and watching television<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water (6-8 glasses) in a day<br>  <br>  Exercise regularly. Do brisk walking at least for 20-40 minutes in a day|`|eQWAVpDXaa	Actually.7 days is a short period of time if you want to lose your weight drastically....What you can do is,first find the calories of the food that you eat regularly and then eat less than 800kcal daily and go for a brief walk daily...But,make sure that you don't forget to take more vegetables & fruits to prevent constipation...Trust me...this method really works & don't starve because it's not a healthy diet...GOOD LUCK...!!|`|93CVX6Jwaa	its a thing called excercising|`|7g44U1xRaa	do excercising|`|2cEh1qYraa	Hi buddy losing weight is not difficult  consume less food and exercise more run in the morning and excersie with more weights and eat healthy food not junk foods u definately lose weight.....|`|H3DtFnXvaa	Loosing wt in such small period means there is no option for heavy workout and controlled diet|`|jw6Lpt37aa	in one week you can only lose 2 pound if you run for 30 minute daily and cut your intake of calories and eat more fibre food with less calories to make the difference and burn the reserve fat around your body fast best of luck and enjoy your life|`|F9Ll7oLJaa	do kapalbhati pranayam as suggetsed by baba Ramdev in Aastha channel

S5ZYHiFaaa	It is illegal in all provinces in canada. But there are a couple that are sympathetic towards marijuana use. British Columbia is one such province. Here, pot is still technically illegal, but for amounts smaller than half a pound, the law is rarely enforced.<br>  <br>  If you want to have a good time, smoking pot and enjoying the scenery, I would suggest that you go over to Vancouver in the summer time, get what bud you'll need, then take a ferry from Horseshoe Bay across to the sunshine coast. <br>  <br>  This is one of the most beautiful areas of British Columbia, you should take the money that you were going to take to Amsterdam and rent a cabin on Gambier Island. <br>  <br>  I guarentee that a week there with all the pot you can smoke would be one of the best weeks of your life.|`|W5AWUOm0aa	While it is illegal, not every amount is a felony. Unless they can prove it is intended for trafficking(packaged and priced) they will most likley charge you for possesion. Which if you actually knew anything about canada, is only classed as a misdemenour. There are a large amount of political groups up here lobbying to have it legalised. If you are caught with a half O or less 95% of the officers will only take it away and charge you with drug parinefilia.(sp). It is available on any street corner where ever you go. The best **** comes from the okanagen in BC. However Alberta bud has almost caught up. BC and Alberta bud is by far the best.|`|g6bBORHxaa	It is illegal in canada. Having any amount is a felony and requires going to court (unlike the U.S. where small amounts are a misdemeanor). However it is still pretty easy to get there. A little easier than here on the opposite side of the the Detroit River (I live in Detroit). I don't know how accessibility would compare to wherever you live though. I do know that weed is very easy to get in Northern California though :)|`|f8KtdtDuaa	I am pretty sure the entire country has legalized medical marijuana laws.

(Summary is misdemeanor, Indictable is felony.)<br>  <br>  First offence: 6 months imprisonment/$1000 fine<br>  Repeat offences: 1 year imprisonment/$2000 fine

I needed to lose about 20lbs which was mostly on my waist and hips. I think I had this pretty much all my life. Im 54 now so I was thnking I could be getting too old to lose the weight. If you going to try it get one of the sites giving a free offer. I used <a href="http://acaireview.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://acaireview.notlong.com</a> and I found it worked ok for me but there are lots out there. I managed to get rid of the 20lbs and I think I managed it quite quickly. Dont get fooled by some of the websites that say you can lose it without doing anything else. I found I still needed to do a little bit of exercise. I have started walking to the shops more often now and that has made me feel a lot less bloated inside.

When I was 11 and had the chicken pox, the scars keloided. Nothing seemed to get rid of them but luckily I received some cortisone injections several years later and it completely flatened them, you can't even see the scar at all. It's pretty much just your skin type if you are going to get them or not, but it was suggested to me to take Vitamin E & C. Keep the area out of the sun. If it's a pierced area, clean it with warm compresses of hot water & sea salt. I had pierced the cartilage all through my ears and it looked like a start of a keloid was beginning but the sea salt seemed to help it heal properly. Now I hardly ever keloid.

ifIRySXpaa	Hello =) Glad to hear you're active, that's half the battle. Since you're still in highschool and probably live at home with your family, it's important that you get your whole family involved in eating healthier. Then you won't have to be surrounded by unhealthy food all over the house and having to watch your family members eat junk food infront of you, which would make it harder. Do some research on healthy eating (and I don't mean low-fat foods because those are filled with sweeteners and chemicals instead!) and start talking to your family about making a diet change. It doesn't need to be a drastic sudden change. Follow them to the grocery store and help them pick out healthier choices. As a general rule of thumb, if you can't pronounce it, don't eat it, and the less ingredients a product has, the better. Avoid hydrogenated oils, sodas and doughnuts like the plague. Try to stay away from restaurants. You never know what they put in their food, and most of the time it's Crap to say the least. Instead, walk the outskirts of grocery stores (stay away from the aisles) and pick your favorite fruits. Eat them whole, chop em and throw them in plain yogurt with a bit of quick oats ontop...<br>  <br>  It's important to remember two things: 1) What might be a healthy food choice for one person might be a bad choice for another person because the food might be rejected by the body or be hardly digested etc... Everybody's body is made differently. So listen to your body before you listen to others. There are a lot of controversies over many food products about whether they are or aren't healthy for you, which makes it really hard to know what to do, but don't get discouraged! It gets easier. 2) Not eating enough can have the opposite effect you want. By starving oneself to try and lose weight, a person will have difficulty because their body will think that it's getting dangerously low amounts of food and will hoard whatever you eat.<br>  <br>  Make sure to eat breakfast (if you're an instant quaker oatmeal fan, learn to make your own, it's super easy, much better for you and delicious! you can mix up oat bran with quick/rolled oats, a pinch of salt, and chopped fruits, pour hot water and voila!). Don't drink a bunch while eating, it makes it hard to properly digest food, and this is very important. If you often start craving foods, try to keep your mind and body busy, drink lots of water, and go for the fibrous foods- foods with lots of fiber help make you feel fuller. Try to eat the least amount of sugar and salt as you can, with time you'll get used to it (trust me, I have! I used to be a sugar/chocolate junkie and now I barely crave it, instead I crave whole fruits). Vegetables are the best thing to go after, but if you're not a fan of veggies, prepare them differently because different cooking methods can make them taste super different! Steaming them and eating them with homemade dressing (extra virgin olive oil, apple cider vinegar and italian spice is a really simple delicious one), stir frying them with sesame seeds and a bit of soy sauce (careful to pick a good one) etc.<br>  <br>  For quick snacks, the first thing that comes to mind is nuts. Nuts are small, dry and easily portable, they're nutritious and have lots of protein (and don't be worried about the amount of calories and fats!). Just remember that you get lots from eating a little when it comes to nuts, so don't eat large amounts, don't eat more than 1/4 cup. Granola bars and energy bars are marketed as being healthy foods but most of them have lots of sugars/sweeteners and chemicals in them. The best thing would be to make your own granola bars (I have recipes for these on my website if you'd like), then they can really be healthy. Fruits are a great portable snack too!<br>  <br>  I've got lots of tips on how to eat healthier and make smart choices on my blog <a href="http://nocrapdiet.wordpress.com/," rel="nofollow">http://nocrapdiet.wordpress.com/,</a> I'm sure you can find some useful tips there! =) I've lost 15 lbs eating the way I do, have lost all my headaches and barely have any cravings anymore, it's wonderful!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, let me know if you have any questions =)<br>  <br>  P.S. Don't listen to Erik, (I'm not saying he specifically is but) a lot of people like that are not the real deal, they're salesmen trying to sell products that often don't work and hide the small print so you have to deal with financial problems. Eat Real Food. That's what's important =) You don't need vitamins and supplements and tummy gigglers if you eat a healthy diet full of real foods, in moderation, in season, and preferably, organic.|`|NjXgkn8Vaa	start eating healthy! eat organic and natural..no processed junk. <br>  <br>  watch The Doctors on fox..it will give you a little motivation =)|`|NkOGRA7laa	Hi There -<br>  <br>  There is a community for teens on a healthy lifestyle and it has many helpful tools on there such as calorie counters, teen groups to join.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	i. Eat more calories<br>  <br>  This involves some calculation. The approximate normal daily caloric requirement for an average male who performs light activity is 2,200; for a female, it is 1,900.You need to eat around 1,000 extra calories per day to gain less than half a kilo a week.<br>  <br>  Do the math. Eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day.<br>  <br>  Your actual caloric requirement can differ depending on your height, weight, activity level and your body's metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  ii. Make smart choices<br>  <br>  For example, choose dairy products, Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca.<br>  <br>  *<br>  One hour spinning = perfect body<br>  <br>  iii. Protein is important<br>  <br>  Increase your protein intake. Your body needs a lot of protein to build new muscle. But since most of the calories for weight gain comes from carbohydrates and fats, do not replace them with protein.<br>  <br>  iv. Snack a lot<br>  <br>  Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars.<br>  <br>  *<br>  healthy Ayurvedic mantras<br>  <br>  v. Fluids help too<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories; milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks are good examples.<br>  <br>  vi. Intensify workouts<br>  <br>  Aerobics are great, right? Not for weight gain!<br>  <br>  You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Is walking better than running?<br>  <br>  vii. Weights are the way to go<br>  <br>  Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbells, not fancy gym machines.<br>  <br>  Free weights put the most stress on muscles and stimulate the maximum number of muscle fibres.<br>  <br>  The best weight training exercises for building muscle mass are free weight exercises like squats, dead lifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips.<br>  <br>  These exercises are best done under supervision, but they don't need machinery.<br>  <br>  viii. Space out your workouts<br>  <br>  If you have a high basic metabolic rate -- which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest -- you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Are carbs bad for you?<br>  <br>  ix. Creatine?<br>  <br>  Creatine supplements can help some athletes gain weight. It is not known if it is because it gives them spurts of energy or because it adds water weight.<br>  <br>  More research is needed in this area before Creatine becomes that magic pill. Creatine supplements are available at all major health food stores, but do not take it without consulting your doctor.<br>  <br>  x. Be consistent<br>  <br>  It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results.<br>  <br>  Your body will only responds to a consistent schedule. No weight gain programme will work for you if you are not regular.<br>  <br>  Heredity does pay a major role in determining your weight. Effective weight training and a smart diet can help you exceed your genetically predetermined weight.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Google the Sumo wrestler diet. They eat high calorie foods to put on weight.|`|GfwjOVGdaa	Try changing up what you eat,  you don't want to go for just unhealthy fast food or stuff like that, but high calorie - low fat meals.  I have a few tips of what you can eat and do though.<br>  Eat Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches as a snack whenever you can (Try to put on a good amount of Peanut Butter),  chicken is also a very good thing to eat for mass gain, try to eat chicken for meals as much as you can.  Also, have a big, high calorie snack a few minutes before you go to bed as you wont burn those calories while you sleep and you will keep them in you.  But most of all, don't worry what other people say.  Stay determined and you will be able to gain some weight.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Fattening suppers might perhaps help as apparently more people are killed by suppers than the sword.
PGkR813Jaa	How old is your boy friend now?<br>  <br>  After a certain age, the medication no longer takes effect and the ADHD can disappear.<br>  <br>  The exact way the medication works is unknown. But it is a stimulant. In a 'normal' person it would make them hyper. Angry. Agitated etc. But in ADHD/ADD sufferers it slows them down.<br>  So it has the opposite effect.<br>  <br>  He may not be suffering ADHD enough anymore to take his medication, therefore the medication is acting as a stimulant. OR because of him taking his medication off and on, the days he doesn't take it shows his ADHD.<br>  Notice next time, count his meds if you have to, if it's the days he takes his meds that he's worse? Or the days he doesn't?<br>  <br>  ALSO Concerta takes a few weeks to build up in the system.<br>  So by him taking it only every now and again, he would not have a safe level in his body, sending him off the rails.<br>  <br>  He needs to see his prescribing Doctor.<br>  But knowing ADHD sufferers, that's easier said than done.|`|c0342d26192961a8e86c337c0610b25aaa	The medication helps him to Focus and to Slow Down so he can Concentrate.

Princess Diana used to be a bit this way, you know.<br>  <br>  I do not think you will find a mystery diet either but you could hopefully find a support group. I would be changing counsellors, if I was you. Telephone your nearest mental health clinic at hospital and ask your doctor for a referral. They will be happy to explain to you what services would be of best help. Don't put it off, dear. Do it now.<br>  <br>  I wish I could be of better service to you but I do not know much more to say than to give you encouragement to do the best by yourself. But I will say thank you for sharing with us all your tragic circumstance.<br>  <br>  The reason I want you to feel better is so as you can meet somebody and fall in love. You will walk on air, then.

If you are not taking any antidepressants right now, try Saint John's Wort. It's sold where vitamins are sold and it has no side effects. The American Psychiatric Association did a comparison study with Saint John's Wort and Prozac a few years back and the Saint John's Wort outperformed it hands down. The drug companies don't want to admit this because with the Wort, you can treat yourself for less than 25c a day. I take it and it really works. Don't mix the two, though. It works pretty much the same way, it boosts the serotonin and takes the same 7 days for the full effect.<br>  There are support groups out there for depressed people. There are always brighter days ahead. The more time you spend around people, the better. Also going out for walks boosts dopamine, making a person feel better. A vacation of some kind would help too.|`|f3ZKyuq0aa	you need to go shopping.<br>  <br>  you need to loosen up, and take your life not that seriously. <br>  <br>  SMILE!<br>  <br>  and no, youre not crazy.<br>  :D :D :D|`|a7f3d8bf66bfd9fc1daac1814d6e6577aa	Ami. <br>  i understand, i empathize, i feel the same for nearly 60 years<br>  it is just the way it  is.|`|95s0Dlg9aa	When you were in 3rd grade? I can't imagine that happening to a kid that young, seriously. You knew of death at 8 and wanted it? <br>  I don't think any sort of food can help you, but you should eat healthy nonetheless. Banana's and broccoli's good for the brain. Uhm, it sounds sad. I can't understand how someone would have those feeling's unless it's a direct cause and a psychiatrist can't work out those past problems to help you mentally. So you take medication? And go to a shrink? Well, your not alone. Look online of any support groups in your town. There should be some sort. You have to look at your life a different way, yes sometimes drugs don't work. But i'd read books and find out everything about depression. Take a day off work, do things you like, if you have friends, bud it up. I don't know what to say, I don't know what you can do to deal with it. But there are people that want to help, so stay positive and look up websites, info, and anything you can. There's no surefire cure, but humans naturally want to live so don't give up, think of your love ones, they'd be devastated if you were gone.. You don't hear voices or anything right?|`|zrFzbDHUaa	From the bottom of my heart,  I feel for you.  It must be awful to have spent all your life feeling this way.  Most would suggest the things you have already done or are doing.  So, if I may suggest, get involved in church.  You don't have to be religious. Believe me when I say this, your hope and answer for a brighter future, is to build a relationship with God.  It will turn your life around without the pills. Your life is worth it and you can change it and you can be happy. It is the answer. Best of luck to you, suicide is not the answer it is a cop out. Try God!!|`|zWPZ7IUyaa	you need to change your counselor, only speak with a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist, stay away from psycho analysts, life coaches and such none of them legally have to have any education. only the two i mentioned are qualified to help you.|`|46a14ceb5e21165137def6a6f8a9df2eaa	I also went through a period like this. Have you tried ECT?|`|KRLadp79aa	In a way I'd like to congratulate you in exceeding so far in life and coping with all these suicidal obstacles. You are not crazy or alone, I know plenty of people who are in the same situation as you. I'm not sure why you're having these thoughts as you haven't stated, but one of my friends have suicidal thoughts because their father walked out on him and his family when he was younger - and has been blaming himself since. There must be something you live for in life, those urges started when you were in 3rd grade, there must've been something that's kept you going on with life. Don't give up. I'd suggest to take up a few hobbies that will keep you busy, and keep your mind off it. Tell your counsellor that the pills aren't doing jack all, and if they insist the pills will help you, I think you should find a new counsellor - a psychologist even. Try and have someone that you are comfortable with to tell them the problems you are facing.<br>  <br>  An interesting my friend does is making a 'positive' journal, and in it he'll put quotes, photo's, and everything that makes him smile. In his daily journal, he'll write about his day. I think you'll benefit from keeping a journal. Good luck and Best Wishes!|`|xQOGce8Saa	Please. Even though you don't know me, please don't end your life. Because there is somebody in the world that loves you, and would be very sad if you ended your life.

Have a friend over every once in a while. Or make a blogging site or diary and write your feelings. Clear your mind of any stress. So please don't do it... hope I helped.

Many people have fears about particular things (like spiders even though most aren't that poisonous) but they don't allow the fear to rule their lives.  If the fear prevents you from doing something (like riding in an elevator) then it is a phobia.  There is a TV show on USA channel called "Monk" about a private eye who has both phobias, and obsessive-compulsive behavior.  The two conditions are often linked in that the patient must perform certain actions in order to avoid some possible danger, such as the need to avoid stepping a a crack in a sidewalk to avoid some unknown bad outcome.<br>  <br>  Some therapists use traditional reasoning, and calming in allaying phobias.  Others use virtual reality to desensitize the patient.  People with an extreme phobia experience unmitigated terror, and lose control of themselves when faced with the phobia.

Taller people tend to be much slimmer because their weight tends to stretch out much longer, whilist shorter people tend to carry it all in one spot. (But dont worry, taller people are often heavier because of their height, but it depends how much fatter they are)|`|OdXomS17aa	First of all, please ignore the ad post with the link to another website - it's just an advertisment taking advantage of you. <br>  <br>  Honey, you are absolutely at the weight you should be at considering your age and height. In fact, you are very near the LOWER limit of that weight range. You can use the BMI calculations ( <a href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/</a> ) to figure out where you are on the Body Mass Index, a sort of general rating of how thin/fat you are based on your age and weight. I typed in your numbers and came up with about 18. Numbers 18-25 are considered "normal" weight; 25 and up is considered overweight; and below 18 is considered underweight.<br>  <br>  All of this means you are slender and, if anything, you could use some extra pounds - but also bear in mind that you're 14, you're growing, so probably your weight and height will be changing a lot in the coming years. <br>  <br>  If anyone says you're a fattie, they must be saying it to hurt you, because you are NOT fat in ANY sense of the word.|`|Bt6WmLjGaa	You sound like you are very thin.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Select an appropriate sunscreen. <br>  Check your sunscreens SPF. The SPF, or "sun protection factor" number, contrary to popular belief, does not signify how strong the SPF is. It tells you how long it will keep you protected (theoretically). For example: it is in how many minutes you burn x the number that tells you how long it should last (even though you should reapply often, say every few hours, or more often if you burn easily). So if you burn in 10 minutes of sun exposure without any protection, SPF 30 will keep you protected for 300 minutes (in theory!). <br>  Keep in mind that SPF is not cumulative. Applying one SPF 15 sunscreen and another SPF 20 sunscreen may give you slightly better coverage, but it does not add up to SPF 35. <br>  Look for both UVA and UVB coverage. This means that the sunscreen will block both kinds of damaging ultraviolet light. <br>  Look for a PABA-free sunscreen. Para-aminobenzoic acid, or PABA, was used in sunscreens for a long time, but it can stain clothing and cause an allergic reaction in some people. <br>   <br>  Waterproof?Choose a water-resistant sunscreen, if you will be swimming or sweating. No sunscreen is truly waterproof, so you should reapply the sunscreen frequently, according to package instructions. <br>  Choose a sunscreen that suits you. Some daily sunscreens aren't as gooey or smelly as some of the heavy-duty outdoor sport formulations. Some sunscreens come in spray-on, roll-on, and stick formats. Some sunscreens come with built-in insect repellent. Some even temporarily turn your skin a different color! If you dislike wearing it so much that you don't, it will do you no good. Wearing sunscreen need not be unpleasant, so smell and try different sunscreen brands and styles to find the one(s) that are best suited for you. <br>  The word "sunblock" is a misnomer. Sunscreen slows the effects of the sun on skin by absorbing, reflecting, and scattering UV rays, but it doesn't stop them. <br>   <br>  Apply plenty of sunscreen.Apply the sunscreen generously. If you're using a cream, the amount of sunscreen you should use is about the size of a regular golf-ball, or 1 oz. <br>  Start ahead of time. Ideally, begin applying sunscreen at least a half hour before you go out. <br>  It takes approximately 20 minutes for sunscreen to become effective after it has been applied. <br>  Use more than you think you need. Most people do not use enough sunscreen, stopping at somewhere between one fourth and one half the quantity applied to test sunscreens. <br>  Don't just grease it on. Put a little on and rub it in. Then do it again and again, until you have a deep, penetrating layer of sunscreen. Do it right and you won't notice it at all and it will truly protect. <br>   <br>  Don't miss a spot!Be thorough. Put it on the most vulnerable areas: the entire face and forehead, especially the nose and tips of ears, back of the neck, backs of knees, and arms. Make sure to cover all skin that will be exposed. Don't forget the tops of feet, if you're wearing sandals - sunburned feet can be very sore! Have a friend help with hard-to-reach spots like backs and shoulders. <br>  Keep your sunscreen relatively fresh. Expired sunscreen may not be as effective as recently-purchased sunscreen, but in general, any sunscreen is better than no sunscreen. If there's no expiration date, try it and see if it still works, or replace anything older than about three years. <br>   <br>  A wide-brimmed hat.Cover up. Light layers of clothing work best, in light colors which reflect heat, rather than dark ones, which absorb it. Try a shell or tank top, and then wear a light camp shirt open over that. Natural fibers like cotton are coolest. <br>  Wear the right hat. Choose a hat with at least a 3-inch (8 cm) brim all around. A hat will also help to keep you cool. Baseball caps leave the ears and neck exposed, so they're not the best choice for sun protection. A hat will also help to protect your eyes from glare. <br>  Wear light-colored, loose fitting clothing. It will keep you cooler and help prevent sunburn by reflecting the sunlight. Be aware, though, that clothing may not block sunlight completely. In fact, an ordinary t-shirt may only be the equivalent of SPF 5. Look for clothing designed to block sun, even up to SPF 50, if you spend a lot of time outdoors. <br>   <br>  They do more than look cool.Wear sunglasses. Choose sunglasses that block UV light and wrap around to block light from the side, too. If you're not sure whether your old sunglasses adequately block UV, ask an optometrist to have them checked. Long term exposure to UV light can lead to cataracts. Wear sunglasses in conjunction with a hat.

I want with my mon to spirulina seminars and heard some stuff about arthritis and other stuff like that. I also buy the spirulina cereal and coffee. I know caffiene is not good for my age, but the spirulina in it helps me. I don't know where you live, so I don't know what type of spirulina you're talking about. Well, I live in Hong Kong and I'm a filipina, so there's a company of spirulina for filipinos and there are some seminars about it. The seminars I've been to were about spirulina memberships (i think,i'm not a good listener) and how spirulina helped the sick.

mn7Sql54aa	Sunscreen.  ;)  Or cover up with lightweight clothing.  (Darker colours protect better than light.)|`|n4ie8Hidaa	The skin is the frontier of our immune system, serving a wide variety of protective roles. It is therefore especially important to be kind to it. With this is mind, life extension scientists Durk Pearson & Sandy Shaw set out to develop a sunscreen that would not only protect our skin but also help reduce the aging effects of sunlight. <br>  <br>  LE: As the summer approaches and we spend more time outdoors, we're told to guard ourselves against excessive exposure to the sun. Isn't skin cancer directly related to sun exposure? <br>  <br>  DURK: Yes. The most common type of skin cancer it can cause is basal cell carcinoma. The two other types of skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and the deadly, pigmented malignant melanomas, are also related to solar ultraviolet radiation, but not as frequently. <br>  <br>  Of the different types of ultraviolet radiation (UV), there's UVB, which can help induce production of vitamin D but can also cause a lot of damage to your skin. Avoid UVB and take your vitamin D precursor in the form of a dietary supplement. <br>  <br>  The longer-wavelength (lower-energy) UVA radiation, however, is a mixed bag. The higher-energy end of its range can cause photoaging, which is similar to the damaging effects of smoking that result in wrinkles. Both smoking and UV induce enzymes that destroy the conective-tissue matrix. UVA also contributes to the destruction of elastin, a special type of connective tissue in your skin. Damaged elastin reduces elasticity, causing more wrinkles and saggier skin. <br>  <br>  However, UVA does some good too. Its lower-energy wavelengths can actually help repair a type of DNA defect known as DNA dimers, which cause genetic damage that can result in skin cancer.* Moderate amounts of UVA can induce the production of the dark pigment melanin, which protects your skin from further damage. And the tan it produces looks good. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  *Topically applied polyphenols, such as are found in macadamia nut oil, have been found to prevent the formation of thymine dimers. Katiyar SK, Perez A, Mukhtar H. Green tea polyphenol treatment to human skin prevents formation of ultraviolet light B-induced pyrimidine dimers in DNA. Clin Cancer Res 2000 Oct;6(10):3864-9. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  LE: Can a sunscreen reverse skin damage? <br>  <br>  DURK: Yes. People with sun-damaged skin will find that, by regularly blocking UVB with a good sunscreen, their skin will gradually improve in appearance. It will start looking younger, and scaly skin patches as well as unsightly blotches caused by overexposure will gradually fade away. Aging, to a considerable extent, is the accumulation of unrepaired or incorrectly repaired damage. You can slow down the rate of damage, or even slowly reverse some of it, by increasing your rate of repair. <br>  <br>  LE: How can your new sunscreen help do this? <br>  <br>  DURK: It is a formulation comprised principally of several carefully chosen sunscreen actives,** the potent antioxidant vitamins A, C, D, and E in topically available forms, and luxurious macadamia nut oil. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  **Octyl p-methoxycinnamate, titanium dioxide, octyl salicylate, and methyl anthranilate. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  The sunscreen actives were selected to allow some of the sun's beneficial rays to come through while blocking most of the damaging ones. The nutrients were added to help prevent abnormal cell growth and to nourish your skin. We use macadamia nut oil to prevent dehydration of the skin and for the superior antioxidant properties of the natural phenolic compounds it contains. All these ingredients are delivered to your skin by a technology that is unique for sunscreens, as far as we know. <br>  <br>  SANDY: Thus, our sunscreen shields you from the sun and enriches your skin, while offering dramatic waterproof benefits - all without that greasy, sticky feeling. <br>  <br>  DURK: The most fundamental difference in our sunscreen is that, unlike other waterproof sunscreens, it has no emulsifiers, and why it stays on until you do wash it off with soap. These compounds are like detergents, which make water and oil mix, thereby forming an emulsion that goes onto your skin easily, after which the water evaporates. But because the emulsifier is still there, when you go into the water, it's just like washing yourself off with soap, and off goes the sunscreen. That is why our sunscreen has no water and no emulsifiers, and why it stays on until you do wash it off with soap. <br>  <br>  We dissolve the fat-soluble ingredients in isopropyl alcohol (the main component of rubbing alcohol), which evaporates entirely in seconds, leaving nothing behind that will tend to remove the active ingredients absorbed into your skin.

a4eCHtANaa	I had a surgical abortion about five days ago and they gave me Ergonovine the day I left.  I took it three times a day for four days.  I had light cramps and no bleeding.  Supposedly it prevents bleeding by causing smooth muscle tissue in the blood vessel walls to narrow, thereby reducing blood flow (constricts blood vessels).  So the Ergonovine will stop bleeding, not make you bleed.<br>  <br>  Today, I finished the Ergonovine and now am starting to have cramps and bleeding. Im not sure if this is normal but I believe it might be due to not taking the Ergonovine.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

But now I'm continuing  to have the pain weeks after as well. So I made an appointment to be seen on Monday. I would advise you to do the same.

If you eat fish, it probably smelled fishy before you had sex.|`|eKDYbe9Laa	clean fisrt after doing sex|`|uPAl4Jb7aa	Hey listen, this is dangerous. This is a disease called "bacterial vaginitis", caused by a bacteria. It is well-known and a little expensive to treat, but you better get treated to avoid any future issues.<br>  <br>  My friend's wife had once used the following and had found it really good:<br>  <a href="http://rampurhaat.bvcures.hop.clickbank.net/" rel="nofollow">http://rampurhaat.bvcures.hop.clickbank....</a><br>  <br>  You might think of trying it out.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	It is actually normal, from your lubricant and his semen together, I love it, smell and taste. If you are concerned get a douche bag from a pharmacy and wash out your vagina after sex!|`|cxJSW5p4aa	umm no i dont think its normal. do you wash right after sex?  itsprobablyy the smell of your odors and his mixed up together <br>  <br>  <br>   i think you need to go to the gyno and see what could be wrong|`|VVizl51yaa	if he came in you, the semen mixes with your bodily fluids and makes a smell, if he didn't, then just wash up before and after.

One thing is for sure, if you keep yourself locked up at home all the time you'll most likely remain a virgin for quite some time.|`|H2IqzG12aa	College beckons, and with it freedom.  Being a virgin is no big deal, but not having any social experience can be a handicap.  Get involved in co-ed activities that interest you, like Young Republicans, e.g.. or the library's book club or a co-ed bowling league or invite a dozen acquaintances to join you at the movies.  Mingling in a non-dating environment is a good start, then let friendships and relationships evolve from there.|`|crw44vnRaa	I totally go for marriage first, you find the right person and then sex is wonderful because you love each other, there's no worrying about comparing each other to someone else or STD's or if a baby comes along it has both it's parents.

TBD6SPaTaa	Hey,rihannafan.  How's it goin'?  Well,You can start by taking a deep breath.  Calm down and try to relax.  Everything will get done,My dear.  You just need to stop and think.  Which part is giving you the most headache?  Next,Never feel like you can't ask for help.  Stop and see the teacher if you are having difficulty understanding the work at hand.  If there is something I could help you out with,You can always pick at my brain.  I'll do whatever I can to help you out.  And if I can't help,I will try to help find you someone who can.  I'm pretty good at Geometry if you'd want to ask me some questions.  Babe,Life's too short to stress yourself like this.  You need a break from your work.  After your break is done,Just try concentrating on getting the work done.  I know it may seem impossible,But you can do it.  And when all is said and done,You will feel kinda silly for worrying about this.  rihannafan,Just think of it this way.  This will help you become a better person.  Well,You will always get better.  Finishing school will show the world that you have brains to go with the looks.  If it helps,Visualize something possitive you want to do after you graduate.  Make that your goal to help you through High School.  You see your goal,You have it in your sights.  Now just concentrate on making this dream a reality.  I've gotta get going soon.  I hope this answer pleases you somewhat.  If not,I am so terribly sorry.  You have a good day today.  Take it easy and God bless.  Bye for now.|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	One thing at a time. Decide what is the #1 priority or which assignment is the most difficult and start with that.

Whatever works for you.<br>  <br>  Work on your homework in increments. After that, go do something fun for 15. Take a break. Eat a Kit-Kat Bar. Then go do some homework again. If you need help, ask friends online or post questions on yahoo answers that you really cant find an answer to.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it is alright to not finish homework. If it is really impossible to finish, you should definitely go talk to your teacher about it in order to learn what you've missed.|`|4rFCesSsaa	You need to create a schedule of when you are going to do your homework.

If you are happy the way you are, then don't even worry about it!  Tell your boyfriend that you don't really need that many friends.  Just be honest with him.  If he really likes you, he won't care. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to figure out whether you are asking this question because you truly care what people think, or if it's because you feel like you really do need more friends.  If you were happy, I don't think you would be asking this question.<br>  <br>  But, if you really are happy, then you need to let go of caring about what others think, because in the end, it won't matter!  How often do you sit around and think about other peoples lives and make judgements about them?  Probably not very often, and most normal people don't!  Just worry about making yourself happy.  Remember that everyone is different, and not everyone wants to have a "crew" or loads of friends.  Some people prefer to have small groups of really close friends, and maybe some people just prefer to be by themselves.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	I don't have friends and truthfully it doesn't matter what people think of me. I'm not trying to impress complete strangers. However no one ever told me what they thought about me because of this.

um14CipLaa	There are other birth control pills that you can take besides Yaz that have different hormone levels.  You shold tell your doctor about your mood swings and he/she should put you on a different one.  You should be careful about the "pull out" method until you are on the pill for the first month.  Congrats on the engagment! :)
KAwYumFfaa	Is your mother menopausal? Things like that is but normal. If not, then your mother might be having some high blood pressure due to increased cholesterol in the body. Is the pain she experienced concentrated on the nape area? If so, that really is a danger sign of hypertension. You should visit an MD for some have some blood works and prescription to lower the cholesterol.<br>  I would also suggest you buy some digital blood pressure apparatus. That would monitor your mom for spells of high BP. You can also have the aneroid bp app for accuracy but i would definitely advise you the digital one for the ease of use.
8ut1Hd0Maa	We all know the best way to lose weight is water, exercise and some supplements. Straving diets are just a fad and we all put the weight back on as our body craves the fats and sugars. If you need  boost try that acai berry that everyone raves about. It worked really well for me and the one from <a href="http://freeacai.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://freeacai.notlong.com</a> is the real stuff, not a fake.

Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  My friend tried hypnosis to lose weight.  Initially, her weight was 198lbs and she lost 18.3lbs within 3-weeks!  All by natural metabolism!  And she never even change her diet but ate as normal!<br>  <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!  You can just let your natural metabolism be high and Lose Fat Doing NOTHING effectively and immediately or be motivated to stop binge eating and exercise regularly without pain or laziness!<br>  <br>  Learn More:<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk</a>
2e41492627923affb8e7fc267ed04777aa	I think we're a little confused as to what you mean here.<br>  What exactly do you mean when you say "thoughts of sexual abuse"? Do you mean that you have memories of prior sexual abuse, or that you have an urge to abuse someone else?<br>  <br>  Actually, in either case, you really need to talk to a therapist, and SOON! And why this specific reference to "2 weeks"?<br>  <br>  This needs to be talked about, processed, and resolved.|`|51dff71b1a9e764ae4aa42218cfb19d3aa	Yes, yes and yes again!<br>  Get speaking to a professional about this|`|96zZlJVYaa	yes, that is the best solution to talk to someone about that you feel comfortable to talk too.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	Can you call the therapist?  I don't know if you were sexually abused or not because you didn't say, so I don't know if you are having these thoughts because it is something you are remembering from the past or if you are just having these thoughts constantly.  If you have never been sexually abused and you are having these thoughts that could be an obsession.  If you are having memories of a past event then you should discuss that with the therapist.|`|AA11573840	I would speak with someone. You could act on these thoughts and you or someone else could be hurt, killed,  put in jail, or both. Talking to someone might prevent you from acting on these impulses.|`|3a4o2e9Naa	yes but a family or friend can help too or make it easy er to talk about it to a counsel or any one online|`|nUD25qDbaa	You should talk to your counselor.  It doesn't matter who the person is, they need to pay the price.  You also need to clear your mind so you can enjoy life for a change. Things will get better.<br>  <br>  You do the crime and you do the time.|`|FKMKQbqPaa	i found talking about it was key for me to cope.  if you go to webmd there is a sexual abuse survivors discussion board.  the people there are great, and it helps talking with other survivors in my experience.
f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	Probiotics are great for balancing intestinal flora, helping break down lactose in cow's milk, and by balancing the intestine they keep your immune system optimal! I am currently using Solgar brand. Most probiotics tend to be the basic similarity. Differences are when they are based from dairy or soy, in capsules (gelatin or vegetarian), powder, or liquid, if they absolutely need to be refrigerated (best for any brand, but if not possible, okay for some to not have to be), and of course how many millions of microorganisms per capsule. The more per capsule, tends to be more expensive, but the less capsules you take daily. Some people say to take them first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, and wait at least 30 minutes to eat. I take them at night before going to bed, only because I won't forget at this time. I've been taking them for almost 20 years since my mom learned they help with lactose intolerance better than those lactaid pills. When I don't take them for a few weeks in a row, my body definitely feels it!!|`|maeGnrRjaa	I use jarrow brand it's in a yellow bottle. They're these white capsules. I like them I've taken them for 2 years and haven't gotten sick once.

kDxljPUnaa	Why would you be getting a hysterectomy?|`|xe3DPFbjaa	Yes you're right, There's a HUGE difference. I hope that you won't have a Hysterectomy. And make sure to tell your sister that, hysterectomy is more painful.|`|bF3DAb1faa	pain management after a hysterectomy is excellent these days , i think (for the members of my family that have had this) that the hormonal changes and psychological changes differ enormously from woman to woman.<br>  <br>  to compare a c section to a womb removal is like comparing a toothache to loosing all your teeth! imo
nA1g26y0aa	Don't listen to those who say it's weird, strange, wrong, or bad. You guys are brothers for pete sake! It's perfectly normal that you are comfortable being naked around each other. I don't have a brother, but my roommates and I have done the same things that you and you brother do. Now, we never jecked each other, but we slept together, sometimes in the same bed too, walked around naked, especially after showering or going to the shower. It's cool!|`|HNFGjUZOaa	WOW, i dont usually say this but dont listen to any girls on this question, or anyone who says that thats weird because its not at all, how the hell is that weird for two brothers to be naked infront of each other, like they are BROTHERS, like.... they came from the same vagina!  <br>  <br>  me and my cousins walk around naked and get changed when the other is in the room, who cares your family, and that just what guys do, we jerk off together all the time!|`|usRWhMGWaa	ok im a girl n i think being naked is totally fine<br>  im naked around my girlfrens all the time<br>  but whaking it together seems a little weird<br>  idk maybe its a girl thing but i would want to be in private when masterbating|`|YQhOFUB8aa	it is normal but the jacking off together thing its kinda weird letting them see you come and pulling it up and down that would be kinda embarrassing|`|sQta04wnaa	No that's weird.|`|yTCywpUyaa	i agree with everything except the jacking off together part thats kind of nasty to me|`|XgO9HUm9aa	It's normal.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	yes, its normal<br>  <br>  and a lot of guys masturbate together, it's part of growing up<br>  i dont have any bros but me and my cousin who are around the same age we are comfertable being naked around eachother...and we have jacked off together before<br>  <br>  my sis and i always walk around the house naked too, not in a creppy way but just like whatever, its just like we're comfertable around eachother<br>  <br>  dude, seriously, i wouldnt worry about it, its normal and fyi Y!A isnt the best place to get real advice from bc most people here will lie or give you a biased answer|`|g6cUQFuCaa	i used to take showers with my bro and my dad sometimes walks around the house naked<br>  but ive only jacked off with my neighbor not my bro<br>  as im getting older i like more privacy|`|Mt1b8dKsaa	Eh, it's probably normal, but I'm a girl with a five-year-old sister, so I wouldn't know for sure. It doesn't sound too weird though.... as long as you guys aren't like.... jacking off... WITH each other. Like, actually WITH one another. Just in the same room or whatever.|`|MDsufhrZaa	ew dude thats gross.<br>  what the hell is wrong with you?<br>  why would you jack off with another dude? let alone your brother.|`|dfJ8yM4Qaa	you just feel comfortable around your bro.but that's something you should not brag about.|`|1f5H6kfvaa	Ja, it's normal.
MycYut4oaa	Familial tremors, maybe?|`|RMgJwhcsaa	If it's not parkinsons (which it may very well be) then it is a disease that people get when they do/have done drugs.  But at his age I would guess parkinsons.
gDHsx5I3aa	Good for the most part. You need a better source of protein in your diet than just beans, if you are worried about the calories from meat then make it part of your breakfast meal because you will burn those calories off throughout the day (which is why they say breakfast should be your biggest meal).  You also need more fruits and veggies in your diet these are very important for your body.<br>  <br>  When you're counting calories take into account how vitamin rich the food is. If the food has more vitamins then it will not just be filling you up, it will be nourishing your body so you can afford those types of foods to have a little more calories.<br>  <br>  My nutrition professor once told me as a general rule that 1 out of 10 meals/snacks can be junk food.<br>  <br>  OH yea, and snacking is your friend! As long as it's healthy snacks! This is when you can get in your fruits and veggies.  It will tie you over till your next meal and you'll end up eating less at the meal when it comes.<br>  <br>  Find the food guide on the internet, try to follow that as best you can (but no ones perfect, you don't have to follow it exactly)|`|hyjtNXUvaa	The answer depends on your age and amount of activity.<br>  15-19 you are suppose to have about 1,00-2,000 calories a day.<br>  19-30 you are suppose to have 2,000 calories a day.<br>  so you've done pretty well.<br>  the tortilla and nacho chips you could have done without, and having low-fat cheese would help, but you've done generally well.<br>  Combine it with exercise and you can be very healthy.|`|l2XtZlPUaa	Bad<br>  <br>  You should have gone with the fish and chips or the grilled chicken with roasted butter potatoes.<br>  <br>  Perhaps fresh strawberries and cream on pancakes in the morning would be better too.<br>  <br>  Sure you might add on a few more calories, but you'll feel better at the end of it right?|`|AA10281378	Ahh...that sounds good but what is your BMI? weight? height? Provide some extra information. Avg 1200 calories daily can be fine within a certain weight range, others it's dangerous.

HxYutvwHaa	Braces will give u close to perfect teeth, but i dont think they can do before after pix...nd it is not painful at all ur mouth is just open for awhile so take sum chapstick it'll help.Oh what actually might hurt is after the braces are put on ur whole mouth feels sore so expect to just eat soft food for the first few days. Good Luck !|`|VYi5HqR7aa	I have many friend with the same problem their toeeth are growing out of their gums above their exsusting teeth. Four of them have gotten braces and it has corrected them so perfectly! They said that braces aren't that bad and getting them on is not painful at all so good luck and it's all up to you.|`|ZoCiZU0Faa	I had the same problem , except I had 2 teeth growing out of my gum . The dentist said that if they don't fall out within 6 weeks that he would pull them out , I certainly didn't want that , so I decided to take matters into my own hands . I put some tootsie rolls in the fridge & ate them after a day or 2 . My tooth came out ! So then he didn't have to pull them out . What a relief !<br>  <br>  Then , when I got my braces , at first they didn't hurt , then when my mom took me to get pan con bistec ( steak sandwich ) I REALLY felt the pain . I couldn't even bite into it without feeling the worst pain . Then on top of that , I had thought they had stuck the braces purposely to my gum . That really hurt like a b**ch ! But you see what had happened was that the wire had gotten stuck to my gum , which later caused holes in my mouth . <br>  <br>  So yehh braces hurt A LOT & anyone who tells you they don't is straight up lieing . <br>  <br>  & sorry if I'm freaking you out . <br>  <br>  & by the way , the pain goes away within 2 weeks or less , then you don't even feel them . <br>  <br>  & yes , they do make your teeth perfectly straight , if they didn't they wouldn't hurt so much . You just have to remember to wear your retainers after . <br>  So don't forget to brush & floss your teeth , byee .|`|ubukt8WWaa	I also find cleanings very painful.  Sometimes they hit just the right spot and I literally jump out of the chair.<br>  <br>  The tooth pulling won't be that bad.  They'll have you completely numb and it doesn't hurt very much the next day.<br>  <br>  Braces do hurt, but it's not horrible. It's not the same as when they are poking under your gums.  <br>  <br>  Getting braces is definitely something you'll want to do.  Trust me, you'll regret it the rest of your life if you don't get them fixed when you're young.  Oddly spaced teeth can affect your social life and even your career prospects.<br>  <br>  Hang in there.  Be brave.  You'll get through it.  Millions of kids have done it for generations.  They can't be that much braver than you, right?
WY6m0pRyaa	do squats,wall-sits,steps,RUN,super-biking,...|`|hE50eekRaa	Just make a routine and stick to it.<br>  <br>  If you are bone thin, run for a few weeks before starting a routine.

AA11286455	Honey, you need to get your butt to a doctor.  Now.  <br>  <br>  Anemia is a tired feeling.  Severe anemia is severe tiredness.  The most incredible tiredness you can possibly imagine and then 10x worse every single solitary moment, every single second of your day.  You're too tired to wash your hair.  You can't imagine getting in the shower, much less turning on it.  <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you've got a hypertension problem at least.  For orthostatic hypertension, they will test your BP sitting, standing, and laying down and it usually will change betw. each position.  In some positions, your BP may very well be worse than in others.  <br>  <br>  At worst, it's a neurologic problem.  <br>  <br>  So.  Go.  Now.|`|hdlzF6f2aa	Sounds like Anemia to me. I had the same problems. Just to make sure though, you should go get a blood test done.|`|FdrbuyaWaa	I have all d exact symptoms.. i once fainted..i was 13 at that time..i really thought i had anemia.. but when i went to check.It was Thalesemia (spell check) instead..im lucky as im just a carrier.. i suggest u go n see d doctor..many people do no know bout this inherited disease..|`|p0fqV7BDaa	Wow, I can't believe how much you sound like me! I've been anemic almost my entire life, but have never known an anemic who has had such similar symptoms. I would certainly say you are anemic, and you should see a doctor. I was put on vitamins and now very rarely have those dizzy spells in the shower, or while exercising. I haven't had to run to my bed in the middle of a shower ever since I started talking to my doctor, so I'd suggest you get to yours right away.
HtiVTA0jaa	I would say that she may have a larger disconnection with her extended family.  There may be some sense of inferiority, but if it is something that is just relted to extended family things, and she is getting proper attention with in her own home, this should help to ameliorate potential effects.<br>  <br>  I felt this way around my mom's family and now I can't stand my mom's family and get pretty bad social anxieety around them.  However, this doesn't really come up other than at family reunions or other situations involving her family.  I am fine with my family and in other situations.<br>  <br>  So I would pay attention to what is occuring.  I would make sure that it wasn't just me putting my own feelings onto her (ie ask her about what she thinks).

Hitting puberty is a drastic toll on your body's energy and many teenagers feel tired a lot... <br>  <br>  If you think you're feeling something unusual, though, definitely talk to your mom or dad or whoever you live with.  Especially if your period seems to be lasting longer than usual.  Excess blood loss can cause short-term anemia which would explain fatigue as well.<br>  <br>  Talk to your school nurse or counselor if you are more comfortable there.<br>  <br>  Good luck

But one thing about those protein bars is some brands can be really high in sugar and even cholesterol so watch out. The best food protein is probably from salmon, chunk white tuna, and chicken breast. You should also look for some tofu-based snacks b/c tofu is really high in protein and has no fat! But you sound like you got it down for the most part so go ahead and do the damn thing girl!|`|5e9eb94bcf83adabfe13bc0bfb55a9a3aa	congratulations good job|`|d99832e130a64a06093d4aaedf7fe11eaa	I think this is great of you sharing your success with us.|`|AA10092567	room freshener shower?<br>  <br>  Prostitute shower<br>  Can I give you the quarter bounce test

VQfDXVl5aa	First thing you want to do is get yourself measured to make sure you are sticking with the right bra size. This can reduce the amount of stress on your back because if you're wearing too big of a band all of the support would be working onto the straps which would cause it to dig into your shoulders. Second is to try going for a bra that has a uplift in it. Uplift would not only compliment the bust, but it would also get rid of some pressure from the band because of the support that you get from the extra padding in the bra. Third, make sure it's a full coverage bra because the extra width you get from the band and the straps can make it more comfortable. <br>  <br>  I would go look at Victoria's Secret Shaping Uplift or the new bra the "PERFECT ONE" bra. Perfect One does not have a lift but it does have foam in it and the straps is cushioned.|`|2eztcCO0aa	One that's made for smaller breasts.  I don't know how old you are or how big your breasts are, but a lot of women get a breast reduction just for this problem.<br>  <br>  Are you sure your bras are the right size?

NK9Qc46Paa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|E64juLwJaa	Never ever use diet pills:they are bad for your body.<br>  Better :eat less<br>  No fat<br>  No carbs<br>  No take out<br>  No junk food<br>  Eat small meals existing of healthy things.<br>  Planets.

CfiMFyGhaa	If you are not diagnosed as a diabetic, I suggest that you see your doctor. <br>  <br>  When diabetics have low bloodsugar they feel shaky, sometimes you feel as if you are drunk, you get slurred speech, you can't walk strait, you are easily confused etc....<br>  <br>  High bloodsugars make you feel like you have the flu.  You feel hot then cold, your stomach is cramped and you feel bloated.<br>  <br>  General signs of diabetes are having to urinate a lot and wanting to drink a lot.<br>  <br>  Problems with your period is very common in people with diabetes. Sometimes you don't get a period at all, you may get only one a year.<br>  <br>  I have had type 1 diabetes for twenty three years. I don't get periods but maybe once a year. When my bloodsugar is low, I feel drunk and act weird. When my bloodsugars are high I feel sick and tired, and always get hot. <br>  <br>  I hope this information helps you.

Some other symptoms are: itching all over your body, excessive sweating, and some other stuff.<br>  <br>   If you're high and eat something, it could cause your sugar to go even higher, and that could be very dangerous. <br>  <br>  In the main question it said something about periods. Are you on yours? If you are and you're diabetic, it could very well affect your blood sugar. My doctors said that right before or at the start of my period my blood sugar could be high, like maybe in the 200s, for a few days. That usually happens to me every time I start. But I've never heard of it going low because of that particular reason... maybe it can and I'm just not very informed lol. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

Most brands of birth control pills take one full week of use to be effective.  Don't stress about it, If you do it is more likely your period will be late due to stress instead wait and see, If your period does not come a few days into the inactive pills then I would go and get a test to be sure.

The poet Larkin was right, they mess you up your parents. In other words the sinns of the father are often visted upon the child (children) which is unfair YES!!.<br>  <br>  No.3 Sometimes the way our fathers behave is completely unconscous & so they don't fully realize the wounding they are causing in other words the wounding is often not done with awareness. It might not have been malicous or intentional but obviously I don't know your father.<br>  <br>  No.4 Depression is VERY very understandable under the circumstances you have talked about. Often depression is anger that has imploded in upon itself i.e. normally when people get angry they explode with anger and the feelings come outwards but if a person doesn't feel safe or feels disempowered the anger implodes & thus ends up in depression.<br>  <br>  No.5 YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH!!!! of this I am 100% certain.<br>  <br>  No.6 YOU ARE LOVABLE, YOU ARE ENOUGH being completely yourself.<br>  <br>  No.7 You have absorbed a negative self belief, this is a wounding from childhood and is a chronic pattern but it can be changed with effort over time if you are prepared to face these negative beliefs. You are still young enough to change this negtive pattern inside yourself. The negative beliefs are NOT who you really are inside, they are just a broken record of non sense, you have believed what others have told you but these negatives are NOT true. <br>  <br>  No.8 AS YOU BELIEVE SO IT SHALL BE!! if as a child you were told you were no good. A child doesn't know any better so it ends up believing its not good or rotten. This is no way to treat a child, the child inside us was 100% totally innocent, the inner child is innocent and therefore NOT Bad in anyway. Therefore I say YOU are not bad either. You were inncoent and did not deserve to be treated as you were. The pain & wouding are real though, as with any wounding you need to let out the feelings of anger & grief which you have tried to push away. The path to sorting this is out is through letting out the felings with someone who you feel very safe with, someone you can trust. Letting out the feelings will lead towards healing.<br>  <br>  **Remember you are a lovely person**<br>  <br>  Take good care Ivan|`|gCTbN4Jbaa	What my father did to me and my brothers could have caused me to be the way you are or to even go as far as commit suicide. But you need to ask yourself "how long is he going to rule my life?" "Will i stop living and dwell in self pity?" "Will i become my father?". Until you stop blaming your life on your parents, you will NEVER continue living. This is YOUR life, you choose how you want to come out of a situation. Rise above everything that happened to you, and know you made it through it. And past it amd keep going and don't look back. If i kept reliving everything in the past, i would still be there.

cAy1SI9vaa	There are three reasons why you may be suffering from premature ejaculation.<br>  One reason could be, that as an adolescent, the masturbation habits you developed may have led to this.  Typically adolescents masturbate with the intention of reaching orgasm quickly, thus premature ejaculation has been “grooved” into your system. <br>  <br>  Now for the second reason, let’s face it we’d all like to be able to make love for hours.  There’s one problem though.  The body sees sex as a means to reproduce.  That said your body is going to try and reproduce as fast and efficiently as possible. This is why premature ejaculation mostly affects men in their teens and 20’s.The catch is, now you have to learn how to control it.  <br>  <br>  3.The third cause of premature ejaculation is the inability to handle and control intense arousal and sexual stimulation.  Once arousal reaches a certain tipping point it becomes almost impossible to hold back ejaculation.  <br>  <br>  In your pelvic region, various muscles come into play during the ejaculation process.  If you can identify those particular muscles and if you can use exercises to develop control over them then you can attain total ejaculation control. For controlling premature ejaculation focus on various emotions, thoughts and perceptions that are proven to cause premature ejaculation.<br>  There are some techniques like heart rate technique, breathing technique, training of glans, masturbation and sex techniques. You may find the detail on following website|`|ANhYfjNQaa	Ejaculation is a process completely controlled by the mind.If he can control  his thoughts,he can stop this problem completely.<br>  <br>  Natural treatments are best to cure premature ejaculation<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.prejaculationcure.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.prejaculationcure.info</a>|`|yEDR0fnOaa	You're not having sex often enough, and he can't hold his stored up load very long after he enters you.|`|IY9JolQ4aa	Yea, not enough sex.

KgSE9QfPaa	as a medical professional, I will tell you that adrenaline (aka epinephrine) is usually seen as a good thing for most people.  It's a natural hormone that everyone has.  Adrenaline "rushes" occur when the body secretes epinephrine at an unusually high rate in response to the brain sensing a threat or emergency type situation.  Like when you get scared.  Or even when you're not mentally freaked out but your body is doing things like running for excercise (because if you need to run away from something like a bear or a murderer it'd be almost the same inner physiological response).  In fact, adrenaline is prescribed to people who have certain medical issues because of it's effects on the body.<br>  <br>  Major effects of adrenaline / epinephrine:<br>  -speeds up heart rate<br>  -opens up bronchioles for better air flow<br>  -opens up blood vessels in skeletal muscle, brain and heart<br>  -but constricts blood vessels in all other non-emergency organs<br>  -increases blood pressure<br>  -reduces swelling<br>  <br>  So you see, all these reactions would benefit someone running from a pack of wolves, for example, or fighting in a boxing match.  Also, doctors prescribe epinephrine (usually in an EpiPen) for people with allergic reactions because it will reduce the swelling in the throat and also open up the airway and also keep blood pressure from dipping too low, and pretty much reverses the reaction to an allergen.  So adrenaline is actually very good, even critical, for people when they need it.  And then it'll go away on it's own (heart rate and breathing return to normal, etc.)<br>  <br>  As far as the stomach cramps and pain, yes some people will experience that as well as nausea or vomiting (but not usually) - this is because the body sends more blood into the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, and there's not as much blood left for the other abdominal organs, especially to move food through the digestive system.  So, some people's bodies might say "hey, I want to run from this guy with the axe" instead of "hey, I want to digest that bacon cheeseburger and fries I just ate" so they feel nauseas or have abdominal pain because the abdominal organs now have less blood and nutrients than the rest of the body and everything is essentially slowed down in there while the rest of the body is sped up.  But most people usually react just fine to adrenaline/epinephrine and it's mostly a good thing and will go back to normal on its own.

Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress. <br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes. <br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system. <br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body. <br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends. <br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position. <br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Enhancer Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|HMzsm50vaa	I totally agree with NY.

It's a myth that you cannot get pregnant by the pulling out method.  To me, pulling out only makes sense if the woman doesn't want to wait for the ejaculate to seep out of her. But pulling out will leave it on you in some way anyway. :)  So don't bother.  Might as well enjoy it but use a condom.  That's the only way to avoid infections and disease let alone get pregnant.|`|AA11481603	Most importantly, the pull out method DOES NOT work, as pre-ejaculate DOES contain sperm. So, take the pregnancy test to get that out of the way. If not that, then likely just PMS. It isn't always going to be exactly the same every month.|`|tPDkIJlZaa	You need to see a doc
xqQO81Omaa	This is more of an approximate:<br>  <br>  13 year old female: 19%-27%<br>  30 year old female: 21%-29%<br>  60 year old female: 23%-31%<br>  <br>  The reason you can have a higher percentage of body fat as you get older is because this takes into account people invevitably lose muscle and bone mass as they age, which in turn increases the overall percentage of body fat.
mOayTJDmaa	Your bum looks fine to me.|`|6I5b76GLaa	The obvious way to burn fat is to eat less and workout more often, the problems arise when we actually try to put that into operation! There are lots of stumbling blocks out there aren't there?! The sole method that definitely showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it was reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I worked off twenty pounds, it definitely does produce results!

8rfodw6Qaa	i think you are just scared of what you can't see. <br>  i did the same thing w/ running out of the bathroom or up the stairs b/c i didn't know if someone could of been behind me.<br>  close your closet at night. get a nightlight and you can see everything in your room. <br>  i'm almost 20 and i'm still doing this. i don't know if it eventually goes away or what. i have an over active imagination and stuff i saw on tv i thought could happen to me.<br>  if you can, see if you can get a pet. my cats sleep with me at night and it feels so much better to know that something else is there w/ me.|`|lb8FBhWnaa	You should speak to a doctor about this.|`|TphsSOz6aa	Sounds like simple hormonal crazies of being a teenager.  Get good locks, close your blinds when you're home alone. Get some self defense training so you can get some confidence, like take judo or tai kwan do.  Be sure you're eating well, and taking multimineral and trace mineral suppliments to be sure your thyroid is working well, and you stay chemically balanced.  <br>  <br>  If you feel like you're getting out of control... talk to a councelor.
GfG6wupTaa	do you shower after gym?|`|764Hudunaa	change deoderants some dont last|`|hwDtWCAjaa	get a better deodorant|`|unLtd3jYaa	Try changing deodorant, and buy a body spray and spray it all over your body because it's not only the armpits that throw off body odor.  Also try showering in the morning instead of just rinsing.  And keep the body spray in your book bag just in case.|`|OqQPzYfHaa	Bathe daily. I'm mexican and i used to have that problem but then my boss, earl told me to start showering and i no longer smell like taco-bell|`|uajH0boKaa	use axe my boyfriend uses it and he stays smellin good all day.|`|Jk4OxMGbaa	Here's a fun fact: If you ignore your underarm shaving duties in the shower, you'll tend to sweat more. So, the bottom line is daily hair removal not only makes you more attractive, it also allows your deodorant to do its job. Win, win.<br>  <br>  Even though you're charmed by those deodorant sticks that squish out those sharply-scented worms, I find they don't actually "work." My rule of thumb is to stay away from clear stuff if you want true, lasting power.<br>  <br>  The best, goes-on-sheer, no-rub-off deodorant is scented Mitchum cream. Yes, cream. You smear on with your fingers. Sure it's weird that you have to touch your deodorant, but you'll smell like a fresh daisy even into the next day.<br>  <br>  Considering the topic I'm writing about, I'm now going to write a word which will gross you out:<br>  Monistat.<br>  But, it's not what you think, y'all!<br>  For all of us who have to deal with the heinous heat of summer, Monistat makes something called "Soothing Care." Rub this silicone-based barrier behind your knees, on your inner thighs, under your breasts--anywhere your sweat. Not only will you not reek, you'll barely sweat. This is especially lovely when wearing your gauzy sundress in 100 degree weather--it will automatically ix-nay the afe-chay!|`|4LLGenzBaa	wear axe all over body because some times is more than just the armpit|`|4WVC7g7zaa	your sister is making fun of you.

Just love yourself for who you are.<br>  Better get used to it anyway, you since youll be stuck with it unless you get a boob job.<br>  <br>  <br>  I wish my boobs were smaller...
AA10281378	Oh wow. Well, just to answer your question, you can flat line yourself. I'm not going to be the devil's advocate here so I won't criticize you lol. Be safe.|`|eIq2S8rtaa	wow, umm don't wnat to answer this. All I know is you don't want to.
cbaed0814556c039d6513bbe51d35768aa	If you combine what whatelks and uniaue 74 told you, I think the first two answers you recieved, then you basically have your answer.  Sometimes dust or lint in the nostrils will make a baby sneeze but as you say, she -or he has been exposed to your cold.  His/Her immunities may be high enough to fight it off but they also may not be and if your child is sleeping or even laying alot then your baby is a prime target for pneumonia from a cold and it needs to be charted.  Children go downhill faster than adults when they get ill.  They can be fine one minute and critical or even dead the next.  That is what CIDS is all about and it primarily hits children who are under one year of age.  Children dehydrate fast, their temps peak fast, keep your precious charge hydrated by all means, make certain there is no soft or runny stool with a possible cold or you could find baby in dire straits.  Practice the utmost cleanliness but also get her or him to the doctor and be sure.  It is always better to be safe than to be sorry.|`|1837e035f6b3b00c236efca8a1f3d303aa	There is nothing you can do to prevent your sweet baby from getting sick....its going to happen no matter what.  Watch for a high fever or a fever lasting longer than 3 days....if she gets either one of those take her to the doctor or the emergency room. Get some liquid tylenol or advil and follow the directions, it will make her more comfortable and reduce any fever.   Also, if she is having trouble sleeping or you notice her rubbing or pulling at one of her ears....colds in little ones can turn to ear infections pretty easily, because their tubes aren't developed all the way.  Also, watch her mucous, if its clear to yellow she is fine, if it starts turning green she has an infection.  Give her plenty of bottles of water and/or diluted juice.  To much juice will give her diarreha.  The virus should pass, just like it does with us.  Hope this helps and good luck...love her up.|`|238065357031373f9968884e2bf0e5aaaa	There is nothing you can give her to prevent a cold. Just make sure you are practicing good handwashing and keep her well hydrated.|`|AA11253145	seems as if preventing her from catching your cold is long past.  now you are in the mode of preventing it from getting worse.  if she is only 8 months old you need to get her to the doctor, they need to know about this.  one they may need to give her medicine, they may need to move she vacination schedule, they need to have this in her charts.  better safe then sorry, call your doctor.
65lTdKNgaa	na thats dangerous.. u can get them cut out <br>  or try this freeze stuff.. u put it up to the mole/wart and eventually it fall off!|`|uf9pZFlzaa	No...moles go away on their own. You can't burn one off.
fZqvuKHuaa	It sounds like a cold sore. The best thing to do would be to change your lip balm, then if you're going to apply it, miss the bit where the cold sore is so you don't get the virus into the balm and reinfect yourself.<br>  <br>  You could just wait for it to heal or pop to the doctors for cream.<br>  <br>  Cold sores are a strain of the herpes virus though so don't kiss any beautiful people until its fully healed. Try to keep your hands clean too so you don't spread it.<br>  <br>  Once you've caught a cold sore once you'll get them again and again at random points in your life. You just can't get away from those darn things, I'm plagued too!|`|e6zQVWKnaa	First stop using lip balm and go to your doctor if the continues or gets worse.|`|00f9873d58a871ae31ecf33313f803caaa	It sounds like a crack in the corner of your mouth.  This is probably from the cold weather and you having chapped lips.  You'd know if it was a cold sore.  Those start with tingling that's almost like itching and then break out in little water filled blisters. The blisters break and then scab over.<br>  Put on some really heavy duty greasy stuff like vaseline instead of just lip balm and it should heal within a couple of days.

UwNKFSBeaa	Yes, you should finish the pack, but if you are having severe side effects, ditch the pills.  Warning tho, it will throw off your cycle.|`|13ca5bfa28957cf9a08b2131fa62965faa	Yes you would.  It would be best to finish the pack.
crw44vnRaa	You want an actual answer? It doesn't have anything to do with the need to urinate or a naughty dream. For some unknown reason guys get a sudden rush of testosterone in the early morning hours, that's what triggers an erection. It's nothing more than hormone levels increasing. It's still up to you guys if you want to use mother natures "wake up call".|`|irIk1saFaa	This happens to me too.  Maybe I am having horny dreams and don't remember them. I don't know.  But it's really big sometimes.|`|7F0zA7ARaa	idk my husband is the same way.|`|R0iHHPqEaa	cuse we're horny|`|QRCQJF6Faa	Lots of funny answers, that is for sure! <br>  <br>  Here is the real answer!<br>  <br>  Nitric oxide!<br>  <br>  In the morning, to wake the body up it sends Nitric oxide throughout the body, this increases the blood flow and this blood flow is what gives guys an erection, morning noon or night. <br>  <br>  Thats it, simple and easy.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  Adam-O|`|Jwk7Ib2vaa	With 8 answers, I figured someone would have given you something to go on, but I guess not so I'll give it a shot.<br>  Morning wood happens when a man comes out of his 4th tier of sleep and is entering consciousness. The shock of waking up and stretching, as most men do, causes blood to rush all over the body. His toes will curl up and his pecker will rise to attention.<br>  There's nothing wrong and it may have nothing to do with being aroused, although the majority of men are generally "rearing and willing" to go in morn, not all are. As was stated, most men have to urinate as soon as they get up, and that will trump anything else, trust me.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|OqQPzYfHaa	It seems hemroids related, you should see a doctor.|`|fnk27F8xaa	You should give him help. Thats a good girlfriend! haha.<br>  its natural...blood circulating while he sleeps.

Some way or how that urge stimulates us in our sleep...But it's a pain to pee it when it's ten-hut.|`|yDp80Fcfaa	I don't know why, but its been happening to me as long as I remember.  The only problem is, when a person wakes up they usually have to pee, and peeing with an erection is difficult (unless you're outside and can just let the pee shoot high in the air).  I wish I was so lucky to have a girlfriend in bed with me, and who was willing to "help"! I'm sure he'd love the hand... just let him pee first.|`|F7olx89Paa	When I was with one partner, because she criticized performance, I eventually never got an erection in the morning, with my latest partner i had no such problem and she was very expressive about her affections and enjoyment of that.|`|ta1d1wjEaa	it usally mean we had a good sleep and might be horny|`|FEViNlQMaa	Probably he's controlling he's pee and wants more sleep|`|E64juLwJaa	A guys testosterone level is very high in the morning:hence the word :morning wood.<br>  Nothing to do with a full bladder at all.Or being horny.<br>  Planets<br>  Biology degree

wwRbkCMraa	supplements will help give you an edge.  don't worry about whey protein... It's in everything from pop tarts to milk and cheese.  Start reading food labels and you will see it's an ingredient in several types of foods.  This means you could take it and be natural.<br>  <br>  Make sure you use a pure whey protein with No artificial Sweeteners, No artificial Flavors, No artificial Fillers etc.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buybulkwhey.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buybulkwhey.com/</a><br>  <br>  These guys sell the highest quality and best priced pure whey protein.|`|E64juLwJaa	That depends on your muscles:whether they will grow bigger when you exercise this much:maybe you need to do more,<br>  Then in six month's you should be able yo reach your goal.<br>  Planets.|`|aDCDwyieaa	I hope you don't mean 6 hours a day.  That would result in overtraining and will actually decrease the size of your muscle.<br>  <br>  But it is possible, but it'll be hard.  You'll have to eat a LOT of protein.  Like as much as you would consume with whey protein.<br>  <br>  And it depends on your arm size now and your age.  But to get around 20" arms, it could take 5-10 years.  I'm basing this on my brother.  He works out every day for like an hour and a half and he has 18" arms and he's been working out for 5 years (he's 19 now)  But he uses supplements and proteins.<br>  <br>  Like I said, you can reach it but you'll have to work really hard for it and eat a lot.  It's not easy without at least whey proteins.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Like Jcamp113 above me said, it does depend a lot on your genes.|`|zJS94XkIaa	It will be very hard if You can do it, 20" arms is pretty big with no supplements.  Genes will also play a big part in how big you will get without supplements.  But good luck! and don't stop lifting!!
fyUa0l1uaa	Warm milk and some white noise.|`|dd83ec34a7001b938f4187223bc6e654aa	First of all don't take anything else and don't listen about the drinking beer. Don't mix pills with alcohol, duh! Get comfy in bed and try reading a book. Try not to watch TV, too stimulating and the flickering will keep you from getting a good sleep when you do fall asleep. Or you could try just laying in the dark and daydreaming.|`|tKTE2xxpaa	drink beer|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Lay down, and starting from your toes, begin to relax every part of your body. When I was having growing pains as a kid my mom would lay me down in bed and talk me through this process of relaxing things one at a time, and then she'd say to clear my head, and I'd pass out. Even with those terrible stretching pains... sorta like restless leg syndrome.<br>  Anyways, try it, I still use the technique now. <br>  Also, if you have lots of things going on right now in your life/head, wirte them down in a journal before you turn out the lights and after writing everything down, you hopefully won't have the thoughts floating through your head.<br>  Good luck! I always have found Tylenol PM work well.|`|qWPLDgPiaa	you could try listening to music in bed, or <br>  just go to bed, and close your eyes, think of a dream you'd like for to come true. you will instantly fall asleep. <br>  hope this helps! :)|`|AA11606079	smoke some purple=)
UUtTDAJraa	Well it's normal to not have a sex drive while pregnant. It really is different with everyone. Who knows if after you will regain it back. It could be months, even years. I was in your situation with a no sex drive and it's not pleasant. I tried dieting and exercising but it didn't do anything. Until I tried this natural herbal enhancer which is meant to increase the sex drive along with other things I've noticed. It's a topical oil called Hersolution Gel which is like an instant libido boost. Along with that my sensations are just blasting and my orgasms are then best. Read up about it at herenhancement.com where I saved on it at the time. It got better with every application. I was skeptical at first but the companies return policy made me commit. From what I remember you have to try out for a couple months but then after that you can return it if it doesn't work. It would work great for your situation considering your pregnant and theres no need to swallow anything. Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|EgoT5xkkaa	That is normal.|`|S5dtWq8jaa	Maybe having a little date with your husband?  Dress up and look pretty, go out to eat at a nice restaurant, get a massage if you can (not sure what they do differently for pregnant women) or go to a movie and when you come home, have some essential oil diffuser going to create a romantic atmosphere.  See how that goes.  If you still don't want get intimate, at least you still have a very nice evening together with your husband.|`|sS0uDgz0aa	well i don't know how far along you are but i am 6.5 mo pregnant and i know at first i was the same way of course i would still have sex but it not like i was just dying for it, but now that's all i want!!!! it normal
arsAqGf7aa	No.|`|FReGm4i7aa	Lol, no. Not at all. First of all, when you orgasm you shouldn't have blood coming out-that's a problem if it is. Second, the blood tension that occurs when you have an orgasm does not come from your ovaries-which is where your menstrual cycle blood comes from.|`|dd83ec34a7001b938f4187223bc6e654aa	I can see where you would think that but it does not make your period go faster. It brings the blood to the surface (so to speak) quicker but it does not make you bleed faster if that makes sense.

8IyZphFVaa	well if you know you get depressed there are a lot of things you can do to help the situation. i'm not saying it'll go away forever but the first thing that might help is for you to understand it. read about it. if you are clinically depressed you go through episodes so you aren't depressed all the time. it lasts a certain amount of time and then one day you're better. and there are things you can do, like taking st john's wort, or going to counseling, or keeping a journal so you can have an idea of what sparks your episodes, exercising. some ppl get triggered by certain things they eat (or don't eat) or because they don't know how to handle certain situations in a healthy way. ease yourself off the drugs slowly. take less and less and while you are doing that start being proactive. don't allow yourself to be dependent on drugs anymore. and if you do feel depressed, don't fight it. try to reach out to family. and you should also talk to your partner about him watching the babies a little more while you go to work or whatever you have to do to feel better. you don't have to go to rehab but if you see that your children are triggers, you should try to cut back on how much time you spend with them until you can learn how to deal with them in a way that doesn't lead to you being depressed. a lot of things have to do with you controlling the way you think and listening to your body. you should be able to feel an episode coming on and identify what might be causing it, and then stop it from coming on.|`|nTXGaBvLaa	You probably haven't found the RIGHT anti-depressant.  I know how you feel though, about taking pills and how they give you more energy and make you feel happier.  I am on Norco for chronic pain, and I am suffering with depression right now because of it.  I do not however abuse them though.  I am actually more irritable than depressed.  I also have extremely bad anxiety.  I would suggest going to see a phsychiatrist.  Antidepressants and pills are their specialty, not your MD.  Trust me, please go see a phsychiatrist...they can help you find the right medicine, as well as talk to you and help with therapy.  If this doesn't help, I hope someone else can write to you and help you!  Good luck!!!<br>  <br>  P.S.  It will take time to find the right anti-depressant, as well as the right dose...I am still trying to find mine.  I am on Cymbalta which has greatly helped my pain which it is supposed to do, but hasnt helped my depression...so I got to go back and see what I can do next.  Have you already seen a phsychiatrist?|`|Jjywhwcwaa	I know just how you feel. The pain killers really do make you feel better and productive.  You are much like me, so I can tell you, and you probably know this already, there is always an end to the supply and the tolerance and side effects are not worth it.  Rehab really turned me off and I'm in school so I can't pay nor do I have the time anyway.  It's a really hard road for us. We are folks who are prone to sadness so the opiate high is like a dream come true.  <br>  Keep this in mind, opiates are downers. They may give us such a lovely high, but by their nature depress our systems therefore pushing us further down the hole of depression.  <br>  I've been struggling with this for years. Before, therapy and family pulled me through, then I fell off the wagon.  This most recent time (ending in January) I found a psychiatrist who works with clients on a sliding scale, he upped my antidepressant and I take them faithfully.<br>  But past experience has shown me that is not enough. Then I found my new drug of choice - exercise - seriously.  It not only gets you temporarily high, but boosts and regulates the seratonin in your brain. So it aids the antidepressant and replaces the desire for pills. <br>  I know I'm obsessed with it. I've been working out for only 3 weeks and do it almost daily.  I have found that I am an extremist. I always seem to have something I'm obsessing over. Heartbreak of failure that I cannot shake sends me on a search for pills.  But now I can feel my addictive behavior in my need to exercise.  <br>  So for this phase of my break up with the pills, I'm gonna rebound to the gym.  We've gotta choose our own battles. I'd rather battle with an obsession over being exercise obsessed rather than how to get more pills.  Give my self time to stay off them (40 days to make or break a habit) and if my exercise obsession gets out of hand, I'll work with a psychologist on finding balance.<br>  <br>  then all the things you are getting out of the lortab, more energy, positive mood, I'm guessing you need some good sleep too, you will find in excercise. Go to a gym. Hire a trainer. I don't have much money, but I knew this was life or death to me. I got a personal trainer at Ballys and am now committed to trianing sessions. so I have every reason to go. It's an investment and i want to make it work. after the first week, I look forward to going. and the sense of accomplishment feels fabulous. My blues are lifting and if I am down. I know there is something I can do about it. Work it out! <br>  Also at bigger gyms you can find trainers who work with your injuries. I was on pain pills for a bad back and knee. We are doing strengthening exercises that focus on areas I need to be strong to lessen the pain.  These people are experts on the body.<br>  get better and try this out. It's worth a try, right? We don't deserve to be so sad and tired.<br>  <br>  So give it a try and if you're not ready to stop the pills yet, do NOT stop the antidepressants.<br>  <br>  You have a difficult struggle and you are not alone. <br>  You can find peace, believe in it.

Infatti sono rappresentati nell’arte e nei manufatti dell’antico Egitto, dell’Assiria, della Grecia e della Cina. Questi antichi ombrelli o parasole, furono destinati come prima cosa a difendersi dal sole. I primi ad impermeabilizzare i loro ombrelli per proteggersi dalla pioggia furono i cinesi. Essi incerarono e smaltarono i loro parasole di carta in modo da poterli usare per la pioggia.<br>  Il termine “ombrello” deriva dalla parola latina “umbra”, che significa spettro o ombra. A partire dal sedicesimo secolo l’ombrello divenne popolare in occidente, specialmente nel piovoso clima del nord Europa. Dapprima fu considerato un accessorio per donne. In seguito il viaggiatore e scrittore persiano James Hanway (1712 – 1786), inizio a portare con con sé e ad usare un ombrello in pubblico in Inghilterra rendendolo popolare anche fra gli uomini. I gentlemen inglesi, infatti, spesso si riferivano al loro ombrello chiamandolo “Hanway”.<br>  Il primo negozio di ombrelli - inaugurato nel 1830 -  fu quello di James Smith e figli, e si trova ancora al n. 53 della New Oxford St. di Londra, Inghilterra.<br>  I primi ombrelli europei erano fatti di legno o fanoni e ricoperti di alpaca o tela oleata. Gli artigiani fabbricavono i manici ricurvi per gli ombrelli con legni duri come l’ebano, e furono ben ripagati dei loro sforzi.<br>  In 1852, Samuel Fox invented the steel ribbed umbrella design. Fox also founded the "English Steels Company", and claimed to have invented the steel ribbed umbrella as a way of using up stocks of farthingale stays, steel stays used in women's corsets. L’8 agosto del 1885, l'inventore afro–americano, William C. Carter brevettò un portaombrelli (v. figura 1).<br>  Bisognava attendere oltre un secolo per la successiva evoluzione tecnica nella costruzione dell’ombrello: l'avvento dellobrello pieghevole. Nel 1852, Samuel Fox rivendicò l'invenzione dell'ombrello rinforzato con nervature d’acciaio, fondando anche “La compagni inglese dell’acciaio”.|`|iGv7Yb7laa	mio nonno|`|lqee00DMaa	Gli ombrelli de "Il Marchesato" nascono dall'accurata ricerca delle materie prime e dalle mani sapienti di abili artigiani che trasformano tessuti ed accessori, in piccoli autentici capolavori.<br>  <br>  <br>  Le ragioni principali di tale apprezzamento dei prodotti potrebbero essere tante ma ci piace sottolineare le seguenti: Costante ricerca di stile, buoni materiali e forte volontà di produrre sempre con ottimi standard di qualità mantenendo alta la tradizione del Made in Italy<br>  <br>  "Il Marchesato" garantisce che il materiale usato nelle proprie lavorazioni proviene da accreditati fornitori Italiani e tutte le fasi di produzione sono realizzate nel proprio laboratorio artigianale.<br>  <br>  <br>  Origini dell'ombrello<br>  <br>  Il primo ombrello fu inventato oltre 4500 anni fa, se ne ha prova nell'arte e nei manufatti dell'Egitto, Assiria, Grecia e Cina.<br>  All'inizio gli ombrelli antichi erano concepiti per proteggersi dai raggi del sole.

I have 30g of bran flakes for breakfast and weigh them but its about two handfuls.|`|gDHsx5I3aa	Yes a tea cup would be one serving size for anything that fits into a cup<br>  <br>  For meat, the size of a deck of cards is about one serving size.<br>  Round fruits it's about the size of an average fist<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)<br>  <br>  Check out the food guide on the internet (just google it) it will tell you about serving sizes|`|f7oLrkKnaa	A serving size is supposed to be the close to the size of your fist, give or take. For most liquids a serving size is 8 oz,  and for food they say a light bulb, a deck of cards is about right. For cheerios, if you are looking to manage portions, invest in some smallish bowls, that's what I have use, in order to keep the urge to fill the bowl from taking over. Good luck!|`|mjy4oRvDaa	The only way to be sure is to get a scale from Office Depot or something and measure 30g worth of cheerios.
eNMRIKL6aa	At that age it depends on how far along you are in your growth. That sounds about average for a girl, a little small for a guy, but that doesn't mean you won't be a lot bigger in 2 or 3 years.|`|XLnboFslaa	It depends, are you a boy or girl?|`|Fllrx2Xsaa	I am a 5'4 girl and the healthy range weight for me is at least 115. visit your school nurse and talk to her about your weight. she can take into account your body type and so forth. But on paper, you do sound underweight.
YH1UX8UDaa	I used to ask this question when I was about 14-15, skinny, but flat chested, no matter how much i tried to put weight on.<br>  But after getting my boyfriend you realize that everyone is different in preference, and love you for you. <br>  Also you're all in proportion too! if you were chubby and flat you'd be a lot worse off. I'm also sure you have other great features? slender legs or flat stomach. go flaunt it!<br>  xx|`|uJKTR4d2aa	You cant really change the size of your boobs unless you lose weight making them smaller. Be happy with the way you look. Im a guy and i dont care about how big the girls boobs are or their but.|`|aNlT1NRqaa	If you work out your chest muscles (push ups, bench press, etc.) you can build the muscles under your breasts and make them look a little bigger. It won't do much, since women don't bulk up like men. Otherwise, surgery is the only other option.<br>  <br>  Take it from a guy; most men don't care if you have big or small boobs (only the superficial ones care). I think big boobs on a skinny girl look strange, and small boobs can be very sexy. Think of it this way, you can look good without having to wear an uncomfortable bra and you won't have a sag problem as you get older.<br>  <br>  The butt is another one of those things that come with genes and fat. You can improve it with exercise (cycling does wonders). Toned is always hot, big or small.|`|nEgI4u4faa	I am the same way! i wish i knew how to, but i don't. The only thing i know is to get implants!  But i really don't want to do that. What i have been trying is to work out a lot. I have been workout my legs and butt and i have def. seen results in my back side! The chest part i have been doing chest press and anything else that i could think of but haven't seen any results in my chest.which is really disappointing. Good luck with it tho :)|`|N956bVxhaa	I'm with Gabe on this one...without surgery there's no way to make your boobs or butt bigger.  Just enjoy your small boobs and butt - I'm sure they look pretty good!!|`|w2n4V9ZMaa	work your chest and glute muscles. that will help a little bit. :)|`|QevBVANtaa	only way to get that is to gain weight...

AA11839888	okay if you go to a dermatoligist, he will rub it with alcohol, inject a numbing solution and that a scaple and cut it off, sending to be biopsied to make sure its not cancerous, a bandaid and it will heal up in a few weeks, if its deep , he will cauterize(burn it) with electricty.<br>  ive had nine removed that way, the shot was the worst part, i hate needles. i had two cauterized, the smeel was bad there.<br>  ive had 6 lazered off, the lazer hurts like a hot needle but the mole swells, blisters, scabsand peels off, several times but it does not have consistant results, some are gone, no scar, some are lighter and , but still show and one is still peeling off months later,|`|bQgOppFsaa	<a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/mole_removal/article_em.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/mole_remo...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.osuedc.org/plastic_surgery/mole_removal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.osuedc.org/plastic_surgery/mo...</a>|`|9h9k81RDaa	i got mine removed a couple weeks ago.<br>  <br>  <br>  its just a pinch feeling, nothing to cry about.<br>  um they usually prepare you but washing that area and putting black ointment to reduce the pain :]

My wife is taking iron supplements and she started "tasting" like you describe after she began the regimen.|`|pRanGHC2aa	yea eat fruits & veggies. maybe it was around ur period cuz blood taste slightly metalic lol i know thats pretty sick but... hope that helped.|`|GWyKZ3aiaa	Gross, talk to your doctor about this. Yuck|`|764Hudunaa	everyone tastes different, its the way you are. yes foods have an effect on it generally sweet fruits help, pineapple is best. stay away from greasy foods and especially asparagas its known to give the worst flavor and odor|`|Kiq9LSmtaa	Pineapple juice ;-))|`|tPDkIJlZaa	Yeah i heard eathing sweet can help that. Someone told me to eat alot of straberries  YEap.|`|f0rYYrPhaa	well, it's never going to taste good, the vagina isn't supposed to taste good. but if you have thick milky white or yellowish discharge(which will leave a stain on your underwear) then you should get a screening especially if it has an odor. it can be a viral or bacterial infection, like gonorrhea or something else. I would definatly go to a local hospital or clinic to get a screening.oh and remember Absolutely DO NOT put fruits or any sugar down there, sugar is VERY bad, you'll get a urinary track infection and yeast infection which hurts
ZRG7wEf9aa	The best low cost remedy you can find is raw pineapple.  Eat a spear three times a day.  It contains something which reduces inflammation in your body.|`|m0b0EGXoaa	Try hydrotherapy.|`|e527f9beebd88f45ab26ebb967c2ddf3aa	Stick with the ice.  The tendons of your muscles are inflamed and anything that warms the area will just make it worse.<br>  <br>  What is causing the inflammation?  Is it your job, or a new activity?  If you can find whatever repetitive motion is causing the pain in your elbows & knees, that would help greatly to reducing your symptoms.<br>  <br>  It would help to know more about your history, perhaps you can find a clinic or medical school (chiropractic ones are great) that would offer you discounted service...<br>  <br>  As far as "herbs" the best thing you can do for your body to heal is rest, ice, and make sure you're taking a good multivitamin!<br>  <br>  Hang in there...
bFfWFsFWaa	I did a project on this in government<br>  <br>  1) Smoking is NOT a right. <br>  <br>  2) Putting a ban in public places does NOT stop people from smoking. They could take care of that at home.<br>  <br>  3) It's silly that people defend the rights of smokers, rather then defend the rights of people's health.<br>  <br>  4) Smoking is NOT a right...................................... it is, please, someone point out where it says so. No websites, no arguments about how it should be a right. <br>    If you believe someone has the right to smoke...point it out in the constitution.<br>  <br>  <br>  *edit*<br>     I would like to reply to Mr.Fantastic. First of all, you have brought up by far the best argument I have heard about this. However. You mentioned that banning public smoking is taking away from property rights? No it is not. They could do that within their own home. Nothing is stopping them from staying in doors. They made the risky decision to smoke, they should be the ones to have to stay indoors to feed that habit, rather then having people avoid restruants and public because of the better decision. Also, it's interesting what people have taken to mean property rights these days. We cling to it as if...ya know...that was still the deciding factor of whether or not we had a right to vote.<br>         Anyways, yes smokers pay that little extra tax. But should a 5 month pregnant lady have to sit in Denny's and breath that crap? Absolutely not. The tax is no excuse. They made the decision to buy the cigarettes, they choose to pay the tax. With or without cigarettes, they still use the public...so it's not like the tax money they choose to pay doesn't go to things they don't use.  Just because they make a stupid, expensive decision does not mean others should suffer.<br>          You also speak about free will. Free will is one thing..but the problem with this is...this choice of smoking effects other people around you.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	Sure they are the minority push em to the curb|`|KHC2oE8iaa	YES!!! it has been concluded that smoking is the 2nd hand smoking is responsible for taking the lives of thousands of americans. the entire tobacco organization needs be put in a box. but then that would put possibly millions of people out of work. on the brighter side it would save the lives of tens and hundreds of millions of people. it has to stop. people are getting sick off if this stuff. and for those who wish to quit find themselves unable to since the addiction is so powerful that once they actually do stop smoking they body starts to break down. its just sad how companies such as kool, marlboro, capri, and others like them are in the business of killing their loyal customers. but hey that's big business for you.|`|kDxljPUnaa	These are public places are they not? And since these are public places you have to expect the public to bring with them their habits as well. Smokers pay an extra tax for their habit and that tax is used by the public. If the public does not want this tax, then ban the activity. But they do want the money don't they? A completely voluntary tax. However smoking bans go against property rights.  If the owner of a place that is open to the public does not wish to allow smoking, then that owner should place a sign that says NO SMOKING in a place that can be seen by all. Or at least make it understood that certain activities are not allowed on his property. The owner of the property has a right to condone or condemn any activity he wants.  <br>  If someone who does not want to be around smokers, they should say so themselves. Simply ask. That's how things used to be. But now, people try to get the government to do things for them. If a courtesy of asking that a smoker please not to smoke around you cannot be extended, then certainly the force of law can be. Smoking may not be a right but it is free will. And if we are going to control free will, then we should ban people who are not married from having sex.  <br>  Normally a smoker who becomes ill due to their habit does not live very long. Whereas a teenage mother who gives birth to a premature baby, will more than likely rely on public assistance for decades. She, nor the childs' father will not be asked to pay any tax to offset the cost of medical care that she or the child will require. <br>  This is not only an issue about smoking or public safety. This is an issue about control. It is a slippery slope, What will be next?|`|DtGFWUP5aa	Pro ban: Second hand smoke has been shown to adversely affect the health of those subjected to it.<br>  <br>  Anti ban: People should be free to make their own choices, and smoking is the choice of the individual.
AA10281378	To answer your question honestly, no. You don't need to be worried. If you're that self-conscious, then go exercise. Throw some cardio and weight lift if you wish. Just remember it doesn't take a few days to see some progress. Stick with it and you will be happy very soon. Good luck.|`|3cNYeVLJaa	That is just a little over.I am 5'4" and about the same. I need to lose. Do you feel good or do you want to feel better? I want to feel better. Have a goal, stick to it. I like it best when I have 5lbs. to play with.(up or down) Good luck|`|7swefA6Paa	yes you are borderline overweight.  for teens, our weight range (im 5'5" too) is 103-150lbs.  im 104lbs.
e527f9beebd88f45ab26ebb967c2ddf3aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Fact of life - as we age, sudden strenuous prolonged activity (from a pick-up football game, or even sex) can take a larger toll on the body than in the past.  Especially if it's not a common occurrence.<br>  <br>  Think of any athlete and the training seasons they have.<br>  <br>  If it helps, the "weekend warrior" is the most common injury we see at our chiropractic clinic.  An inactive week (or weeks) with a major physical weekend leads to many sprains and strains.<br>  <br>  For future reference...warm-up first with a slow jog and STRETCH AFTER!  Also, icing those spots after is great, do it right now.<br>  <br>  Heat will feel good at first, and then make the area feel much worse b/c you rush blood into an already swollen area.  So stick with ice!|`|a5MzSF5qaa	It's normal. It's a combination of muscle fatigue, muscle recovery and acid build up that's causing the pain. It'll go away in 24-48 hrs. As you play more and more your body gets over it faster.|`|yiux97Wbaa	Its possible that you over did it, like many of us, if you don't normally do a certain type of activity on a regular basis, we tend to feel the strain.  Take some nice hot baths or hop in the hot tub if you have one and that will help a great deal.  It should go away in a few days so long as you don't continue to overdo the exercise.
AA10281378	Um....actually I think you will. Over use of a stool softener would probably (someone correct me) give you loose runny stools, and all those stools exiting your body will result in a loss of weight...but at the same time that's not even healthy for you so I wouldn't go that route. Do something else that will be healthy for you, like...for example do what most everyone who wants to lose weight does...drink 2 cups of green or black tea every morning.|`|1F19qjrZaa	yes you can but that is bulimic.
764Hudunaa	DENNYS|`|il7bLkSIaa	it depends if your drunk or not!! haha either way I would say Dennys!!|`|xItxOqE4aa	Here the truth, You can eat anything you want anytime anywhere you wont gain weight unless you consume too much food and did not exercise...so if you eat under 1200 calories in the morning then after 12 you can eat more.|`|iTq7HWfdaa	Are you trying to watch...if your trying to watch your intake eat something under 300 calories and you'll be fine. :-) otherwise, go to eat-n-park! they got new midnight specials haha.|`|VzBAzdfwaa	go to ihop and eat unlimited pancakes|`|4wQffufZaa	CHOCOLATE!|`|XfMehRqAaa	nachos!
b4s0iroSaa	thats common in kids<br>  as a matter of fact i am 12 too and sacred of dark<br>  well its just because our imagination is too wild<br>  for example if we are walking through the TV room<br>  and we are scared that a monster will just come breaking out of the TV screen.|`|2eztcCO0aa	It happens to all of us.  It happens to me every once in a while and I'm an adult.<br>  <br>  Darkness scares us because of two things:  It may be concealing something dangerous, and it makes us feel as if we're closed in.<br>  <br>  You could go behind your parents and turn the lights back on, but why don't you try getting used to being in the dark?  Just tell yourself that there's nothing in the dark that isn't there when the lights are on and force yourself to walk calmly through the dark rooms.<br>  <br>  It would help if you didn't watch scary movies at night.  I had to give up trying to watch them at night and now only watch them during the day.|`|0aaa10bf1334628de7df8d1527e7a5a7aa	Julian, the dark in the hallway is the same as the dark in your room. Walking around when you can't see and might be injured (even superficially) could be increasing your anxiety, so turn on a light. Also ask yourself what, specifically, you are afraid of. Then think hard about the answer. Those two steps, although they sound simplistic, are a great launching pad for dealing with any fears at any stage of life!|`|1F19qjrZaa	ok so im 12 also and that happens to me alot so if u find out cld u tell me thnx baybeeeeeeeeeeeeeee|`|TgOCIVFqaa	That's very common for your age, especially after you've watched a bunch of scary movies. What you can do is everytime you're walking in the dark think of something nice then open your eyes and picture that nice thing around you. Hopefully you will adapt to nicer things in the dark instead of SCARY stuff :S. But don't worry if that doesnt work you'll grow out of it.<br>  Good luck :)|`|coPtU10Laa	My dad told me there was nothing there in the dark that wasn't there in the light. when i saw something scary i watched it as I turned on the light after a few times finding out things that looked scary in the dark were really boring everyday objects I quit being scared now I enjoy trying to walk around in the dark.|`|WeybsS8Baa	hah<br>  I do the same thing, but i'm older.<br>  :O<br>  ahha well umm just run, run that's what I do.<br>  If not dont think about it.<br>  See no evil, hear no evil and dont fear it, it'll come and get you,<br>  XD|`|ParFJxnSaa	Never run in the dark! Put a blindfold on, and walk around (carefully) in the daytime, so you can remove it, if you really must, but try to get used to moving around without seeing. Then you can do the same thing at night. Or get a cheap flashlight. <br>  <br>  If you are one of the 40% of people who are fairly suggestible, you may wish to consider professional hypnotherapy, or: Fear of the Dark<br>  <a href="http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/</a>|`|DNouvr9maa	have a flashlight on your lightstand to use or wALK AROUND THE DARK TO GET USE TO WHERE every thing is

8OOPH9niaa	I dont think you were, you just were a deep thinker, and as a Kid you had fantasies which may have seemed odd.  I can relate to you, even though it seems weird, I had fantasies like that.  Although I'd hate it if it was real.  I think it is all partly due to the sexual and emotional changes you go through when you grow up.  There is nothing wrong with you lol.  I can confidently say I felt all those same things, even stranger things.  But I'm a perfectly healthy adult now (20 years old) who has a beautiful girlfriend that I love very much.|`|nfQhsRvfaa	I was the EXACT SAME when I was younger. Because you're so lonely and your life is so boring you imagine ways to make it exciting.

Sad I know.lol It's totally normal though. It's only because you were lonely.
7xq7hUB7aa	Im not a health expert or anything, but i think the best thing for you to do is incorporate strength training, instead of only doing cardio. like, use weights, this will help your belly fat turn into muscle.

You need to really go for a long time.<br>  2. The incline is always better, but it makes it a lot harder, which will negatively impact how long you can exercise, and also will get your mood down.  I'd level it out and jog/run/walk longer.<br>  3.  Most important:  You must eat less calories.  That will make all the difference.  I'd say that weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|OflbswHKaa	excersize is one part of the equation. Diet is the other. If your getting on the treadmill and then eating 3 big macs, then of course your not going to lose any weight. Take diet into account.<br>  <br>  Also another thing I just recently heard. Try running on the treadmill and doing excersizes in the morning on an empty stomach. This will burn already existing fat, instead of working off the calories you ate that day, because you didn't eat anything.|`|1Qz0cZ2Waa	Just remember you have to burn more calories than you eat. If you are really enthusiastic about it, do a little more exercise. Go to a gym & try many different machines. 20 minutes on a treadmill really isn't going to give you any results. It will decrease your heart attack risk though.
V9NGGPP5aa	Get up and walk around your office or home: This should happen at least every two hours for 5 minutes. This brisk five-minute walk every two hours will give you an extra 20-minute walk by the end of the day without making any special efforts. <br>  <br>  2. Wash something thoroughly once a week: Be it the floor, a couple of windows, the shower stall, bathroom tiles or your car...anything that makes you don your cleaning gloves and exert some pressure on your hands and elbows burns nearly four calories for every minute spent on cleaning. A washing session of 30 minutes and you've worked off nearly 120 calories. <br>  <br>  3. Drop a movie for an active date: Yes, it's a weekend and you're planning to spend time with your love. Why not head to the local park rather than sit idle in a movie hall? This will not only give you a chance of walking hand in hand, but will also avoid the calories that a large bucket of butter popcorns holds in. What's more? Explore other active dating ideas like cycling together; enjoying a tennis match or a swimming championship...even losing to your love will be fun here! <br>  4. Kiss your partner passionately: Lock your lips in passion at least 10 times a day. Not only it will keep your love life buzzing, but every minute spent kissing will burn 6.4 calories. Ten minutes a day of kissing can burn approximately 23,000 calories in a year...that's the power of love!<br>  Such there are several tips|`|F9Ll7oLJaa	learn to do pranayam kapalbhati pranayam is good for reducing weight|`|X9QOHRLFaa	Sadly my friend the only way to loose weight successfully and permanently is to workout and eat healthy. well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

QIc5VVmTaa	Nope... just sleep with them on. I've forgotten my solution before and I just sleep with them on. Seeing as you're so apprehensive about wearing them overnight, I'm guessing that you've never done it before- once won't hurt you. <br>  I wouldn't risk my contacts swimming in some old solution for any period of time.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	You may get an infection... that's why there is an expiration date stamped on it.|`|71U41QLAaa	it wont clean it very well<br>  it's probably best not to<br>  x

So it may not be that big of a deal.  <br>  <br>  Are you othervise healthy?  Do you feel good generally, I mean, are you normally happy?  Or are you noticing that you are sad more often?  If you are normally happy, and you seem to have a good appetite, and you are not losing weight, but slowly gaining, I mean over months, it could be just fine.    <br>  <br>  If you are worried, I would suggest you ask your parents to set up an appointment for you with a nutritionist.  OK?  They can go through some options for you as far as your question is concerned.|`|TvYa0rmbaa	yeah you are.

UWdauoN3aa	I am a chemo nurse. This is how chemo works. It attacks every fast growing cell in the body such as hair cells which is why your hair falls out. The cells that line your GI tract which causes the nausea and diarrhea. And also attacks the bone barrow which produces your red and white blood cells so your mom after her chemo treatments might become prone to being sick bc her bone marrow can't make any white cells and she might also be anemic and might need blood transfusions. But they also have shots they can give her to boost her red and white cell counts if she would rather do that instead of transfusions. Radiation can be harmful bc it does most commonly burn people. But it usually takes a couple of treatments before it burns you. Hopefully she'll be fine. I'll keep her in my prayers. Hope I was helpful.|`|tEqcmCv3aa	Hi there! I know what you are going through. Last August my Mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. She just finished her chemo, and had surgery to remove the remnants of the lump. She will now under go radiation treatments to make sure they got all of the cancer from her system. The chemo is rough. She'll most likely be nauseous, and weak. She will also lose her hair. But, fear not, because as the chemo works, the side effects will lessen. Mom is actually starting to get her hair and her strength back. Good luck to you, and I'll remember you in my prayers!|`|cJRFbZUaaa	If you're old enough and your Mom is OK with it, you can attend her meetings with the doctors and nurses with her.  They will answer your questions and concerns.  Yes, it will be tough to see her suffer.  The nurses can give you tips on how to help your Mom and what to expect at home.  She will still feel sick on the treatments, but there are ways to make it more tolerable, and you can still do some things together in between treatments.|`|QwuYRrMCaa	Well i am not a doctor but it is administered in a controlled manner,and its needed to destroy the cancer cells...In the process it might even deplete some of your red blood cells which can leave you tired.But with GOD by your side,a good nutritionist,and a well trained doctor and ALL should be well.<br>  <br>   Don't worry,trust in GOD and have a blessed 2009.|`|htD82ij1aa	look at it this way, any negative affects of the treatment will be minute when compared to the cancer.  as far as I know the treatment hasn't killed people it's the cancer that kills if treatment fails.  I wish you're family well.|`|jXp6BhpCaa	My Mom had the same thing and went through radiation and chemo they killed the cancer but she also lost muscle and cannot eat through her mouth and has to eat via a feeding tube.<br>  God Bless You|`|AnHQbZQAaa	the big drawback is nausea, weakness and hair loss.

sQu3LLqtaa	Trans fats are hydrogenated unsaturated fats that are often added to processed foods such as cakes, cookies and biscuits to extend their shelf life.  These preservatives are usually identified by numerals so you don't really know what those numerals are concealing.  Trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats.<br>  <br>  Trans fats can clog up your arteries and that can cause heart attacks and strokes.  They are supposed to be the worst fats there are. <br>  <br>  You can find further information in a web search for "trans fats" + "health hazards".|`|TKAd63UCaa	yeah,its true...its oil/grease that stays in your body forever unless you get it surgically removed........but most people wont ever really need it;unless theres hella of it in your body.....i suggest you dont eat it

QmDqNiqPaa	Spacers are usually just little plastic binders inbetween you mollers to space them out for the metal brackets...they dont hurt and they just put some pressure on your teeth...it literally took like 2-4 minutes...braces actually took me like 2 HOURS!!! it sucked and i had such a bad headache from sitting back and them yanking on my teeth...so i advise to take some motrin or advil before! but i got them off a year ago and i dont think they are a thing to stress about...at first they seem really weird but u get used to them fast and after a few months or earlier u dont even notice them...it sucks when u get stuff stuck, like bread or apples or carmel are the worst! not gum so much like everyone thinks...i had them for about 2 years and it went by so fast and it is really worth it in the end! but i cant tell people enough times how important it is to wear your retainers no joke because me teeth are slowly going back to the old way then i will need the braces agian! HOPE IT HELPED|`|Yfgf47lBaa	Hi,<br>  it doesn't take that Long to put braces on.<br>  the spacers feel like pressure in your mouth, and when you bite down they will be kinda squishy.<br>  don't eat anything too hard to start with, they will need to be replaced as they will break. also avoid soft drinks while having spacers in. its just too much hassles to replace the spacers all the time.<br>  take a few panadol, you will be fine, it will just be a bit tight for a few days and can hurt when eating hard foods.<br>  <br>  when putting on the braces, it doesn't usually take longer than an hr... i recommend using the wax they supply.<br>  also baking paper folded really small can be placed at the back between your teeth and cheeks, this will stop the rubbing when sleeping and can be worn in public and not seen.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|UWdauoN3aa	I'm 27 so it's been since I was 15 when i had braces put on but the spacers didn't take long to put in. Just feels weird like trying to squeeze something that doesn't fit in a tight space. The next day your mouth will be really sore. I can't remember how long I had to wear the, but when they put the braces on it took them about an hour or 2 and it didn't hurt until the next day and my mouth hurt for like 4-5 days. And I had to go back every 6 weeks to have a new wire put on top and bottom and every time they do that your mouth is sore all over again. It sux but it's so worth it. :) Hang in there.  And by the way.....Eat your favorite meal before you go have your braces put on bc you'll be living on soft stuff like jello, soup, and mashed potatos. And do this also every 6 weeks before they change your wires out bc you'll be sore all over again. Hang in there|`|5d4bdcf7fb843f77c58e6eae3f91dcd7aa	im not sure on the spacers but it only took my orthodontist about 10 minutes to put on each set of braces...you get used to them fairly quickly...the first 3 days suck though with all the soft foods|`|9SIApfUxaa	well it might take a month or so braces feel tight spacers feel weird but u get used to them

9WM2DHlNaa	what you are getting are technically called white outs. they are like black outs except you are semi aware of what is going on. many times, symtoms such as this can be related to a lack of iron and potassium in the diet. all of your symptoms are neural, or have to do with the brain (loss of hearing, loss of muscle control, and vision) the sleep paralysis may be another symptom of this as well. iron and potassium help with blood circulation. if the brain isn't getting enough blood, and it has been going on for several years, then it might be cutting off circulation to a certain parts of the brain at random points causing the white outs. it could also be from small anurisms in the brain which aren't very critical, and so small that they do not need treatment. if there is any history of strokes or anurisms in your family, then go seek medical advise. otherwise, try eating more iron and potassium. if they get worse then go see a doctor.|`|fkgYL6TSaa	Please seek medical help .. it sounds serious.|`|HPO87jGiaa	I would say you're suffering from a chronic case of vertigo.  It's fairly common, it's usually a dysfunction in your brain.  Most people get over it and I'm not sure if it's treatable, but I'm very sure there are certain measure that you can take to lessen these experiences.  Perhaps train yourself to become more focused on one thing rather than trying to pay attention to everything.|`|dnMXvVM3aa	The above answer is correct but be aware that you can cause problems with your heart if you take too much potassium.  A doctor is your best bet.|`|lSGhyEneaa	You might be anemic or dehydrated... I would check in with a doctor.

Nih5aED0aa	well the "white stuff" can just be vaginal secretion which is normal and well, if you itch it alot, that might be why it is red and swollen. Also, it might not be a yeast infection causing it to itch but who knows.<br>  <br>  there are creams and wipes (i believe) that help with yeast infection. Just go to your local pharmacy or and grocery store and ask them where it is located, or if you are too shy, then look around yourself and you should find what you are looking for.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the... err... problem. ^^.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	yes it's a yeast infection.<br>  go to the pharmacist, and get a vagisil or monostat kit and follow the directions. you'll be fine without the doctor.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	It sounds like a yeast infection. You should just go to your doctor to confirm what it is though. You can get cremes and tablets over the counter aswell.
HtiVTA0jaa	This is a very confusing question but I will try to help.<br>  <br>  I think you are asking about the difference between psychologists and psychiatrists.  Psychiatrists are doctors and generally people see them to get prescriptions.  They can do some amount of therapy but their main purpose is generally to provide medication and prescriptions whereas psychologists are there to provide long term therapy solutions.  So if you don't want to be interrupted, psychologists -may- be your best bet.  But I would have an issue with any mental health professional who interrupts a client.<br>  <br>  Also, there is an issue which is referred to as "medical student disorder"  but applies to psych students as well.  Basically any disease (including mental health disorders) includes some symptoms which are just common place occurences.  It is when those common place issues occur together and with more worrying issues.  But when students are learning about them, there is a severe tendency to say "Hey!  I totally do that too!  OMG! I have this disorder!!!"  You don't.  I can say that with 90% confidence.  This is added to the fact that you want to describe symptoms that have only been occuring for about a month and the only way you can describe them is to use terms your have learned in psych classes.  This generally sounds like you have picked up medical student syndrome.|`|Wb6l1nKEaa	ok i'm a little confused what ur asking. but here is the big difff.  u can tell a psychologist or a psychiatrist anything u want.  the diff is a psychiatrist is a doctor and can perscribe u medication while a psychologist is not a doctor and can't percribe u meidication.  you can talk to them about whatever u want but if ur under the age of 18 and they think its very serious, they are allowed to tell your parents that serious thing.  if u want to talk more i'm online on aim or yahoo messenger and my screename is TheBTPYoda.  i'm not sure if i answered your question.
XivKHqSGaa	Wow man.. I'm really sorry about your friend. I know that life is really hard at times because I have personally struggled with depression myself but you need to fight the "feeling" that eats away at you deep down. As hard as it may be you need to find a way to fight through it. In this world you either sink or swim. With the growing worldwide state of Capitalism where people would literally stomp on you to reach their own goals, it is a lot easier for them to when your down. <br>  I personally found my antidote through music (Finnish Folk Metal!) but yours might be something completely different (not alcohol!). The only thing we can do is persevere. With the will to persevere and find the things that make us happy we can't sink because we are swimming to better things. <br>  I also drink but only in the form of  socializing but I honestly do not believe it is your antidote my friend simply because you do it to try and forget the troubles that surround us all and if we fall asleep in the pool of life we will surely sink. Fight it, don't hide it.<br>  Although I barely know you at all, I consider you my friend. This is simply because I know how it feels and I know how hard it is. We are all people and on the internet we are all comrades you can always talk to us. <br>  Good luck my friend,<br>  "If your going through hell, keep going." -Winston Churchill|`|T0niuadlaa	ok, i think you never feel good because you dont know why you are living in this world. i mean everything to you have no meaning so i think you should think about your future like who you want to be or get something to do and always get yourself busy.instead of get drunk you can play sport. also, you have to be confident in front of other, you can practice your speech in front of the mirror that could help you. well, you just tell others how you feel dont be nervous but remember that just tell the person who will going to enjoy your story. it's very helpful if you practice your speech everyday that can make you become more friendly. when you talk and talk and if there is someone there to listen  you, at least you could feel so much confortable...|`|kKlDmLzeaa	Try practicing meditation.<br>  <br>  Lots of time people take drugs or indulge in harmful things because they have a higher need to be mentally stimulated. These people feel terrible as they have a constant need to stimulate themselves (i.e. cutting themselves etc).<br>  <br>  You really should pick up a new healthy hobby that you may be passionate in and you'll feel good learning it, experiencing it and getting better at it.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, meditation is also a good method to curb your need for stimulation.|`|AA12139243	The first thing you need to do is  assess the type of crowd your haniging with. Are they true friends who will always be there for you or are they self centered and drugs and partying are  the main goal. Then the next step is figure out which direction you want to go toward..the light or dark.Talk to a counselor and they might reccomend you take a mild anti- depressant for awhile till ya feel better.then once u feel better start working on doing things you enjoy or go to school doing something you are really into..then it will fall into place|`|qXQIHCqGaa	Get high then.|`|Wb6l1nKEaa	well i'm sorry about your friend.  i know how u feel about life being crappy for a long long time.  if u want i'm online on aim or yahoo messenger and my screename is TheBTPYoda.

These “porous bones” lead to osteoporosis. Currently 10 million Americans—80% of whom are women—have osteoporosis.

Having either disease increases the risk of fractures in the hip, spine, wrist, pelvis and ribs. Osteoporosis was once considered an older women’s issue.

uVmwUqhIaa	Swelling and redness are not indicative of an infection on their own. If those are your only symptoms, your right ear is simply irritated. However, this can lead to an infection. Mix 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt to 8 oz of boiled water. Dip both lobes into the soak. Rotate your earrings and soak your lobes again. If the earring getting pushed into the lobe is becoming a problem, go to a tattoo shop or even a Hot Topic and find circular barbells. I assume that you got your ears pierced with a normal 20 gauge needle. Both places should have 20 gauge surgical stainless steel curved barbells. This will cause less irritation to your ears as you sleep. If you choose to use these, change out of your current earrings and into the new earrings only once. Do not go back and forth. You are supposed to keep the same earrings in for at least 4 to 6 weeks. Also, avoid the use of alcohol and peroxide.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy healing!|`|BNAzjSO1aa	It could be that you have the beginning of an infection in that lobe so I would suggest that you see a doctor and check if you need antibiotics for it.

Forcing or holding the foreskin back can hurt and cause injury including ‘Paraphimosis’ where the tight foreskin restricts blood flow to and from the glans. <br>  <br>   If the foreskin is detached from the glans of your penis but is not fully retractable because the ‘hole’ in your foreskin is too small to allow the glans to come out AND the foreskin does not appear to be stretching over time you may have a condition known as ‘Phimosis’.<br>  <br>  Phimosis is not uncommon and often resolves itself through puberty as the normal practice of masturbation stretches the foreskin to the point where it retracts fully. To stretch your foreskin simply try to retract it a little more each time you shower, urinate or masturbate. Otherwise you can do stretching exercises as describe in the links below.<br>  <br>  If your foreskin is very tight, is not stretching or loosening over time, or still feels firmly attached to the head of your penis you should see a doctor.  A doctor can prescribe steroid creams which assist with the stretching process.<br>  <br>  In extreme cases of phimosis circumcision might be recommended but this is usually a last resort.<br>  <br>  It is normal for the glans (head) of your penis to be very sensitive when it is first exposed.  This sensitivity should reduce over time as you masturbate or engage in sex.  <br>  <br>  Check out the links below<br>  <a href="http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/docs/Factsheet_PenisProblems.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/docs/F...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/restoremaine/tight_foreskin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/restoremaine/ti...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathermag.com/health/boy-care/boy-care2.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathermag.com/health/boy-care...</a><br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgS_BsYpEJnIQjyQ9xkG4EPg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20080704035859AA2gWX8">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Agv5irHjawO.lSGw14XGKkTg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20080718012622AApCEx8">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>

xnZi0i8saa	I have suffered from Derealization/Depersonalization disorder my whole life. In my case it was caused by abuse but it can be cause by smoking pot. It is usually transient, meaning that eventually it goes away all by itself. All psychiatrists and psychologists arewell aware of it. It is a very common state. 70% of all people will experience it in their lifetime. It can follow any traumatic situation and frequently accompanies or follows panic attacks or anxiety. Then it can cause more anxiety..... a viscious cycle.<br>  <br>  There is no know treatment, however it can resolve all by itself with no treatment. Therapy and some medications can help lessen the anxiety which will help. Valium, Xanax, etc and some antidepressants can help a lot. She is not necessarily stuck with it forever.<br>  <br>  She is being fatalistic, and sounds depressed too. She is putting too much blame on the DR/DP. Many people live with it 24/7. I have lived with it for 35 years. I also have Bipolar disorder....... I'm still hanging in there<br>  <br>  In response to the guy who connected it to multiple personalities..... it is in the same catagory, called dissociative disorders and it is only considered a "disorder" if you suffer from it continuously for years....... It is most common as a symptom of trauma or anxiety. It usually goes away by itself. Having if forever is very rare.|`|KcDRAWrtaa	She can't be sure she has this disorder until she is diagnosed. her doctor will only prescribe pills. she needs to be in counseling because if she focuses on WHY she feels this way, it will help her conquer it.|`|99AEKeUWaa	Sounds like schizophrenia.

dSZTdU56aa	I doubt the ingestion of the pills would be causing the problems he's having in school now.  The parents should be ashamed of themselves for not seeking immediate medical treatment for their own son overdosing on birth control pills.  They are clearly not suitable to be parents.|`|K26ec4kLaa	OMG  I can't believe that they didn't call a doctor immediately after he ingested the whole pak!  Or call poison control center.  I have no idea what could be causing these symptoms a year later.  It may have had something to do with the pills.. They work on the brain and hormones.  Even if a grown woman ingested a whole pak, I would think she'd call the doctor and be checked out. I would be concerned like you.. You could call and ask a doctor or yours if you want some answers.. Even a pharmacist can answer certain questions because they're the chemists.  So, if not a doctor try talking to a local pharmacist.  Those parents are very negligent in my opinion.|`|WcIIpxs2aa	Birth control pills contain hormones (usually estrogen or progesterone) that supress ovulation.  I would have been inclined to contact a poison control center or see a doctor for any immediate side-effects, but would not have been concerned about long-term effects after the child's hormone levels returned to normal.  It would only be conjecture to link the child's behavior to the pills, assuming the unusual hormone levels affected brain development.  It seems more likely that the pill ingestion was part of his unruly behavior rather than the cause of it.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	the little pill incident had nothing to do with his behavior.

fk9AvB25aa	Cold sores can be caused by herpes simplex 1, not herpes zooster that is what is related to chicken pox. They are very contagious while they are active and visible. They are also very common to have 50-80 percent of the population has them. If he all ready has them then he won't get them again on his mouth, but you can pass them to the genitals. So do not kiss or give oral sex until the sore is completely gone.<br>  Unfortunately there is nothing to say if he will get it for sure, but he does have a good chance of him contracting cold sores since he kissed you when you had an out break.

In fact, non-organic cotton is one of the most pesticide laden crops there is in the world so unless you use organic cotton tampons, you still risk TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome) if you leave a tampon in too long. Using them anyway exposes you to the pesticides in the cotton.<br>  <br>  In any case, I have used organic cotton tampons but the best thing since sliced bread for periods is a menstrual cup! You need nothing else and it's so easy and versatile and very cost efficient.<br>  <br>  Check out either the Diva Cup or The Keeper. The Keeper is no longer sold in Canada (that's what I used for 2+ years, the same one even!) because it's made in the USA and the company didn't get a renewed license with Health Canada or something but now I've ordered the Diva Cup which is similar.<br>  <br>  Basically the cup holds about 6 oz of menstrual fluid. It's easy to insert and extract to empty. On your heaviest days you may want to check it a few times throughout the day to see how often you may need to empty it. It too can overflow and leak but once you're used to it in conjunction with your flow, you will never use pads or tampons again!<br>  <br>  Different companies will sell these. I got mine from <a href="http://www.grassrootsstore.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.grassrootsstore.com/</a> but they each have their own sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.divacup.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.divacup.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.keeper.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.keeper.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can probably get them cheaper but I paid around $50 for The Keeper. That's about 4 or 5 boxes of tampons; so how long would that last you? The "cup" will last several months. They recommend changing it every year but mine literally lasted longer than 2 years. Not only do you not have to carry around tampons but you're not filling landfills with menstrual products! You don't have to worry about properly disposing of anything.<br>  <br>  Cleaning is easy. Anti-bacterial soap and warm/hot water.<br>  <br>  They generally come in 2 sizes: regular and "have had a baby" (since you stretch so the size would have to be a bit bigger).<br>  <br>  PS: I am a black belt in karate and have found this product absolutely fabulous!

Sometimes stepping on the smallest pebble will break your ankle.  Elevate it as much as you can, and go to the doctor.  They need to x-ray it to see if anything's broken.  If you broke something, they will put you in some sort of cast or splint, or may even have to set the bone.  They will give you good pain medication.  Also, ice it for 20 minutes at a time throughout the day.  Give yourself at least 20 minutes between icings.  This will help with the swelling, and so will the ibuprofin until you can get to a doctor.

I feel a difference in mood in 3 days.  But as I said - all brain chemistry is different.  Never would I wait 6 weeks for a med to work.  You need to find a good psychiatrist and be very pro-active in treating your depression.  It took a long time for me to find the right medication but I did.  And I feel good.  Don't let anybody tell you - take a walk, read a good book, think positive - none of that stuff works if you're depressed dah - do you think you wouldn't have tried?

AA10084471	Obviously some massage parlors are merely prostitution fronts, and it is obvious what can happen in those.<br>  <br>  In others, a table shower is just what it sounds like.  The person lies on a table (usually a padded massage table -- firm) and the masseuse or masseur takes a hot shower nozzle and prays the person down, and usually soaps them up and rinses them off.

It's a $57 billion a year global industry, and the U.S. is the largest producer, consumer and exporter of porn in the world. And now that porn's become the norm in our mainstream media, music and movies, you have to wonder: are we becoming a "porn nation"? Or have we already become one? And if so, how is this affecting us as individuals, both in the way we see ourselves and in how we see and act towards others in relationships?<br>  <br>  Important questions for today's college students, and the central question posed in "Porn Nation-The Naked Truth." Porn Nation is a fast-paced, multimedia-based lecture featuring the compelling personal story of Michael Leahy, a recovering sex addict and the voice for over 20 million sexually addicted men and women in America.<br>  <br>  Featured on ABC's "20/20" and "The View", and the subject of numerous local news stories and newspaper articles as he tours the nation's universities, Michael and "Porn Nation" are breaking the silence in what Oprah Winfrey refers to as America's #1 addiction. His personal story captivates audiences with its gut-level honesty and open dialogue about America's biggest obsession - sex. Michael shares intimate details about his growing obsession with porn, and how it changed the way he viewed and treated both women and men and ended up costing him a 15 year marriage and family of two boys.

BIzaFaOYaa	This is a common problem with alot of guys, maybe I can help.  <br>  <br>  First of all, completly stop masterbating for 2-3 days while you let it heal.  Go to your local store and buy some regular Vaseline or Petroleum Jelly. (Dont waste money on expensive lotions or products).  Put the Vaseline on the tip of your penis.  Be sure to re-apply after showers, before bed, and around lunchtime.<br>  <br>  The Vaseline will protect the skin, moisturize it, and allow it to heal.  If you want, you can go buy a big bandaid to put over the raw area (make sure you put the vaseline on before you put on the bandaid) to further protect your penis.<br>  <br>  Your problem should end withing 2-3 days of doing what I said above.<br>  <br>  In the future, start using some type of lotion, or KY liquid.  Never masterbate with spit, or "dry hand".<br>  <br>  P.S.  If you are sexually active, please refrain from having sex until your penis is completely healed.  You are more likely to contract a STD with a raw penis.  Also, if you use condoms, the condom could rub your skin and worsen your problem.  If sex is a must, try lubricating your penis with KY Liquid before putting the condom on, just be careful to not let it slip off during sex.|`|AA10475412	You need to go easy on the masturbating.|`|HvWwjnLFaa	told you guys if you are not careful it will fall off-best check with a doctor could be infection or worse if you messed around.|`|99b24665f2ce2cd2fa8ea2e1919dd6feaa	Just leave it alone for a while.

It will probably heal on it's own, though.|`|VymTPIOraa	Riding the bike too much.Theres something bound to break|`|f61d7b55c7a8f82e1a344628134f4f1eaa	sounds like you just had a little more hand to penis tip contact last night. that extra friction can easily make the end of the penis tender or sore for a day or two after. And yes, if it is tender, boxers, briefs, pj's sheets and other fabrics rubbing against yoru penis tip can be quite uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  best way to deal with it is give the little guy a break for a day or two until the tenderness passes. also try a nice body or hand lotion to moisturize the tender area. As well, keep the penis and surrounding area really clean. Plus consider wearing underwear that don;t allow for chafing for a few days.<br>  <br>  and once you recover, learn to masturbate without causing excess friction on the glans/head and/or use a lubricant to reduce friction.|`|w9EQcmQ4aa	Well stupid you. Leave it alone for a while. Logic will tell you if you rub it that much the friction is going  to cause a burn on your penis. Little you can do apart from give it time to heal, and perhaps occupy yourself with something more intelligent. You must have a lot of time on your hands. Be careful the rubbing doesn't become an obsession. I would just use an antibacterial cream on it just to make sure you don't end up with an infection and then you really will be in trouble.

w9EQcmQ4aa	ninety percent of sexual ability comes from your mind the rest is physical. There is obviously something  going on in your head that you may not even be aware of. It is highly unlikely that someone here in this forum could help you, perhaps you should consider seeing a therapist who specialises in these type of  problems. It does not sound as though you have any physical  problems because as you say you are getting erections. I would not say it is nerves because you have obviously had sex before, so the only place I can think of is inside your head, perhaps what your thinking of or what your not thinking of. It's okay for women they can lay back and think about anything but for a man to keep an erection up well it's a bit hard to fake that. Have you discussed this with your girlfriend? Perhaps you need to spice things up a little try different approaches, role playing, longer foreplay, different positions, perhaps she needs to be a bit more dominant with you..anyway I wish you well..|`|BswsDDVBaa	dude I think you may be gay|`|GbZrdv3taa	I think you getting nervous and to tense, be laid back, take things as it goes.

If any of the above occur go to the hospital immediatly.|`|WbNPkZhnaa	There are two ways to answer the question of how Viagra works. Here's the short answer: Viagra blocks an enzyme that prevents erections from happening. <br>  <br>  The longer answer is: When sexual stimulation and arousal occur, they cause a chemical called cyclic GMP to be produced. Cyclic GMP creates erections by causing the arteries of the penis to expand and the veins to narrow. In other words, it creates a "traffic jam" of blood in the penis with blood entering faster than it leaves. That's what causes the penis to get hard. <br>  <br>  Viagra stops an enzyme that attacks cyclic GMP, so more cyclic GMP can accumulate in the man's penis. With more cyclic GMP present it causes the normal expanding of the arteries and narrowing of the veins -- which produces an erection. <br>  <br>  So in the presence of sexual stimulation, erection occurs -- as long as the stimulation is perceived by the man's body as sexual.<br>  <br>  more about How Does Viagra Work - <a href="http://www.viagra.su/how-does-viagra-work.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.viagra.su/how-does-viagra-wor...</a>|`|RpIElS4Raa	can't say i have

1571509531ecf15251cc04e355cea80faa	Your question is hard to answer with sources the way it is posed.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would look at the side effects of ADHD meds first.<br>  <br>  From personal experience I can tell you that many girls used ADHD meds (Dexedrine and Desoxin) in the 1960's and 1970's for supposable weight problems with a doctor's approval and prescription.  However, many of the girls that told me this were not overweight and some bordered on too skinny.  Truth is, that ADHD meds causes weight loss due to the fact that you lose your appetite and in fact, while on the drug you can have such a distaste for food that you literally feel nauseated by merely thinking about or placing food in your mouth.  Eventually people get use to this and can often tolerate some food while medicated but still not much.<br>  <br>  I was diagnosed with ADHD without the hyperactivity in my early 30's and started taking Dexedrine later to replace it with  Ritalin then Adderall.  I no longer take meds.<br>  <br>  My four children have ADHD without hyperactivity as well and have been on a full variety of ADHD meds.  At this time, none are on them as they are all adults and three do not have insurance. My youngest son was always medicated more than the others.  While on medications he was quite irritable, his growth was stunted, and he became quite hyper when the meds were wearing off.  He is still a very depressed person but has grown a lot physically since stopping the medications.  He graduated from high school without meds for the final three years of his public school education.  My youngest daughter was on ADHD meds for a short time along with an antidepressant.  She ended up with psychosis NOS (no other symptoms) for a month and was hospitalized.  The meds were removed immediately.  She is psychosis free now.<br>  <br>  We were never addicted to ADHD meds although that is something that many believe happens.  In fact, more often than not we had a habit of forgetting to take the medication for days.<br>  <br>  However, people who do not have ADHD that take ADHD meds do it for different reasons.  They usually have a tendency to want to get high, enhance their awakened time and perform better academically under great academic stress such as college/work load situations and some still want the weight loss effect that these meds cause.<br>  <br>  A person with ADHD diagnosis often doesn't like the effects of medication as they feel their creativity is stifled on the med and that the med forces them to focus on things not of interest to them.  The medication makes you lose your appetite, your sleep pattern is shot, your nerves are on edge especially when the medication is wearing off and it can bring on paranoia and depression leaving you to feel that your day was ruined.<br>  <br>  People who take ADHD meds and do not have ADHD appear to be people who have a greater need to please others at the detriment of their own pleasure and/or believe that the heightened state is eurphoric (the pleasure of being high).<br>  <br>  There are many side effects of ADHD meds that people are not aware of or that are played down by pharmaceutical industries and physicians that can do harm to both an ADHD person and a non ADHD person.<br>  <br>  ADHD medications speed up all of your body functions such as your heart and the aging process.  It effects your liver and can destroy it if not monitored.  It  causes depression, anxiety, and paranoia.<br>  <br>  Other side effects are severe headaches, sleep disturbances and/or sleep apnea.<br>  <br>  Strattera was taken off the market do to fatalities and severe liver toxicity.  Adderall was taken off the market in Canada due to fatalities.  Ritalin is more prone to make you paranoid and anxious (giving you extreme jitters and sometimes tics when it is wearing off).  Dexedrine is not used much anymore as it was said to be addictive (there again, I took Dexedrine and found it not to be addictive at all).  Desoxin, was a drug that was said to be abused by drug addicts and is not used as far as I know.  Dexedrine is used rarely as it was in the same class as Desoxin.<br>  <br>  College students are the ones most likely to use ADHD drugs without a diagnosis.  They simply buy or borrow some from a student with the diagnosis.<br>  <br>  This site gives you the dangers of Ritalin:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chiropracticresearch.org/NEWSRitalindangers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chiropracticresearch.org/NEWS...</a><br>  <br>  I'm sorry I cannot give you another source for your particular question but as I said before I would simply try researching for the side effects of these drugs.  I forgot to mention that ADHD drugs slow a person with ADHD down so they can concentrate.  I believe that people who do not have ADHD like the "speed" effect that it gives them.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped some.|`|p6ltg0b4aa	I've read that using stimulants used in treating ADHD will give you a "speed" effect. It doesn't react the same way in a person who does NOT need them as it does in a person who does.<br>  <br>  Search for the words "academic doping". Studies have shown that pediatricians are prescribing the stimulants to children whose parents want them to do good in school even though the child doesn't need it.

It supresses my appetite that is about it, no major weight loss yet.

You would be on the high end of this standard. The main thing to remember is to ensure that you still take in the necessary daily nutrients and vitamins. And remember that even though today's trends do not support it, carbs are not the enemy. This is especially true if you will be involved in any form of an exercise routine, as carbs are what supply our bodies with energy. You will be surprised how easy it is to lose weight by simply cutting out unecessary fats and sugars. While saturated fats and trans fats are bad, remember that your body needs monounsaturate fats (most commonly found in nuts) and polyunsaturated fats (found in fish oil and corn soy). It is also necessary to ensure that you take in the necessary amount of iron so you do not begin to feel tired or run down. A daily multi-vitamin is a fantastic compliment to a already healthy and balanced diet. One last note, if you drink a lot of soda kicking this habit is the easiest way to begin your weight loss. Some studies state that cutting soda from your diet, and doing nothing else different, can result in as much as a 20 pound loss over the course of a year. Also avoid diet sodas. Even though they do not have calories, they tend to make you feel tired and out of energy, which means you are more likely to lay around and not be active. As always, ensure that you weight loss program is right (and healthy) for you personally.|`|7QoIrnntaa	This diet claims to allow you to lose 15 pounds in half that time.  I just started it and since you have to eat 6 times a day, I am never hungry.  It's a lot of healthy, low-cal food...a lot.

1Weszvuoaa	And to answer the question like it was asked:<br>  <br>  No coffee does not interfere with weight loss. There are very little calories in coffee. But be care-full as to what kind of coffee you drink and what is in it. Actual caffeine in coffee does not affect you.<br>  <br>  Remember unless you are drinking a coffee black, then there will always be milk in it. Depending on what kind of milk it is, will tell you how many calories. Full fat milk in coffee will not help you slim. Skimmed milk will be a lot better for you.<br>  <br>  Once again this depends on how many times you are drinking coffee as well. If you only have 1 maybe 2, then the calories are negligible.<br>  <br>  Decaff coffee does taste different, but depending on how much coffee you drink and whether you drink it for taste or not, means you most likely will not be able to taste the difference.<br>  <br>  p.s. If you are watching your calories then stay away from starbucks. They most always use full fat milk and if you get anything other than a normal coffee, it will most likely have sugar/syrup of some sort in it.|`|VNZRMzReaa	Flower,<br>     <br>  On a basic level coffee in and of itself (without any cream or sugar) does not help you lose weight. It actually promotes fat storage in your adipose tissues. You can read more about the science behind it in the links below.  <br>  <br>  If you love your cup of joe, don't want to give up the comfort and benefits of drinking coffee, but want to lose weight I suggest that you drink Skinny Science Coffee. This is a low glycemic, non cephalic coffee... meaning it does not promote fat storage, and is actually a fat-burning coffee. It's a patented and approved coffee through leading glycemic researchers led by Dr. Ann De Wees Allen. The studies and info are also available below. To break it down, you can burn more calories by drinking 2-3 cups of coffee a day than you would by running a couple blocks around your neighborhood. One before breakfast, lunch, and if you desire with dinner. It's that simple, and it's that amazing. Dr. Ann De Wees Allen is 20 years ahead of her time in research when it comes to the obesity & diabetes epidemic. You can read more about that below also.<br>  <br>  As for additives in your coffee it is important to use a milk/creamer that won't promote nor cause weight gain. That includes any sugar or sweetener that you may be using on a daily basis. There is an all natural sweetener available through the same leading research team called Acai Sweet, and a Zero Fat Creamer that won't promote fat storage, unlike many products. They've basically designed a three part system that is a dream come true for coffee drinkers, the diabetic community, and those seeking weight loss alike. <br>  <br>  If you have any questions or need more information please don't hesitate to contact us at support@angelascoffeeshop.com.

But it needs to be black or an espresso as calories in lattes or capaccinos or adding milk and sugar can make any metabolism boosting negligable. <br>  <br>  What it also does though, is make your metabolism drop rapidly 20 minutes after the caffine has been taken. This leaves you burning calories at a slower rate then normal and so at the end of the day, coffee really does not have that much of an impact, if any impact at all.<br>  <br>  You would need to have about 20 cups of coffee a day and not add any sugar or milk or cream to get anywhere. And this would mean you may struggle to sleep at night- meaning when you wake up, you may feel very achey and unable to move around as fast or excercise as fully. So you need to eat less to compensate for that....viscious circle and also very miserable. Just cut the junk food and up the excercise, its way easier!|`|e4320d40393740e3b9148136c56004baaa	Lester Piggott the jockey to keep weight down used to smoke cigars and drink black coffee and nothing else.

7G4hisdzaa	You need to have the absorbency level to get you through at least 4 hours.  If you are having to change more frequently, you should up your level.  Your period will come heavier at some times, less heavy at others.  Usually heavier at first, and as your cycle continues, it will require less absorbency.<br>  You are at the most risk for TSS and bacteria when you leave a tampon in for longer that the recommended time, which (double check your insert in the box) I believe is usually 6 hours.<br>  So just make sure you remove it if it has been in that long, and adjust your absorbency if it is difficult to remove (dry), or if you are having to change more frequently.|`|GZ88jyP4aa	Use the supers on your heaviest flow days then as it lessens use regular until you speckle then you should just use liners.<br>  <br>  No TSS for you then ;D

Diet: very important when trying to lose weight. You should eat often but little - let's say 5 meals (small) instead of 3 big. Lots of fruits and vegetables should be included in your diet. Also water is very important so try to drink about 8 glasses a day.<br>  2. Exercising - try to do some jogging and/or swimming 5 times a week for about 30 - 40 minutes. It will not only help you to lose weight but it will also keep you fit.<br>  <br>  And last word: when trying to lose weight do not rush -it takes time so be patient.

But that’s not how you should look at it. You don’t have to suffer. Losing weight is simply the result of a healthier lifestyle. By understanding the underlying causes of this problem, you will know exactly what you need to do. Then you will be able to apply the principles I talk about in your life right away, and start getting results.<br>  Follow these three steps and you will be well on your way to a healthier, slimmer body.<br>  1. Speed up your metabolism  by eating more meals<br>  ? Your metabolism is usually the reason why you are gaining weight, even if you are on a diet. It basically represents the rate at which your body consumes all the food you eat. The reasons for a slow metabolism can go as far as genetics. That means that you probably inherited it.  Also, age and gender have a lot to do with it: an old woman has a much slower metabolism than a young man.<br>  ? In order to fix that, you will have to eat more meals in smaller portions and eat slowly.<br>  ?  Action step: Eat 6-8 small meals throughout the day.  <br>  2. Curve your caloric intake by exercising<br>  ? Exercising is what will actually burn the fat right off. Think of it like a shortcut. All you do is concentrate the effort you would make in a much longer period of time in order to reach your goal faster. Practicing a sport or just being active also help. By burning the calories, exercising will allow you to eat more. I’m sure you can see how that helps.<br>  ? Action step: Exercise 20-30 minutes a day.<br>  3. Keep your body healthy and energized by eating fruits and vegetables<br>  ? This is the exciting part. It’s where you fix all the things that you weren’t able to balance right.  All the vitamins and minerals will help your body work efficiently and boost your energy. But what’s more important is that you don’t have to give up on what you like if you compensate with fruits and supplements. This works because fruits contain fiber which if contained in high quantities will trigger diarrhea. And that way you will just flush your weight down the toilet.<br>  ? Action step: Eat 10-15 fruits/vegetables a day  <br>  Extra Tip: For an extra boost to help you lose weight, drink Acai Berry Juice every day, as it is highly beneficial. Acai Berries are rich in Vitamin A and contain iron, fiber and calcium. They have a great flavor and contain all kinds of nutrients and antioxidants.|`|NSARVXkMaa	Take it easy and relax. It's easier than you think. I lost 33 pounds in around 2 months by walking on a treadmill and taking hoodia. This is no B.S.!!! You asked exactly and I'm telling you. After you read this you must GOOGLE: online health desert burn hoodia : just cut and paste it into your google search engine. I hurt my back and was out of commission for nearly 2 years so I put on like 33 pounds and felt like crap. My buddy Mark is a health nut so I asked him what to do and he said he had heard good things about hoodia. I researched it online and one of the best brands turned out to be desert burn hoodia. I got some and no bull, I dropped 33 pounds in just a couple of months because when you take this stuff you literally forget to eat. I swear to God I did. Food was the last thing on my mind and that never had happened before. I have a very big appetite and seemed like I was always hungry. Sincerly, desert burn hoodia can work just as good for you as it did for me. You can do it man!!! seriously, try some hoodia and if you do decide to, I'd appreciate it if you get it through my site but if not, that's ok, just get some and don't buy any of the crap the sell at GNC either. Desert Burn is authentic and 100% hoodia gordonii. Don't forget, Google: online health desert burn hoodia :and read about that and also read about the treadmill, protein and fiber also. There's a ton of reading on my site so tear it up. All my best and good luck with the weight loss.

You see, it's NOT "weight" You gain, but just the body-fluids, which weigh as well. <br>  <br>  You really are overly "infatuated" with your weight, honey...and you remind me at a lady I met in therapy, who wouldn't even go on the scale before she's been to the bathroom first....and when I asked her...WHY in the world she would do that she answered:"Your urine weighs as well"....I mean if that's NOT OVERDOING it...than I don't know !!!

7mHlDzn9aa	Kind of a short question, but if you get stitches they can be 3 to7 days (Mainly 3 or 4 ) I am not a doctor but stitches are about a quarter of an inch apart for cuts on your skin that are deep. So I mean to say that after your stitches are pulled it could easily be another 2 weeks. And now you are probably saying whats with this guy ?  I dont have any stitches!                              |`|KyKasXBIaa	it depends on the location and depth of the cut

24414fcc91f5304cd67eb4e1e5e9e3d2aa	There are two types of diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2. Although they are both forms of diabetes, they are totally different diseases. Only 5-10% of all diabetics have Type 1.<br>  <br>  Type 1 is an auto-immune disease that usually occurs in childhood or under the age of 20, but not always, which is why it's sometimes also called Juvenile Diabetes. It is not caused by eating too much junk food, sugar, or living a poor lifestyle. There is nothing you can do to prevent type 1 diabetes and there is currently no cure, although scientists say they are close.<br>  <br>  Type 2 usually developes in adulthood and can develope slowly over a period of time. Obesity, poor diet and lifestyle can contribute to this type of diabetes, but this is not always the case. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented, or that's what some people say. Other people disagree with that statement. <br>  <br>  Here are some of the symptoms of Type 1 Diabetes. Some of them might apply to Type 2, but I'm not sure:<br>  <br>  *Increased thirst<br>  *Frequent Urination<br>  *Increased appetite<br>  *Drowsiness, Lethargy<br>  *Sudden Weight loss<br>  *Sugar in urine<br>  *Sudden vision changes<br>  *Heavy, labored breathing<br>  *Stupor, Unconsciousness<br>  *Fruity, sweet, or wine - like odor on breath<br>  *And sometimes upset stomach and vomiting<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  |`|bRpt4li0aa	i am a diabetic. this is how i found out that i had it.<br>  i aways was tired<br>  drank a lot<br>  went to the bathroom a lot.<br>  did not want to eat. <br>  lost weight<br>  <br>  if this is what is happening to ur friend then geta  blood test to see what the sugar is. if its high more than 200 go to the hospital. don't wait
k6M48eUMaa	If you're going to be exercising every day then you don't have to go to such extremes. It is definately a good idea to avoid soft drinks, cordials, coffee, etc and just drink fresh water. <br>  <br>  Just stay away from things you know are bad. Chips, biscuits, lollies, sweets, cakes, hash browns, hot dogs, etc, etc. <br>  As long as you stick to water and healthy foods, and work out a little bit each day, you should see some results after about 2 weeks or so.<br>  Good luck <br>  xo

8Apb5fXJaa	Cheerios.|`|1jGEeMDYaa	All those are great.<br>  Special K also had a commercial promoting their cereal as a night-time snack. And all of their commercials nowadays promote Special K as part of a weight loss plan, so see if that fits in with your calorie in-take.<br>  Also fresh fruit might be an idea, unless you already had all your fruit for the day. But you can never have too many.|`|LR5m5WDOaa	All three are healthy.  I would vary them so that you don't get tired of the same ol thing day after day. |`|fys4qM9Faa	Whatever you do, do not eat the Frosted cereal.

It helps to regulate your blood sugar and eases you into sleep.|`|e48yQ1dKaa	you shouldn't eat anything before bed. <br>  but oatmeal would be best of the foods because of its high nutrition and low number of calories.<br>  if you can, switching out to fruits before bed would be healthier.|`|U6C4Bywwaa	I would say cheerios?<br>  heart healthy?|`|KZbFgxNcaa	if you want to maintain your weight or look even more good with less body fat,then recommend you drinking a whey protein shake before bed.The reason i recommend you protein instead of carbohydrates(bread,pasta,cereal,fruits,... because carbs causes insulin to release and if you cant convert carbohydrates into energy then it gets stored into fat probably around your belly and at night you aren't  burning much calories. So at night as a bed time snack drink whey protein shake because it is very hard for your body to convert protein into energy so you burn calories if your body converts protein into energy,because it is very hard for our body to convert protein to energy.<br>  <br>  So drink whey protein shake at night,and it also fills you up,because  protein gets released very slowly into our body.

You are ripping out hair from the roots... rip one of your hairs out of your arm and multiply that by 100 all at once. But everyone has a different pain tolerance too, so if you have a high pain tolerance it probably wont hurt as much for you. If you have a low one then you're probably screwed lol!

There is nothing that is inherently unsafe unless it will either cut you or will deliver bacteria.  Even your fingers, if they are dirty, can cause infection.  Whatever you play with, make sure it is thoroughly cleaned before and after "use".  I would avoid anything that is porous because a lot of things can get into stuff like that and become bacteria sponges.  I have seen women use everything from candles to champagne bottles, children's toys, sporting equipment, balloons, fruits and veggies, etc.  One interesting approach is to freeze water in various objects and then masturbate with the ice.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

Then tell everyone about it.<br>  5) Learn about zone training and low intensity training.<br>  <br>  Start out jogging 30 minutes a day and increase time by no more than 10% per week.  In 2 months you'll be running 10K races.  1 hour jogging and 1 hour on a bike in Zone 2-low Zone 3 burns around 1500 cals and puts your cardio workout to shame.  It'll put the green chart about 600 calories a day above the red chart.|`|5Jy04RVKaa	when you just diet, i.e. consume less calories without exercising (hopefully by eating healthier rather than just eating less) you lose body fat, because obviously theres less fat in your diet. However, if you are dieting and exercising 6 days a week for an hour at a time your body is changing, you are you taking in less calories but by doing weights and other such exercises you are building up muscle, first your body fat changes to muscle (muscle weighs more than body fat) your body becomes more toned and then you begin lose weight whilst also toning and building strength, keep doing what you're doing, if in a while you're worried its still not working then consult a professional. Make sure you don't just eat less, eating less means that you become weaker as your body loses fat but then begins to lose muscle as your body starts eating it to survive and you would eventually become very weak and ill and in extreme cases, your body would eat its own organs and shut down.|`|fXBNqpTeaa	A simple answer would be you're gaining muscle mass. Muscle weighs more than fat, so you are most likely slimming down your fat in replacement of muscle. You /look/ slimmer, but you weigh the same, simply because muscle is heavier than fat.|`|mxFZnj0uaa	You need to work your muscles! Lifting weights, doing crunches, leg lifts,|`|HipCpcIlaa	slow metabolism|`|D81hhlKSaa	It's not just about how many calories you burn on the elliptical, because even though you're burning 300 calories on it, you're really only burning 300 minus how many you would have burned before you started working out, so probably 100 in the hour you weren't working out. So you're really only burning 200 calories. And it takes a calorie deficit of about 3500 to lose one full pound of just fat. Find a reliable website that will calculate you BMR with your activity level included. That will tell you how many cals in a day your body will burn (it calculates your workout in with it so you don't add your 300 cals at the gym onto it). Knowing how many cals your body will burn will let you know how many cals you need to eat. Try doing a 500-600 calorie deficit a day and you should be losing around a pound of fat a week. Also, since you started lifting this week (which is awesome) lift before you do cardio. That part is really important. Lift, cardio (which you don't need to do an hour, you can bring that down to a half an hour because lifting will make up for the calories you're burning) and drink water and you'll see some results.|`|4b8MLoJNaa	When it comes to burning calories intensity is very important. Monitor your heart rate when you are doing cardio and make sure that you keep it in the 'target zone'. You can calculate this zone at the following link. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stevenscreek.com/goodies/hr.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.stevenscreek.com/goodies/hr.s...</a><br>  <br>  Be sure to keep things interesting and vary your routines. Find a good weight lifting circuit (many gyms offer assistance with this, or even have a set up machine circuit) and move quickly from one exercise to the next to keep your heart rate up. This will increase your metabolism.<br>  <br>  Remember, not all calories are created equal. You should be eating lean meats, veggies, nuts, seeds and beans, a bit of fruit and a little dairy.|`|f7yJQbB4aa	First of all, those estimates of calories burned are BS. Focus more on your heart rate, and on keeping it at a good level throughout the whole cardio workout.<br>  Second, working out will often make you lose fat, but gain weight. Muscle weighs more than fat. Measure your success by how you look, not how much you weigh.<br>  Third, if you still feel pudgy, look at your sodium consumption. You might be retaining water, which is hiding the weight you've lost or the muscle you've gained.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|cukXH3lhaa	I use to run consistently for at least several weeks and only lost about 5lbs. now that its been winter i haven't been able to run at all, but i found out that simply eating less and drinking more water ive lost almost 12 pounds in barely two months. your metabolism might be slow. some people can lose a lot of weight doing what your doing, but for others they simply need to eat less or maybe a combination of both. you should try maybe less consumption and see if that works for you.|`|EB4O98eNaa	You need to cut sugar completely from your diet. Don't add sugar to anything. Don't eat anything that is naturally high in sugar like fruit and fruit juice, corn etc. Drink only bottled water. Eat very low or no-fat food. Don't eat late at night. Eat lots of veggies and drink veggie drinks (eg. V8) whenever you are hungry. Eat chicken breast for protein. DON'T STARVE YOURSELF.<br>  As far as exercise is concerned, walking long distances is a good start. Find a sport that you like and stick with it.|`|qflKqif4aa	this possibly could be that you are just turning any body fat into muscles. there is  a certain amount of calories you must burn to loose body fat. Say if you want to loose a pound a week then you would have to loose 3,500 calories which is 700 per day.|`|DsszxGT6aa	Muscle weighs a lot. Don't go by weight. measure around your waist and thighs and arms and you will see what I mean.|`|NSARVXkMaa	It sounds like you're off to a good start and you have kinda plateaued.  That's rather natural actually.  Even with weight lifting or running or whatever you kinda hit that imaginary barrier and it's hard to break through to the next phase of your personal weight loss mission. I went to a wedding on hoodia and lost weight so you should have no problems.  The best way to lose weight is to control your appetite and the best way to do that that I know of is with hoodia.  When I was dieting (and believe me I still watch my weight even though I have achieved my weight loss goals for the most part) I realized right off that the most important thing is to control your appetite.  If your stomach's not always growling and your not always craving food it is sooo much easier to stick to your guns and stay on your diet.  With hoodia I would literally go a whole day sometimes and simply forget to eat and I didn't get tired and run down like diets can sometimes make you feel.  Once my appetite was under control and I wasn't always thinking about eating then and only then could the weight start coming off consistently and steadily because the hoodia kept my mind off of food and I would go longer on my diet and as I did that naturally I lost weight.  You have to remember that consistency is very important when losing weight.  If you cut back a little on your food consumption everyday your body will change (stomach will shrink and you won't be eating as much) and with that consistency over a few days, weeks and months you will lose weight just like I did.  Hoodia was my saving grace for all of these factors.  Hope this helps!!!  GOOGLE: online health desert burn hoodia :to read all the good info. you need to accomplish your goals.
sp1TB35Kaa	Definitely.|`|Sucivxykaa	noo ur not fat! don't compare yourself to them- ur weight is fine for ur age!|`|peB3XgiGaa	OMG, you're NOT fat. Everyone is build different, so don't think that you have to be stick thin to be attractive. So many of those girls that are under 100 pounds have eating disorders, so don't do that to your body. You are the perfect weight for your age.|`|87699ab1ce2025108e4e32e4cb62c9e6aa	well im 14 and i weigh 94 pounds but i dont have alot of muscle but my best friend weighs like 130 and she looks alot like me but she has more muscle so it just depends if you weigh a little more bcuz of muscle or fat. otherwise thats pretty normal. dont worry about your weight the world we live in is rediculous how they make girls think they have to be blnde skinny and have big boobs. dont worry what other people think.|`|rUdFljMiaa	im 13 and i am know as a stick at school :S <br>  im 5'4 (quite tall) and i weight 93ish LB. <br>  but i have to be honest, youre a bit overweight|`|ETV7yvNbaa	I think you may just be a little over, but don't feel bad!

Don't worry!|`|UuFQybQcaa	Some useful imformation you could provide for people to help you figure this out is your ethnicity, it ranges  only alittle though depending on that, you know, if your white, black, asian, latina, or indian. Its about 105-120 lbs.<br>  <br>  but EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT! This means what might be the right weight for one person may be completely different for another person. What matters is that you feel healthy and good about yourself. Just make sure you are capable of walking, standing, and running or doing any type of physical activity, without feeling significantly more warn out or tired compared to the other girls. <br>  <br>  I havent seen your body before so its quite difficult to conclude if your fat or not. But if i was going to estimate, i'd say no, your not. you just probly have a bit more junk in your trunk than most. lol. and thats a good thing, most of the time. <br>  <br>  Guys automatically sense if a girl is attractive or not. There brain automically calculates angles, ratios, widths and more. What matters is the symetricallity of your body, especially the face. Rigid, white teeth. Your teeth is really the only type of bone in your body that can be seen externally, and is a big indicator of health. Eyes that have no trace of swelling, a yellow shade or red spots. The ratio of your curves (hips, stomach, shoulders), and guys don't care if you have a bit more weight, or if your body is larger or slightly wider, what matters is that ratio. Theres more too.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it.|`|tX40VG9Xaa	a lot of girls around our age are anorexic. dont be one of them<br>  im 14, im 5'3 and i weigh around 115 or something and i really dont care about wat i weigh. keep in mind muscle wieghs more than fat, so if ur really strong ur gonna wiegh more than someone whos weak. and just to let you know, especially when u get older, guys like curves. a loooot. so dont become a twig.<br>  and definitly dont listen to the freak who called u fat.|`|3azXcbZ4aa	Your probably going to say how should I know, but i m 11 and the average is somewhere around 70 or so, im 73.

10a75ee0424e1f57ac73550ada2b49deaa	Oh boy..oh boy..I didn′t think that this kind of questions could still arise, respect. that minds like yours still function and are put in the open on Q&A.<br>  Let me enlighten you: after as a resident you have written up 10 to 12 clinical histories in one morning , interrupted by an emergency arrival of an ectopic pregnancy in ER 3, itself interrupted by a placenta previa in ER 6 and the OBGYN dpt head is playing golf and the attending physician does not answer his cell, and the intern from 3 months is doing a Coombs test on a newborn-lets hope he does it right- after all this when the next patient comes in for a pap smear , mr. no pervert, the last thing but really the last thing you have on your mind is sex. Apart from this hospital regulations demand the presence of a female nurse during OBGYN examinations. Oh and by the way: an OBGYN is not a sex doctor; a sex doctor would probably be a psychiatrist specialized in sexual dysfunctions.|`|ziVtTtObaa	A female "sex" doctor? Are you referring to a GYN? If so she is not a "sex" doctor. A GYN specializes in the organs related to reproduction. That however is NOT a sex doctor! Doctors and nurses are professionals. We are not in this field to "hook up"! If you wish to look at ladies in a sexual way go to a strip club. We all see vagina's and penis's every day.NEVER are they viewed in a sexual way. Your attitude is demeaning to people working in the medical field.I recommend that you find another profession to consider.
IMPvzBk1aa	Just about any irregularity in your periods can occur when you are in perimenopause, since the hormone levels are unstable as production begins to change.  It will gradually lead to a total cessation of menstruation.|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	Yup....sounds like perimenopause symptoms.  The peiods  will come whenever they wish, as the hormones are no longer being produced routinely.  Evenutally, just before you quit your periods all together, you will feel like you need to sit on a cottonbale when they do come, and they come on with a vengance and very irregularly.  Sometimes the discharge looks like tar...., but then next month hemmorhage.<br>  <br>  You are considered post menopausal when you have had no period for a full year.  And since they won't give out HRT anymore, look at alternatives like Black Cohosh (herb), but that really only helps minimally.  The hot flashes come on real quick and sometimes 5-12 times a day.  Oh the joys of being a woman!!<br>  <br>  The hot flashes are the hardest for me.|`|wETQbPxGaa	it is normal, I've had the same thing for about 2 years now. sometimes I miss my period for a month then the next month bleed twice as hard. however you should make sure and see a doc

1IhJSHboaa	I like the FIRM workouts.  I've tried three of them--Fat burning cardio sculpt with resistance cords, the sclupting ball workout with the ball included, and the power yoga.  I find them to be challenging, but not overly grueling, and they work your entire body.   There are many FIRM DVD's to choose from..I just bought the Ultimate Fat Burning workout, and I also want to try to stability ball workout.  I especially like them because I can fit them into my busy schedule--they pack a lot into just 30-45 minutes!!  Great on days that I can't make it to the gym.   I've gotten very good results--last year, as a result of working out at least three days a week with a combination of going to the gym and doing my FIRM workouts, I lost 20 pounds.  My stomach has always been a problem for me, and now it's much more toned.  Good luck!!|`|Oxh13RaGaa	I love the 5 mile fat burning Leslie Sansone Walking DVD.

x73U0nUBaa	I have had the implanon in for nearly 3 years, the bleeding thing is a pain I did bleed a lot more than usual for about 8-10 days sometimes every 3 weeks then sometimes not for a few months so you always have to be prepared, but at least I don't have to worry about forgetting to take the pill. When I got it done I had a really big bruise on the top of my arm but now you can't even see where it has been inserted.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	I have the Paraguard IUD.  I've never had kids but have been dilated.  The doctor warned me that it may hurt.  She inserted it during a heavier day of my period because you are more dilated.  It was not comfortable but it did not hurt.  I had some cramping that Motrin took care of.  My sister had an IUD put in after having 2 children and she said hers hurt like hell.  That tells you everyone is different.  The possible pain on insertion is why they try to discourage those who have not had a baby from getting it.  I just wish I had gotten it earlier in my life.  I say go for the IUD  and plan on some pain maybe even take some motrin before you go in.  You'll be fine.|`|AA12316174	I had an IUD and the reason why you have to have a child is because after you have a child your uterus is slightly larger and it will hold  the IUD. Your risk is Higher for expulsion and perforation which can cause infertility. That is why it is recommended you have at least 1 child. The IUD is more effective that the pill because their is no chance or error but ALL hormonal methods are as effective as the next as long as they are taken as directed|`|86g1v9hWaa	I used to ask my Gyno if Mirena IUD is ok for me if i do not have any children. She said its most suitable for women who have at least 1 child. <br>  <br>  I like to get implanon implanted as well but some horror reviews like hair loss, non strop period, extra facial hair makes me worried. <br>  <br>  I tried patch before, its alright but you have to change it every week, it could be itchy and sticky on your skin.<br>  <br>  I would like to try Nuvaring too.. leave it in there for  3 weeks, out for 1 week..but some people get pregnant on nuvarings<br>  <br>  I dont like to take pills or depo shot.. I guess Mirena IUD could be best if you can try to convince your gyno that u dont plan to have kids in next 4-5 years. <br>  <br>  or best way for u is..tell ur bf or husband to use condom, easy, and u dont have to take hormone to mess up ur period cycle. My bf hates to use condom too, we are going to get engaged soon so he wants me to go on pills..now im looking for the right contraceptive method too. Good luck! ..

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|8Z7bCyQOaa	some fast easy recpies are at this site. and also other site links too. check it out<br>  www.healthisgreat.webs.com
