AA11932246	'Organic' foods are a fraud used to make those who are ignorant but have money pay more for their food (they aren't any better than conventionally grown foods despite costing more).<br>  <br>  A stimulus bill is unlikely to do anything to help that sector of the economy although it should really be used to put the 'organic' foods movement out of existence (but that won't happen either, there's just too much money being made from that fraud).<br>  <br>  In terms of whether the prices of 'organic' foods can be lowered, that's very unlikely to happen due to the irrational ban on use of modern technology (synthetic fertiliser and pesticides are some of the most important agricultural technologies, banning most uses of them (the bans the 'organic' movement actually imposes tend to be very inconsistent) is going to hurt your yields in a big way) in the 'organic' farming movement resulting in lower yields and higher manual labour required (remember that progress in civilisation occurred because farmers became unemployed).|`|FxWppY7Baa	Bestonnet_00 obvously knows very little about organic agriculture. This person seem to think there is not modern technology used on these farms. While no GMO's or synthetic pesticides may be used tractors, harvesters, high tech irrigation systems, high tunnels and green houses are all used. A lot of cutting edge agricultural practises are coming from organic farms world wide.<br>  <br>  Okay how will the stimulus package effect organic agriculture? Not much. I believe some money did go towards research but there is nothing to bring prices down.<br>  <br>  one big reason for higher prices (and if you look at the whole, not processed foods you find a lot are now the same price as conventional if not a bit lower) is there is a greater demand for organic food than what is beiong produced. Simple Supply and demand. As more farms go organic the prices will drop some. But know if they drop too much than we will have the problem of too many farmers leaving the farm because they cannot make enough money to pay bills/loans and survive, much less thrive. <br>  <br>  We Americans do have cheap food but we really get what we pay for the food is cheap and very low quality and causing a whole host of health problems such as diabetes, obesity, cancers, etc.. So is it worth it to have all the cheap Doritos and Cheese puffs only to be faced with millions in medical bills later? Or is it better to pay a bit more for healthy foods now and not end up dying in the hospital in 20 years?<br>  <br>  I find it utterly absurd that Americans complain about food prices and than go out and spend thousands on useless crap like x-boxes, cell phones, cosmetics, designer clothing, etc.. All luxuries we can live without but feel we cannot

Right now all the people who did the "smoking won't kill you, it isn't that bad" ads are all working for the climate ads. It's their job to confuse. <br>  <br>  And people are easily confused because they don't know what to look for (more than just temperature, extreme precipitation events too, etc etc). Average temperature increases that cover the whole world are going up. That might not be the case where you are, and it won't be as fast of a rise unless you are in the Arctic. Temperatures in the Arctic are rising fastest. Most people don't live there, so we only hear occasional reports of sea ice and polar bears. It's easy to ignore otherwise. <br>  <br>  99.9% of climate researchers "believe" in global warming. Once you've looked at the data, it's hard to argue with fact.

Another interesting report to read was done by an economist: Stern report. He says that it's easier to pay for mitigation now, than it will be in ten years. And the longer we wait, the more it will be. He gives numbers in percentages of GNP. Seriously.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure why American media is so messed up on this really.

The ice is not melting.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	An ice cube melting in a glass of water does not cause the water level to change, up or down appreciably. It is not pack ice or floating icebergs involved in sea rise or fall.<br>  <br>  When the oceans evaporate to provide water for rain or snow, that causes the ocean levels to drop. When the rain runs back to the oceans the ocean levels rise. If the water is snow and stays in glaciers, oceans can remain low for thousands of years.<br>  <br>  Right now we are seeing more snowfall going onto Antarctica and Greenland because the oceans are producing more water vapor. But for thousands of years the trend had been for the oceans to rise. The low point came early in the last great ice age. We are seeing more water returning to the oceans, so that ocean levels are not yet declining. But the evaporation is mostly keeping up with melting.<br>  <br>  With a few more degrees rise in temperature we would still see more evaporation, but more water running back to the oceans. At some point the rising temperature melting would likely outdistance the rising evaporation.<br>  <br>  I say likely, because we could go into a major ice age before that happens. <br>  <br>  Eventually if warming continues, we will go into an ice age that will return a  lot of the ocean water back onto the northern land mass as glaciers. Remeber though that it takes a lot of heat to evaporate those oceans, send that water onto the land as ice.|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	I don't think it is going to expand anywhere near 1 percent.   It is as the previous answer said, the most dense at just above freezing.  When forming a crystal latice, it takes up more space and therefore decreases in density.  It is an unusual substance in that regard.  <br>  <br>  Much of the recent or predicted rise in sea level is due to explansion of warming water.  This is not to say that sea levels don't naturally move significantly up and down.

But then as water gets hotter say approaching body temperature it again expands in physical volume, not as drastic as ice but still a greater volume than cold water. So they are saying even a small volume increase of that water might raise sea levels somewhat. Why have we not seen this, who knows it might just be that the amount of Co2 released from solution as the water warms compensates for the lack of volume increase they expected but have not found.|`|aWTo9K22aa	Ocean expansion is part of it. Meltwater runoff from Greenland's incredibly enormous glaciers (look at a map of the world, look at the size of Greenland, and realize that the ice there is several KILOMETERS thick) is the main issue. Most of Antarctica (though not all) is safely locked into a deep freeze and will be fine no matter what we do, but there is enough ice on Greenland alone to raise sea levels by as much as 30 feet. It has happened before and it could happen again. <br>  <br>  And you are right, floating icebergs, such as what makes up the bulk of the North Pole, will not affect sea level rise. |`|2hE5Dvnyaa	The simple answer is that the land base glaciers break off and slide into the water and add volume.<br>  Take one bucket of ice and add it to a bucket of water.  you get the idea?<br>  Don't worry though GW is BS!|`|bDKcqNSqaa	In its 2001 assessment of global warming, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPECAC) projected that global mean sea level is expected to rise between 9 and 88 centimeters by 2100, with a 'best estimate' of 50 centimeters. A warmer world will have a higher sea level because as the land and lower atmosphere of the world warm, heat is transferred into the oceans. When materials are heated they expand (thermal expansion). So the heat that is transferred causes sea water to expand, which then results in a rise in sea level. |`|G59cfwwIaa	A lot of glaciers are not floating in the water though.

Other than a laboratory, there's been no real life examples of the greenhouse effect, the co2 they stress over from WW2 to the 70's obviously didn't cause problems other than the pollution itself..since temperatures were going down the entire 30 year period. There are no polar bears drowning, the glaciers aren't shrinking, the supposed scientists have either lied or been tied to some political pay offs, and even their god on earth Al Gore that many turn to is only "trading" carbon...he's doing nothing to reduce or eliminate it.<br>  Global warming is a made up problem with little support so people can get rich off it. Al Gore was doing just fine being the middle man, trading carbon offsets.....and the limit was based on ? nothing scientific......and need we remind people that Al Gore is a politician , not a scientist ?<br>  For the people with no meaning to their lives, deal with the real problems.<br>  After all, look at the lives your interferring with, the food shortages your corn based fuel has caused, not to mention the mandated use causing boat engines to be destroyed and bus engines to clog in cold regions. Look at the added cost you've added to the poor, and to people's cost of living.<br>  Just where do you get off causing so much pain, suffering and strife among the human race for a made up problem we are powerless to do anything about.<br>  Man can't inflict the power of say Mount Pinotubo when it erupted, yet the world wide temps only went down a few degrees while the sulfer dioxide worked its way out of the atmosphere. Not to mention that the damage to the ozone repaired itself without mans help.
FP1HX1VJaa	"In 2006, Americans drank about 167 bottles of water each but only recycled an average of 23 percent. That leaves 38 billion water bottles in landfills.<br>  Bottled water costs between $1 and $4 per gallon, and 90 percent of the cost is in the bottle, lid and label.<br>  According to the Beverage Marketing Corp, the average American consumed 1.6 gallons of bottled water in 1976. In 2006 that number jumped to 28.3 gallons.<br>  It takes over 1.5 million barrels of oil to manufacture a year’s supply of bottled water. That’s enough oil to fuel 100,000 cars.<br>  Eight out of 10 plastic water bottles become landfill waste.<br>  In 2007 we spent $16 billion on bottled water. That’s more than we spent on iPods or movie tickets.<br>  Plastic bottles take 700 years before they begin to decompose in a landfill.<br>  If everyone in NYC gave up water bottles for one week, they would save 24 million bottles from being landfilled. One month on the same plan would save 112 million bottles, and one year would save 1.328 billion bottles from going into the landfill."<br>  <br>  "People in the U.S. throw away 2.5 million plastic bottles an hour.   Plastic is one of the most disposable materials in U.S. culture.  We throw away our milk bottles, soda bottles, water bottles, trash bags, grocery bags, product packaging, and more every day without giving it a second thought.  Plastic makes up much of the streetside litter found in cities and throughout the countryside, and it’s rapidly filling up our landfills as well.<br>  <br>  Making new plastic requires significant amounts of fossil fuels.   Studies suggest that between 7% and 8% of the world’s fossil fuels are used in producing new plastics.  This doesn’t sound like a great amount, but it accounts for millions of tons of fuels per year.  Recycling could preserve these fuels—even reuse them in other markets.<br>  <br>  Plastic is easy to recycle - although few people do it.   All plastic can be recycled.  But it’s not being recycled as much as it should be.  Some studies show that only 10% of plastic bottles created are recycled, leaving that extra 90% to take up space in landfills and killing ocean life.<br>  <br>  Plastic bottles take up space in landfills.   Our country’s landfills are closing at a rate of around two per day.  The landfill-space crisis is especially problematic in cities, where inner-city trash dumps are often filled to capacity, and surrounding communities are unwilling to allow new landfills to come to their neighborhoods.  Many coastal cities use the ocean as a dumping ground, resulting in depleted fish stock, polluted beaches, and other health issues for the inhabitants.  Plastic bottles make up approximately 11% of the contents of landfills.<br>  <br>  Incinerating plastic contributes to greenhouse gases.   To save space at landfills, plastics are often burned in incinerators.  When this is done, chemicals, petroleum, and fossil fuels used in the manufacturing process are released into the atmosphere, adding to greenhouse gas emissions. <br>  <br>  Plastic in the oceans is responsible for the deaths of millions of sea animals.   Plastic bottles floating on the surface of the oceans can look like food to larger sea life—often with fatal consequences.  In addition, fish, sea birds, and other ocean creatures often get caught in plastic rings that strangle them or constrict their throats so that they cannot swallow."<br>  <br>  Just SOME of the facts. :)|`|UzZyxTtEaa	Look up at the monstrous essay.

SYZQZGesaa	Coal - it produces more raw weight of the same pollutants as gasoline while adding other things such as mercury and arsenic.|`|WewCtMpzaa	Most would say coal, because they see pictures of18th century industrial plants with black clouds pouring out. Most coal these days gets refined during the bunring, to sock out SOX, and NOX. Only trace amounts of those two offenders and mercury get out. Even at 100%, you can hardly tell the plant is burning their fuel. To make it more comfounding, not all coal is the same. Most eastern types coal is pretty clean, then western fuels from Wyoming are probably the next best coal. Most other coal, or lignite is pretty high in SOX.    I would say diesel  2, or red diesel is probably the nastiest. That's part of the reason it's illegal to use in population centers, and only an ag fuel.    Most of our haze is being caused by auto, and manufacturing. The big ships that transports all our junk from China and India is bunker fuel, or waste oil.

Probably a peak, if the usual relationship between sunspot activity and climate follows.<br>  <br>      Being a warmist means being very selective about what data you consider, and imagining that short term trends will continue into long term.

As humans who generally live to <100yrs of age we are simply unable to comprend the lifespan of our planet.  With regard to the earth reaching it's warmest peak in 1999, consider the fact that the sun, in 500 billion years* time (arguably when humans won't even be around as we will have reached our carrying capacity well before then) it will turn into a red dwarf and the temperature of our lovely blue and green planet will be so hot that it will liquify and turn a nice golden orange flecked with hues of red :)  I would imagine that when this happens it would without a doubt have to signal the hottest period of our earth!<br>  <br>  * give or take a few billion years ;-)|`|FZmu6Pm9aa	1998 is the warmest year on record according to most sources, largely due to a very active El Nino. Warming didn't stop there but that remains the warmest year unless you listen to Jim Hansen, the godfather of global warming at NASA GISS. Obviously he has a vested interest in warming since he's been the main US proponent of AGW.<br>  <br>  It's proven easy to tamper with surface temp records, most US sites that measure surface temp are too close to external heat sources such as pavement, A/C units or buildings. GISS and Hansen claims to account for this in overall temp readings but that's obviously not the case and he will not provide the raw data showing his adjustment. A less-biased data set is from satellites measuring the temp of our atmosphere. Oddly enough, though the surface stations still manage to claim it's been warming, satellite data shows a trend of cooling since 2003, at the rate of 3.6 degrees Celsius/century, far greater than the rate of warming which has apparently at least paused.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way. All of the CO2 in our atmosphere (.04% or 381 parts per million) causes about 9% or so of the total global warming of 33 degrees celsius Without that warming we'd be on a frozen iceball. 9% of 33 is about 3C, yet the IPCC warns us in hysterical terms that a slight increase in that CO2 will cause warming at the rate of up to 8 degrees celsius. None of their predictions have come true and they can't come true because CO2 remains a weak trace gas in our atmosphere and cannot cause warming on that scale. So they invented a boogeyman in the form of a multiplier effect. If such an effect existed, an average summer would lead to runaway and unstoppable global warming until we couldn't live here. Has that happened? No, and an increase of another 1 or 2 C wouldn't cause it either.<br>  <br>  Sunlight hits the Earth and warms it, some of that heat goes into the atmosphere and most would escape back into space if not for greenhouse gases and water vapor. But nearly all of the infrared that CO2 can interact with is already being 'blocked' this way, so any increase would have a tiny effect, blocking that heat slightly lower in our atmosphere than before. <br>  <br>  To mix metaphors and fables, Chicken Little has no clothes, AGW is bunk and we're much more likely to see a return to glaciation, either in a Little Ice Age or a return to the real thing.|`|z4V9kdR8aa	There is no such statement.|`|d4kxwVD7aa	I think you're watching Fox news a little too much.
