20070820074758AAGX3ci	Social Science;Sociology	Spesso diciamo che l'amicizia non esiste, che gli altri ci fregano, che i parenti tutti serpenti,che fare bene	non conviene ecc.   Cioè, vediamo negli altri malizia, cattiveria, gelosia e invidia ,ecc: io stessa sono pessimista.   Ma, se tutti diciamo e tutti dicono la stessa cosa degli altri, vuol dire che siamo tutti cattivi invidiosi ecc,.    ci accorgiamo  subito della cattiveria subita    e quando siamo noi a fare il male non ce ne accorgiamo o ci autogiustifichiamo.che ne dite? per me è un problema ,perchè penso di non essere cattiva ma gli altri non mi dimostrano per nulla atti di amicizia.

20090128211924AAPe2Ef	Social Science;Psychology	Doesn't this disprove the existence of an afterlife?	Ketamine has been used 100's of times by scientists to simulate near-death experiences. Ketamine can produce all the features of the near-death experience, including travel through a dark tunnel into light, the conviction that one is dead, telepathic communion with God, visions, out-of-body experiences and mystical states. If near-death-experiences can be reproduced by a drug, thereby giving a false glimpse into the afterlife for some, then aren't real near-death experiences the same? Thus, isn't the whole idea of an afterlife produced by a drug that signals the brain to cause hallucinations and visions that are taken out of the person's nonconscious mind (which can include the deeply-ingrained relgions views of each particular person)?

20070509171135AARWpsN	Social Science;Psychology	Does anyone ever wake up in the middle of the night confused?	I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, say 3-5 in the morning depending on when I go to sleep, very confused.  It's usually because I'm waking up in the middle of a dream, but it's very difficult for me to slip back into reality.  Sometimes I'll lay asleep thinking in the same frame of mind that I was in the dream, and it's just really weird stuff.    It's very hard to put an example into words because the dreams I wake up from like this are very different than reality, but one time I was counting these dimensionless objects (I'm usually performing some kind of work or task) and moving them somewhere in front of me and when I woke up I was kind of just trying to continue doing what I was doing and wondering why I'm doing it and it takes a few minutes for me to separate myself from my dream into reality.  It's just a really strange feeling and I always end up losing about a half hour of sleep when this happens, once or twice a week.  Any ideas?

I have recently found and was looking over some old documents and journals I have somehow kept since I moved out of my parents house...      I was reading a few poems and stories, and I was absolutely sure it wasn't me who wrote them - I mean... I thought they were so good... I thought I had printed them out from somewhere (because I used to keep collections of stuff). However, I looked and surely enough... they were signed by me...      I sort of forgot how aware I used to be... these were from my teens... I haven't written anything in a long time... and I don't think anything I try now will be as good... I'm no longer sensitive, romantic, or even as aware as I used to be...      so I tried... and for the life of me I couldn't go back... I ask myself when did I get sucked into this "practical" real-world crap? Have you ever had a moment like this? Do people just grow out of the "soul" part of them?

I've recently run into someone on another political chat board who claims that Bill Gates insults his money by giving big chunks of it to charity.      His argument is not that charity is a bad thing, but rather capital has its own will, like human beings, and that using it for any other purpose than financial investment is an insult to capital itself.      Just one of the more possibly lunatic justifications for the 'free' market I've ever heard. Anyone ready to defend this concept?

I let the candle burn out completely and checked it before i left the house.        recently i've been thinking about my health a lot.      I got back home, and the candle was out and done, like gone.  i layed on my bed for a while and saw out of the corner of my eye a flicker of light, i went over to the candle and it was burning again, but just the wick, there was no "candle" left to it.  It freaked me out a lot.  and the fire was traveling up the glass holder.  the freaky thing is that on the side of the glass there is a chinese symbol for health.  i blew it out, and slid the glass a bit to make sure it wasnt burning the desk under it and the entire thing split down the middle right through the symbol.      thoughts?

I have a fixed budget for a new car and have decided to buy a car that gets 20 miles per gallon, and has a performance level of 60 (maximum speed) at which a turntable can play Mozart's first symphony without skipping. A sales person asked about my attitude towards the car with different combinations of mpg and ms. I would prefer a car with  19mpgs and 64 ms to the tentative choice but would prefer his tentative choice to a car with 19 mpg and 62 ms.  Suppose that the costs of an additional mpg is six times the cost of an additional unit of ms.      Does my tentative choice (20 mpg and 60 ms) maximize my utility subject to his auto budget? If not should he choose an auto with more or fewer mpg?

Personnellement, je trouve les "roles" que la société tente d'imposer en fonction du sexe aussi réducteur dans un cas que dans l'autre. Certes, il est probablement plus confortable d'etre dans la peau d'un homme que d'une femme, vu les belles valeurs machistes de la société dans laquelle nous vivons.   Mais si les nanas refusent de plus en plus souvent ces clichés à travers divers variantes de féminisme, ca ne semble pas être le cas des mecs... La fille s'est arrêtée de préparer la tambouille dans la caverne, mais le garcon continue d'aller chasser le mammouth.   Donc ma question, messieurs, c'est : est-ce qu'il n'y a pas des moments ou vous en avez marre de devoir assumer tous ces clichés réducteurs de virilité, de force, de réussite professionelle, bref tout ce baratin macho, cette idée (profondément débile à mon humble avis) que sinon vous n'êtes pas un "vrai mec" (avec tous les sous entendus homophobes que cela comporte) ?

I'm not sure if there are people who want to get hypnotized for the same reason as I would, but anyway, the only reason why I want to get hypnotized is to increase my acting ability by taking my sister's acting ability. She's a really great actress, but she doesn't want to be an actress and I do, though I don't act as good as her. I got her full permission, she doesn't care, she's just going to waste her talent anyway. That's why I want to do it. Will it work?

Tous les musiciens, tous les philosophes, sculpteurs et même écrivains. On objecte que les femmes n'ont pas du développer leur génie, puisqu' oppressées. Pourtant Mozart composait à 5 ans, les peintures rupestres sont masculines, et personne n'a jamais empêché une telle de peindre ou broder. Alors? Est-ce une conformation du cerveau relative au sexe?

There's alsothese cryptic messages which are hidden that freak me out. Backmasking is another thing that freaks me out. just listening to a voice speaking backwards sends a chill down my spine, i start to plug my ears.

20070619051514AAGCsLp	Social Science;Psychology	Terrified of flying...?	I used to really look forward to flying until I worked for an airline. I didn't work in an airport, just as a reservations agent at a call center. I flew after 9/11 just as always, no real anxiety. Nothing bad happened in air travel in the one year I worked at this airline, but ever since then I have been insanely terrified to fly. No joke. I have horrible nightmares that I am at an airport watching a loved ones plane take off and all of the sudden it plunges to the ground exploding. It's so real, the sound, feeling, everything. I wake up shaking and crying. Last year I was supposed to fly with my grandmother and these dreams actually brought me to cancel our non refundable tickets and drive cross country. I don't know what could have brought this on, but I know it developed while working at the airline. I find myself on the internet looking up past crashes & reading all about it. It's a little obsessive and unhealthy. I need some help figuring this out.
