So when he took me for study I chatted to him, and it turned out that he was just so tender-hearted, music oriented like me and a creative man. And bashful. I fell more deeply for him and his beautiful eyes and smile. I can only think of him and how he must be onto me and my blushing face everytime he looks at me. It drives me insane!    I know that I couldn't have him as my boyfriend (and when that happens in my daydreams I marry him fast because I never want to let him go), that he could never want me and it would be wrong because he's eleven years older... But I can't face the fact that I'll have to leave his presence next year for Uni, though he lives in the same city and I just might see him once.

20090219231158AAzvNJC	Health;Other - Health	Not sure when my drug test is but...please, I need your help!?	I applied to Home Depot in January, and they have finally called me last week on sunday (Feb. 15th).       However, I smoked on Friday night. We passed around 2 blunts.   I am not a heavy smoker. I've smoked a couple times before around the fall of 2006, then I smoked once in October 2008, which was about 4 months ago.      I've been drinking 2 bottles of water, and probably that's not enough,   but i'm also going to start exercising.   I'm 5'0 about 125lbs. i'm kinda round, but not so chubby.         So I have a couple questions:            1. What method does Home Depot (or other places) use for drug testing?   I think it's urine, but just wanted to ask around.         2. Do you have to show some type of Identification when you buy a home drug testing kit? or can you just put it in your basket and buy it like any other items? or by selfchecks?            3. I've been researching about how far back a urine test can detect drugs, in my case weed. If i'm not mistaken..      Urine: 2 weeks to 1 month   Oral: a couple days ~ 1 or 2 weeks   Blood: 2 weeks to a couple months   Hair: a couple months ~ a year      correct me if i'm wrong please.   if anyone has an accurate or correct information,   please tell me.                     I'm done doing drugs.   I should be in trouble, but I believe this is a chance and an opportunity for myself to get my mind straight and stop.   Even if I've only done so little of it,   i still did it and i can't change that.   I'm through with it.         DRUG FREE   IS THE WAY TO BE.

20090219232016AASsd2U	Health;Mental Health	My mood is so unstable, I'm so fed up with this!?	I was diagnosed with major depression in November 2007.  It was very severe, I almost had to be hospitalized, and I was planning a suicide attempt that no one, not even my doctors, know about.  I went to a psychiatrist and a therapist, I was given antidepressants, and after a good three or so months it let up just enough for me to be able to function, but I was still depressed every day.  In August, I felt abnormally happy, energetic, almost like I was high all the time...I was enev in two car wrecks within 30 days of each other because I couldn't control myself behind the wheel.  My docs knew about this but did almost nothing, my pdoc insisted I was just sleep-deprived because I could only sleep six hours, and I would feel fine.  In December 2008, I got incredibly depressed again, and it's been like that ever since.      My therapist half-believes I have bipolar disorder.  My pdoc has not even brought it up.  I know, I'm almost completely sure, that I am.  I do not experience regular "prozac-nation" depression.  It is so much more severe.  The emotional pain is literally crippling, I cannot even get out of bed for days when I have another episode.  I've shared all this with my doctor, and she still keeps me on the damn Lexapro.  And my mood changes drastically during the day, too.  For example, this morning I was very energetic, determined, almost happy, and as the day continued, I got a little depressed, and a little more, and now I just don't know what to do, I feel awful.  And a big problem is that I just can't switch docs because I live in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere, and the next nearest town of equal or larger size is about two hours away.  :(  I'm sick of this.

20090219231904AAWssTx	Health;Dental	How long can a cavity be left untreated?	I never had a cavity during the vast majority of my childhood, but my wisdom teeth came in a bit early. one of them, I could not reach with a tooth brush. So, it developed the only cavity I have ever had, and it is a good sized one. Thing is, I have had this cavity for 6 or seven years now, and I can now reach it with a brush. It is clear it never got to the root of the tooth, so I never really worried about it. My girlfriend is convinced I should get this treated right away though. I admit I have not seen a dentist since high school, but I believe they are likely to want to remove this somewhat impacted tooth rather than just fill the cavity... May want to get the two wisdom teeth that came up almost sideways as well while they are at it, but they really do not bother me at all.

She has an Orthodox Jewish family who are pretty well off, and said her parents would never be happy with her having a child with me, I’m not Jewish and we’re not married and I’m not “up” to their standards anyway. She’s afraid to even tell them about the pregnancy even though she’s close to her family. She says she will have an abortion in a few days without even telling her family. I don’t know what to say. I really don’t want to have my entire life thrown away because of this, but I do not want her to get an abortion. What should I do? How should I support her?      She won't consider adoption at all, i already brought that idea up to her, she said she won’t go through the hassle of pregnancy just to give her baby over to strangers

When the condom was removed and back to oral it went hard again but as soon as the condom went on i went soft again.

I read up the symptoms for Pneumonia because my doctor said I might have it and I saw that one of the symptoms was 'chest wall pain that gets worse when you breath deeply or cough' and I know that my chest starts hurting worse when I breath deeply or cough. I saw that besides that confusion I only didn't have like 2 of the symptoms listed. I had an X-Ray done and my doctor said that I didn't have Pneumonia, but I'm still curious what a chest wall is. Any doctors out there that could answer this question?      And maybe this question too: I've had a cough for 3 weeks, that's the longest I've been sick in my life. I'm an abnormally fast healer so the longest I've ever been sick before this for more than a day.

20090220002045AAWQOVH	Health;Mental Health	What could I have? Sleeping disorder?	Okay, don't say go see a doctor. I have a neurologist and I come in for a check-up every month. Which is more often than most people that come in.      Anyways, I'm just a teenager. Which makes it even more abnormal. I have hypersomnia long sleep, or so my neurologist says. He's put me on multiple medications, and none of it works. We at one point upped my dosage to 20mg of stimulants which would help for maybe an hour or two, but then it'd fade off. It was the best reaction we got but it put my resting heart rate into the 100s and I lost 5lbs in a month. (I'm a girl who's very athletic, so I'm already skinny with hardly any fat so that was scary).       Now I'm on Provigil and my other stuff (10mg) and the Provigil is at 100mg. I'm taking both in the morning and zero reaction.       My neurologist says he wants to send me to Stanford medical since they have the highest sleep lab in the US apparently. He says he's tried everything in his power. I've had a sleep study done, and we've tried every medicine he can give to me. Nothing works! He would think I'm faking this if it weren't for the fact that the sleep study proved it.       Sometimes when I take my medicine I feel MORE tired. My insomnia is fading because I'm so tired during the day. I don't know what to do and I can see my mom is getting stress from it. I don't want to go to Stanford since it sounds expensive, but this is the first case like this that my neurologist has had, and even the pharmacist is a little shocked that the dosages of medications aren't working.       Anyone know or have a guess??

First I tried Stridex and that didn't work. Then I started using Proactiv and that worked for me, but not 100%. I tried other products, such is Clean and Clear Ultra and that gave me a lot of the little blemishes on my forehead, so I went back to Proactiv and my forehead cleared up. I used that for a couple of years but I still wanted to get 100% clear skin, so I tried things like Skintactix, which worked for a couple weeks. Then, I tried Murad, which made me break out a lot. I then recently went back to Proactive again, my forehead cleared up, but now I have so many breakouts around my jawline. Ughhhh :(

I proposed her 8-9 months back and she said NO. I am fine with this and we are still friends and we work together. We respect each other and we have nothing else in our minds except friendship. But after that, I have developed obsessive thinking about everything related with her. I analyze each and every single thing which happened between us like speaking, writing, working, walking etc. I am sick of thinking too much now. I am not expecting anything with her. And my over-analysing and excessive thinking is killing me. At the moment, every single person at my workplace likes me and I am friends with everyone and I sincerely mean EVERYONE. But I don't want to think excessively and obsessively about anything related to this girl anymore. Can you suggest me what can I do? Thanks. I need serious help to stop thinking. I am already going to a psychiatrist and my thinking has come down a lot than before but I want to improve more.

20090219235615AAl9tqU	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Do I have cold sores or am I just being paranoid?	My girlfriend gets cold sores around her mouth and occasionally and I have never had them. I am always careful not to kiss her or share food when a sore is present.       Then one time she said she felt like she was getting a cold sore so she put abreva on. Two days later there was no sore and so I assumed it was safe to kiss her. A little more than a week later I noticed a small little dot on my upper lip.      I put abreva on it just in case it was a cold sore coming on and continued to apply it throughout the day. At the end of the day the dot would actually sting when I put abreva on it. The next day it was gone completely. A week later I felt my lips itching and burning so I again put abreva on it. It feels like there is a zit on the edge of the lip.       I know the HSV virus can transmit through shedding but I didn't realize that it can still be contagious if no sore was present. My girl didn't have a sore and she applied abreva for two days before I kissed her.       Now I'm worried that I might have cold sores for the rest of my life. I guess I feel ashamed if I have them even though they say 90% of the population will get them in their lifetime.       I know they are common because the abreva is always next to the chapstick. I guess someone can say worrying about a cold sore is about as silly as having chapped lips. I don't know. I'm just bumbed out if I have them. Any advice, or answers are appreciated. Thanks in advance everyone.

20070507042946AAVCzwa	Health;Diet & Fitness	Doing 30 minutes cardio with Nordic Track ski walker and Weight Training in between.?	Greetings fitness buffs. I am on a steady road to loosing a hundred pounds. For the last two months I've being doing 30 minutes of cardio workouts on my Nordic Track ski excerciser (which involves both lower and upper body) daily at least 5 days  a week. I recently joined a gym. One day I work out upper body, the next I do lower. I find myself too sore to do the Nordic Track for at least 2 days after weight training. I start to cramp up. So I do 45 minuites of brisk walking instead. My goal is to gain a 'moderate ammount' of muscle mass to tone and loose weight.  Will weight training only twice a week along with cardio on off days still provide any benefit? I want to do something I will stick with. I see myself burning out if I work out the same muscle groups 3 days a week with weight training. Any thoughts?

20070731225114AAsDMGv	Health;Men's Health	Premature ejaculation. Should I panic :(?	I have been sexually active since 23, I'm 26. I probably had sex about 40 times. Most of these were casual relationships or one night stands and were performed after heavy drinking. I used a condom on ALL the encounters. I used to come after about 5-10 minutes, which I think is normal. But if I had been drinking heavily I could go on without achieving orgasm - I could last 40minutes or more. Now I have found someone I love and we had our first encounter a few days ago. I lasted 10sec. We did it on two other occasions and I lasted less than a minute each tme. This time I used no condom.       1. Am I coming early because there's no condom and its more sensitive.   2. Is the absence of alcohol the cause. Someone said alcohol makes you last   3. Am I just anxious? Lack of 'dutch courage' since I'm doing it sober for the first time?    4. What's my best chance. My ego, self esteem have dropped. Am I 'useless'    5.

The Give Blood people are coming to my area in the next few weeks, and as we only turned 17 a few months ago, my friends and I decided we would all go down and do it together to help some people.      My problem is that the form asks if you've had vacinnations within eight weeks. I haven't, but I would need to have some very soon, and I'm wondering does it work both ways ie) am I not allowed to have vaccinations within a certain period of giving blood?      Also the form asks you about foreign travel. The reason I'm getting these vaccinations is because this summer I'm spending a month in Vietnam. Does that mean I'll never be allowed to give blood again?
20090203114034AAw8qWN	Health;Dental	Help, pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee?	I just finished my 124k novel; I'm 14, and I need a good title for it. The basic idea is a girl goes to live with her dad, her boyfriend died a few years back, he is still in her life as a ghost; the girl meets a guy that has amazing features, (bronze hair turquoise eyes) so on. This guy has the same exac features as her dead bf, and she can't tell then apart but she thinks her dead ex might of taken over her new lover's body. It's almost like a... "love triangle" in a way I guess you could say. I really want a unique one- word title for my YA romance/drama novel. I've tried so many names for the characters on for size and t seems like not one if them are perfect enough. Same with the title. Tv cover is already designed; my best friend whom I love like a sister has drawn the perfect cover; her being an artist. Two hands intertwined but coming  undone and a red/black rose slippig from them. The first name I tried on fir size was forever; that didn't do. Then, forever, I still didn't do. Then always&forever and i'm still just not sure.   Also, names for my characters:   Addison-marie Smith was the first, and I quickly grew tired of it.    Now it's Abigail "Abby" Caroline Sinewy and I'm still just not sure. She's A clumsy girl; paranoid; gorgeous but doesn't think she is. Pale ivory skin, green eyes and chocolate brown hair. About 5'4, 110 LB, bites her fingernails when she's nervous.   And for my guys,:   (alive) Brad tommy Slagle. I'm growing tired if it.   John Paul Collin   (dead) Davie Edward osbourne   Please help. It seems like nothing is just right.    "Addie & Brad" negative.    "John & Abby" not so sure.    I need names that will blend well together.   I would also love a one-word unique title.    *sorry about the miss punctuation and capitalzaion. I'm on my itouch and it's getting on my nerve. And, sorry about how long it is. As an author, you can never keep stuff short :)    Thanks in advance,   Madison

What I know about the U.S. Health Care system could fit into a thimble. When my son was born I was living abroad so I pretty much only have experience with private medicine. I have Insurance under United Health Care and I took my son to a pediatrician yesterday. The Co-Pay is only $20.00 and nothing was precribed or anything like that. But they did give my boy a few shots that he was missing (Chicken Pox, Hepatitis A and another..).

20081009111749AA2ErsX	Health;Dental	Does TMJ disorder fully heal after splint therapy? What is your experience with splints?	I am undergoing braces treatment for readjusting my bite...this is actually the second time for me to have braces, the first set I got off three years ago, but my bite was not fully balanced horizontally, as I had a trapped tooth which, in their effort to pull down, ended up knocking my teeth off balance. This in turn, made my bite funky which started my jaw problems. So when I got the braces off the first time, they were fairly balanced, but off enough to where now my jaw locks all the time on the one side, and I am forced to chew mostly on the right. Right now, the orthodontist is trying to readjust my teeth somewhat, and he's been trying to get my jaw to shift forward to a no-popping position, but thus far, there's been no real improvement, so I may have to go into a splint. Has anyone on here had similar problems, and used a splint for treatment? And also, with having the problems of this severity, does it ever fully heal, or at least heal 90%? Your input is appreciated...

I am a 14 year old girl, 4'11", and weighing at 120 pounds with a 32 inch waist.      For my workout plan, I am going to be doing 15 minutes of jump roping, and increase it to 30 min. after I'm use to 15 minutes. I'll also do 50 crunches a day.      For my diet, I'll mostly eat things like fruits, veggies, brown rice, and things of that sort. And for dinner, I'll usually eat what my family eats only in smaller portions. Some nights I might just eat brown rice with other things.      Does all this sound good? Or does it need work? And can I lose 10-15 lbs. before Aug. 16th if I start now? And is 5-6 inches off the waist by then possible, too?      Much thanks! :)

20080711210145AASMVOH	Health;Women's Health	My doctor said I get hemoglobin levels of 33-53 during my period. How do I convert this or w/e?	Hello! =]      I found this website:  http://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/ar...  and it lists hemoglobin levels like this:      Newborns: 17-22 gm/dl   One week of age: 15-20 gm/dl   One month of age: 11-15gm/dl   Children: 11-13 gm/dl   Adult males: 14-18 gm/dl   Adult women: 12-16 gm/dl   Men after middle age: 12.4-14.9 gm/dl   Women after middle age: 11.7-13.8 gm/dl      When my doctor explained my hemoglobin levels to me he used large numbers. He had been monitoring me for a while and noticed I fall severely anemic during my period. He said I drop down to a hemoglobin level of 33-53. Usually I need transfusions when they fall below 80. He said the normal hemoglobin levels for my age would be around 120.      I'm on different pills to help out with my hormone imbalance but all the websites I visit talk in small numbers. So how do I convert it? Do I put a dot in the middle? For example, 33 becomes 3.3? Or what?
20080711231527AAek9CI	Health;Diet & Fitness	Unable to eat more than 800 calories per day?	I was on a diet for about a month and lost 20 pounds (to 5'4 and 103 lbs). I realized how unhealthy my diet was getting after a week of eating 300 or so calories a day with a couple hours of exercise a day. So after a few tries I managed to stop.      Ever since then I've been unable to eat more than 800 calories a day. I'm just rarely hungry, and I still eat less than that on a lot of days. At the most, on days where I really binge, I might get in close to 1000 calories. I still exercise 30 minutes - 2 hours with this. And while I still always guilt myself about eating this much, I really do try to eat more. Is this bad?

20081207192253AA6EzSr	Health;Mental Health	Prozac's size effects are really bothering me. Is there another antidepressant I might tolerate better?	I'm on fluoxetine (the generic name for Prozac) for dysthymia with occasional episodes of major depression, various phobias, and irritable bowel syndrome. I've been taking 10mg a day for three weeks, and even at that low dose, the side effects are quite bothersome. I haven't been able to have a complete bowel movement without the use of a laxative for two weeks. I have a history of constipation (mostly in childhood), but I haven't had anything this bad for years, and since my digestive problems when I went on this medicine were the exact opposite of what I'm experiencing now (constant, and I mean CONSTANT diarrhea), I'm fairly sure that this is the drug's fault. I also get nauseous often, but I haven't actually vomited since I started the drug.      The medicine also makes me very drowsy, and I've been sleeping a lot more and a lot more deeply than I usually do. Before I went on fluoxetine, I was sleeping 3-5 hours a night, with no naps during the day. Now, I average on about 10 hours of sleep a night with a 2 hour nap in the afternoon, and I still feel exhausted. I also fall asleep at random times. I've fallen asleep watching TV, eating, on the computer, on the bathroom floor after taking a shower, even in the middle of a conversation. Also, I sleep so soundly that it's pretty likely that I could sleep soundly through a bomb going off on my street. This past week, I have slept through three alarms almost every day: one on my clock radio, a timer on my TV in case I sleep through the clock radio, and an alarm on my cell phone to remind me to take my medication (because of this, I've taken a couple of doses late). To make sure that I woke up on time this morning, I asked one of my friends to come over and wake me up. He tells me that he came into my room and shook me while I was asleep, and even though I stayed in bed with my head under the covers, I had a conversation with him and he assumed that I was awake. I have absolutely no memory of this. In fact, I slept in three hours later than I intended to, despite setting three alarms and having someone "wake me up".       I've also been having frequent nosebleeds. I'm not sure if this is related to the medication or to the cold weather, but starting this past week, I had a nosebleed nearly every other day, and on Friday, I had three separate nosebleeds. I remember reading that SSRIs can cause bleeding problems, so I'm a little concerned about this. I also feel a bit jittery; I'm constantly fidgeting, itching myself, and biting my nails, something that's never really been a problem before. I've also had more of an appetite, but, paradoxically, I've lost five pounds since starting the medication.      It may be a bit early yet, but I haven't noticed any change in mood at all, and these side effects are really annoying me, the constipation being the worst. I'm seeing my shrink tomorrow, and I'm wondering if I should tell her that I want to go off the medication or if I should ust wait and see if these side effects go away. I know that SSRIs generally have the fewest side effects, but do all SSRIs have the same side effects? Could going on a different SSRI get rid of the constipation and sleep problems? Is there another class of antidepressants that has less digestive side effects? I realize that I'm probably going to have side effects with any drug, but there are plenty that I can tolerate, like sexual side effects (totally celibate), weird dreams or nightmares (I've had those my whole life; I doubt I'd even notice if I experienced this side effect), or weight gain (I'm skinny anyway, so I could stand to gain a few pounds).      Sorry this is so long, and thanks in advance.

20081108051641AAsoEtp	Health;Women's Health	What could be causing bad cramping?	i just had a baby boy 9 weeks ago. my doc said most people will start their period between 6-8 weeks after.       Some background:   after birth, i stopped bleeding at 2weeks.    i am not breastfeeding.   we started having sex at 2.5 weeks (it was ok'd by doc as long as it didn't hurt. i didn't have stitches or anything after birth).   anyway, i still have not started my period, i am not on birth control. i have tons of creamy/white/stretchy discharge. about a week ago i had a couple tiny streaks of pink/brown blood. its not itchy or irritated so its not an onfection.      well, for the last 2 days have had some horrible cramping in my abdomen/stomach area. at first i thought it was my period getting ready to start, but still no sign of it. plus, i never remember cramps being that bad. i thought maybe i was pregnant again, but took a test about a week ago and it came out negative. i never felt this kind of pain with either one of my pregnancies anyway. anyway, what could be causing this kind of pain? it's like cramping/pulling pains in my pelvic/abdomen and middle stomach.

I can already see myself forgetting it, because of the break.      So, some tricks and tips?

20081121184240AAgpaVB	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	When will my black eye (periorbital hematoma) fade away?	I have had a terrible car accident on the 23rd of september of this year. I suffered deep lacerations from all over my body due to glass debris from both my windshield and my left side window. I also underwent a six hour reconstructive plastic surgery (lots of stitches!) on my upper left eye and neck.      Now, my questions are - it has been nearly 60 days since the day of the accident, my eye was swollen for about 3 weeks or so but until now i still have this black shades around by eye, when will this fade? will it fade? and what do i have to do to make it fade faster? its been almost 2 months and i'm starting to worry that it won't go away...i've read several websites and it said that Periorbital Hematoma heals for about 15 days, but mine isn't..      Replies are greatly appreciated...

I really feel ill be wanting to come back to the antidepressants. Im worried... please help... thanks for reading
20081209023602AAVGiL6	Health;Mental Health	My mother beat me...does she have a mental illness?	To the outside world, she was the perfect mother & friend. When I was 5 months old, my father tells me he "caught" my mother in an act of rage throwing me onto the bed. As a little girl growing up, I was subjected to a number of beatings to this day I still don't understand. I talked myself into thinking it was because I was the eldest and should have known better. I kept all of this hidden from the outside world one day when, she viciously beat me with a vacuum cleaner pipe in front of my best friend because I had asked her if could go and play. That was the most embarrassing day of my life. I ran away for 2 days - thankfully it was the 40 hour famine weekend & starving was on the agenda anyway.       At age 12, my father caught me getting a vicious beating from my mother. He held her against the wall & told her he would kill her if she touched me again. I begged my grandparents (her parents) to let me stay with them & they agreed although they had no idea how cruel she was to me. Over the years, I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt but whenever she came near me she would bully me & make me feel so low, I would revert back to the child inside. I could never do anything right in her eyes. Her parents were very good to me and never mistreated me at all. I stayed with them until I was almost 20 years old.       Last year, I had a serious car accident not far from where she lives (we live over 2 hours away from each other). Two days after the accident, we had words & the next thing I know, she loses it. She throws me and my kids out into the cold winter's night. No money & nowhere to go. I was so disillusioned - bad enough for me but what about my kids?      I'm 32 years old now & a single Mum of two handsome well-adjusted boys. I hold down a full-time job in Government where I have worked for the past 11 years & have made a very concious decision not to abuse them & to try and maintain a good relationship with them - free of fear. My mum recently phoned to say she's coming to my place for a few weeks (WTF?). She's been calling & texting me non-stop (including 3am in the mornin). It has taken me 2 weeks to gain the courage to tell her to "just leave me alone" & the only way I could do that was by text.       Now my younger sister's are harassing me with texts like "what's up with the text you sent Mum?" What should I do?       Thanks to all :-)
