NrwJyffxaa	Be glad that she thinks your a god and has brought you burnt offerings.      I personally let her try to eat it first if she can do it then so can I.  If she can't then she doesn't feel bad about getting take-out of pizza.     I always encourage her to try again|`|rcut6bhoaa	Eat it and say thank you!      Dont mess with the cook !|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Either cook another meal himself or go out to dinner.|`|AA10531094	Order or take her out to dinner unless he can do a better job.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	Hopefully it's something you can cover in lots of ketchup.|`|asxqampCaa	2 weeks ago - you were married to a phsyician.

Same as what a wife to do if a man breaks whatever he tried to fix in the house. Take it as not a big deal.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	Can you cook? If so give her a hand and teach a thing or two. If not take up cooking classes together, it might sound silly, but I guarentee you'll get something out of it plus it gives you both some new and fun things to try. Than a couple nights a week you can take turns making dinner for one another and on other occassions go out and let someone else do the cooking for you!|`|AA11138696	Get on the phone and call for pizza or take her out to eat.

The correct answer is-    She is going to be  upset, embarassed and somewhat depressed. She may even hide it, but inside she may be having these feelings.    You should:    1. Try to eat it anyway. No matter how bad it tastes, chew it, swallow it, smile (she will be able to tell that you are faking, but do it anyway) and say "It's not that bad"    2. Ask her if hers is ok    3. Whether she says yes or no, take a few more bites and then say "would you rather have something else?"     4. If she says no, eat it anyway. If she says yes, ask her what she would like, offer take make something else, offer to order takeout, take her to dinner    This always made me feel better. I don't burn dinner anymore now because I have more confidence that my husband (well, he's an ex now, but not because of burned dinners) isn't going to care if I burn dinner.    Hope this helps :)|`|1m8zFFXyaa	Either shut up and eat it, or cook for yourself!|`|rRrxszgMaa	lol...my husband was very patient with me|`|fvfUoiW1aa	if you have any experience cooking you could always help prepare the meal with her...obviously not telling her what to do exactly, but just being there when she needs a helping hand and isn't doing things correctly...and if both of you are terrible at cooking then maybe yal should watch the food network or take a cooking class together ;) lol...no but really, it could bring yal closer doing things together and hopefully someday she will have learned when to take things out of the oven ;)...never ever tell her you don't like the taste though, that would just hurt her feelings...if anything sneak a midnight meal :)

JkegixQ3aa	Wow, I'm sorry, but this is a really dumb argument. I mean, you're only in grade six, but come on. Tell your friends to suck it up and get over it. It's not worth losing a friend just because of some pointless argument. Trust me, I've been there, and I'm never going back! Oh yeah, and if they ask you to pick sides, don't. Just change the subject to some happy memory all three of you have together or bring up an insider all of you have. Or just crack some kind of stupid joke to make them laugh. Odds are they'll forget all about their fight, and they won't even remember the reason they were fighting in the first place!  Good luck!|`|mYAbq6fnaa	just tell moria and sydney that this whole thing is stupid and they should get over it. seriously, this sounds like a fight that 7 year olds would have. its no big deal, just remind them of this.|`|LiTMU2Dhaa	Tell them that it's stupid to be arguing about being a girly girl or not giving people part of your lunch.  What grade are you in?|`|VxhknQjEaa	I had the SAME EXACT PROBLEM about 5 months ago when my three friends, Amber, Jessica, and Haley kept fighting and arguing and now Jessica and Haley are B.F.F's again and me and Amber are and have been feeling left out.......the thing I did was just to step back and stay OUT of it!  If you get yourself into it, they will both end up hating you!!!!!! Trust me!  I hope this helped!!!!!  Good luck, bye!
AA12046874	Wow sounds similar to me. If his father's name is on the birth certificate, he has as many rights as you do. However, if you two can settle it outside of court, which it sounds like you will, then there's no need to fight for custody. If you want full custody, you have to be married, and the step dad would have to adopt the child. I know that sucks. I'm in a similar boat and I found out I have to be married because the kid has to have a legal father, I guess. Child support is easy to get. Just go to a local DFS office and ask about it. They will help you through it. Usually you hand them the paperwork and they chase him down for the money. How much you get depends on his income and your income together. You can try to get a lawyer pro-bono but it's hard. It may be easier where you live (I'm in Wyoming). He sounds like my baby's daddy...irresponsible...I wish you good luck!|`|4ssSgfYEaa	My daughter went through this in Illinois.  She had to go to court to get Custody of her boys.  The dad didn't contest though. They were never married.    They went to a different court for support to be taken out before he gets his check.  I think it is 22 or 23 % for one child.    The visiting can be set in court also.    You need to see what the law is where you live.  You need to have it all legal.|`|JQrGknfMaa	The mother and if the father wants rights he has to go through the court system|`|986af596c09da513b6587d9c648fde74aa	you'll need to go to afdc, they are for low income mothers, they will also arrange child support for you, I gather you cant afford a lawyer?   If you can arrange child support/ visitation with out them and he is reliable then great, but, if not, then you really need to go to the state for help, which is the afdc- aid for dependent children
UgD15lkOaa	The legal age is 18. Once your 18 you can do anything you want that legal. I know how you feel ^-^ hang in there bro!|`|eUUcriANaa	It is 18 and You should be ready to go when you go. First I would get a job because you are going to have to have a place to live. Second you will need to save money because everyone is going to want a deposit for electric, etc. Third I would make sure I left on good terms because you may need to come back to good ole Mom and Dad. Look, I do not know what kind of parents you have if you are abused then yes you need to get out. Call 911 and they will rescue you. But if you have decent parents that just give you rules you do not like you need to grow up. I am so sick of hearing how my parents have all these rules and curfews and I just want to do what I want to do. You need to thank GOD that you have good parents if you do. So what if they have rules that means they care about you and they want what is best for you even if it doesn't seem like it. I suggest you do the smart thing stay in school and if you have good parents suck it up and obey the rules.|`|aXqi9lYJaa	I think it's 18, and maybe 16 with the right court stuff.|`|5NF4sAPaaa	what state do you live in?    EDIT: at 16...ONLY if you go to the court and get permission from your parents, and proof that you can support yourself...also you have to have a good reason as to why.    otherwise its 18...I feel your pain, I do...    EDIT: btw it's called emancipated, look it up for all the "legal" information.|`|KJAKihaCaa	18|`|GEXsNLgZaa	you can leave at 16     its called getting emancipated but you got to go to court for that and have to show the judge that you can support yourself without your parents helps and go to school and all that stuff       i thought of doing that but i don't know im still thinking  its hard to support yourself its not EASY i know sometimes  parents go crazy over the stupidest reasons ever but ill be gone in two years or less doesn't really matter. just get emancipated or wait till your 18 if i was you i would wait till im 18. make sure you think about it real well                                   GOOD LUCK!!|`|IupDRUKnaa	You can Legally move out at 16.

oMIxJTO1aa	Cut off communication with him, and learn to ignore..exs who harass even if they are told to f off just need to be ignored, it may take a while, possibly ages but thye dont deserve the time of day nor your attention at all, even if it gets to the point u begin to think otherwise.    As for the raping if this is a serious post id go the police if its rly bad and dont be put in a situation where he can do that, aka nvr evr be in a place where its just u and ur ex...no matter that just causes problems.

Q5BM2POnaa	Could it be true?  Sure.    Is it likely true?  Probably not.    To better answer I would need to know if he brought it to your attention, or if that was simply his excuse after you noticed the calls.  If he brought it to your attention, that ups his chances of being an honest guy, particularly if the friend is question seems like that kind of guy.  If you busted him and he just offerred that as his excuse, he's almost certainly guilty of sleeping with a prostitute.    I know that as a married guy, and a guy who has friends that probably have used escort agencies, I would not be comfortable with them using my phone for such a call, though I suppose if your husband is telling the truth, there's the possibility he didn't know who his friend was calling.    Then there's the question of what did your hubby do while the friend was preoccupied as they were obviously out together when the friend decided to do this.    To verify you could check his credit card statements and ATM withdrawl history and see if any large amounts or charges you can't identify went through.    Lastly, a guy doesn't just up and decide to cheat with a hooker one day out of the blue.  If he did do this, it's not likely the first time, nor is it likely to be the last.  Is there any history of  cheating, lying, unexplained absenses or spending?  The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.      If he's always been squeeky clean and you have a healthy and happy marriage and he came to you with the issue, chances are he's on the up and up and deserves the benefit of the doubt.      If not, you need to protect yourself; in every way possible.    ------------------------    Since you stated you busted him, I would say it's a 99% chance HE used the escort (and maybe his friend too).      Even If he does get his friend to call you to tell you the story, how would you know if the friend is telling the truth?  A: you can't, and most friends put into this type of situation would back their buddy, and not put their friendship in jeopardy.    I would check the ATM withdrawls and credit card statements.   I have no idea what the going rate is, but hookers don't come cheap, and there has to be a paper trail leading back to your husband somehow.      I will end by saying marriage is built on trust, and you can't sustain one where there is no trust.  Something caused you to check his phone in the first place, right?  Even if the friend corroborates the story and you believe him, AND you find no financial evidence tying your husband to the escort, you still have a trust issue to work on, so if you want to stay together, DO plan on working on that with a professional (and not the kind his friend sought out).|`|f3n2zXG2aa	A girl I work with kept getting sick-o adult video's in the mail addressed to her husband.  He kept telling her that "his friend" orders them because the wife does not allow things like that in their house.  (YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  His friend always laughed behind her back for believing that one.|`|2esGKO2Caa	They my have but the escort service is not calling him you have to call them. No matter someone called them!|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Thats is just total BS.........dont even consider that to be the truth!|`|AA10531094	That's one of the oldest tricks or should I say lies in the book.  My Dear. . . You're husband is a lier!!|`|NWH3MnE9aa	If he chooses to call an escort agency, it's his business, not yours. If he wanted to tell you, he would. Butt out and give him the same privacy he gives you.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	Yeah right ! lol|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	He got what he deserved|`|6ucVuo10aa	you should really look in this matter.......|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	1.  Why would his friend use his phone to call an escort?  Wouldn't his friend be embarrassed that he needed an escort?  Hey, dude, let me use your phone so I can call an escort.    lol....|`|ju8CjD84aa	Thats nice....I feed my dog at the table sometimes and she always begs now...I still feed her every once in a while...eh ...eh|`|gfHutvEFaa	Ummm, Im sure it COULD be true, but probable? Not really. Take his cell, call the number and tell them if they don't stop calling that number you will be calling the police for harassment. I have no idea what else you can do to find out the truth either. If there have been other instances where something doesn't "feel" right, you may have a cheating husband on your hands.    Good luck.|`|stRWElvPaa	I suspect deceit, why on earth would his friend need another persons phone? Do they go out much together in the evenings and nights?    If they do, then it's possible his friend was out of credit and they phoned on your husbands cell phone.    But, if they don't go out much in the evenings, nights etc then I would be more suspicious than believing.    Try digging deeper, or a good idea is to send a message to his phone/call him with a foreign accent and try to arrange a meeting or invite him to contact you back.     Lay a trap so to speak. I think that's the only way you'll know for sure.    has his behaviour towards you changed lately? good luck.|`|AUsvrW8faa	His friend may have given him the number but I don't believe his friend called from your husbands phone.    Usually, the friend won't do anything that will jeopardize their friends marriage. They know the husbands that will do stupid things are usually stupid enough to mess things up on their own.  One thing in his defense- he told you it was an escort agency so you may not have anything to worry about unless there is drama behind how you found out about it.|`|unBDeZ8Caa	.I would ask him who his friend is that used his phone.Most people have their own cell phones now,so why would'nt his so called friend have his own phone.Or you can ask your husband for the ph.number of the agency so you can tell them not to phone his number again.He may not agree to that,but if he does then he may be telling you the truth.|`|1IweC4O7aa	Yeahhhh his "friend" used it. Hahahaha|`|K9SmiHX6aa	no|`|yIGVOqXdaa	I doubt its true but if you want to give him the benefit of the doubt then ask him to change his number and see if it occurs again.|`|6k2lmVChaa	Thats BS. lol|`|2wzGwV5daa	Have you tried calling the agency to find out who it was that actually called them (they might have his name or his friend's name down as customers) and to find out why they continue to call his cell phone?    I'm not saying he is or isn't lying: my husband cheated on me and I still don't trust him (only been four months).    Otherwise, sitting down and having a long nice heart to heart talk with your hubby is in order.

Just give it time to sink in, and let the wave of love and romance take you of your feet, it will come soon, don't fret.   And as for the conversations, yea sure they might be boring, but sometimes that is where stuff pick up from. Do the old stuff like ' how was lunch? what did you have? etc..' they might be a little weird but they can work sometimes. And sometimes just a old 'hi' could be enough.    But dont worry, some relationships just take a while, since it is just the begining it will take time for your to realise that there is someone else in your life now...    Wish you two all the best =D|`|nql213V6aa	Well, don't be too shy around him. When a guy sees you being shy, it might give him the idea that you don't enjoy being around him. Just don't be too overbearing.  Talk about school, your friends, and try to find some common ground. A guy will be less awkward around you if you have something in common.

That doesn't seem good. However, if you want to try to make it work, go for it--I'll tell you what I think about how to do it. But if you find you're not happy, for heaven's sakes, don't drag the poor guy along. Get out and spare yourself and him some dignity.    So, if you're leaning toward staying with him, which isn't a bad idea since this relationship has lots of potential, then learn to be patient. You should be able to just talk to him naturally, on the phone and with texts. Just come up with things to say and questions to ask. Maybe even play a sort of question game to get to know him. And when you're together, maybe the sparks will fly.    Like I said, if things aren't working out, make this clear to him and get out. You don't want to torture yourself.    Good luck!|`|zrk2VtPIaa	go out with him on that date, and see how you feel. i was in a relationship sort of like that one a little while ago. we weren't great friends at the beginning, but i liked him enough. after about a month of akward phone conversations and sweaty hand holding (3 dates not including hanging out with him at school events), i told him that i think that i liked him just as a friend instead of as a boyfriend. he was mad at first (he even accused me of "stringing him along") but he got over it. now we have about the same level of friendship that we had before all this happened. once you figure out exactly how you feel, tell him. if you have to break up with him, let him know that you hate to hurt him and you really wish it could work, but your feelings for him are more than that of a friends. good luck!|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	scrap the relationship, move on to the next victim, no I mean bf

You should not ever tell him you were watching.  He might never forgive you and well he might not.  You should not have watched but since you did keep the info to yourself an don't do it again.  You wouldn't like it and he won't either so do not tell him unless you want to open a great big can of worms, not to mention feelings of violated trust.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Guy's response: We love our j*ck-O*f time as much as you do. With few exceptions, if we're masturbating by ourselves it means we want to be by ourselves or we would have invited you to participate. We want our privacy. The three previous answers to the effect of "We just ignored it or gave him his privacy" are absolutely the proper response. If we walked in and caught you using a toy, we would make ourselves scarce until you finished and not let you know we were there. Listen? Of course. Horn in? No.  If we want to throw a masturbation party with you, you'll know. How often we do it and whether we look at porn or not is OUR business, not yours. How you j*ck-o*f is YOUR business, not ours.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Sure. I ask him if he wants his privacy or wants me to help. If he wants his privacy I close the door and leave him alone, if he wants help, I get on my knees and help out.....|`|OG4410bdaa	I've caught him  but unfortunately he realized I was there  ...it would def be more fun of a show if he didn't know I was there    we don't keep our masturbation habits secret from each other  in fact, some times we do it for each other to watch...  I just think it would be better if he didn't know I was there because then he'd feel less inhibited...god I love to watch that man get off, whether I'm doing it for him or he's doing it to himself, its just so hot!|`|P91FugsAaa	I can't imagine being married and not tearing one off in front of your partner from time to time.  I think it's totally hot to watch a woman play with herself.  Besides, watching your S.O. do it to themselves is good education for what they like.|`|5RoYyprkaa	No.  My fiance and I have sex almost every day.  There's no need for him to do the deed.|`|yIGVOqXdaa	Nope.|`|Ctgc429laa	lol. no thats never happened to me, but i would laugh if it did.  haha|`|6ucVuo10aa	lol......thats funny.....but no and you should tell him....o the look on his face. i wud love to see it lol

His name is on the certificate, so legally you both have joint custody.    These days they don't usually grant full custody to only one parent unless there are circumstances proving unfit etc . Its joint, with the child residing at one address, and the other parent gets visitation rights.    If you cant work out a agreement with your boyfriend, then you will have to take him to court and let the judge work our a custody, and visitation order for you.    Call the Child support agency and they will give you an estimate of the child support you will receive. You get a percentage of his annual income.|`|OT3eczxaaa	I am fairly sure you get legal custody because you were never married. However, if your son's father is named on your child's birth certificate, you need to go to court to get child support ordered. They will use calculators to figure out how much support he needs to pay.|`|4805686fe56c40b3d116e63ef0f5fd16aa	Ok If you and the father are not married the mothers has custody until or unless one or either parent files a custody motion through Family Court. Child Support has to be file, if you and him can not come to agreement about support than the state or the court will levy the amount.|`|rh12tX8Naa	Right now, you do have full custody. He can take you to court to try to get custody, but most likely, the judge will make him pay child support and he can see the kid every other weekend. Until then, you have full custody.|`|JRV8gHbkaa	You both have custody even if your not married. Court hearings will determine who the child will live with and who pays child support and set visitation arangements if the two of you can not agree on things.
MX1shAbcaa	nah, i don't understand your question should search it on google though.  Best of luck~William
VvUxR6qRaa	I was in a similiar situation about 8 years ago.  The only thing is that we were both willing to move to be with one another.  You say that you really want to be with one another, but you're both not acting like it's the number one priority.  You're both putting being closer to your families first (which is totally understandable, and not a bad thing in any way).  I think you both need to sit down and really talk about this.  Both of you should make a list of pros and cons of moving and decide where to go from there!  Good luck!    (He ended up moving up to be with me, and we've been living together for 71/2 years :) )|`|wJ1v0cX0aa	you can both find jobs and can end up staying in a place together midway from both your family's place.|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	The first rule in life, is that YOU have to take care of YOU.      Relationships with other people always come second.  If you put the relationship ahead of your own needs, you WILL be unhappy.      The simple point at this time, is your boyfriend is not ready for a major change, because his relationship with his brother is more important than his relationship with himself, or with you.      It could be, that he has a local girlfriend, or crush and doesn't want to leave town because of it.   YOU are not his  1 after his own needs.

dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Of course the classic black...it's becoming really popular to use during weddings! Black against you burgandy dress would be so beautiful. You would stand out just like if you were wearing white  Or to make it interesting pale pink for the dresses  White would be nice but silver is already a light shade|`|AA10378447	Interesting scheme ... probably white or ecru would go best.|`|o2dnH9WAaa	white...black...something neutral, because that red is already very eye catching and saturated|`|auUeI2Vnaa	black and white...maybe some pale pink|`|oMB5FnIMaa	I agree, black and white. Maybe grey? burgundy, bright red, and black roses look beautiful together!|`|7CKipTZOaa	I would personally go with black with pink accents, for the ladies a sash , for the gents pink tie or vest    cream could also look lovely with pink accents, and for the gents a darker grey such as platnum but not as shiny as silver|`|CCnej03qaa	black and white...you can't go wrong!|`|37DTSXZJaa	white and grey|`|wS0VRGK8aa	black or cream|`|x8RA1ENvaa	white, pink.  very cute idea!|`|LaiANzeAaa	gold and pink?|`|1FrhiNhiaa	Maybe a black suit with those things inside idk what it is called exactly but in red . Did you already buy the dress? Maybe you can get it in white with embroidered burgundy designs on it?!|`|7Ty9Uhmhaa	light pink and dark grey...???|`|ovnMPPhraa	suite and dresses for who?  Family?    Jewel tones like:  Aubergine  Royal blue  Emerald green  Black  Chocolate  Latte  Champaign|`|iSyGrJliaa	blck|`|vDu90qajaa	red|`|j1OreBEoaa	grey   pink  red  navy|`|4suXhe6iaa	Gold and white!  Beautiful combination!|`|g5KaAFIQaa	A white would be a nice refreshing color with all the darks you have|`|yCYw735Aaa	beige and tan would go very well.  white would be really sweet too.  go for a neutral color since you already have a sharp color like red and a metallic.|`|d1kz6b17aa	Dress: pink    Suites: maybe light blue|`|1E0sjoqHaa	gold or navy blue|`|Y0o5uMvdaa	peach is a pretty color and white too match with that.but if your colors are those maybe cranberry and white would work too|`|sglcMxlWaa	white, cream or black would be nice.     Google something like "Red and Silver" "Wedding" and you can bring up images that perhaps give you inspiration.|`|NdU3e83Gaa	i think those colors are so pretty ...so but cant think of any other colors i think just keep it with those 2...how about light pink|`|jQIGk39vaa	well first off it would look nice if you alternate the color in the bride maids' dresses (one in white then one in burgundy). the grooms' men are fine the way they are! too much red will be too overwhelming!   Gray, white, and black for example would look good with those colors.
zMF1kY4Yaa	no, it was a good thing to let him know. it is important that he knows a thing like that.|`|VvUxR6qRaa	I've been in this situation.  I didn't tell my mate, but when he found out, he was upset that i hadn't "thought enough of our friendship" to tell hium what was going on.  I think you totally did the right thing.... if that was your bf kissing another girl, you would want to know|`|wJ1v0cX0aa	well, i guess now that it's done, it's up to your friend to decide. If you think it was in his best interest to know, then it's not wrong.|`|DeWADdQaaa	i think this person is typing in tongues O_O wth?
L7oTokyPaa	I found this question because I googled "how to tell a bridesmaid she is not in the wedding". I am getting married in the beginning of March and have just been faced with the same dilemma. First thing you need to do is to just be honest and tell her how you feel. I think you need to find someone else who is going to be there for you on your big day. You have PLENTY of time to get this done, so don't worry :).  For me: I had to demote her from MOH to a bridesmaid and as of yesterday, she isn't even a bridesmaid anymore. It definitely seems like we are a lot of like. I am not a bridezilla by any means and havent even asked much out of anyone. She needs to understand that this is the most important day in your life. Good luck with everything! I am sure it will all work out!|`|gq1XoIBNaa	I'm sorry but I didn't realize that "Bridesmaid" was a job title.  Don't forget this girl is your friend..and I am assuming you might want her around after the wedding.  My advice:  You don't want to turn into Bridezilla and have NO friends after your big day.  Include people when and how they want to be included.  Everyone has their own lives and issues outside of your wedding dilemmas.  Respect that and do the leg work yourself if you have to.  Or ask family to help you with some of these things you don't have the time to do yourself.  Good luck with the big day.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	btw the bridesmaids buy their own dresses, you do NOT buy it.|`|AA10378447	It's understandable that you're concerned about and highly engaged in your wedding. It's coming around the corner. But I would advise you to stop being self-centered and just stop to ask her what the problem is. You might find out why she's being so brassy.    If she refuses to talk then, or makes it difficult, just flat out ask her if she still even wants to be a part of the wedding party. Give her that choice. If she says no, accept it gracefully. If she says anything else (as I doubt from the way you've described this girl, that she'll come out and say, "Oh, I'm just loving being a bridesmaid!"), then let her know that she needs to adjust her attitude or you'll have to ask her not to participate because she's stressing you out.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	you need to find out why she won't talk to you. It is because she's jealous that your getting married before her? there could be many reason behind her behavior. If she isn't going to participate, by all means ask her to step back and let someone else fill that position. But be warned, if you do, you may just lose her as a friend. So which is more important to you, your friendship with her or your happiness with your wedding. Just something to think about.|`|VOLRhthLaa	Play her at her own game. Go ahead with all your plans and seek help from your other bridesmaids. Do not ask her for any more help or suggestions. Plan for her to stay as a bridesmaid and she may make the decision not to be part of the wedding herself. She obviously has a problem which she does not want to discuss with you. Don't let her ruin your special day, just ignore her.|`|AA10975867	If this girl is a friend, then you should be wondering if she has a problem and is maybe trying not to bother you with it. If you named her as a bridesmaid on a whim and she really isn't a friend, then maybe it's time to call her and ask her straight up if she's still interested in being part of the wedding party. She might have had second thoughts, maybe tired of hearing nothing but wedding things for the past year, and is just not that "into it" any more. Maybe she heard a rumor about your fiance and wants to distance herself. Maybe she is sad about something totally unrelated. Maybe over the past year she has responded, given you lots of ideas and, so far, you haven't used one of her ideas so she prefers to just remain silent. (That happens a LOT -  a bride asks and asks and asks but doesn't realize how many ideas of her friends she just ignores.) You will find out what the problem is by speaking to HER not a bunch of strangers on Yahoo. It wouldn't be fair to just "fire her" without having a heart-to-heart talk first. And - why are you making the assumption that she would "get drunk", "flirt", etc. She might have a lot more class than you know! Really. It's time to show the maturity you should have if you plan on being a married woman. Set a time to meet for lunch and have an honest talk with her. Good luck.|`|AA11312653	Send her an eMail or even a postal letter with a detailed timeline of everything that you be expecting her to buy or do. By detailed, I mean "be at my house on Sat 14 Apr from 10 am until we have all agreed on a bridesmaid dress" instead of "help look at dresses." Give her a few days to look over your list and let you know whether she feels able to do and buy all the things on it, or if she would prefer to attend as a guest.|`|mkrKHQvFaa	Well that is quite the dilema.  If you ask her to step down and not be in the wedding you will lose a friendship.  If you keep her well she probably feels like you are bothering her with YOUR wedding not hers.      Personally I would just step back. She is not your MOH just just get her to show up to try her dress on order it and then show up to the wedding.  Save the friendship.  If she can't do then,,,,,,,well then drop her.  Either way it is a tough decision.  Good luck!|`|TIlxoclXaa	It depends. If you tell her she cannot be a bridesmaid now, she will not be your friend anymore. But, from the effort she is putting in, she might already not be your friend. If I were in this situation, I would start by asking her to lunch or something, just try to get some time when you and she can talk. Maybe start by asking why she hasn't been involved in anything. She may be having a rough time with things right now, maybe she is unsure how to help....who knows. But it is worth asking so you show some concern for her. Then if she really just isn't helping, then it would be time to tell her you don't want her to be a bridesmaid. Bridesmaids are supposed to be the people who have supported you and your groom from day one, have always been there for you, and are really the people largely responsible for making your wedding work. It is an honor, not a joke. And if she isn't actually helping you, then she doesn't view it that way. Best of luck...wedding drama is never fun.|`|3MDY29gnaa	You first need to fing out what's going on, why she isnt responding to you. Maybe she doesn't want to be in it. Maybe she's jealous! you need to find that out first. If she's not going to contact you about small help like that then how would it be closer to the wedding. If you cant trust her now with help what makes you think you can trust her to help make YOUR wedding go smoothly? Good Luck hun! call or text her and tell her that she NEEDS to reply or call you asap otherwise you will have to replace her.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	You might just ask her how's she's doing in general. If everything is going alright with her personally, not just in reference to the wedding. She may have something going on, or she may just be having difficulty that you're getting married.     I know it's exciting to be a bride and have a wedding, but it's your wedding, not everyone else's. Even seeing you may give her the wedding blues. Try talking to her and tell her that you've noticed that she doesn't seem to be that involved and while you do want her to be a part of your special day, you would understand if she has something going on and doesn't feel as if she could commit to actually participating. That way, you let her know that you really want her to stay but are OK if she wants to come as a guest.     BTW, I was in a wedding several years ago. We had been fitted for our dresses, the venue was booked, flowers decided; almost everything was done. The bride sent out daily announcements even though the wedding was over 7 months away. She sent out a menu selection e-mail at 10am and wanted the bm's opinions. When she didn't have a response by 3pm, she called my office. My secretary told her I was having back problems and wouldn't be in for a few days. At 5pm, she sent an e-mail to her sister and me telling us that if we could not put our lives aside for 5 minutes for to give an opinion on her menu, she was booting us out. The menu wasn't due for 6 1/2 months.     I was in the hospital in traction. Her sister was on vacation for a week out of the country. The bride had known about her sister's vacation for 6 months and knew that she wouldn't be available during that week. She didn't even bother to ask what was wrong with my back. Needless to say, some brides can go a bit overboard and it can be a little off-setting, especially to those who have never been married and don't know what it's like to plan a wedding.     Try and have a heart to heart with her and let her know how much she means to you. But if after a couple of weeks, if things don't improve, it might be that you do need to replace her. But don't plan on being friends after that.|`|jQIGk39vaa	I think you should just tell her (either through e-mail or face-to-face) how you feel and let her know she's no longer your Bridesmaid! Period!..and don't beat around the bush either while your at it!  It seems like she's only there cause you "asked" her to be and just stopped attention to her duties to you as a Bridesmaid. So why waste your time dealing with someone who apparently doesn't have time for you!|`|EQOnbP3Qaa	I would tell her you don't need the stress of trying to get her to help you and trying to get her to talk to you! She's playing games with you not txt or calling you back. I had an issue like this one and I finally said that there was too many other things to worry about for the wedding then to try to keep my bridesmaid, who is suppose to WANT to do this and be happy to do it. If she wanted to be in your wedding seriously she would not be ignoring you. And her not wanting to even talk to you about anything could mean your friendship might be falling apart or she might be jealous or even she did something she shouldn't have and nw doesn't want to talk to you. Cut her loose so you don't have the extra stress!! Good luck on you planning!!|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	I have news for you. It is NOT your bridesmaids responsibility to help plan your wedding. If they want to, great. But they dont have an obligation.    You are already getting help from 3 other bridesmaids. Gee, how much more help do you need?!     Just listen to what you wrote: "tell her I'm firing her, should I warn her that I'm going to if she doesn't help more, or should I just go on without her". This is not an office; there are no "firing" or "warnings".    Buying someone a dress does not obligate them to plan your wedding. If you wanted a wedding planner, you should have hired one. Why wouldnt you want your bridesmaid to have fun (eat food, flirt with groomsmen) at your wedding? You should want her to have fun. Her only obligation is to wear the dress and stand up at the wedding.    You ARE a bridezilla and Im not surprised she is distancing herself from you. I wouldnt want you as a friend either. Good riddance!

I know the wound is new, but you need to talk to her and tell her how you feel, see if she'll give you another chance and if she does you need to take it upon yourself and be better so next time it won't be your fault. I think you should give it another shot! If you still care for her and feel that way, realizing what went wrong then this time make things better and don't ever take anybody for granted! It goes along with the saying: "You never know what you got until it's gone." So this time just make things better. The least you can do is give it a shot. You might regret it later and if you don't do it now it might be too late. It sounds to me like you still have a chance so take it!

There is really nothing you can do but wait this pain out..... and no girl ever sets her standards to high|`|cyqKa2Keaa	Maybe you need to take a day off by you're self ex:pedicure manicure new hairdo brand new you.Let yourself free for one day turn off you're phone i guarantee that u will feel so happy and crap less.|`|OMs2EuTuaa	time is a great healer!!    now get back on the love train!!  you will find your station!|`|GUgzfks9aa	well just try to find peace with yourself.. i mean how are you going to make someone happy if you aren't happy with yourself.. you feel like that because you miss her . you are so used to her but it will go away with time.|`|3IRnGPAcaa	LOL, wow......if i didn't know better i would think i was ur girlfriend, man u just described me and my boyfriend.  Look if she loves u and u love her then: COMMIT!!! u cannot have it both ways! grow up! my boyfriend is taking me for granted too and if he doesn't commit, i will be leaving................but if he came back to me with a ring, i will take him back in a second because I love him. So, in a nutshell, if she loves u she will take u back. Just make sure u know what u want in a relationship, stop procrastinating. LOL, yeah...u do not know how great someone is until u loose them. Take my advice and get ur girl before another guy who can recognize a good woman claims her as his.|`|5jWj9r2daa	to answer your question,  you feel like crap cuz you were a bad bf.  and you took that relationship very blah.  im kinda suprised the relationship went on that long.  but not being mean.  totally honest.  change and become more mature.  and then you will get her back(:|`|KVCkcMokaa	Dont listen to some people on here Dude, this is why Questions and Answers have a relationship category? I think they are too up themselves to give a sh*t about other peoples issue, Seriously, dont go into the relationship categories if you dont want to help! Period! anyway I have had my moan....     Do you miss her dude and feel bad because you dont want her to be with anyone else? Or do you miss her and actually want to be with her? ask yourself this asap....because if its the first one then dont bother going back to her, you will get over it....and if its the second then sit down with her and tell her that you cant be without her...simple!  IF she rejects you then thats just the way it has to be to be honet with you, go and get a lay, or go and get it out of your system asap otherwise you will be hurting for a while, also stay away from her just for a few months as much as you can to get over it...and you will!..  If she gets back with you and you are happy for that and you really truely like/love her then comit to it mate, if your not ready for comitment then you shouldnt really be going with any girls unless they dont want comitment, and to be honest that is rare!    So way it up..Do you like her soooo much you could see yourself with her in the future...  OR  Do you just miss her in the way that you dont want anyone else having her?    Your choice!    Good luck dude!|`|WEDQFiLKaa	You answered your own question on line 3|`|MW2eIGyYaa	If you really want her to get back with you tell her your sorry for whatever you did and if she feels the same way!!!!!!Who knows what can happen|`|gpP0zXfbaa	wait for your heart to heal because right now you're in too much pain then give it another shot. if she said that she may give you another shot, then she really doesnt like the break up idea. so go for it.
bjsOnyPkaa	My wife doesn't know I shave hair off my toe nails. Do not let her know.....|`|gfHutvEFaa	I don't have a story, sorry. Not keeping any big secrets over here.|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	Sorry but the stories are way two private for me too share them. Otherwise I would like two but it's just to personal too|`|6QIpltVyaa	not huge stories maybe small ones...|`|AA10171853	i have not keep a secret longer than 1 whole day. Im bad at them. plus i wouldnt want my husband doing that to me.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	All of them.  That's why they are secrets.|`|6oZagLCvaa	well, I am really a lesbian trapped in a mans body. I am not sure how to break it to her, hehehe|`|3iNobwVraa	Sure, some.  I'm a completely open book with almost no one (only two people in my entire life.)  It's not completely intentional...I don't know.  And, the stories are most definitely private, sorry.    I will say, however, that I am more open on here than almost anywhere.  Anonymity is formidable! ;)|`|O36qjj7Oaa	No stories here because i dont keep secrets from my husband.    Thats not good for a marriage.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	My big secret is that I am a lesbian woman trapped inside of a man's body.  Shh!|`|0d0W0nbVaa	I'd love too tell you my to stories, but it is bit two personal and besides, i do not want her too find out by browsing through my pc two find out that i'm having too affairs with her to best friends.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Most do. Most cheat in one way or the other. We all know that.|`|5RoYyprkaa	My fiance and I have no secrets. I tell him everything, and he tells me everything. Well, almost. I know that we both have small secrets but nothing big or major.
JQrGknfMaa	I agree with you. its not being hypocritical its your sisters job to teach the younger sister whats appropriate and whats not and you are correct in saying that there are things that your 16year old sister can do that your 6 year sister cant do.|`|ToKUdSZFaa	A 6yr.old little girl is very impressionable.and looks up to big sis.In front of the young one 16yr.old should practice what she preaches.|`|TzbGxqqoaa	I don't think so, It has a lot to do with perspective. I believe that kids should be kids for as long as is possible I think you guys have it cover. You can not ask a teenager to dress  like a nun. thats my opinion good luck. :)|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Yes, that is being hypocritical and there is no reason either should be showing off anything.|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	it is being a hypocrit, but sometimes being a hypocrit is ok, in this case it is fine.|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	It is hypocritical, yes.|`|2FsNdcXEaa	Yes and No. It is in the sense, regardless of age, that telling someone not to show chest when that person is, would be considered being a hypocrite. But because of age, I would say not quite as much, because it is obviously more important that younger children be conservative.|`|pVFfCRmlaa	You spell it "hypocrite".    To be fair, 6 year old kids don't have anything to hide anyway. A bit of cleavage can get you a long way. But yes I would say it is hypocritical.
uGN7Lmg0aa	Ha, you have a beautiful mind :-)    The only patterns I really notice here are the questions that should probably be in a frequently asked questions section somewhere.    "Is porn bad?"  "How do I deal with their mom-in-law?"  "How do I deal with their ex?"  "Are they cheating?"  "They cheated, how can I move on?"  "I cheated and they found out, how can I get them back?"  "Should I leave?"    etc.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	do you see dead people?|`|Ki1gWTzzaa	NOPE! but if you have a hubby, and a bf... then good on them if they are!|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	I think you need to see a psychiatrist|`|0e9846c69a3447404194ba8083d4f969aa	Oh lol, I used to say bf and people would always take it as boyfriend.     The proper term is apparently bff or BFF, meaning "best friend(s) forever."    I know, all the crazy slang nowadays, right?    And no... I can't say I've noticed that at all lol.
dTaGzh6Haa	Yes. In my lifetime I've been smitten by guys who later on I wondered "what in the world did I ever see in that person?"   Then there have been times when I've seen or been around a very attractive guy and felt nothing.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	Yes. Sometimes people are with so-called "ugly" people, but they're attracted to them. It's all about connection.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Yeah, I can be physically attracted to a woman without feeling any desire to get to pursue them or get to know them.  If I am attracted to them, to me, that says a lot more - that I would love to find a way to get closer to them.  Orrrr, maybe it's all semantics.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	i'll have what she's having.|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	No.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Yes, if you are attracted to someone, then you have the chemistry thing going on, and you would want to persue a possible relationship or whatever with them.    If you find someone attractive, thats different, it just means that you think they're 'good looking'.. ...eg: walking down the street and thinking,...'hmmm he's/shes nice looking".......|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Ah, maybe. You can find someone attractive; sort of notice it and move on. However, if you find yourself attracted to someone, that means you want to have sex with them.|`|3iNobwVraa	For me?  Oh yeah.  I see tons of attractive people.  Lots of people are very pleasant to look at, many are even pleasant to talk with, but VERY few could capture my interest enough to spark 'attraction.'  I think I might be pretty rare though, so I don't know if this helps.  And, I definitely think my answer is probably less common for men. ;)|`|BLstN7vZaa	Yes, I would say finding someone attractive is taking a LOOK but being attracted to them is a CONNECTION that you may want to explore.
b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	You've allowed him to stay in your home?  You're a great father!  VERY tolerant!|`|oOR511mFaa	You really did make me laugh just now.|`|dxPiM5VXaa	Lmao that's funny :D :D :D|`|WwrCYF1kaa	Yes.    Anything that involves physical abuse deems you an abusive parent.  Get help before you loose your kids or get locked up.    You may already have lost the love and respect of your son. Did you not stop to wander why he would not eat his dinner?    Allow you child to be a child before you begin to enforce your rule.|`|mjTmQzvFaa	It doesn't matter what the age is , because just like a child , they only have 1 set of parents and vice versa with the parents,no matter if you have one child or more, each child you only have once in your life and they can't be replaced no matter what. Basically stop and think how would you feel if someone bigger than you came to you and did that or if you made the wrong move on your child when doing what you did and if you seriously injured your child. You would have to live with that for the rest of your life and on top of that the hospital is required to turn in any and all abuse and you could lose your child all together. When your child does something that upsets you, step back and take a few deep breaths and then ask the child why they acted that way. Like with his dinner, maybe your child was not feeling well or something. Find out what the reason is behind the action before you take any action , but remember not to take the discipline that far . I know you must love your child because if not you wouldn't be taking the time to post your question. Hang in there and please please remember before you make the choice to do something like that think of how you'd feel if the role was switched. Good luck to you.|`|AA11852242	yes that may be abuse......................................|`|6L54KHbcaa	haha I hope your joking!|`|vnqRKrQ5aa	YES! you send him to bed|`|iW0yP86qaa	yes your a terrible father!|`|CiIxyXBbaa	Yes you are, stop taking advantage him.|`|jQVIRl2qaa	well i dont know...  i mean if your son is like 5 than i think you went a little harsh... i mean hes just a kid...they go through their little spasms... but if he is older than i would've asked why... not just automatically slap him. :) think before your actions!|`|8flRqHV4aa	no you didnt|`|AA12046874	That's a little too much discipline. I usually just tell my son "Bad, no food for you." And send him off hungry.|`|o37slzW4aa	Umm I dunno what a "stone cold stunner"  or a "leg drop" is, but I'm assuming that it had something to do with a hit, slap, pop, crack, wrestle mania?? etc... If you really did those things, you are a charming guy, every son's dream.   What can I say?|`|a3deb28ebba1fe096e3b09d1cdf50bd1aa	depends how old... if he is young than YES if he is older than it depends|`|BSKJdZK3aa	no if that was a joke then no    but if you if did that when you got mad then you are horrible|`|NgkkzBOEaa	That's funny...  It isn't physical abuse unless you actually harmed your son.  I'm not sure what a "stone cold stunner" or a "leg drop" is, but I'm assuming they are wrestling moves.  My father once slapped my brother, who called the cops.  Despite the huge hand print on my brother's face, the cops were angry with my brother, not my father. I do, however, think that you did overreact to your son not being hungry.|`|ToztjpAsaa	I hope, for your sake, that you're joking.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	lol|`|kFEx2Bx0aa	The worst kind|`|hYqRhQxPaa	yes you are.do you have a heart or some feelings for other humanbeing?he's your son.  for advice just talk to him,don't hurt him|`|666y2OWOaa	you are sooo mean.  IHY.|`|3vBALAlaaa	OMG!!! you've just abused your son! Unless he's made of steel, you've probably hurt him terribly both physically and emotionally! How would you like it if you weren't hungry, and when you wouldn't eat, he beat you up like it was a street fight! You have SERIOUS anger managment issues! I can't believe you did such a thing to your family, never mind your own son! I just pray that you didn't do it to someone like a toddler or an 8 year old or something!   Here's what you can do:     Go to church, Lord Jesus and God can help you through this.   Therapy therapy therapy!   If your a druggie or an alcoholic, get help! Drugs of any kind and alcohol, even in moderation can make one abusive and cranky over little things such as your own son not eating dinner!|`|5gqc5qyzaa	He wouldn't eat his dinner. What else were you gonna do? He's been told - you did what you had to do.|`|HlT9ZJF5aa	LOL very funny.|`|YZez6mheaa	Yes! That was terribly mean! That is actually child abuse. If he refused to eat his dinner you must give him a time out or send him to his room and tell him he can't eat anything until his plate is clean. But you do not lay a hand on him! you could go to jail for that! Children do that but as soon as they realize that you were serious about the food thing they will obey. Never hit your child
A8F4HF3Paa	Keep the conversation short.  You'll have more to talk about on your date then.  If I were you, I'd pick a few different options and then let her decide.  For example... "Hey.  So about Friday night, I wanted to nail down the plan.  I was thinking we could go grab a drink at _____'s around 6pm and then make dinner reservations for 7pm. Is that ok?"  If she's cool with that then say "Okay, we have a couple choices.  There's a Greek place I like..." and talk about that.  "There's also a really good little steakhouse that has great whatever"  and "If you like Italian, one of my fave Italian places is on ________.  What do you think?"  Then let her decide.  If she says she doesn't care, say "Okay, so you'd be good with Greek? "  IF she says yes, say great. Nail down the time you'll get her and where she lives and then say goodbye.|`|qjuqSq7Gaa	make it a friday evening. like 7 or so. pick her up. go to dinner, not like an expensice restaraunt but somewhere nice (applebees, ruby tuesday, tgi fridays, etc). then go to the movies, ask her what she wants to see. she will probably say she doesnt care so ask her either comedy or scary. then pick one. the night will end pretty well. maybe sneak a kiss in when u drop her off|`|AA11570752	find out what movies are playing and ask her to help pick one out to go see with you|`|sZePlWTQaa	Say exactly what she wants! She wants to know time, date and what to do! Once you do that...talk about anything!

Tell her when and where to meet and tell her you're looking forward to seeing her. Keep it simple.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Just call her up, ask about what her favorite type of food is, so you can get some ideas, that will start the conversation and things should flow naturally from there.

Easy as that!!|`|QuEU8Mh2aa	be like " hey i figured out some things to do" and list them   remember to give her options. show her what movies are playing wat time is best for her. and other activities oo like bowling or something. be creative :)|`|UsNKWP02aa	Don't go to the Movies..Thats the First Worst place for a First Date..Why.??

65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	If chemistry is not there for her, it is up to you to inspire it.  The best way to do that is to be a friend, a real friend.  Chances are as she gets to know you better on a deeper level the chemistry will start to happen for her too.    A person can't change his/her feeling by just wanting to.  Accept it as fact and focus on being her friend.  I think you will then stop obsessing about it and the lonely feelings will go away.|`|AWwtgcuwaa	TRY to find some one else!!|`|q0DntFi1aa	true it hurt, but it is also part of growing up.  There are plenty of fish in the sea.  If she does not reciprocate your love this is her lost.  You will find someone who love and cherish you for the rest of your life, be patient.|`|SW7g9Qzxaa	Hmmm perhaps she prefers a man who is intelligent or at least knows how to write a sentence.|`|ExOwMG2haa	Just give it time. Time will help you. Maybe she'll start to look at you as something more than a friend. But if she doesn't only time will help you get over her.|`|0i9y6Jk1aa	It takes time.  I know exactly how you feel.  I'm in the exact same situation with this guy.  He used to really like me, and I liked him.  And we had such a good relationship going.  But then things just randomly got really bad, and really awkward,  And now we hardly ever talk. I don't know why  I've been extremely depressed for two months now.  And I'm trying to move on.  And it's so hard.  But it just takes time. That's all I can tell you.  Good luck.|`|kts8IEoUaa	Ughh dude, i had this same situation my junior year (last year). I thought she was amazing and she wasn't into me/and or didnt want a relationship. It was a hard thing to swallow seeing as i had in the same class every day to start the day off. I choked on that alottt.     As cliche as it sounds, just give it time, there's nothing else you can besides talk about with a friend, hopefully a mature one? Eventually something great will come your way. Im in my senior year now, and i met someone amazing. You should too. givee it timee|`|EYW6av1Uaa	Im also a Jr. in High School and I had this problem for awhile but he was my best friend and ex so this plan isnt that good if she is but if she isnt a really good friend keep your distance, dont talk to her unless you have to, and start talking to other girls to get your mind off her and hang out with her trust me you will eventually get over her.|`|MrzXn2ejaa	LOVE is a dangerous road ... it looks all nice and everything, but once you go down it , it can leave some lasting scars!

VOLRhthLaa	Look for an outdoor site for the ceremony. There are lots of places where you could hold the ceremony and save the money to put towards the reception. A friend may have a nice garden area or even an indoor area that you could use.

oZdIsSSEaa	If depends on whether or not you mind your 'child' living with you.  In some cultures, it is normal for children to stay with their families. However, if it is a burden to you and your child shows no ambition or intention of moving out and on, I would set up a time line for him/her that gives them a definite time to move out, for example 3-6months. This does not mean that you love the child any less. You could help with the apartment if need be, and also suggest temp work, or any other type of job in the meantime.  By making your home a comfortable place for your child, you could be preventing him/her from exploring their full potential as an independent adult.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	first find out why they can't find a job and don't let them use the economy as their excuse, even with everything going on, you still can find a job.

The latter is by far the best and you will feel better which ever type of enema you get.|`|pVFfCRmlaa	Basically they pump a gallon of coffee up your rear and it flushes you out.

You need to let them know how this is effecting you!!! becuase if you dont, they wont know! take each day at a time, one subject at a time and one part of the day at a time. you have alot going for you with a GPA of a 3.4! stand up for yourself, be firm but repectful, be confident and mature!

E2XbFVBQaa	Go file the divorce papers and let them know you don't know where he lives. they have to advertise it in the paper for so long then they will grant it. Just ask at the courthouse when you file what all you need to do. They should be able to tell you how it works.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	You would file a missing spouse divorce. This involves placing a Notice of Publication in the newspaper. This will be considered serving the spouse. He will have a certain amount of time to respond, if he doesn't respond the court will finalize the divorce by default.  It will be difficult to get child support from him if you don't know where he is... you could hire a PI, or do some searching on your own. In the meantime, file the missing spouse divorce.|`|jwsba3qAaa	You could just go the courthouse and file or you could always get him arrested for backed child support.  Either way you'll get what you want eventually.|`|036UU02Caa	I believe you can file a missing person and throw an ad in the newspaper, as long as you have proof you dont know where he is then they will divorce you after a certain period i believe 90 days of not hearing from him, good luck

y4SUDnpaaa	I think you are blaming the wrong person and I'm surprised you didn't figure it out immediately. From what you've said about her husband it just didn't sound in character for him to let her go to stay anywhere,  much less to a place where he  didn't even have an address.It would be the perfect opportunity for her to leave him and you can bet he knew that. It may have been his plan along to go with her at the last minute to make sure she didn't leave and to know where you lived in case she did. Now you're in a terrible predicament. He's not going to let her come alone so you have to rescind your invitation or take the risk  of having him in your house. If you having them both there could somehow make her life better, it would be one thing, but I doubt she wants to go see you with him along anymore than you want him in your home. Try to make up some believable excuse for why you have to postpone the trip........... only so he won't take it out on her when he finds out the trip is off.|`|iZbgUtxcaa	Give her the link to wikipedia for the word "boundaries" because she clearly has no concept of them.

Call her now and tell her you are "uninviting them" because HE is not welcome in your home. Lock the doors and do not let them in if they come. In fact, leave the house for the day...go take in a museum or somehthing, but don't be around when they arrive. Do not worry about hurting her feelings. She knows you think her guy is abusive and that he does drugs. And you've told her before the guy isn't welcome.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Just call her and tell her that its your house and your rules and dont want her husband to come but that she and her son are still welcomed.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Don;t worry about hurting her feelings.  You set the rules, and she is waffling and trying to break them.  You were clear, now you just have to stand your ground.  Just say, "I love you, your my friend, but I told you that we can't have it this way and now I need to put my foot down."|`|0d0W0nbVaa	Do you have a close neighbor?  swap houses for the night.  preferably a house at least 5 lots down from yours.|`|5RoYyprkaa	It is your home, and you have a right to refuse her partner.

She should understand why.|`|aXYiOskmaa	you know why he's coming don't you?  cause his wife was going somewhere w/o him. he has no control then. odds are, if this guy is really bad, your friend had no choice but to let him come with. he'd have started a fight one way or another. she couldn't say she would stay home cause he'd find fault with it and he won't allow her to go w/o him.  i would simply call her and say you are very sorry but you'll have to cancel the plans and reschedule for another time. family stuff or something.

HOW TO POOP AT WORK:    CROP DUSTING    When farting, you walk really fast around the office so the smell is not in your area and everyone else gets a whiff but doesn't know where it came from. Be careful when you do this. Do not stop until the full fart has been expelled. Walk an extra 30 feet to make sure the smell has left your pants.    FLY BY    The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping.  Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come  back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.  People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.    ESCAPEE    A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop  in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of embarrassment.  If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen.  If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it.  No one likes an escapee. It is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.    JAILBREAK    When forcing a poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace.  This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should  happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom to  spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.    COURTESY FLUSH    The act of flushing the toilet the instant the poop hits the water.  This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom.  This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.    WALK OF SHAME    Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just  stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone  walks in and busts you. As with farts, it is best to pretend that the smell  does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.    THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (P.F.N)    A group of co-workers who band together to ensure emergency pooping  goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the where  abouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.    SAFE HAVENS    A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex.  This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.    TURD BURGLAR    Someone who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to  force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments  that can occur when taking a poop at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall  until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.    CAMO-COUGH    A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you  are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert  potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an  ASTAIRE.    ASTAIRE    A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that  you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is  occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.    WATERMELON    A poop that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.    HAVANA OMELET    A case of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an ASTAIRE.    UNCLE TED    A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the toilet, as you should always wait to poop when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.|`|hlq3Eo0haa	u can pluck my strings anytime

Why do you have a bad boy image? Do you act bad? Then change up and show how nice you really are?  You actually have a rare combination--tough on the outside but gentle and kind on the inside. This is very cool. If you can hang on to yourself for the next few years while everything catches up with itself you WILL find a lady who will fit you like a glove. It's perfectly fine to love people, but giving ones heart over too easily can start making you look just the opposite of what you say you're all about. Guard that wonderful sensitive part of yourself, save it for just the right one. If you go around falling in and out of love with tons of girls you'll get the reputation of heartless.

If you hold their hands.|`|PpRvEETQaa	You know that someone loves you when they are willing to spend as much time with you as you might require, and when that person is willing to make changes in order to save the relationship.|`|es9EgQIiaa	because they adore you and would do anything for you and they always want to be around you and call you all the time  everytime they have spare they are there for you|`|MU3EbXHGaa	i don't think anyone can ever no for sure. you just have to be able to trust the person. and since you are asking this question, the possibility of whoever your with loves you is low or you have a low self esteem or maybe your even too paranoid.|`|tVYjNEXmaa	Loveeeeee is HARD TO EXPLAIN!  I mean, I'm only 14...  I WOULDN'T KNOW!|`|lSeI7ksuaa	when they adore you and treat you well. never thinks twice to punch some mother ****** for saying **** about you. :]You will know it if its honestly true.|`|cIF70lGMaa	when u feel like they love u  or when being together feels right....|`|98efbe3dfc34c68b7f5cc8d76ea17619aa	Well, to me, Love is an action word, not a feeling. Someone can tell you "I love you" till hell freezes over. It is a WORD, albiet, a word that feels good, but unless the word "love" is followed up by an action, in my opinion, it doesn't hold a lot of weight. Example, Your boyfriend says "I love You" all the time, yet treats ya like ****, to me that ain't love, it's just a bunch of feel good words that are meaningless. On the other hand, if he treats you good, and "shows" he loves you by those kind of actions, then it could be real love.   Beware, though, sometimes when the old man springs some flowers on ya unexpectatly, he could be feeling guilty about something, but give him the benefit of the doubt at first.
C2olZsNiaa	You have to boost your confidence in some way.  Stop worrying about what your don't have to offer and focus on what you do have to offer.  Most women are mostly attracted to guys with confidence.  Confidence is the key.  I know it is easier said then done but even if you had a lot of money you would still have problems getting a real connection if you don't have the confidence.|`|zprAkP3eaa	Let them come to you, if they want you then they will let it show.|`|VvUxR6qRaa	I think it might be a good idea to put any ideas of a relationship on the back burner for awhile mate.  You need to sort out your own problems and get to a stage where you feel happy and confident.  Women are much more likely to be interested.  All the best!
99532CAkaa	first of all shake those nerves and let this guy know that you like him too before its too late, you don't want to look back on this and say "gosh I wish I could have had the nerve to tell that guy that I liked him too."  and that's after you see him with someone else and thats what will really hurt, so ask yourself "do I really like this guy and can I get the nerve up to tell him or do I want to see him with someone else?"|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Just tell him.  The worst that can happen is that he doesn't like you back.  The best that could happen is he ultimately ends up your bf.  I think the positives definitely outweigh the negatives there.|`|TofmqjUaaa	He is VERY VERY VERY into you. Just casually start the conversation with something like:    So, about that truth or dare     or something like that|`|vMY3EF8baa	just tell him!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT HARD AT ALL!|`|ZR34thBvaa	Show him your boobs.|`|BzKBTv1zaa	jstt telll himm|`|JRM0wwLNaa	Well since u kno already know that he likes u so there is no worries. Just breathe ez and try 2 clam down. By the looks of ur story i can tell he likes u he was prolly just shy 2 tell u as the same u was shy 2 tell him. Be honest with ur answer and if it doesn't go as planned then don't let him noticed that cause at least u guys r good friends and u should always have that relationship.|`|6GFw9gkraa	dont worry bout it! it seems to me that you both like each other equally, so ya got no problem!    Dont over-think it, just do yur algebra, and look straight into his eyes, hold his hand, and tell him how ya feel!    Good luck!    adam|`|cIF70lGMaa	tell him! sounds like hes into u|`|AWwtgcuwaa	Well u should calm down and think and if he dosent like you tell him its ok ull get over it! :D|`|4d5c4ad41e20b88fd01b606f0aafeb2caa	break out into a romantic making out fall back and have sex|`|E9WFPlvVaa	wow, im kind of just like that...im scared of rejection when it come 2 guys. but with situations like that, i kind of figured out what 2 do. when u c him nd u get on the subject of it. tell him u want him 2 tell u first who he like. refuse 2 tell him who u like until he tells u. knowin it is u. when he says its u just b like "well, would u ever go out with me" or if thats too hard ask that b4 he tells u nd say "would u ever go out with this person". when he says yes and tells u its u .........badda bing badda boom u 2 r destined 2 go out =D
Q412OM5gaa	This reminds me of a poster that is in the councilor's office at my school. There are three pictures of a woman. In the first picture, the woman is a little beat up, not much, but you can tell. Below it it says "He loves me". In the second picture she's even more beat up. Below that picture it says "He says he's sorry.". In the last picture she has a black eye and bruises everywhere. Below the picture it says something like "He says he won't do it again.". Don't let this happen to you mom! Talk to her and tell her that he needs to go to counseling/therapy. If he says no, then maybe he doesn't love her as much as she thinks. If your mom won't do anything then tell someone. Maybe a trusted teacher, school counselor, family friend, ANYONE that will help. And definitely call the cops next time he does this! MAKE SURE he does not know that you are calling the police though, this could anger him and that would not be very good at all. You never know when he could take things too far. He is a dangerous person for you to be around as well!|`|FF4J59pMaa	Next time he hits ur mom call the cops! No one should ever let a man beat on them or anyone else! Tell her that you love her with all your heart and she is the only reason why you are trying to support her stupid boyfriend but that you are not gonna let any man mistreat her like that. Tell her she needs to be your example and ask if she would like it if a bf that you had hit you. She wont like it and maybe then she will realize that she has to be your example. Hope this helps and good luck with your situation|`|EqWRgSF8aa	CALL 911  i wouldn't let any bastard hit on my mom|`|SX6yUkyzaa	I've been a police officer for 6 years and when a woman takes a man back after him being abusive its not because she thinks he wont do it again its because she really dose love him even knowing that he could and will do it again when a woman starts to think this way over this kind of situation theres not much that will change her mind until its to late theres only a few things you can do when this happens if your feeling that this guy could hurt you then you need to stay away from him as much as you can if you feel anyones is in danger of being hurt you need to call your local police department sometimes people cant wake up and see whats going on for their self and when that happens is when the situation turns serious but if you will call the police for her that might just be enough to wake her up   good luck kiddo
o8NPR0PNaa	It's not healthy to lose sleep consistently or you body will suffer.  It doesn't show itself right away, but easier to catch colds, more run down, body organs get undue stress, etc.  And count yourself lucky that grades didn't slip before too!      Sorry, a midnight bedtime on weekends is more than reasonable!  Suggest you fight the battles you can win.    ~ Suzi :)|`|4KdC9gwLaa	As a fellow teen with decent grades (not quite 4.0!), I think that a midnight bedtime is a good bedtime.  But, if you must have a later bedtime, try negotiating and settling for something like 1.

Giggity giggity.|`|g6KubppDaa	I think right now that he does, but it sounds more like a friendship other then the fact that he asked your friend to leave. Try flirting with him, and see if he will start to flirt back. If he does, then that probably means that he's into U! : D
GWRP3vLQaa	You are dreaming about a man with whom you didn't have a great relationship and whom you couldn't trust (or was it he who didn't trust you?) Whatever.     That relationship is over and you are having a child with the man you are about to marry. You need to put the past behind you and stop fantasizing about it. You can't love someone you can't trust.     If this guy you are marrying is a good man and treats you right, and you can do right by him, then go ahead with the marriage.  If you don't love him, don't marry him. Time to grow up and stop living in fantasies.|`|ehAG30Yvaa	Whether your relationship with your ex was great or not, you shouldn't be having the thoughts you mentioned when you're about to marry someone else! And just because you're going to have a child with someone doesn't mean you have to get married, right now or ever. If this person is the love of your life and you want to spend the rest of your life with him, then marry him and never look back. But if you don't feel that way about him, save yourself the trouble and don't get married. If he's the man in your life and you're going to have a child, be together, have the child and see how things go. I can tell you from experience that bringing a child into the relationship will change the dynamics completely! It could bring you two closer together but it could also take a toll on the relationship. If you've only been together for a short time then you have no business getting married. You can both be loving & caring parents without being married and rushing in to it is the worst possible thing to do. Your ex may not be the one for you, but this guy may not be either. You will forever be linked to him because of your child but you might realize that the person you are meant to spend your life with isn't him. But only time will tell, if you're not 100% sure and happy about getting married, don't do it. You'll regret it.|`|mkrKHQvFaa	Alot of people wonder how it would have work if they would have stayed with their lost love or if the person they are with is the right one.  If you think you are going to cheat....don't do it.  If you think he is not the right one and you are only getting married because of the child......don't do it.  If you love him with all your heart and you know for sure you can not have the happiness with anyone else that you have with him.....then do it.  I married with doubt.  I divorced.  I am marrying a 2nd time.  No doubt.  No regrets.  Good luck.|`|hbPtndhzaa	i have been there and now i am divorced. when i was married to my ex husband i would always have dreams of someone else. it was almost like my dreams were trying to tell me something but because we had a child together i stayed with him  and got married. well 3 years later he had an affair. listen to your dreams! lucky for me we just went to a jp and got married and he payed for the divorce. its been 6 years now and i finally met the man in my dreams! and we are getting married in 2 weeks. i know your getting married this weekend but think about everything that you are going to be saving by stopping this now. your feeling and his feelings are going to be  crushed and not to mention all the money your going to blow if your having a big wedding.  best of luck to you!|`|3MDY29gnaa	Well i am not really sure.  I mean remember your relationship with your ex was from the past. You are about to get married. you said that you "still love him deep down inside" now no disrespect to you but i dont think that it's right to marry a man and still be in love with someone else. When you get married you are suppose to give yourself to that person. How will you give yourself to him if your not even sure about your past?  Hun i really dont know what's best for you only you do, but i wish you luck in whatever you deside|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	If it makes you feel better 90% of the time we dream of negative things, and your ex was clearly not a positive in your life, this is probably why.    I havent gotten married yet, but advise from friends has always been that regardless of where you are in life and how happy inlove you are, deep down you will always care for your first love, it doesn't mean you want them back, or want a relationship with them ever, but because it was your first love, and such a great time in your life, its hard not to care and reminisce every once and awhile.
CdGOuEmpaa	its a really cool poem!! but just to make sure, u r writing about growing up, and that started when ur babysitter got a disease and was disabled? i love the ... oh i can't remember what their called, but its when u say childhood is a dream and growing up is a nightmare. the news stabbed u in ur heart. etc. those were really cool! i lvoe it
b44WwAMsaa	punch someone and take their lunch and run!|`|ncSd9jXDaa	whatever you do, no matter how accepting they may seem, or how similar you are to them, never EVER hang out with the geeky kids; for although they may seem somewhat friendly and seems to be a better alternative than being alone, people across the school will lose all respect for you.    its a simple fact. plus you start talking like they do, and start talking about geeky stuff like Halo and Guitar Hero...      EDIT: dont do what a few people like Michael suggested... sitting alone won't work. period. you need to make a friend that was in the period just before lunch and say 'hey im gonna sit with you at lunch, ok?" and he'll say 'ok' and it wont be as awkward... think if you just walked up to him and sat down, he and his friends would be like 'uhhhhhh.... hi?'|`|1dNZb7Y4aa	:( i HATE that,  i guess just sit by yourself...  maybe someone will come sit with you.  i mean that normally happens in our school.|`|Ujb6P4gMaa	Go up to someone and talk to them.|`|byWl2fw0aa	I eat my food. Then open a book and start studying for the next class. If someone wants to talk to you...they can. This way you're not invading their 'click'.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	i would try to befriend someone in class and then sit with them at lunch.|`|UrUpWmA7aa	I just kept to myself mostly. It was pretty gay|`|VT7T4m8Saa	hide in the bathroom until i make friends.|`|JxTpCkizaa	skip lunch|`|8KMdXKTLaa	go get lunch and sit somewhere to eat it|`|ze7HgH19aa	Well, sit down with somebody from one of your new classes, friendly looking people, someone also alone, or simply sit alone. Your not a castout if ur new, so give it time =)|`|xu0HiYEOaa	eat..... nah just joking.. you would start off with getting a friend in one of your classes.. Then you would have a friend with you for lunch or you could get something that will be intresting with the rest of the people in your school and let them come to you.|`|MYnH6UKQaa	that happend to me, i sat by myself at first because i was so sad i didnt even care, but lucky me i sat near some nice people that invited me to sit with them :] i guess you just take chances|`|t9rTToWYaa	During the day, I would've talked to someone and sat next to them during lunch.  When I started high school last year, I saw this girl from my homeroom walking alone in the hallway.  We had the same lunch period so I went up to her and asked her if she had lunch, even though I already knew she did.  We walked to lunch together and sat next to eat other.  :)    OR you can hide in the library or bathroom.  xD|`|Tj2xROpwaa	just sit with some people who look cool|`|qhvQDcdfaa	eat your food, its lunch time..|`|SYcH3TCRaa	either sit alone or try to find someoone to hang out with  that seemed nice in class or something
Oi3CQnvHaa	Yes.  Because I think it should be the most stable situation for a family.  If I never intended on having kids, I'd never get married.  It's just my controversial opinion. A lot of people disagree with that.    I think it's supposed to be a safety net for society---to keep a couple mostly monogamous, that keeps society safer--keeps people from contracting and spreading too many diseases.    children by all accounts and through all studies spanning the decades are known to do better--in all aspects of life-- in a committed household where there is a man and a woman and they are married.    The drawbacks, quite honestly, are unique to each couple and depend on the person you marry.  it's really that simple.    If you want good looking, tall kids, marry a tall good looking man, if you want to be happy and stable and secure, marry an easy going, nice guy who's going places.|`|YaB5bpv7aa	Yes i do beleive in marraige and love. being mrried to the right person is very good.  pros being with the right man is awesome. being with the right women is awesome too. being married is wonderful and happy. you share the good times and the bad times. ou have someone to share your love and dreams with, you have someone to sleep with and hold at night.|`|9XZ67Umcaa	Marriage can be beautiful..............I agreed to let my 18 year old daughter marry............and it was a big mistake!    I wanted her to be a virgin when she married.............and now I know that I would much rather have had her shop around more.....................sometimes Mothers make mistakes?    Marriage to the wrong person is terrible?|`|5RoYyprkaa	I believe in marriage. But I can't really tell you the pros because lots of the pros can be experienced by just living together. I like the total committment. Cons would be not being able to sleep with whoever you wanted to, going out all night all the time... splitting everything if you didn't sign a prenup.  .|`|an1EMiFkaa	No way!!!    No way should one person be tied forever to another. We are animals and animals have very rarely stayed with one mate their whole lives.|`|JIATcwW6aa	I do believe in marriage.  I say this after 2 failed marriages, but the first one lasted 27 years.  In retrospect, both of us could have done a lot to prevent the ultimate break-up, but neither of us ever really took time to figure it all out.  Then one day it was just too late.      I think communication is the absolute key.  If you can properly communicate, you can trust your partner and live in a very healthy environment.    Live and learn.
7c363e38856b0bc8f147b3343d70feb7aa	it does matter, maybe not when they are young but as one grows older usually people begin to enter phases in their lives where questions need answers.  at least in my own personal story.  i grew up with my father until the age of 7 then he disappeared showing up once in awhile for holidays,  i grew up with my mother who refused to talk about IT!!  it is unfortunate that the pain of our mothers become the pain of us.  I have a great relationship with my father now and really the relationship between him and my mother was theirs.....when one grows up hopefully they learn to develop their own opinions based on the truth they find and if not, the pattern of life continues on...sometimes denial can be very tricky especially when the truth is painful....in my opinion only  i also lost my mother at the age of 15 and our relationship was based on her pain about her life.  it took me a long time to understand life on its terms, i love them both equally for without them I would not exist.....|`|FF4J59pMaa	Since they haven't had one in their life they probably figure that it is not that important. I had a dad but in a way I didnt. My parents divorced when I was 5 and it hit me hard cause I was a daddys lil girl. I wanted to do everything with him. Well I was always on my dads side and I kind of resented my mom until I was older and realized why my mom left him. Then I started seeing that my dad didnt do things for us because he wanted to. He did it out of obligation which made it hurt even more. Now I have a dad well step dad but he is more of a dad to me then my biological dad. He showed me what a dad is and now I know that you really do need a dad there to protect you, to love you, to show you how a man should really act. Hope this answers your question.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	It ALWAYS matters to the kids that their father is not in the picture,regardless of what any idiot liberal says.|`|GT1ipOvzaa	Well, not all women are like that.  I guess I am a young woman, and I am definately not like that.  My dad passed away 8 years ago, when i was 4. There has never been a day in my life that I didn't wish I could've known him, or that he didn't die. Not a day goes by without me wishing he could come back, but I know that's not possible...  You know, I waited years for him to show up at the door, telling his story about how he never really died, and he had to dig himself out, and he spent years looking for us and was so glad he could be with me, but he can't, and won't.    So, to all that don't like their dad's, think of how much worse it could've been...|`|i27Kmimlaa	I'm not sure if this answers your question but my father was never in my life and the few times I did see him, he was drinking to get drunk or already drunk, so I'm happy I didn't grow up with him, he is damaging to himself and others. He is like a stranger to me and I don't really know him and truthfully, I dont want him in my life, maybe that's cold or careless to say but I think if he had been in my life he would've done more damage than good. And maybe your right, and irresponsibility may run in his family because from the little that I know, my grandpa also left my father and his brothers when they were younger but that's not an excuse. But I never wished him to be dead or anything like that.
QJslTCUBaa	You don't listen to him...do you want him to listen to you?|`|DlCcFu1eaa	You have to listen if you expect to be listened to. You only reap what you sow.|`|iZbgUtxcaa	Get hooked on Phonics, my friend.|`|dTaGzh6Haa	We tend to reap what we sow.|`|35ae746aae90d4f0ba10e9f5ecba492baa	Be open-minded to him and your husband must also be open-minded so that both of you can understand each other.  Also why don't you listen to him and try to understand?  Why not the share your reason why you disagree with him?  He should be able to understand your reasons.  The reason why he is leaving you is that because you two couldn't get along each other, I think that he is a person who doesn't like chaos or war, he wants it by in order and peace.  Be positive, don't let negative emotions ruled over you, it will make it worst.|`|VfuCXCRAaa	Wait you don't listen to him, but you expect him to listen to you!        I'd leave you too, only difference is I'd take the kids with me!    you need to grow up, you can't act so childish in a marriage!  Try communicating!  It usually works!
J7Mmo5Xmaa	He is going to talk to you.However you are not married so he can discuss this with anyone he wishes.If he were committed to you, then it would be his place to talk to you about it.|`|hFNS77cNaa	You should not be worried at all. He just wants to discuss money issues with you.|`|FF4J59pMaa	He is telling you. He just needed to get someone elses opinion. Sometimes it helps to get another persons opinions and especially from a parent. It helps even more when it is a parent. If you don't like him talking about your situations with his parents tell him that. Of course not in a mean way but dont get mad at him because he did that  because he didnt do it 2 be mean or anything so keep that in mind.
vk5R3sCzaa	If the one girl said she would go with you, then you have the option to go with her.  If you really feel like it would just be like going with a friend, then ask a girl you have your eye on!  It's your senior prom, make it memorable and bring the girl of your dreams.  Good luck!|`|LWwGW48Daa	Whats more important?

But definitely GO!|`|zMCpXmivaa	go with the first girl. maybe u guys r good 4 each other and it's time for u to take it a step further. if she didn't like u, she wouldn't have said that she would go with u to the prom in the first place|`|ER7YkDAQaa	Well if you take this girl who doesn't want to ruin your friendship still take her because there might be a slow dance and you might ask her to dance and you guys could be dancing and looking into her eyes and you could win her heart over. Think about it.                                                               Hope i helped, good luck, Emily.

Guys tend to stare at girls that they like, or think they're pretty, or both. :]  Good luck, hon'!|`|DOSUTY74aa	that's a very tough one. it's so hard to understand men nowadays. but the way i see it, i think he likes you. if he stares at you, look at him straight in his eyes. you would know if he's staring at you because he likes you or not. :) good luck!|`|z3RANStnaa	he would probably like to put it in your butt|`|jJoZ1nvVaa	prob do you like him? say hi talk to him!|`|mfQdfg2maa	well that happened to my friend and later on i found out he liked me instead and he was looking at me not her i felt bad so i would say he liked her not me     what im trying to get at is just from eye contact you cant tell|`|rMIpCeY7aa	this is the situation i am in rite now!! he likes u....
Dx23osxWaa	im in 7th grade so i kno wat ur talkig about you should tell ur friend you want to b friends so it dosnt mess up ur realationship and you should start talking to ur crush some more ..... go out of your way to c him thats wat i did and were going out!!!|`|M7wBrpObaa	In this situation you have to follow your womanly instincts. Follow your heart. If you don't like him then don't go out with him. Go for your crush. So you have no classes with him? Get his number and call him. Tell him that your kinda feeling him. Let things go from there. If your crush doesn't work out then im sure you'll find someone else in the future.|`|GUgzfks9aa	don't go out with your friend that would be a mistake that you will regret later just keep it as it is later he will get over it i mean you are only in 8th grade.. try to talk to the other guy that you like find friends in comment so you can start to talk to him.|`|m5a4OcnVaa	1.if he likes you and knows that you like the other guy...maybe he'll sacrifice, and let you go.  2.If he's your guy friend maybe he can be a good boyfriend  3.try talking to your crush...maybe you won't like him  4.give your give friend a chance, maybe hes a good bf.    :)|`|1ZAHgiTsaa	If you don't like him as a boyfriend then don't date him. Just tell him you are really sorry and that you just want to be friends. Most guys will understand, and if he truly loves he will say that he is fine with just being friends.|`|sdt7vPSoaa	If the guy who likes you is your friend give him a chance to dazzle you, then judge it might be easier then!|`|ZR34thBvaa	Have pity sex with him and then move on.|`|GwEZ8uJnaa	don't date him. you can't go into a relationship having doubts about it. that's just setting it up for failure. and if you do so then you are also risking the chance of losing him as your friend. Just because you go out with your buddy doesn't mean your little crush with this other random guy will just go away, and that isn't fair to your friend. don't go there.|`|EdidZdtlaa	tell your guy friend that you just want to be friends. set a boundary line if you know what i mean. tell him that you just wanna be friends with him. dont listen to your friends. listen to YOU. but with your other crush, try talking to him one of these days. and see what happens.|`|VMAhim63aa	you can always try going out with your friend to see how you feel about it and let him know that, theres nothing to loose...you already know how he feels|`|ikekDCRxaa	Don't date your friend, it wont work out. Try not to spend as much time with him as you have been so that he gets the message and hopefully moves on. Ignore your friends and be yourself, if your guy friend doesn't like it then he can go stuff himself.
aNIiGpzeaa	i have always wished for an older brother too! also, ive always wished to be a 'happier' person|`|5c195fa940b1bc2cf1834bf3be0673aaaa	i want to be happy alwayss (: and i want everyone else to be happy too|`|hhXYzv0Haa	no asthma and allergies|`|YfTMBFIIaa	I would wish and wish and wish that my older brother wasn't autistic.  I was always embarrassed when I was little and I felt like I couldn't have friends over because he would be there and I was afraid that they wouldn't want to be friends with me if they knew him.  Now I am over that, but feel like my parents only had a second child so that when I am thirty they can say "Now it's your turn to take care of him.  Make sure he keeps his job at goodwill and lives in a decent place."|`|PyvVuFTOaa	My moms back to be healed.|`|3cGgRo42aa	My two front teeth.|`|LWwGW48Daa	No asthma and allergies|`|83419326a8e663feecc64bea718f1bc0aa	I always wanted many things and I still do:  I always wanted a little sister so I can give her advice and those sort of stuff.  I always wanted to have curly hair but I'm stuck with straight hair. =(  I always wanted to be right handed so I won't smudge the paper but apparently I can't change that.    Everyone wants something but do we really need it?
v1QIWugFaa	i would just start talking too him im sure he will want to date ucuz ur older|`|BicfV5R7aa	I think you should talk to him, race an age don't matter at all.
qe0RNp7xaa	I think men who shave their chest are gay.|`|AA10783710	Gerrardo, it's time you joined the 21st century.    Look in the mirror on a bright, sunny day.  Look hard.  If you have a lot of body hair, you look a little ape-ish.  Some guys have way too much underarm hair.  Trim it.  I'm not saying to shave it off, just take an electric razor and keep it under control, ok?    Hair on your chest, especially your upper chest was only popular in the 1960s and 1970s.  That fad is gone, and I doubt it will ever come back.  Look in fashion magazines.  Or heck, look at Brad Pitt.  You think a hot babe like Angelina Jolie would be so attracted to him if was disgustingly hairy like actor Collin Farrell?  Would Brad Pitt be able to do shirtless scenes in the movies if he were hairy?  No.  And why?  Because it simply doesn't look good, that's it in a nutshell.    Girls in the U.S. aren't lesbian, but they sure are a lot pickier than European girls (so I'm in Europe now, and loving it).  U.S. girls are demanding, so if you aren't using deodorant and practicing good hygiene, you're not going to be popular with girls.    So here's the question:  you wanna be popular or not?|`|CUc2gqzjaa	i think its the media too. but i agree with the media..its gross|`|1whTwTbDaa	There are some women who like hairy chests...why do you think everyone loved David Hasselhoff (sp?) from the show Baywatch? But as for me, an American woman, who is not lesbian in ANY way, I prefer a clean cut, clean shaved, non-hairy man. It is just what I like...I don't like muscle men, or athletes...but I do like non-hairy men that are average and good looking. So, stop being stereotypical...and get a wax, lol.
vk5R3sCzaa	You shouldn't have to deal with her.  She sounds really rude and if she doesn't care about the way she treats you, then she obviously doesn't value your friendship.  I can understand your attachment to her because you have known her for many years.  But, sometimes you just have to let friends go.  I'm sure that you will find much better friends that can respect you and everyone else!
GT1ipOvzaa	I don't think you should talk about it to them, because, think about it. Crazy, girl-crazy 15 year olds would do things like that and now they're 28, they've moved on. 15-year-old guys are all about girls+sex, they're 28 now. no worries.    but i do think you should tell your parents about it, just so they know. if they start getting mad about this, tell them what i said about girl-crazy 15-year-olds and how they're past it now, its been 13 years.  just remember, it's not your fault (people that have been abused often blame themselves-i got this from the secret life of the american teenager, so...)    good luck, and im so so sorry|`|JyvG8dFcaa	yes talk to your folks about what happened...you need to be reassured that it wasnt your fault...also since he was so much older to you, he could still be doing that to little kids...ya never know, bring it out in the open.|`|ezKWwpdQaa	yeah seriosly dont tell anyone,its in the past.  only gunna bring out drama&problems/|`|u2gf6AwWaa	noo. i wouldnt. i mean, ifits in the past, leave it there.
E7WnoWT8aa	Women should keep their bush! I want my partner to look like a real woman, not a 10 year old girl !! Hair is a lot more sexy. I can't believe so many girls have fallen for this shaving obsession, all started by men with teenage virgin fantasies, or worse still, with paedophile tendencies. Now many poor girls have even begun to think that hair is dirty! Someone has really been screwing with their brains!    Any man who prefers a woman to look like a child, I would be very suspicious about.|`|92iuiuZKaa	Yes there is a big difference between shaven and trimmed. this one guy I knew liked it trimmed very low. this is other i knew liked it shave and this other liked a bush. so I think it just depends on the man|`|f2hfuMKFaa	lol idk. sure it is :) it depends on what it looks like. ask people u know lol|`|Molu004zaa	It's all about the Aesthetics - or the looks in other words. Visually, going completey hair-free LOOKS a heck of a lot better. In my opinion, it's also a lot more hygenic. If you wanna keep trimming, then keep trimming. You don't HAVE to shave for guys if you don't want to. But if you DO want to go bare, why not get a professional wax? Don't wimp out because you're 'scared of the pain' - if you don't want bumps and ingrown hairs, GET IT DONE!|`|G0KEMulSaa	imnot a guy im just curous of the answwer|`|ZR34thBvaa	I'm not an explorer.    I don't want to trek through no jungle to get some vagina.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Have you tried waxing?  It really does itch when it grows back.  Laser hair removal is great but you don't get any of those things you mentioned, but it kinda hurts when you're having it done and it's sort of expensive.    Why don't you just ask the guy you're sleeping with.  Different guys like different things.  I've known guys who love it and guys who hate it.  So ask him what he likes the best.  He might not even care at all and then why waste time worrying about it?|`|qjuqSq7Gaa	well... i prefer shaven. but you should trim close and then shave. go down first then up. use lots of shaving cream and lotion after|`|fMpKj0DYaa	MMk. So only shave if thats what YOU want. All guys are different they like different things. Some guys like it when girls shave and some like it when they dont and then some just dont care. If he loves you he will let you decide.    Now. If you want to shave down there. To avoid bumps and stuff makes sure and put lots of shaving cream on then shave over it once. Do not go over it more than once UNLESS it has a decent layer of shaving cream on it. I know it will be tedious but it gets the job done. Make sure and get the inside too the same way. Its really not as scary as you think. I used to think so too but it really isnt bad. After you shave put lotion on it everyday. It is only itchy the first few times you do it. But it wears off. And I dont think that hair gross back funny. It just grows back.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	You're making this too complicated. Let's put it this way, do you like getting hair in your mouth?|`|kVc0e6RZaa	wait do you mean mopped? You cant shave your house. Okay I'm connfused.|`|R0U4qy6haa	i hate going through the bush to find what i would like to eat:)|`|YVRXdfGHaa	Most of the immature guys, who have only porn or their experience playing "doctor" with little girls, will tell you that they like it shaved or waxed. ( waxed is a better bet )    However, most mature and caring guys will be quite happy with a scissor trim. I'll even take it natural, but I would rather my tongue be able to reach its goal without having to break out the lawn mower.    It is your body. It is your right to present yourself however you wish. If a guy doesn't like it when he gets close enough to see, then get dressed immediately, and show him the door.|`|mtV7dWJHaa	I believe they do like it better shaved or at least trimmed.  My previous SO even did it for me.  That was a lot of fun for both of us. The itching is quite a nuisance I have to admit, but if he thinks "she's" prettier that's what counts.  Just tryin' to keep my guy happy!|`|r7tllHjuaa	Uh, anyways....if you are scared about shaving then trim, lol wtf.  Unless you are planning on having sex you might as well grow a bush.  Aha.|`|iBkO2o0haa	if i were you i'd make an aarow or something sexy pointing down. something he wont be expecting ;) i like that|`|aIj5W3lBaa	Hey Girl!        Though I am a female, I can tell you from experience guys LOVE a girl who is bare down below. Also sex will feel much better for you!         Your best option is of course waxing as others have said. However, in this economy $70 a month can get difficult. If you must shave here is how to avoid the bumps:  1. Exfoliate VERY well. I'm talking a loofah and a scrubbing exfoilant.  2. Use a fresh razor  3. Use a good quality shaving cream or lotion for "sensitive skin".  4. When finished shaving use an after shave lotion for bikini, you can find one at a drug store.  5. The best product EVER is Wax and Relax "Get the Bump Outta Here".  I mean it is AMAZING. Put it on after shaving and for a few days afterwards (get it online) and you will not get bumps!  6. Exfoilate in the shower (again with vigor) each time you shower.     I can almost guarantee you will not get bumps!
nldpobkGaa	i thnk i wuld be nervous to talk to me at first because i can look kind of mean but when i got to know me i would know i was actually really nice and tell anyone else who thought that i wasnt that bad|`|seMpUL8Kaa	Hmmmm, I'd think that I have a great taste in music, but my anger issues and depression wouldn't make me want to be around myself for long periods of time. Though, I would love to have a friend who cares so much about her friends. :)|`|CUc2gqzjaa	id do me|`|X88lyKHoaa	hmm..  i actually don't think i would/  it's weird. but idk.  but i probably would(:|`|JQDAO34caa	I used to seem unique, and strange when I would look at my own life, but in reality, i am not too strange, but still in my mind I think I am. it' s all about you and what you are thinking because you are a unique, and special person. that is what makes you YOU, so you have respect and love for yourself!!!! who knows, you might become famous because of your individualality!!|`|hAaa8H1faa	well i am trustworthy, kind, and don't make drama and cuss people out for no reason, or be violent and evil to anyone. i mind my own business, so yea, why not?  rofl  i love to speak about anything and i keep others convo a secret and don't tell anyone|`|MKJAobeVaa	If I was a guy, I'd look up to him. If i was a girl, I'd get wet.    Sorry if I'm cocky... I'm just too awesome.
8GvVWgFPaa	i had the same problem with my husband (but this was when we were dating).  I wanted to be up his *** like ALL the time. He ended up being like what the HELL! It did hurt my feelings, but I ended up going to clubs with my gfs, went to the beach to relax, spent a girls day out with my little sister, go to the movies with your gfs, have a days out with your mom, budget your finances. Hell, stay on Myspace 3 hours a day. Go to sex shops and buy oils & lotions and kinky outfits and suprise him that night. Leave little notes (dirty or just sweet) around the house for him when you leave knowing he'll spot them and keep him wondering. The more your clingy, the more he'll push away. I was with my husband for 4 years b4 we got married. we'll be married for 2 years this year. But we argued for a whole 1 in half years before we understood each other. being in a relationship is hard but being married is the HARDEST job anyone could ever imagine. Believe me, now I'm at home ALL day and he works two jobs. I get to spend only monday nights and Thursday nights with him and Im pregnant. He has missed some pregnancy appts. but he is providing for our family. Just trust him, and leave him alone. Believe me, you'll feel a lot better yourself too. but don't get too comfy bc he might get stuck up ur *** if he feels your not spending anuff time with him. Thats what my hubby did. I started living the independant & single life again and hubby didnt like that. I wasn't flirting or flaunting it, but i felt more confident and free! I was out shooting pool til 1 am.lol. He wasnt too fond of it, but I was giving him space, and he said that it was too much space. Guys are hard to please, just like we're hard to please. BOTH sexes don;t know WHAT WE want....lol good luck and i hope this helps!|`|3VrZGegiaa	Grab a chair and your laptop and try to engage him in HIS interests instead of complaining. =P After some time making the effort to do things he likes; suggest things you like. If he takes interest in your likes, your good-to-go! if not he needs to.     This kind of give and take relationship is what it takes imo.|`|ubj2hZWZaa	you and he need to make some kinda compromise.  If you give him his space what is he giving you?    a compromise is in order; of course this is only an opinion.|`|TsCMDYEkaa	Find your own interest and get involved in them ...get the juice of life independently of your partner for he may not always be there and what do     you get left with? an empty life. it is Not healthy or beneficial for you! Study, read, learn cooking , gardening, music, drumming , exercise so many things to choose from good luck !!|`|d39dc2a48a86bf08c5bfb20d68522559aa	You do need to give him his space for part of the day. Go out with your girlfriends, go shopping, read a good book, write poetry, cook some meals to put in the freezer for days you don't feel like cooking, paint your toenails, etc. You can find things to do to fill a few hours, can't you?|`|BQGHIoIqaa	don't contact each other often
IYgTS1eiaa	I have a delema lately. My bff i told her i like her. at first it ruined are friendship, now we are getting better and she doesent care. but i am gonna tell her i love her tomorow.   HONESTLY!...  I think its not a good idea to rehears a speech.   but some key phrases will be good.    Like dont say all u said in that paragraph, but say those phrases for example  You say a phrase or 2, let her talk, then continue. just be yourself.    and if i were a girl, i would be really flatterd and want to be your friend.  BTW, that promiss thing at hte end, smart but the way u worded it sounds dorky.  Maybe, dont say that at first, then after you talk for abit, say  "Can u promiss this wont change our friendship?"  doesent sound as dorky, timing is better.    Hope i helped.|`|EyiCVm6Oaa	no i don't hink it's stupid. it's really good!|`|9vYShoKgaa	That's not stupid at all!! It's really sweet. I would be so happy that the person told me how they felt and were being honest with me|`|tsdHndRhaa	yes, tell her you only got this life and who knows what could happen between you two.|`|FiCl71flaa	I think it is a sweet ,personal, and sensitive piece. I also believe it is a piece  that needs to be read by the person for whom you intend it. Having said that, you also ask how I would react rather than how she would react. When all is said and done ,that is the most important question that requires a response. While  her reaction is an open one , you will have none unless you let her read it. That is what I suggest you do ; send it to her or give it to her  any way you choose but let her get it. Then it becomes a waiting game until she lets you know how she feels about it. You sound like a sweet , gentle , and loving guy and I truly hope and wish that  the young lady would recognize that and things will go the way you want it to go . I wish you the best.|`|5MxKdoixaa	I've had a guy do this to me and, while it was romantic, I ended up having to cut him out of my life. A lot of circumstances that caused that, I didn't want it to happen, but he wouldn't drop it or just act normal around me. Our relationship was forever changed and could never go back. Only time we were able to hang out was when he was seeing someone, because he never cheats, but after they broke up, he ended up losing me too... over something stupid.     If I were you, and she meant this much to you, maybe its just how she is so supportive of you that you love her? Would you want to lose that?|`|3IRnGPAcaa	sweet. tell her.|`|K4emL77jaa	You know the best way to tell a girl you like her is from your heart. Don't think about it. Don't ask anybody just do it. You never know you might be to late by the time you write a poem for her. DO IT NOW!|`|cYf5IacRaa	Awww! That's unbelievably sweet! You should totally tell her how you feel. :)|`|s9omDmHWaa	If you told me that I would understand and no I don't think it's stupid. Just tell her at the right time and not when you can embarrass yourself.|`|M5SK3CM3aa	im really sure she or he is gonna think its really sweet and no its not dumb|`|fHHeal1Vaa	i wish i could turn back time and wipe away all the bad things that happened. i wish i could get back the first time you but it cannot be like that. you wanted it to be deeper but it turned it a nightmare you couldnt know that you would have destroyed it completely maybe that is what yo wanted in the first place to prove there was fake. for me it wasnt every word every letter every thought was real
EZm6uiFraa	You need to remind yourself not to loose your temper and hit him or go crazy, just look at him and think, what is he gaining from this? He clearly thinks he is winning, so take that away from him. Just don't give him what he wants, so you can ignore him or refuse to take part in what he is doing, but you need real patience for that. I suggest when he is being annoying that you remain calm and tell him you dont want an argument. good luck|`|U36GI9FUaa	1. that is not a question   2. that is wrong to say to a boy like me  3. your hot|`|afWoScNbaa	Ignore him, eventually he'll go away. And if he doesn't and is still persistent, well then it gives you something to be amused about that he has nothing better to do but attempt at getting a reaction out of you.|`|z4G3TXyLaa	Ignoring him is the best thing to do. Eventually he'll get the hint and back off.
m6FPXCeuaa	i think he has a crush on you and since your good looking, i dont think he even cares if your his niece...i wouldnt bring it up to him , he probably is just as embaressed as you are|`|GT1ipOvzaa	Aww, i feel so bad for you!!    Here are my thots:    -Use a light joke like "awkwwwwarrddd..."    -He's just as embarassed as you are! No worries, he'll pretend like it never happened! Go along with it!    -He was checking you out!? whoaa, gross!    -Accuse him of coming into your room while you were taking a shower and tell him off! it's easier than having to talk about it...    -Act like it's no big deal, just act like "whatev, you saw me naked, so what?" as if tons of guys have seen you naked and it's not a big deal if ur uncle did    -Have a little fun, accuse him of checking you out! He'll be as red as a tomato (do this if u can, i know how embarassed you must feel right now...)    so so so sorry for that! i feel so bad for you. if he kind of ignores you or bails out on plans n stuff kick it into accusing him! it'll work like a charm  i hope i helped! update us on how it turns out!|`|YH7cvYHkaa	you are a beautiful woman,and even though he is your uncle,he is also a 26 yr old man with normal hormones,I think it would probably be hard not to want to look(not being sick,just honest)but he did run out of the room,if you are good friends then you should talk to him about it,maybe make a joke to see how he reacts.You don't want it to be uncomfortable from now on.And if you don't say anything he might pull away in your friendship,embarrassed about the fact that not only did he see you but probably liked it which will make him uneasy around you,I think it will end up being something you joke about in the future.Good luck,hope your friendship remains..|`|O5gvRj8Naa	nah, don't say anything just let it go put it behind you otherwise he'll be thinking of it when you start talking to him.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	don't say anything to him, that will just make it more awkward, instead just act as normal. and in no time things will be normal.|`|jfDggfMCaa	in some families if they are close enough it's normal,that everybody is pretty familiar with everybodies bodies beyond the faces.Though,as everywhere is not as zany anymore as Finland,Japan or Norway,etc and they have lost this familiarity,the events may happen accidentally as it did to you.Imagine it would have happened to you seeing him.Think how you may have felt,and so is probably he.  Well,welcome to the rest of the World.It is just a matter of getting used or see past through.You both pretty much know what everybody has under the clothes from the beach,pool,etc.Now he knows the little(or generous you) left,but as he is your uncle -and a friend one-,and even closer to you by age,he will know how to respect and care your "secrets",as in all else.Just another unexpected event of closeness to keep more the mutual trust.  Imagine if either one of you had to take care or help with the event of a body paralized by accident,like it happened to Chris Reeves.Family is for that and more    PEdit_Ah,yes talk to him,talk each other and be honest,no reason for false modesties no more,as it should be.if I were your uncle,and because the closeness in age,probably more like an older brother,I would feel very proud of you if I liked what I saw (but I am much more used and maybe because i am a relative I may already consider all in my family so)and probably that is what kind of embarrased him.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	No either keep your door locked or get dressed in the bath room hon.|`|wQEdey24aa	oh my gosh!!!  that is very embarassing...i can imagine what you must be feeling but don't worry about it, try not to make it awkward because im sure it was very embarassing for him too.....just pretend it never happened and im sure u wouldn't, but since u mention he was kinda checkin u out, don't flaunt ur cleavage more ...cover it up. And NO, dont talk to him about it, itll just be weird and he'll get even more embarassed talking about it. Just let it go :-)|`|afWoScNbaa	Make a joke. Tease him, turn it to his embarrassment. (that's the mean way to go).    But seriously, if you can make a light hearted joke like "haha,awkward right?"  or just laugh and say something, it should be fine. As long as you show you'll live and he shows the same, your good.|`|FF4J59pMaa	I wouldnt talk about it. I don't think that he meant to check you out but it is human nature. I do not think that he is like going to be staring at you or anything so I would just forget about it. I've walked in on people to and if you talk about it it is even more awkard. I've walked in on my brother, cousin, and a family friend. Yeah I need 2 start knocking on doors lol. I know what you mean about the boobs thing. I am a 40 D so I know exactly how you feel.|`|vtHkIscFaa	idk..if ur really good friends than just take it as a joke.

htZvZyrJaa	I suppose it like the phrase "you know when you've found 'the one'" in the sense that you just know when your heart is broken or breaking.    It starts with the blur just below the end of your sternum, that feels a bit like butterflies but the feeling just doesn't go away.    Then you get the general low mood that really warns you of the pain ahead.    Now the feeling of hopelessness becomes intermittently present, making you just feel like resting your head in your hands and thinking "oh fudge, this doesn't look good" etc.    Now a few tears may appear, just when the general topic arises, such as when listening to songs with particularly poignant lyrics.    A few restless nights are to follow, but not ones of great severity.    When your heart is broken comes the full on hit of heartbreak, the crippling stomach pain, inability to stop crying, restlessness, staggered breathing, inability to eat or sleep, complete loss of any motivation, the massive lump in your throat, possibly headaches or a compulsion to listen to music, the hindering nausea and occasional vomiting.    To be entirely honest, getting over it depends on the individual. Some can just genuinely push it out of their minds whilst others can never forget. Therefore, I think anybody suffering should just try to find the motivation to spend time with friends and talk about the things you have that really matter. True friends will give you the comforting attention you need without making you feel stupid or incapable.    But if you want to listen to music, don't pick songs that are already of great significance to you or with deep lyrics / emotional sentimentality, because I have tainted many songs that now just drag me back to the fuzzy "butterflies".|`|YCmveH6laa	do many things and keep yourself busy.    Its very hard at the beginning but as time goes on, you will realise that you wouldn't need to keep yourself busy anymore, then you will realise that you are not heart broken anymore.    REMEMBER WHEN I SAY THIS OK =)|`|UThG15FLaa	-  There is no really medicine, for a broken heart.  which is to bad, all you can really honestly to is wait it out.  Or - Going out on the town, is a good way of forgetting about it for a little while. But when your heart has been broken pretty much all you want to do is Mope around.    A heartbreaks emotional, and pretty much all you can do it wait it out.  (there's always Ice cream)    Gd luck,  ?|`|1YXmUin4aa	You will know when your heart is broken because it feels like the whole world will collapse because you get a sense of being unloved. If you are deeply hurt then you will feel maybe rage or sorrow, but it will not be the same as getting your heart broken, you should be able to tell the difference.    To get over a broken heart you will need time, time and a good pal to help you througth with it. Some people get through it by moving on and searching the horizon for better things to do, while others find it easiest to keep thinking and dwelling about that thing that keeps your heart aching until your heart repairs itself. All you need is time, and it will all be better.|`|Up6wkVLvaa	'Having a broken heart' is just metaphorical language and has no actual precise meaning that you can confirm by looking it up in the dictionary or on an encyclopedia.  In order to think straight and be true to yourself you need to shake off this language that clouds the mind and disperses meaning and learn to feel how you feel.  Feelings can't really be put into words and no one can accurately give you advice on your life based on their lives as everyone is different and everyone is fighting their own battle.  You know how to get through this but not everyone has fully mastered how to go to yourself for advice.|`|shb1309caa	There's no such as heart break, you may be hurt, but i have this friend, who constantly has her "heart broken" but that i real just an expression, but she takes it so litterally, saying "her heart hurts" and i'm just like, then go see a doctor, but it's not heartbreak, she just let herself fall, and was hurt. There is no such thing as heart break. Sorry. I'm sure you are hurt though, and i'm sorry. I've been through this before, you just have to move on, and know there are better things waiting for you. Keep yourself busy, and have fun with your life. You only get one.  Take care.|`|SgKFNuHAaa	i would say  that when your heart is broken you can not see another person with the same eyes you saw the person that broke your heart...when you are deeply hurting you can try to give other people a chance and it won't take as long to heal a heart in pain as it would to heal a broken one...better to heal the wound then to pick up the pieces of a broken heart...|`|mEhpDcQraa	Havent got through it yet..:( i suppose deeply hurt..you will get over it quicker ..heart broken when you cant stop thinking about it and when you do you feel all sad ? i dont know..:(|`|10cnKUpxaa	Just think to yourself, what would Chuck Norris say? The true pure answer then becomes clear....|`|MtW4K43Aaa	Bro, when your like kyle when you break up with your girlfriend your heart is truly broken... if u dont wake up every morning and think of "them" then you really had no point in dating in the first place.|`|BuQSBF8baa	you can always tell when your heart is broken. you just have this pain that you feel all the time, and you cry a lot and you just feel like crap after it happened. The best way to heal is going out and doing fun stuff with friends, or doing things that will keep your mind off of things.|`|71WZTIKOaa	well if your heart is broken, youll know......youll be more depressed than words can describe....    nothing can really help.....turn to your friends and have some fun, eat ice cream, watch either really sad movies so you dont feel so bad or really funny ones......or turn to art, listen to music, write a song.....try to move on because someone better always comes along and the longer you dwell on it, the harder it will be to find anyone else. keep your mind open|`|wFWytGlxaa	I can't really explain it.    Deeply hurt -- when somebody betrays your trust.    Heart is broken -- when you have expressed your feelings towards someone, and they take it throw it back at you I.E. cheating.    Just my 2 cents|`|t9rTToWYaa	Heartbreaks are part of the pains in human life.  You know your heart is broken when you're deeply hurt.  You have to deal with it and move on.    The first thing is to get all your anger and frustrations and emotions out.  Throw plates, stomp on the ground, cry it out, let it go.    Second, lose all communications with that person.  Don't go peeking at their myspace or anything, it'll only hurt you more if you see that they've moved on and stuff.    Third, you wait.  Time will eventually heal your broken heart.  Find some new hobbies, enjoy life, surround yourself with people that you and love you back.  Listen to songs that mean that you've moved on from the heartbreak.  I suggest "Starts with Goodbye" by Carrie Underwood.  Start believing in love, prince charmings, and happily ever afters again and know that your knight-in-shining armor is still out there.|`|X2eVfKc6aa	Its hard but someone better always comes along!|`|7gfNIajYaa	I suppose real heartbreak is something you truly feel for a long time,like an emptiness and not being able to smile or not think about it. The thing about being heartbroken is that you need to have good mates around you who know how you feel,mates can pick you up and be there for you,and bring you out of it. I was deeply hurt over my ex (thats ages ago) but I got over it myself,and I had my mates around me,I dont think Ive ever been heart broken.    I guess as cheesy as it sounds,your mates and family are the glue that put you heart back together again.And its up to you how to go about it as well.|`|HsWFqn1naa	if your a girl ice cream and movies  if your a guy beer and and bars    or if you an emo write terrible poetry and post it on your blog

GT1ipOvzaa	hahah, i just read the other answers and the one before mine is a joke (not literally) but dont listen to them...    go behind ur brother's back and when he asks you about it, just say you're friends with him. if he says something bad about the guy or says not to be friends with him tell him it's none of his buisness or say something like "so now i cant have friends. great. all because of ur paranoia."    you're going to have to say stuff like that so he gets off ur back and lets you be you! ( ik how cheesy that sounds but still....)  if u start going out then let him know, sometimes brothers are freaks (like mine), but sometimes JUST SOMETIMES, they're right.    good luck with the guy and ur bro...glad mine isnt protective...unfortunately i cant date so i cant take advantage of the situation haha.    hope i helped!  -lost-|`|FF4J59pMaa	Brothers will always be protective. My brother is 13 and I am 19 and he is even protective of me. You need to tell him because it is worse to find out from somebody you don't know. Tell him that nothing is happening but you just want him to hear it from the horses mouth. If he gets to protective then tell him that but dont get mad because he is being protective because that is what brothers do. Hope this helps!|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	He will find out and here's something YOU need to understand.Your brother knows and understands guys your age and his age better than you do because he is a guy, thinks like a guy, knows the OTHER guys and hears them talk about things they do not let the girls hear hon.  Listen to what he has to say.
aN8CeTsoaa	just talk to her about it.|`|eUUcriANaa	I think you should not say anything. You were punished for something you did and you need to deal with it. If your mom and dad brings it up you should be like I know what I did was wrong and I know I am not going to get to go. If they think you have learned your lesson they may change their mind and let you go but I do not think you should ask to go.|`|LLQLjlEpaa	wats semi formal????????
vVxM4sPIaa	Being mean to him when you were younger is not the same as him physically abusing you now.  =(  I'm sorry you have to go through this and not have the people you depend on most to help you.  You have a  very immature brother with low self esteem....  I guess the best thing to do is call the KidsHelpPhone.  Really.  I went through this with my brother too.  And my Mom always took his side no matter what... He stopped when he started going out with friends a lot and having girlfriends.  He was like 14 when he stopped I think.  Good luck.

His parents, family and friends must be very prejudice.  If I were you, go on with the marriage.  You and your fiance have each other and are starting a life together.  Nothing should stand in your way.  His family etc. will eventually get use having you for a daughter-n-law.    You are starting a new life as husband and wife.  Enjoy it.  Good Luck!  And congratulations.|`|oMIxJTO1aa	Let him choose what he wants not his family!|`|YaB5bpv7aa	If they love him as they say they will ccept you in the family.  he loves you very much and dont want to lose you, dont leave im, marry him. love is more important then what others say. you and him have to live togetehr not him and them.|`|VnvGC190aa	Are you happy with him? Do you love him? Let him know how you feel about him AND the situation.     Can you live with the fact that his friends/family dont like you and will probably not like you for awhile? I am sure they will loosen up eventually especially after your marraige.    If you truly love him and care for him, if he truly makes you happy then you shouldnt be the one to call off the wedding. Just make sure he understands what he is doing and what he is going to go through by marrying you. Let him make up his own mind. After you talk to him give him a couple days to think about what he wants to do. If he still wants to go through with it then you to should put every effort into each others happiness. I can already tell he is going to need your support as well as your families since his family and friends have made it clear that they wont be there for the two of you.    Good Luck.
A8F4HF3Paa	Well, I've never had any plastic surgery myself but I certainly can understand why people might want to.  You only get one life and if having a big nose or tiny boobs makes you feel like you're not attractive, why not change it so you can feel good about yourself?  I mean, we control our weight so we can stay thin.  We do our nails so they look better. Why judge someone because they want to fix something they perceive as an imperfection?  Now if they keep having surgery after surgery, they probably have a deeper self esteem issue, but lots of people get the one thing fixed and then go on with their lives feeling better about themselves.    Think of it this way, if you got in a car wreck and smashed out your two front teeth, should you just go through life toothless because that's what God wanted to happen to you?  Or would you go to a dentist and get new teeth put in?  Who would fault you for that?  I wouldn't.|`|xxSGhywoaa	I know a few people that have reconstructive surgery because of dumb stuff:    getting run over by her own vehicle because she was too drugged up to know any better,    Falling out of a third story window because his pipe was thrown out along with a stash     A girl I know had to get reduction at the age of 14 because she was already in a triple d.      So with this added information NO I wouldn't date somebody that had plastic surgery.|`|1fcb7562596b52ad171b00f259e7e947aa	um okay?|`|UF6KcXDvaa	i agree with you! stick 2 ur gunz!|`|ep8iy5YNaa	yea plastic surgery is stupid. unless its a serious health issue i say dont get it. does your outward apearence really define who you are?|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	What if someone is severely burned as a child and has plastic surgery to keep other kids from making fun of him/her? Does that make them any less of a person than you? Quit being so damn shallow and appreciate people for what's on the inside. Your opinion of these people probably isn't helping their self esteem much anyways.|`|uVH046Fjaa	Who gives a crap? Go away.    Another Laura G? Are you serious. I'm really sad that alternate Laura G is a dumbass. Anyway, you should be more concerned about just getting a date first before worrying about who to date, buddy.|`|jpAzVmG0aa	It's like you're saying those people are shallow.  But the fact that you'd never date someone who's had plastic surgery says the same about you.|`|1hcupwT4aa	I wouldn't shut out everyone who's had plastic surgery. Some people are given the lovely gift of low self esteem, so they go out and do something about it. I personally think that's better than moping around and not being comfortable in your own body if you have other options.    Plus, what about people who get in car crashes or freak accidents and are stuck horribly disfigured? They can get plastic surgery... that doesn't make them any less of a person.|`|hH76CdQ1aa	i agree with you.|`|0AxzqheHaa	Have you ever thought about how having small breasts or a large nose might be like for a certain person. It can make them lack in confidence, and can decrease their ability to do their best because of it. Ok, so some people go overboard but there's nothing wrong with a bit of surgery. It's a similar thing with make-up, a bit and it can enhance your natural features, and a lot makes you look like a wannabe wag Jordan / Jodi Marsh impersonator  Don't be so quick to judge  Peace  X|`|fMpKj0DYaa	Listen. For someone who talks about appreciating God's gifts you are very narrow minded and un willing to be accepting. I'm pretty sure you could be called a hipocryte. Just because someone gets plastic surgery doesnt automatically mean they dont have self esteem. Yes I'm sure there are some out there that may have self esteem issues, but most people that have self esteem issues dont develop those on their own.     If you really love someone or care about them then it wont matter if they have had plastic surgery or not. That's their decision. Quite frankly the only 'fake" person I can see in this is you.|`|F3RhxZ1Maa	you said it yourself, they have low self esteem. obviously theres nothing about yourself youve ever hated so you have no place to judge.    ive never had plastic surgery and i dont plan to, but if people do then thats their choice.    because someone felt uncomfortable about a part of there body and decided to change it, theyre unmarriable?    youre so ignorant and it really makes me upset that theyre still uptight people like you in the world who think theyre perfect, looking down on people that have problems with their bodies.    so, to sum up:  it really doesnt affect you so stop being so judgmental and imagine what its like to be trapped with a body you hate.    **** you|`|IoncQbR7aa	i wouldnt that makes some women look insecure about them selfs|`|1ZAHgiTsaa	What is the point of this question??? If someone wants to date someone else then they should go for it.|`|E9WFPlvVaa	Some people get made fun of for features that they lack and others dont. So they get a low self asteem. and when u r'nt happy with yourself, neither is no one else. so they get it changed nd boost up their self asteem. then others want them. i personally dont see the big probloem.,,,if u liike a girl but u dnt want her bcuz ur a boob man nd she doesnt have big boobs then y wudnt she change that to make u want her?? =D|`|PNA7f0q3aa	I wouldn't date a person with plastic surgury.   True beauty is staying natural and yes like you said accepting with what you have, not getting some bulges of fat on your chest or making your face any prettier. that just proves your insecure of yourself.
RAGAcJV7aa	honey give him the benefit of the doubt first this will make you look like a winner in the end. sit down with him and tell him if you do find out he s cheating tell him im divorcing you taking the kids and getting everything . this may scare him into straightening out . but by chance if he is screwing around the decision is yours. can you live with his deceit must try again with him. if not divorce him get agood lawyer and take everything this will surly teach him avaluble lesson that there is no such thing as free sex.|`|QJslTCUBaa	Well, good for you!|`|YaB5bpv7aa	yes sounds like hes being a lying scumbag  just like my ex was and still is.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	Wow!

Scare the living crap out of him and squeeze every ounce of information he has out him. Then, divorce him and take everything. Serves him right.

I'm glad you called his work and found out he was lying.  Its not fair to be lied to.  What was his excuse for not telling the truth.  You are going to have to try to keep it cool for a while,  and next time he goes out rent a car or something and follow him,  or have a friend do it for you to avoid getting caught.  It's sad to say  but sometimes when we have a bad feeling about something it's because we are right.  Well good luck.|`|dTaGzh6Haa	Uh oh...guess you know what this means.

JQDAO34caa	no, that is fine as long as you are true to them and not a "best freind with benefits". which it sounds like you aren't so who cares what they say, they are probably jealous since  they can't keep it in their pants where you can.

Kr09aQJkaa	You don't have to screw everyone in town to have a fulfilling sex life after marriage. This doesn't make much since to me anyway. Everyone is different with their likes and dislikes in the bedroom. You don't need 10 ex lovers to find out what the new one likes.     I know many who have had only one sexual relationship and they have no desire to have sex with other people.     I'm not saying everyone should wait for marriage just that no one should treat sex in such a casual way.|`|YaB5bpv7aa	Its not right to have sex before ur married but since ur two adults its on u what to decide|`|9KqcP8mAaa	I'm in the same boat you are.  I've been dating my boyfriend for two years now and we're both waiting for marriage.  Though the temptation is strong (and has been in the past with my other relationships I thought would last forever) we're in agreement that it will be better after marriage.  Obviously, we're both talking theory, as neither he nor I have had any "experience."  I think that on our (I hope) wedding night, we'll be happy we waited.  Again, this is just my personal opinion and you need to make up your own mind.  Just remember, "if you stand for nothing, you'll fall for everything."|`|2WKN9kZiaa	if you love her.... if you have sex before marriage, most likely you will think that sex isnt the MOST important thing in a relationship and will probbaly have hopes of improving sex... and therefore will end up staying with that person ANYWAY!!   if you have sex before marriage you will know if you are compatible or not, but like i said before... love is blind and you wont end up separating JUST BECAUSE the sex isnt good!!  I say wait until marriage, its that much more exciting!! how exciting is a honeymoon where you've previously explored the glory in your loved ones body!!!?  thats why people that have previously had sex always go to exotic and far away resorts for their honeymoon because since they already know what sex is like they just take a vacation, BUT for newlyweds that have those nervous feelings and anxieties a bed in a hotel is all that matters!!!!  wait! its that much more exciting and important, you will get to know her and hence know what to do to make her feel good.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	YES! Remaining a virgin until you marry is ridiculous. The wedding night is no time to find out your spouse's sex drive and/or proclivities. Sexuality is too important in a relationship to guess about it, wait and hope you're compatable. Knowing how to please your spouse is the right way to go on the wedding night. People who don't have sex before marriage are, I suspect, just too scared to.|`|VH4YeaZYaa	Wait until after marriage it is better.
LEA9D9xlaa	Ya, i agree with the first answer. You also first have to have patience and think of how much you want this. Having motivations is helpful! And about patience, I am not good with that. I like a boy and i don't want to smother him, but i also pretty much think of him ALL THE TIME! It's hard to resist not you know, texting him every day or stuff like that. And don't worry, i feel like im gonna have a heart attack even when i think about talking to him, but this just goes right back to wanting it. If you havn't talked to her too recently, think of how great she is and that may help you. As far as first moves go, try to be charming and like the first answer says, find common interests, because that makes it easier to chat...which is good! Most likely when she starts getting to know you, she may start to like you if start the friendship that way...do you know what i mean? You dont want to get too chummy, because then it would just be weird for you two to date, buti do know how freshman girls work...chances are she may start to like you too;)    ----------------------------  Im so sorry if this is confusing i have a problem with organizing my thoughts...i hope you get the majority of it atleast ^-^;    ~Lulu|`|UF6KcXDvaa	just go into it with intent to befriend her. friendship is the best foundation for more if it's meant to be ;)|`|xEJm0NCiaa	freshman? sophomore? :S  english please!|`|6wxgyGy5aa	Keep it simple.  Just say hi to her.  Start a conversation.  Find out her interests and go from there.  If she loves movies, and you enjoy the same genre, suggest going to a movie together.  Find common interests and you'll have plenty to talk about!|`|hgBSYQmBaa	just go for it but be subtle.  you can put your hand on her shoulder, maybe compliment her, just take it easy don't rush it, but if you don't do anything about it you'll probably regret it!
da01a183e542dfa37aaed0cf065bd218aa	not all pakistanis like the same decor or presents- ask his wife who i presume is your sister or your husband if its brother - they will know his likes and dislikes - and as long as you're friendly im sure he will appreciate your efforts .......good luck
n4DT8cIqaa	I think the best way to tell her is to just go out and say it. She doesn't hate lesbians or gay people so you can start there. You should explain to her why you feel the way you do and help her understand y you feel that way. If she loves you she'll accept you no matter what your sexuality is. Also I wouldn't try to drag out the conversation for to long. That will only make things get uncomfortable and might make you lose courage. Try to get to the point at a steady pace then give her some time to take it all in. I hope I helped alittle.|`|BQGHIoIqaa	just say it|`|d39dc2a48a86bf08c5bfb20d68522559aa	I think you don't tell her yet. See, eventually you will decide to marry...a man, or a woman. If you decide to be with a woman, then tell her you are "bi" but, if you marry a man, you don't need to tell her anything. I, too, have a problem with "bi." The only people I know who say they are "bi" are both living with same sex people, so I consider them just gay. You have a preference, you just need to figure out which it is. You are experimenting with the other, that's all. It's rare that people like both sexes just the same. You might benefit from therapy. But if you think you are just fine, then just don't tell your mother until you are sure you are going to hook up with a person of the same sex.|`|aN8CeTsoaa	just tell her, it will be better|`|vCsSOmVOaa	just say it
xJ1TW5Gpaa	That is helarious....I'm sorry...but if she doesn't ask again, then don't worry about it....just be more careful next time|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	You should know better than to do that at the computer with anyone at home boy.  If you have to do that, do it in the shower,but it's best not to get in the habit.|`|Z6kjwFcHaa	Not going to lie, she probably knows what it is.  Not to grosss you out, but she's your mom, and an adult.  You're living proof of her having sex at one point or another, she's bound to know what semen is.  If I were you, I'd clean it up and not talk about it again.  That'll be a good way to avoid awkardness.  In the future, if you have to masturbate do it in your own room or in the bathroom.  That's a deed nobody wants to get caught doing.  I guess just move on and forget about it, the sun's going to float no matter what she saw.  Life will go on.      xoxo

4ZGriYvGaa	my friend asked me one time to experiment like that.     well first, she just texted me one day telling me she was thinking of the idea becasue she wanted to see how it was like and practise. and then we were talking bout it for some time. it was just a thought in our minds, not saying we were going to do it.    then one day i slept her house and she asked me to do it with her. she was embarrassed to say it so she got her phone and texted it to me (even though we were in the same room lol) and then yeah we texted each other in the same room coz we were embarrassed, then we agreed to do it, and then we did it lol     it was a bit weird after we did it but then we did it a few more times and got used to it after that and yeah its good practise lol|`|KSWeYE4haa	ok heres wat you do. Expreiment all you want.. Tape it and send it to me!!!!!!|`|b1NRf4VCaa	just ask her if she would like be your friend, there,s nothing wrong with that cause i used to be friends with a girl just friends. so no that is not wrong.|`|zdqn5R6oaa	ummm that would be kinda awkward i guess its up to you, but the girl might think you are a little strange for asking her. no offense intended at all. i guess that's normal, its just that it might not be the best idea cuz rumor might spread about it, i don't know.|`|LOAUbEGJaa	You're a lesbian!|`|uJB3Yet6aa	yes it weird  why would you experiment with a girl if your not a lesbian?  and your friend would probly freak out and not want to be friends with you... thats what i would do  experiment with a guy instead  if you really want to|`|Mdj7QalPaa	that would make things awkward with your friend, but go ahead, be my guest

I would never answer it - and I do not even have children.|`|565df5fe4c276dc3f59d54d1b9259380aa	Well, I will share my opinion. Why would a parent chose which child should be terminally ill? You asked the question that way. That is just cold-hearted. I understand where you are going with the question because some would miss their firstborn more than their youngest and vice versa. However, nobody wants to talk about who wants to go first.     You must be single with no sibilings.|`|NgkkzBOEaa	Funny... I think my parents would pick my brother.|`|HaHPnNp3aa	This is a rather messed up question. Even if you are open minded. No one should have to choose between there children. I dont even care if your children are born at the hips. I'm not sure the anwsers your looking for but I dont think people are going to anwser this one the way you want them to. Next time I choose a wiser question...
vj2pWs9Maa	If you're afraid his rage might one day kill you, why the hell are you still there?     Which is better:  Staying with a mentally ill man who may one day kill you, but at least the kids have a father?    OR    Removing yourself and your kids from a really unhealthy situation?    I'll tell you a little story, and it's true.  My relative was involved with an abusive man.  She stayed because of the kids.  She wanted to leave so many times but thought he could change.  He did change - he graduated from his fists, to a shot gun and shot her dead in the driveway of their home.  In front of their kids.  What's worse is that their eldest child years later killed himself, unable to get the image of seeing his mother murdered by his father.  I think the message here is fairly simple.|`|sOAY4Wgnaa	put on your tennis shoes and run...don't walk...run....get away from him now.    Let your children live with him or leave with you...give them the choice and tell them you prefer them to be with you but will understand if they choose to stay with their dad.    Then RUN....RUN.    You have one life to live...not two...not three....ONE...live it happily or alone but don't live it scared and stressed out....life is not worth it.|`|AA10171853	will i think you should leave him at least till he understands that he only need you'll. He & his stupid Bitc  as  mother should know that when you get married they become your family & thats all you'll need. Some ppl are so stupid & dont realize that untill they have nothing. You should give a try. I have a mother In Law that DOES NOT LOVE HER SON(my husband) & still she doesnt leave us alone. My husband doesnt want nothing to do with her. Just leave disapear for a couple of months. He'll change|`|t8GofAZmaa	Hi, I read your problem. You need to take the kids to a shelter and divorce this man. I can't see him ever changing. I comend you on staying this long. But please for your health and sanitiy leave while you can. I wished I had someone who loved me like you must him. Youe kids will thank tou in the end. Maybe not now but they will. Write me back if you need to Good luck . My prays are with you. Fred|`|qpAYU8Knaa	You should not let any person to abuse you. With this woman in the house, neither you nor your children are safe. You should take your children and go to the nearest abused women's shelter. They will guide you with your next steps.|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	I would tell him that in order for you to stay in the marriage he is going to have to do 3 things.  1. gethelp for himself.  2. tell his mother she cannot stay with you.  3. respect your wishes as well.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	I would simply tell him that if his mother is living under this roof, then my children and I will not be.  Based on the info you have given, it is a completely helathy and rational decision.  He will make his decision, and based on what you have said, you will be living elsewhere.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	Your In laws have classic symptoms of bipolar disorder.  it's hereditary.     i'm not trying to be funny or smart like all my other answers.    if possible, have them psychologically evaluated, then treated.    if (and it's a big if) things go well with the treatment, maybe you all can be one big loving family.    and although hard to believe, yes, i am 100% serious.|`|QkYRnTPIaa	I think you have to really look at yourself to understand why you have stayed so long in such an abusive relationship.  You say you want your children to have a father but what kind of a role model is he forming in their minds.  Abuse continues through each generation until somebody steps up to the plate and says no more!  Just the thought that he could explode into a fit of rage and possibly try to kill you must instill a lot of fear--and this is not something I would want my children to live with each day.  Go to the nearest women's shelter and get some counselling.  If you choose to leave they will provide temporary housing for you and kids.  Trying to help your husband is futile at this point as it's clear he doesn't want help.  He is seeking his mother's approval regardless of your concerns and it will not get better until he admits he's abusive (rarely happens) and until you admit the situation won't change.  Take the control back and let your husband and his mother know that your childrens' and your well being will be the top priority now.

zrk2VtPIaa	yes i know im being hypocritical when im saying this, but you need to get sleep. i am in high school and i normally go to bed around midnight every night, not because i want to, but because it takes me that long to get everything done. i've managed to keep my grades as good as yours this way, but the lack of sleep does mess with me sometimes. its actually better for your health (and sanity) that you keep your bedtime consistent every night. also, thats a sucky way to waste the valuable lighted hours of your weekend, sleeping off the hours that you've missed the previous night. if you sleep till 2 pm on sunday, you won't feel tired when it comes time to go to bed. trust me, sleep will help keep you sane|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Sorry, you won't get any affirmation from me. I can stay up as late as I want to and I don't stay up that late.    Students your age need the sleep, even on weekends. AND any sleep therapist will tell you that you should strive to go to bed and get up at the same times every day, even on weekends.|`|eUUcriANaa	I think maybe your parents do not want to stay up that late anymore to supervise you. You have to be supervised by an adult and if they are asleep who will be supervising.Go to bed at a decent hour.|`|7dVtO1gtaa	High school is harder, and you need your sleep!|`|sCGWcJTFaa	well this is when you need to learn time management. Trust me college is harder than high school. Unless you have College course classes then your just challenging yourself. Also never copy, you won't learn anything, get tutoring if you need to.

All studies have shown that in order to have a healthy sleep schedule you have to be consistent. That means same time every night. Plus, despite your taking higher level classes you are still a child and you need at least ten hours of sleep a night. If you went to bed at four or five in the morning you would only be getting three to four hours.     If you do that long enough your body will slowly start to degenerate. You'll get sicker and sicker, and eventually your grades will drop.|`|R9Z494QHaa	welllll....i know ya said ya dont care about disagreeing people....but I'm in 9th grade with 4.0 grade average, and my bedtime/phonetime curfew is freakin 9:00    yeah it's annoying, but you could just maturely state those good things you just said to us, and try to convince them you are responsible enough to stay up that late.    BUT...(lol) staying up late all the time like that isnt really good either. even if your grades stay up, dont you get all cranky? lolz|`|XIlTuV4paa	There is not much you can do.

o8NPR0PNaa	By investing, I didn't necessarily mean in rental units.  The problem with buying house/condo and renting it out is that others don't have the same regard for your property as you do.  While you can make some good money that way, there are too many out there that won't pay, and/or damage the places.  Besides, I am not sure that I would keep investing in homes, especially because this is such a down time for the housing market.  It can go down much more, and probably will.    I did not tell you to trust Suze with your money, just to ask her what best thing to do with it is.  www.suzeorman.com  Catch her show on CNBC.  It is just asking her opinion, as she has been a financial advisor for years and is on our side, so to speak.      How long ago did your hubby inherit the money?  She said recently, and I have heard this from others before also, never to do anything for at least the first year but keep the money safe.  Investigate what your options are so you can think it out thoroughly and do the best thing for the two of you.    I applaud your public schools and McMillians Nursing School Foundation work.  Had never heard about that program before, but I think it is VERY worthwhile.  You are helping them get a good foundation towards an excellent career.  Children are our future and those with only a high school education (or less) are only hurting themselves.  I had very high grades, but couldn't afford college years ago myself.  Went into the Army, then used my GI bill to pay for college.      Night Club??  Restaurants??  McDonalds??  Snow Ball Stands (never heard of them, but they sure do sound cool!)??  I say if you weren't in business for yourself before, to hold off on all of those for a couple years at least.  While I think your business ideas are probably worthwhile, it is too easy to over commit the money and end up not reserving enough of it for long term growth.  Maybe take some bus mgmt courses and investing courses would be a good idea for the two of you too.    I would set a certain amount aside and never touch that principal amount, although not sure how much.  If you want to invest in the businesses, can you only do one at a time?  Take the profits and invest those in the next business?  You are probably going to need to hire others to manage +/or work for the businesses, so it is important that you know the business inside and out, BEFORE you invest in it.    I know it sounds like I am being a wet blanket, sorry.  Keep the principal safe.  There are too many unscrupulous people out there that are staying awake nights trying to figure out how to make your money theirs!  That said, love others and don't let the rotten apples (i.e.-cousin with attitude) destroy your faith in others.      Best of luck!!  Be safe and be careful!      Thanks for saying I gave the best advice, I really appreciate that!  I know some treat their answers as couple points, but I enjoy trying to figure out the best advice to give.  Did you already mark mine as the best answer or still collecting answers?  Hopefully someone else will put some thought into theirs and give some more good advice!     Usually I am not on for too long, so I am glad I saw this second question too.  The SUZI grabbed my attention, lol.    Good Luck!  My best to you and yours!!  ~ Suzi :)
QsbB6vkoaa	you should try to persevere, for you.   you have no idea how many kids go through the same thing so don't feel alone. look at it this way, do your best at school, try and get a scholarship, get a job, and when you turn eighteen you can move out of your house. i bet you will find a great girl who appreciates you, and then she will be the only one who will matter.  As for your mom, i think you should sit her aside when your sisters aren't there and tell her "mom, i really have to speak to you, i feel underloved, and i'm trying so hard to impress you , but i just don't know what to do." if this doesn't help, talk to your counselors at school or to a trusted teacher or adult, to see if they can speak to her. but don't worry, keep on being a good person and one day your mom will find out what a great son you are .  good luck|`|FF4J59pMaa	I am sorry but your mom does not sound like a very good mom. She needs to treat each child the same. She should be hard on your sisters for failing not bashing on you because you talked back once. The same situation happened with me. My older sister was more like the favorite one and I was the other I guess you could say. I kind of turned into daddys lil girl so he kind of protected me when it came to my mom. She has always treated me different from my older sister. She doesnt trust me but trusted my sister who dated guys behind her back(when she was not allowed to) did things behind her back and talked back and was disrespectful. Luckily I have my dad who takes my back because he sees all that I do. I take care of my 3 siblings clean house cook dinner and manage to get a's and b's in my classes so I am in the same situation. The only thing you can do is be your own inspiration. Show your mom that you can suceed with out her words of encouragment because you know that you are better. And dont drop down to her level. Dont be disrespectful dont give her reasons to get mad at you and hopefully she will start realizing how awesome of a son she has! Hope this helps and hope your situation gets better.
eTxk4lSxaa	Go on a date. if you can't work up the nerve for a solo date, organise a group thing (but not movies!! you need to be able to talk to her) Something like bowling, shooting pool, pizza. Then find a moment and tell her you really like her and want to spend more time with her. Rejection stings but unrequited feelings are worse. Find out where you stand with her before your feelings get the better of you|`|NAvaa1Araa	Just tell her how you feel already!!! By keeping it to yourself you're just hurting. Just go for it!!

My guess is that he is probably a pretty nice guy inside, but when he's around his friends he  wants to show off so his friends think he's cool.

There are some out there that'll treat you with respect and you should give them a chance. a lot of guys your age aren't as mature as girls your age and they don't want the same things as you do at your age so...be real selective with whomever you think you might want to go out with or like and stuff.|`|yMfiSTjbaa	he this doing that because he don't no how to show his feeling when he is in front of you and his friend he will at like he don't you but he do like a lot ok. good luck

NrwJyffxaa	What is the worst thing you've eaten?    If you could be a female movie star who would you be and why?    If 7-11 is open 7 days a week 365 days a year and 24 hours a day why are there locks on the doors?    What was your favorite cartoon hero?    How many times do you shake your thing after urinating and do you really feel it is enough or are you afraid if you shook it more other people will think your playing with yourself?    Do you ever check out the guy at the next urinal? not sexually but just to check sizes?    How old were you before you became concerned with your mom seeing you naked/in you underwear?    Why do you think women started wearing makeup and perfume? Do you really think it was to attract men or to stay even with other women?|`|dcNmRPGPaa	ask him which one of his friends he thinks is packing the most.|`|NUpZqZLkaa	They hate when you ask if they have ever worn women's underwear, but you have to say it sexy!    "sweetie have you ever tried on pretty panties and maybe a matching bra"  You will know when they blush! LOL!|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I have this great little book called "how far would you go". It has all different kinds of thought provoking and some very hard 1-line questions in categories (some sexual, personal, family related etc.). It's a great way to get to know someone or to pull out at a party. I highly recommend it.   A couple examples off the top of my head: "What is the greatest betrayal you have ever felt?" "What is the best way to hide a dead body?" "Worst lie you have ever told?" "Greatest disappointment?" There are so many better ones...I will have to revisit this question when I get home!|`|2WKN9kZiaa	what if you ask questions that you didnt want to know the answer to?? has that ever happened?|`|O36qjj7Oaa	If he ever tried on your panties and bra lol.|`|krKMYVbFaa	If we could act out any role-play you wanted, what would it be?|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Where's the kinkiest place you've had sex?  What's the best sex you've had -- besides me?  Do you want a threesome?  Would you like to watch me f**k another guy?  Do you have a kink or fetish you'll share with me?  Have you thought about an open marriage?  Is there someone we both know you'd like to f**k?  Have you had sex with someone else since we've been married? Was it exciting?|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	advice:  don't ask anything that you don't want to hear the answer to.  have fun.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	my fave one is "what are two things you can't live without? and two things you wish you could live without?"     and you cant use basic needs like sex, food, sleep.    and i also always go for like one person in history you;d sleep with and why.... one person you'd want to spend one day with.. .|`|9XZ67Umcaa	Well Samantha.....ask him this?    If you could have sex with someone.........and I would never find out about it...............would you do it?|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	If you could be any kind of crustacean, what would you be?    Would you ever want to live on a colony on the moon?    How many fish can you name?    What's the worst/most interesting experience you've had in a locker room?    What would you do if you found out you had only a week to live?    Do you think it would be fun to sail around the world by yourself?    Would you go skydiving for charity?    What's the weirdest joint you can pop?    What would you do if you woke up and found a herd of aliens in your bedroom?    Who would you cast in a werewolf movie?|`|qL3dGTXDaa	If you were asked to write a humorous Super Bowl ad what and how would it go?
gK0vcdnDaa	Great idea!      I love stark white!  Use grey tones to add to the white and make it more dramatic.      Opt for a live band, live entertainment always adds to the drama of an event.    The church looks amazing even in its unfinished state.      Use all white flowers for your centerpieces, and go for tall but skinny, or small at the bottom and lavish on top so that guests may still see across the table at each other.  Like Calla Lilies (sp?) in a tall flute style vase with long stems.  & maybe white/gray river rock and candles or white lishts surrounding the base? ((I like that I might use it... I love gettin the creative juices flowing))    Use all white for the invitations with a touch of the colors the Maids are wearing.  Get your postage custom made with a monogram.    Let me stew on this for a few... I'll be back!    [additional details]    Insist on "Black Tie" or formal wear, somehow mention what color is preferred - black, white, gray - you can request for a certain attire, but understand that someone will still come in red, or you can just opt for formal wear and go with the flow of the colors everyone is wearing.    If you have the cash then go for some awesome transportation.  There is a place in my hometown that rents this amazing stretch car that looks vuagely like a herse, but its very elegant and has been used in a lot of rockabilly type weddings.  Or go for the horse drawn buggy/carriage.    For favors go white - or wrap/box in white and tie with a ribbon that matches the wedding party.  Maybe something white chocolate, or brushed glass.    Sorry if this sound dis-jointed, but I'm just throwing my ideas out there.    Make sure that the wait-staff are in the correct attire as well, and decorate all the tables similarly.  If you have chair covers go for white with a white/gray/silver bow.      & I love your veil!  If I had the face/dress for it I'd be opting for something very similar.  Great ideas!    Congratulations!    & Good Luck!    -Elle    (I'll probably be back again...)    Ok... here again!      Grand Piano...  I mentioned live music, but you can get it all focused around a pianist, depending on your venue they may have a piano available.  Very romantic and can bee looked at as classic/dark/goth.    Other jewlery options would be pearls, old fashioned I know, but you can dress them up.  You can even mix them with the amulet style jewlery you are already looking at.    Once again, Good Luck!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Sounds pretty.     Goth is not all black, depression, etc. It's marching to the beat of your own drummer, whatever that might be.    If you haven't already, you may want to check out the Tribe at www.offbeatbride.com since the ladies there are very helpful and open to anything outside the norm.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	Fog machines! makes for instant ethereal environment  light things by fairy light after dark and light projectors with light blue and pink light could be effective as well  get white table clothes and chair covers and if you can get them sheer pearl overlays for the tables  centrepieces use tea lights placed on silver trays with glass pebbles or antique look white candelabras  flowers- something reminiscent of bygone eras, I'd scatter miniature roses and babies breath through maidenhair ferns|`|f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	Nightime with nothing but candles for lighting... put a little fan in the back to make the air move around a little so they flicker...ooooo, spooky.. lol   I'd have very "airy", light decorations hanging that move/dance in the breeze that look like spirits flitting around, as well.    I like your theme, have fun, you only get to do it once.  :)|`|HiSVA9p8aa	I got lost along the way.  The maid of honour and three bridesmaid dresses are all different styles and colours.  Are these the dresses they will be wearing or more of an idea of the kind of look you will be having?    In the pictures of your dress and veil, their is a shot of a veil and another of a hair decoration,  Will you be wearing both?    For the music at the reception, can you find a whole bunch done on an organ.  Better yet, a pipe organ?  That would be very Phantom of the Opera-ish.  Use some with a pan flute.  Also very ethereal.    Dim lights are good.  Candles are great.  For the look you want, tapers are better than pillars.  Candelabras would be really cool if your budget supports renting a bunch.  They don't have to match.
IYgTS1eiaa	Ok, i cant read ur crush that u loves mind. but i will do my best. Ok, he sounds like a nice, sensative, kind guy. If i were him i would be so very flatterd but confused, My best gal friend that i dont have a crush on (Hannah). If she said she liked me, and my guy bff didnt like hannah. i would be so totaly flatterd, i would be so happy. But i wouldnt feel the same way. so he proboly likes the other girl, but is happy someone likes him.  So anwser question number 1. He doesent love you the same way why u dont love a diferent guy, he has feelings for another. and it will be hard to move on but u can do it. It will takes months, but  u wil move on eventually. and no one should say just stop liking him, its harder then it sounds and u just need to do what your heart tells you.  question 2: You dont need the other person to like you back,  love doesent need another person, its a feeling that is good to have. but it is SO MUCH better if the other loves you back.|`|quM6eMT6aa	TELL HIM TO STOP PLAYING WITH YOU EMOTIONS AND SWEETIE IF HE DOESNT LIKE YOU IN THAT WAY ITS HIS LOST YOU SHOULD MOVE ON AND DO THE SAME TO HIM|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Guys go through this all the time.  This is why I never become friends with girls I might possibly fall for.|`|6JnrnEpaaa	You need to re-write this question with correct punctuation and spelling so I can figure out what the he|| you are trying to say..|`|EdidZdtlaa	hes thinks of you as a friend. and only a friend. he dosent want to loose you as a friend because sometimes when you start going out with someone your friendship might get messed up and he dosent want to loose you. he trusts you with his secrets and stuff like that. i guess thats just how its supposed to be.|`|66jX06Onaa	You are a friend, and he's comfortable with that. People feel differently about each other. He may even enjoy that you love him so much, even though he doesn't love you in that way.    If it bothers you too much to see him with other girls, you may have to decide to not be around him for a while. Stop talking to him all day long (how can you do that with school or work?) Put some space between you for a month - it'll help you to put things into perspective.|`|x6g3t8HWaa	i think you should just keep being friends with him and when you think he's ready for a  relationship see if he interested in going out with you.
OIJ3JBkSaa	ask them if they still have their wedding gown/suit and would they like to have a photo with them wearing them if they can.  a photo of them with their entire family surrounding them  a photo of her sitting on his knee  a photo of them standing looking at their original wedding photo  a photo of him presenting her with a poesy of flowers and then   a photo of her pinning a boutonniere on his lapel  a photo of their hands with their wedding rings showing  and just do me a favour and wish them a very very happy 50th anniversary - its wonderful to hear of someone being married for that long! congrats to them and you come on back and let us know how your photo session turned out!  good luck!

Dads well most the time are right. Sorry, but its true. I hate to admit it. Don't break it off with her, just stay on the dl for a while until everything smooths over.|`|sbDa2JcPaa	You must have done something.     I dated a chick and I was talking on the phone with her and she started crying b/c of some dumb thing I said and her crazy hill billy dad threatened me.   I just kept showing up and he eventually started liking me.|`|eUUcriANaa	I don't think so. Why don't you just leave his daughter alone. Obviously there is some reason that he does not want you near his daughter. Are you over 18? Is she under 18? You probably could sue once he actually goes through with his threat but he would be facing criminal charges then so I do not think your little law suit would worry him. You may be the one facing criminal charges if you keep harassing him. So move on and call someone else.|`|v1QIWugFaa	whoah! hahaha i like u i would date u lol ur funny|`|5J4BE7KWaa	he's just being a father, hahah.|`|vVxM4sPIaa	Wow what did you do to his daughter?    EDIT: LOL.  Yeah call the police and tell them that you're scared because you received a threatening phone call.  It doesn't matter how old you are, or that he is a/her dad!  There are all sorts of idiots out there who have children.  He's an *** of a Dad, unless he apologizes.  Call the police.|`|1Hyrx5gMaa	Yup you can since you have the proof.|`|7IfzKtPHaa	yeah like they siad, call the police or talk to your firend alone.  call your parents or something i would of never let anyone threatening me.  wtf is his problem?|`|43769776f4128a4bec47a0e8a7748039aa	I think you can. and I would call the police and tell him he threatened you with a knife. As that is assult and battery charges.
b4PU0YdEaa	I myself was in your situation but it was my best friend.  You just have to try to stop thinking about him because if you don't stop now your life will just fly by because all your doing is wasting your time thinking about him.  Ya of course you can still be friends with him. But unless your really going to commit to him then just stop thinking about him.
chFwkKzTaa	just be cool  be your self, if he doesnt like you then too bad for him   he would have to deal with it :P

Golf courses have built in scenery, lots of free parking, and great bars.  Many now have wedding coordinators because it's become a big business for a golf course.  My wife and I got married at one and it was fantastic.|`|k6F9zkIRaa	Try a hotel. They can give you a conference room for the ceremony, a room for cocktails, and then a ballroom for the reception. They can work with you. Most hotels can accommodate large parties. Try the hilton! They have lovely ballrooms!|`|nrt7Bfnqaa	have it at the reception hall|`|Y08YLysXaa	Woah... 300 is HUUUUUGE! Too bad you can't have it outside. My fiance comes from Indiana (we're in Australia) and he said all you guys have is lakes, nothing else hehe. To be honest a church would be the best because they can be so massive. Or you could get married in the same place you have the reception. For the reception you'll need something huge too, function rooms will be too small, you'll probably have to go for a large hotel. Depends on budget.    I'm getting married in a public (rental) church that isn't used for actual church-going, and I am having a pastor from another church marry us|`|s6A61VHTaa	well, im not sure where you could get married at  if you dont want it inside a church, or outside.  an outdoor wedding would be lovely, especially in spring.|`|8gi5gfOsaa	I certainly sympathize with you about all these 50 minute Sunday Churchie types, they suck. Particularly the ones who tithe to pedophiles who attack and rape candle boys!!! May they burn in their Christian fabricated Hell!!!    You need to look for a Public Auditorium or Park where there are no ridiculous religions expectations. Religion and the people who promulgate it suck!! May they rot in the hell they exclaim and proclaim in their own selfish hatred. Go to hell American Christian and take all your Republican ilk with you!!!

3652865bf75234629480db3292c40bc6aa	We have had 42 yrs of bi-political marriage. We never argue. We agree to disagree. We just be sure to go vote to cancel out the others vote. Politics is not even on our list of important things in a marriage.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Depends on how hot you are. JayJay, I'm sure your husband doesn't give a damn what your politics are!|`|5RoYyprkaa	I'm about to get married, and my fiance is a Republican, I'm a Democrat. We don't fight, we just avoid talking too much about politics. Although I highly doubt that our relationship will end due to our political beliefs.|`|y9CgveCGaa	We both have very similar views on politics.  I like to donate to certain politicians.  She doesn't care for that even though she agrees with their positions.|`|RBQrgByeaa	It might be a good litmus test if someone thinks their spouse is too far right or left that they view this person as an idiot (but most people are apolitical, it seems).
AA11190264	baby girl, actually this is common. people act differently when they are not see that person face-to-face. let me guess, he would act like this when you call him. do this, don't call him; let him call you. you'll see that his manner will change. it's playing the upper hand in a relationship.|`|1r05fktRaa	yes it hurts  you need to tell him that  and sse what he say|`|7qBokMqWaa	I've been through that.. it made me crazy!!!  Talk to him about it, and ask why he's so different on the phone and in person.  Good luck.|`|LTnwTh24aa	ive been through that    ive been dating my bf for 6 months now, and a couple months ago i was feeling the same exact way.  what i did was talk to him about it.  we did have a fight, and we got pretty angry at each other, but in the end we forgave each other and we made up.  that fight made our relationship stronger :D    i say you talk to him about it too.  tell him exactly how you feel, and talk about everything u wrote in this question.  you might argue a bit, but then you'll make up and everything will be better than before.      plus, it will probably be much easier for you than it was for me.  you'll be able to talk to him in person.  my bf lives 7000 miles away :(
0pHtqdZqaa	hot chicks are hard to get ... we need to open immigration to address shortage of hot chicks|`|niC7aoDQaa	well girls are strange beings, we have weird reasonings behind certaing things. you probably attract a certain group and they wont stop until you give them your attention. and if your one of those pretty boys or you look really good, the girl you want probably thinks your another player who just wants to get in her pants like all the other guys. thats just how we think. if you want her, try and talk to her like a friend first, dont try and "holla" at her, cause shes just gonna shoot you down. be nice, but not overly nice, and flirt with her in a way where it makes her think for a bit cause she has to think if your flirting or not. it should work. good luck!|`|bj5Hq83uaa	karma my friend...|`|iCnQBqbFaa	You can't choose the direction your heart follows. It's human nature to want what we can't have. If the girl you like doesn't contact you, she probably doesn't like you. Does she know that you like her? If you are 'soo in love' then perhaps you should tell her! Bottom line, the girls you don't care about probably like you because they want what they don't have (namely, you) because of human nature. And you want the other girl because you can't have her.
Nngdk0izaa	It doesn't matter if they are girls or guys, don't you think it would be a bit fair to give all your friends, even if they are boys, valentines? I mean, they're your friend and if they think you like them more, then just tell them that you felt it would be nice to give them sometime on a holiday. Going with the flowing with everyone doesn't exactly work out sometimes, especially if you don't want to. So grab your surfboard, and go the other direction! If you want to give your guy friends at least something, go ahead and do it.|`|wTYPomqQaa	their dumb guys get stuff too only girls who believe in the guy always make the move probably believe that but thats not true you can give guys something too|`|afYSjcp0aa	ya they shuld get something too it is a holiday|`|ayMXUVgvaa	i think that they should get something to..some people don't get guys anything but some people do i guess that it just depends who you are..

I got pissed. But it blew over. My mom personally is just a psycho though.|`|msr6s66gaa	no thats never happened to me before.. that would be bad! make sure you dont have anything in there you don't want her to see from now on!|`|H7kmp0qdaa	I would be highly upset. I almost always have weed in my bookbag and my mom knows so she just doesn't go there because she respects my choices. But i'm also a senior in college. So maybe this is a different kind of situation.|`|pf37jVQVaa	OH MAANNNN, I feel for ya. My mom always does that. She tells me it's for my own good, but hey, I talked to her, told her to respect my privacy, and well, went on a hunger strike. HAHA! Good luck!|`|B8Y81hlzaa	This has never happened to me but did she ask you if she could. Or did she sneak and look through or straight up right in front of you look through it? And, did she give you a reason why she looked through it?|`|syT3XUAraa	If you live under her roof, then you have to obey her rules. It was sort of rude to just go through it like that, but you can't really hold it against her. She's the parent, and you're the child. Sorry, but it's the truth...|`|aXYiOskmaa	too bad. she has every right to do this and should have done it sooner.  edit - when she stops looking in your bag and doesn't give a sh*t anymore, then you have something to worry about. that's a fact.|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	lol.  her house, her rules!|`|AA12223669	I'm 25 now, but yes it happened to me a lot as a kid. She'd find cigarettes and dirty love letters and letters between my best friend and I. She'd make a big deal out of everything and I always felt terribly embarrassed.

If she doesn't want to see what is in there then she shouldn't be looking. go through her purse and talk about what is in there that shouldn't be. that will make her stop.|`|RCZCeBQsaa	happened to a friend of mine. his mom found empty bottles of alcohol lol.|`|rmyAXl7Uaa	I would be like   "Hey, no.

But no, my mom has never done that...umm...what did she find :O|`|3b3052873874a18b5ea83205f5549b9aaa	Sorry, but you are a kid and you have no right to the type of privacy from your parents that you are seeking. You mom is doing these things for your own good. If she didn't care about your wellbeing she would just sit back and let you do whatever you want. You may not appreciate it now, but you will later---especially when you have your own kids and they're trying to keep secrets from you.|`|uNIHqmH8aa	Well, if your the kind of kid that keeps that kind of stuff away from her...I applaud her for taking some action. If you aren't, then I have to say that she really had no right to do so. My mother never went through my things once I got into middle school. Mainly because I never left them where she could find them. Plus she never went looking. And I always told her if I got a bad grade more than once.

OT3eczxaaa	It's your marriage certificate that gets signed either before or after the ceremony in front of your officiant (the license is what you get in order to get married in the first place). The officiant is responsible for sending it to the appropriate authorities. You will sometimes get a ceremonial certificate that is a keepsake and NOT a legal document.    Check with your local auditor or county clerk about getting copies of your marriage certificate. You will need those to change your name with Social Security and on your driver's license.|`|aXYiOskmaa	it is signed just after the ceremony with the reverend, or whomever, as a witness. it is sent to the county in which you were married to be recorded. your name changes immediately if you choose to do so. however, you have to change your name on your s.s. card and other legal documents as well.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Consult an attorney or the Clerk of the Circuit Court.|`|evW18jvIaa	Most people sign it before or after the ceremony. We did it right after, before the pictures.    The pastor then sends it to I'm not sure where.    Not sure if it's the same everywhere, but in CA I had to then request our official license from the court by sending a check and a request form that was given to us when we applied for our license.    It takes a few weeks for the official marriage license to come. THEN you can start with the name change stuff. Start at Social Security. Then go to the DMV, bank, and everywhere else.     We've been married 2 1/2 months and I'm about done with the name change. I already have my new license and SS card, and have notified everyone who needs to know of the change. It takes diligence and time, but it's not too hard.

There isn't much you can do.  i mean they are Adults and are living their lives. I know it's hard but try not to think about stuff you have no control over. Keep up the Prayers and Keep Going to Chuch babez.|`|EFBUPnITaa	not to be all holy and stuff.but i think you should just prayy:]<br>  or even talk to someoneee.<br>  <br>  i know what you mean about the whole betrayal thing.but honestly, you should just let your parents deal with what they've got themselves into.<br>  YOU should really just try to focus more on you rather than how it affects either one of your parents.<br>  <br>  LIVE YOUR LIFE WITHOUT REGRETS!|`|Ac1Qdr72aa	please tell your mom|`|qzXwkrqkaa	just tell her you dont need to be stressed out|`|SzccdwqVaa	i think its really important for you to tell your mom whatever you know about whats going on. think how you would feel if you were in her position im sure you would want your daughter to tell you right? i wouldn't be worried about hurting his feelings as obviously hes not worried about hurting the either of you. you will feel much better having told her.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I think you should tell your mother if it's making you so unhappy.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Tell your mother immediately.
jbxGEdVbaa	Hello Mayor McCheese:    I'm glad you asked this question because The Hamburglar happens to be an expert in this type of activity.  The first thing I noticed is that you waited to watch hardcore pornography only after your "misses" was gone for the weekend. This means that you do not have full domination in the household and domination is the one ingredient you need to acheive full QUAKING. I'm going to show you how to kill two birds with one stone on this one.  The first thing you need to do is establish dominance in the relationship. As soon as your wife walks in the door, greet her with a smile and a hard back-hand to the face. She will immediately fall into a submissive pose that will allow you to give her a firm lesson in dominance.  Mount her from behind and hover over her body like a three-toed sloth. Then, vigorously pound her like an oil derrick in an up and down motion. When she gasps for air due to the shock, grab a nine volt battery and stick that sucker on her tongue. This combination should result in some seismic activity. If it doesn't work.........I would try a harder back-hand.    -You have just been sacked by The Hamburglar|`|68vju75baa	hahaaha|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	I think in order for it to work you need a generously proportioned booty in order to quake it.|`|KzszBNsoaa	booty as in the women's ***?  that's because the women has extra fat in her *** tho perhaps shaped perfectly it will still inevitably shake ( quake ) when u do watever u do to quake it|`|3iNobwVraa	Can't answer because I don't know how you define your terms.  What differentiates shaking, rumbling, trembling, and quaking?    For me, shaking/trembling means I have gone pretty far under.  In these moments I usually don't even know when something is hurting me.  Then, later I see the bruises.  Gotta love cars, and being so turned on you don't notice the emergency brake is repeatedly knocking the wind out of you!  Causes some pretty unusual bruising.|`|I814g6ZBaa	You remember what THEY were doing when it was quaking, right??  Well... there you go.      NEXT?
zGi9Wag3aa	I've received one plenty of times. and it's just fantastic. I highly recommend it|`|qpxPW5paaa	I've been on the receiving end of a few|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	Yes I've done (received it), and yeah, it's weird.  This is America.  Everything is ******* weird    One way to conceal it is to punch a hole in the bottom of the popcorn container, and get him to stick his cock through it.  Then it just looks like you're grabbing some popcorn ... and there is so much grease on that popcorn, it's pretty much lube.|`|AA12223669	Yes, it is weird. Please don't do that. There are STRANGERS around you ... just as we are strangers right now. And the last thing I want to do is walk by on my way to the bathroom and watch your boyfriend blow his wad.|`|E2djArd6aa	just sit where no one can see you! and dont get caught! Its fun its a BIG RUSH!!! Have fun.|`|3YpVVRWpaa	not really  as long as your guy dont screeam or morn  i think it really HOT|`|GQfQ0TsDaa	shrug. sounds exciting though ;]|`|OcISFpRdaa	hahha don't even bother unless you are willing to suck it. every guy i know hates handjobs because guys can do it better themselves!|`|yDweJapXaa	extremely weird  but not uncommon|`|rfkVin6Iaa	Considering other people are there....I wouldn't|`|SzQKCeRqaa	Wow that is soo ******* **** **** the ***** wiping son of a ***** *** ****!!!one11!!1one!1!!!|`|A99uzyeFaa	i have, its totally weird, but he liked it.  dont let him finish, just a tip.|`|Q5KFND17aa	its where i gave my first handjob ever...    haha and we got caught and got in hella trouble.|`|Lz3yxrXKaa	I have given guys a lot of hand jobs but not in a theater. however, I did one time made my boyfriend at the time jerk off in the movie theater while we were watching a movie. it was so hot!!|`|2JeCyjF8aa	Hahahaha, thats hilarious because one time I got head in a theatre, there were like 5 people in the theatre, I think only 2 of them saw though. Dont do it unless you are in the last row in some corner and nobody is in the same row, otherwise you will be seen and it is kinda embarassing for both of you. I wouldnt say its weird, its just...risky and unecessary.|`|aw3JE1wCaa	Lol, Not really. It's kinda awkward to though.. cos you feel like people are watching you..|`|YkmVbpDeaa	It's not that weird, but I've never done it.|`|wbcmHJ3waa	only if your mom is there|`|kUl1dCdVaa	well i haven't.. but if ur alone in a row then maybe it won't be bad. but if you are, maybe you should cover his lap with a coat or something|`|FDHbKmgtaa	u will feel like people r watchin u|`|swOkwZNhaa	wow you just got punk'd!|`|oMIxJTO1aa	Nah if your both open to it go for it, but oral is good too!|`|SIxMxu5gaa	Well I'm sure it'd be fun but it is also extremely trashy, and rude, and well it just isn't flattering. Kiss in the movie theater like normal people.|`|oYcKNtiGaa	lmaooo that barack wanna be is hilarious...  thats pretty gross.. Srry but i would not give no guy a hand job, blow     job, none of that crap.. thats nasty. U dont noe what they be doing with there private area. Let them do that themselves|`|VcdmOXyqaa	lol..no hand jobs are easy to give and not that weird..its blow jobs that take more talent!!!  but all can be done...including him fingering you!|`|JkQ62zOmaa	**** yeah its weird... your hand is not your vag and that should be the only thing wrapped around his cock.    I hope this helps!!|`|uVkMdIJNaa	yes it is weird...but i would...lol
yev2iWgWaa	first scan him i.e  find genuine things about him and if good is result go ahead  affly   dr,g.janaki|`|bO2rzfISaa	Direct requests. Don't expect him to change, just work with him the way he is. My husband is passive, too. It's a bit irritating, but you can work around it if everything else is there.  EDIT: In response to the above post, my husband has got the sex covered. Covered. It all balances out.|`|66jX06Onaa	Ask him to do something, then wait for him to do it.  (like make you dinner, pick something up from the store, etc.)    Sometimes this can get the man into 'man mode' and he'll take charge.   DON'T tell him HOW to do something or he'll lapse back into a follower role though.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Find a man with a pair of b**ls. You deserve better and the sex is hotter, too.|`|7cjqT33Baa	Maybe his being passive is a result of your being so needy.  Who tells someone they love them and then gets off the phone and texts them the same thing...way too much.  If you are always telling him how to feel, what to say, probing him for his responses...how does that give him breathing room to actually be and to think for himself?  I would suffocate if I was around a person that needy.
eR8JygaDaa	what i would do is sit her down and make sure she knows your being serious and tell her. If she keeps doingg that tell her you like someone else(if you do) but tell her you dont want to tell anyone.|`|hpIFZhkVaa	simply say: ***** YOU TELL ANYONE WHO I LIKE AND I WILL CUT YOU.|`|WMNbGsoWaa	Just keeping telling her you don't like him. Go ahead and prove it, too.     I once had a friend who did the same thing. Whenever my crush would be near us, she would be all "Why are you blushing?" and stuff like that. I never told her who I liked after that.    You might as well keep your crushes secret for now on, or at least find a friend who is more mature.|`|OI7eeIreaa	I'd go with the smothering.  It's the only way to be sure.|`|seMpUL8Kaa	You stop saying things to her and she will have no reason to say things to you. Stop the pointless, childish bickering. Leave each other alone.|`|KwNpyp3saa	Stop being friends with her. She is not a friend to you if she does this to you. Ignore her and find someone else to hang out with. Just becareful next time who you share your thoughts with.|`|8JoRsnBTaa	wow i hate people like that.     threaten her .   be like im gonna tell everyone...     even if its not true, just say it cause u dont like ur crush and thats not true :)|`|pmkP39hcaa	This may not help but, tell her. Im not trying to offend her but its childish what shes doing. she is just saying stuff like that to make herself feel better or maybe she doesnt have the greatest sense of humor!
niC7aoDQaa	dudeee. first of all, girls will NEVER think of things that way first, unless theyre like Lil Kim if you catch my drift. Now im a stoner, and i know what you mean by that stoner charm, and dude..its soo not sexy lol its only sexy when your stoned. now if she has a boyfriend and shes showing you interest, then that means she may want you cause she thinks you could give her something her boyfriend isnt [and that doesnt mean strictly sex] so i think your best bet is to actually be her boyfriend and not break her heart cause when you break a girls heart the meaning of paybacks a b--i--t--c--h will really come back to haunt you. if your strictly into boning, you better get friendly with the yellow pages.|`|fMyZIcCCaa	umm might ask her if she cares your a stoner... i know i would care|`|sIqQF5j2aa	Ok you are just stupid.  No girl wants to go out with some one who smokes weed unless they already do.  Weed is stupid and one day you are going to die from it.  Also no girl wants to be screwing buddies.  They want to be treated with dignity and respect, not as some one you can call over when you feel screwing them.  So my answer is no don't ask her and get a new life because the one you are on so far is going to end badly.|`|JBcpBn5Gaa	bahaha. i didnt understand a word you just said.|`|ZR34thBvaa	I respect you.    Be upfront about it, I recommend something along the lines of:    "Yo, beyotch, you wanna ride this dawg all night long, baby?"     Never fails.|`|5Ra5xbziaa	just be yourself and tell her how you feel|`|VQdHstWtaa	lol you should get to know her a bit better without leading her on and tell her what you like about her and what exactly you want.. nothing better then being straight up- from a chicks perspective :) ..|`|r7gxrbqGaa	Yes, ask to bone her. If she says yes, great try not to get herpes. If she slaps you in the face, go smoke some more weed.|`|e3XC8M6Yaa	I don't think you have a prayer, no girl in her right mind is going to want to kiss a guy who smokes weed, let alone take it to the next level. Give up. Please.|`|Dx23osxWaa	ummm idk if u asked me that it would depend on how cute you r|`|AA11669383	i thank you should get her numbeer and got out for lunch or something to get to know her and if it was meant to be than it will happen|`|TweZlF73aa	Sounds like the only way to do it is go out with her have her over to your house and see where it goes.|`|ZFgjX4Hmaa	I don't get what you're getting at here, but I think you should take relationships seriously and actually get to know her. Girls like that. Hey, darling, if her body's sexy, don't tell her that.  She'll get all pissed at you, I'm sure.|`|w2DBijJ5aa	Wow.|`|AA10229594	personally  this dude i liked asked me the question straight up n i was shocked at first but im glad he was straight up with it instead of tryna feed bull.. girls love when guys are honest point blank
nxeffjjKaa	start talking aboutthe girl that he likes   simple just say  "you like any girl? JW"  or talk about school  or ask him to a school dance just as friends  in stead of random questions think of questions that wil help you get to know him like  whats your family like  what do you wanna be when your older ect|`|sWgekFwaaa	ask him bout sports or something  u and him r interested........|`|8JoRsnBTaa	talk about things u like and dont like.|`|ad5ycXvvaa	the number 1 question would be what are his dreams and goals.  guys like to talk about fashion too.depending on his age and maturity maybe the economy,just simple everyday things
XKhNw221aa	he's gay, or maybe he wanted what he couldn't have and now that he can have you he's not interested, or he really doesn't want to hurt you relationship now.|`|VkFWgXaHaa	ahh yes...i do this to som1 i REALLY Like...i hate when i do it...it just means he REALLY likes u but is so terrified of expressing it thats hes become SHY to you...just open up to him and tell him not to be scared/ be very flirty and romantic with him so that he can open up to u.|`|KRDwCai5aa	I bet he feels awkward around you now, knowing that you like him.|`|sWgekFwaaa	shy?
ZEP1K3oSaa	I don't think so sorry, best of luck to us all! Ciao.<br>  <br>  GAH|`|EyaqiWPwaa	no not the truth....hes thinking when is that chick gonna make me a sandwich|`|qy2CIDmlaa	Thats Not true at all.  There are many other reasons he may be staring  in your face. He may just think you have nice eyes, a nice smile or an attractive face.  He could be staring at your face to give you his total undivided attention.  In other words he is not focused on any other girl, woman or person in the room at all.  He only is focused on you because you're special to him.   The first time I fell in Love I always stared at my ex girlfriends face simply because I adored her.  So it's not necessarily true.  However let me warn you.  If a guy is high or drunk or just extremely horny there may be some occassions where what you were told is true. But most of the time it just means he thinks you're attractive and likes you.     Since you must be young I want to tell you be careful. Some guys will say anything such as I love you or I think you're special just so you will agree to let them have their way.   Some only want to fulfill their own selfish needs and get off when they really could care less about you.  Take Care...|`|Arw6OmVtaa	LMFAO HAHAHAHAHA..............<br>  <br>  On a serious note.. no. Unless they're really really f*cked up.|`|WdAeGmUYaa	gross
d39dc2a48a86bf08c5bfb20d68522559aa	My husband and I got married when he was a Senior in college and I was a Sophomore. We are still married 35 years later. It was hard. We both had to work AND go to school, but we made it.  The only thing I am worried about for you is that you don't seem to have dated other people since you were teenagers, just each other. You might wake up in a couple years and wish you'd dated some other people to make some comparisons, before you married. What is wrong with waiting a couple more years?|`|5RoYyprkaa	I'll be younger than you when I get married. I've only finished one semester of college. I think that, if you want to get married, then go for it. It will be difficult, but marriage is difficult for everyone. I'd say go for it and good luck.|`|dc7cc2bdb5422aaad5fa8d92de4182fcaa	i don't agree with wiser1. if you have been with somebody that long, you won't want to date anybody else if you truly love them. get married.
LLQLjlEpaa	He is fine     he probably is as worried about you as you are about him     relax he will be fine|`|xwCIuvWYaa	Thats horrible don't say that! He is not dead I am sure he is fine and he is probably trying to get a hold of you too......|`|35ae746aae90d4f0ba10e9f5ecba492baa	Have Hope and Faith....|`|1eLZ3Bejaa	I'm sure he is fine and just can't get a hold of you since the power is out and cells are working too well. Don't worry too much.|`|da01a183e542dfa37aaed0cf065bd218aa	he may be okay and just as worried about you .........i know you are concerned but don't panic until you absolutely must ........do you have a landline number for someone near to his place ? or a relative who he would contact ?.............hope he is okay don't worry abt it too much|`|hSHl6trDaa	He's Dead
AA10737067	I would say so yea, he obviously is interested.Go for it and ask him out. You don't want to waste more time wondering when you could be having a great time with him do y ?|`|0HYG8PlNaa	It sounds like he does like you.|`|WMPbyXwcaa	definitely. if he was just flirting with you i wouldnt be so sure. but he bought chocolate.  guys dont do that unless they really like you.  just returning the favor. : )|`|B9fwuaSlaa	Yes, he wouldn't do all that if he didn't like you. Go for it!! GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!|`|n9y5ydnVaa	I think so... :) ASK HIM OUT! <br>  <br>  :)<br>  Kylie|`|8EnlSE93aa	its highly likely. <br>  just go with the flow and see what happens.|`|Hr5utLldaa	probably. most guys dont flirt like that unless they do like you. i dont think anyone who is that caring would want to lead you on, so yes i think he does.|`|UXUi83fWaa	lol he is really into you girl! of course he likes you! just keep doing what you are doing and wait till he asks you out.|`|uCCyOYZ8aa	you cute?<br>  what's yo' aim?
YtSGbYqEaa	thats not a relationship at all.......|`|5ciDai7Paa	Well it depends whether you've meet the person or not. By meet I mean known them for a long time and they just moved away, in that case maybe. However if you've never met the person not only will it not last, but it is extremely dangerous. You might have him ask you to meet with him, and he turns out to be an ax murder.|`|UI79JnJVaa	"Like reading a Jackie Collins romance novel."<br>  <br>  "Where we have our favorite celebrity.

As long as the two people fit these descriptions then i'm sure the relationship will last, because nothing makes a horny person happier than meeting another horny person. So if you fit any of those two types of people (which i'm sure you do considering you're even considering internet dating) then go ahead.|`|0x6KtwULaa	no. absolutely not. Bad girl. No! no no no no no. They never work and the person you are talking to is one of the two. either a fat old guy or a chick that will mess around with people that live in the same area as her. I have somebody that i know is a girl and she is my age, so once i turn 18, i shall move to Maine to visit her. We are just friends. They never last. They are not healthy relationships. I am sure you are a very pretty girl. do NOT date online. find somebody that likes you for you not your looks. It will work longer than any other internet relation would.|`|DlrHF9L5aa	I think its crazy, you can never bee 100% honest or truthful talking online.

You may as well get a man out of the deal.|`|J3JClsuQaa	I met my fiancee on line and when we first started talking on the phone I asked him his height and he's like an inch shorter than me... and I was like oooh  I dunno about that... I like to wear heels, ya know.  Anyway, 3 years later we are getting married this year and I love him more than life!   He still won't let that down either... still says things like well, ya know since I'm too short...    Long story short:  : )  Don't be scared of what ppl think, follow your heart.  You could miss out on a nice relationship, I'm not sayin you'll marry him or anything, but ya know what I mean...     P.S.  I don't wear heels very often, and I'm wearing ballet like slippers when we get married.  Good luck!|`|uJB3Yet6aa	screw other people  if you like him then go for it  it doesnt matter what they say  goodluck! :)|`|fQiiuwlHaa	I've been through the same thing. I didn't go out with him, Then regretted it later. I never knew how much I liked him until he wasn't there any more. I wouldn't listen to my friends because you can't help the way you feel about someone and their height. No one will make fun of you, And if they do DON'T LISTEN TO THEM. Be confident in your choice and hold your head up high. So what is he is short, I'm sure he is really nice to you and you like him. That's all that matters. I'm sure you've heard this a lot, but looks don't! I wish you the best of luck with what ever choice you make. :)|`|67O85hIzaa	I wouldnt think of what other people said. If you like him Go For It!!!!! Good Luck    =)|`|8JoRsnBTaa	screw everyone else    if u truly really liked him, and if ur friends are really ur friends, they wont make fun of u    i say go for it.|`|5ekis6tDaa	it shouldnt matter what other ppl think.......  but most of the time it does right?  but u have to ignore the voices of the other ppl for once in ur life and go after the guy  (sounds kinda like a cheesy love novel)  lol  that was a bit too dramatic but the point is  "listen to your heart"  good luck!  -?-
Oi3CQnvHaa	I think he sounds like a moron, quite honestly.    Are you saying he wants you to abort your twins late term?  What a disgusting pile of human filth.      It sounds to me like he's scared of the burden of so many children, if they are his (i'm assuming they are), he'll love them just as much as he does the other one, they have to grow on him.|`|5RoYyprkaa	You reconsider your relationship. As a parent you can't be partial to one of your children... and it's not like you can undo it now. You need to decide if you're willing to expose your twins to a father who doesn't love them and will treat them differently than your other child.|`|KZlgdMeEaa	id stay he/she is thinkin bout this a little late. what a jerk!|`|YjUyBWPEaa	I would wonder why?  Since he isnt home much does he not think they are his?  I would tell him he should have thought about that before hand.|`|Rzsudrzqaa	wow! what an a**! (assuming they're biologically his, of course).|`|AA10405438	I tell him/her that he /she should have thought of that while he/she was helping you make the babies.  No matter what happens, he/she will have to support the babies until they are 18.|`|I814g6ZBaa	I would say:  "TOO D MN BAD; WE made the twins and the twins are on the way. Get over it."  He'll get used to the idea.  He's just scared right now.      Happy Twins, Honey!!|`|1a370a32d49eb577cd4ab9146d28bdd0aa	oh wow.  thatd be a jerkish move.  id tell him to either,  take all 3 of the kids,  or im out|`|ugRN86bYaa	When they get here, he'll change his mind,but I don't know what I'd say; probably nothing; he's a jerk. Such a statement doesn't deserve an answer. I'd just stare at him when he makes such statements and then walk off.|`|d39dc2a48a86bf08c5bfb20d68522559aa	I'd suggest a divorce and child support.
5Rn5BHjQaa	Wow, I'm sorry you're having to deal with all this crap.<br>  <br>  Please talk to your school counselor and see if he or she has any ideas. Maybe your relatives could pool their money so your mom can afford to go back to court and get your dad's custody arrangement changed. Depending on your age, maybe you could even arrange to be legally emancipated so you can live with your mom. <br>  <br>  I hope this gets straightened out. Please don't let this derail your whole life. Do the best you can to concentrate on your schoolwork, maybe get a study group together after school, or do your work in a library where you can concentrate better.  Hang in there--you WILL be able to move out as soon as you're 18, no matter what else happens in the meantime.|`|tjj7nO9maa	How old are you? In some states you can divorce your parents and move out. Talk to someone in the legal field to see how you can legally let someone know that being under your fathers' care is harmful to you. Check out www.lawguru.com for starters and ask a question for free!<br>  <br>  Make your Dad listen. Let him know that this is not only harming you individually but the family.|`|lYpzSSFMaa	He probably is going through mid-life crises or something...<br>  and if you don't want to live with him you Should be able to move and live with your mom. Its not your fault and don't think it is, I really don't know of much that you can do. I'm sorry for whats happening and I hope things get better for you soon.<br>  Hope I could help!|`|mItsW20naa	Well why doesn't your mom have joint custody? <br>  If she does, she doesn't need your dads permission to come and get you. If your mom isn't in the picture then sometimes grandparents can file petition for custody, especially if your living in a bad situation.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	"if people were meant to like their parents then they would live with them forever" .... from The Breakfast Club (1985)<br>  <br>  ps.  you're wearing my hat|`|f8bba879d02b930f55f403333784e649aa	Sorry to hear this dude, stay strong and learn from his mistakes.|`|DKzadEW7aa	See if your mom can work something out. Call child support.|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	If your dad has custody of you, he has legal rights to make you stay with him until you are old enough to decide where you want to live.Go to your dad and tell him exactly how you feel and ask him why he insists you live with him? Tell him you would like to live with your mom on a trial basis. Tell him if he and his wife had time together with you not around, maybe it would be for the best Maybe your councilor can help you and who knows maybe a foster home might be the answer. No pressure on your dad or your real mom. I know it must be so hard for you, but you must obey whom ever you live with like it or not.|`|lYN0YxrYaa	He is your Dad. Talk to him about it and tell him exactly how you feel. Family drama and issues are usually because there is horrible communication skills. Life is going to throw you tons of crappy situations, but you have to take all of them as a learning experience and grow from it. Please don't let someone ruin your life just because they have their own issues to work out.|`|Ozeg1lIhaa	emancipation.|`|KZCrNa7Zaa	who's stopping you from moving out? Just do it.  If you need to, tell your mother to take him to court so she can be your fulltime caretaker.  If you can prove that he's a poor father and causing you all this stress then you should be with your mother.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Can you talk to him about really wanting to move in with your mom? Does he have sole custody of you or does he just choose to have you live with him?<br>  Have you expressed this to your mother yet?<br>  Do some talking and see what happens.|`|w4DetxEtaa	Listen.  You have to remember that this is your life and only you can make it work.  I know things are hard, really hard.  But others have it much worse and there is no excuse for not doing what you need to do in school.  Continue to work hard and remember that "this too shall pass".  As a young person you don't realise that things change and what affects you today will be a thing of the past tomorrow.  Be strong and tough.|`|DuGanGcNaa	You need help man but your Dad doesn't seem to think there's a problem. My advice would be to get your mom to get a lawyer to try and get custody of you.|`|h01weUiIaa	if he dont kill you he'll make you stronger|`|3Ophdo9raa	Why won't your mother fight for custody of you? Get back in school. If you think you're bad off now, wait until you try to make it in the world without a high school education. Reenroll in school and graduate. One option would be to enlist in the military once you graduate to get away from your situation. When you turn 18 maybe your mom will take you in then. Meantime stop giving your dysfunctional father power over you. Just stick to your studies and graduate. Try to get a part time job too and save up some money to move out.
VHA9qrVSaa	go to passionup.com<br>  Good Luck!|`|cHROCt3Aaa	you can't just tell her that yourself? you want to copy and paste a letter?|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	Why don't you facebook her and write your own.|`|asEM3kQmaa	you should write by yourself..  no matter what ever you want write.. whatever you want to say to ur wife..she'll understand u..<br>  so you are looking for friends with benefits.. . . LOL.. hahhahaha|`|Ikd9cppcaa	No. Don't put anything online that you don't want everyone to read. Send her a real letter.|`|ByUS0k8waa	You should write her personally. Trust me there is nothing better while hubby is gone to get a hand written love letters. You can always add a love quote but just talk from the heart. That is the best thing when hubby is deployed. I love to get those letters and I cant wait til the next one gets there. Don't tell her its coming just let it surprise her. You can also order flowers and stuff like that for no reason but to say you love her and have them sent to her with a note saying "just because your so wonderful" or something sweet like that. Trust me that is sooo awesome when he is deployed to get to remind me that he really does love me and will be home in my arms as soon as he could.
nWgfXF3laa	blonde or brunette, not into redheads.<br>  Skinny<br>  about 50/50 on looks vs. personality, and she needs a good sense of humor.|`|AA11899313	I rather like tall Scandinavians with long blond legs, petite brunettes and bald redheads myself.<br>  <br>  However, as long as she is 1: breathing,  2: can articulate herself (can say the word 'Model' as opposed to pronouncing it 'Modwe')  3: doesn't class 'shopping' as a hobby,  4: doesn't see handbag collect nor that of shoes as a priority in life,  5 : doesn't get drunk routinely and 6: can speak and laugh without sounding like a cross between a donkey or having me 'grit my teeth in response' to the volume.....  then she is likely on her way to being my Ideal.<br>  <br>  Personality matter, as do looks, but it can be a trade-off between the two as to which is dominant.  Chemistry matters too.<br>  <br>  And, at a rough guess, that's likely about 10% of the package.  A sense of sensuality comes into it too ~ although I detest the clone girly types, the platform shoe wearers, the skirt that is smaller than the handbag and the fake tan and ridiculous fingernail's that look like mini shovels.<br>   <br>  Sash.|`|Rmbwvm2uaa	Brunettes.<br>  Skinny.<br>  Looks matter. No-one ever sees a fat ugly bird in a bar, and thinks "wow, I bet she has a great sense of humour, I'm going to go over and talk to her".<br>  Personality matters more in the long term, but you're not going to find out about a girl's personality until you've met them a few times.|`|4AHvIlKcaa	personality matters most (for long lasting relationships)<br>  matter most (then that's for showing off to friends)<br>  Curvy (sexual use)<br>  Blonde's or brunettes or redheads does not usually matter at all...<br>  <br>  The question is a bit weird because i think everyone whould want curvy (not fat) and looks and personality....|`|pIkJVfAkaa	Hair- doesn't matter although preferably long<br>  Height- 5'2" to 5'5"<br>  In shape<br>  Looks matter because there needs to be a 'spark'!<br>  Personality is huge...

zrk2VtPIaa	you are legally an adult, so you should be able to make your own decisions, especially if you are moved out of their house and you aren't dependent on them anymore. if they are strict, it is normally because they want to protect you. dont introduce your boyfriend right away though. let them get used to you dating gradually. maybe suggest over the phone that you might like to start dating. if they freak out, remind them that it is your decision, promise you won't be distracted from your schoolwork or career, and maybe even slip in a few subtle threats about not sharing your life with them anymore. once they have gotten used to that (probably in a few months) introduce your boyfriend to them. dont let them know that you have been together for as long as you have, because then they'll be angry at you for keeping secrets from them. keep the PDA as mimimal as possible in front of them and have your boyfriend be very respectful. words like "sir" and "maam" work great. also, have him be prepared to answer questions about his future financial and career plans. i dont know exactly what your parents are like, but if they start asking questions about his "intentions" have him say "its way to early to be talking about that." that will put them at ease that they won't have to be letting go of their precious daughter anytime soon. good luck!|`|E2djArd6aa	u are 19 yrs old! its not like your 15 or somthing. I think you should sit down and talk to your parents and advise them that your a adult and that your old enough to be dating. Parents these days need to take a deep breath and let there babies be grown.  all you can do is talk to them hun parents are difficult trust me I know! but once they see that your taking responsiblity then maybe they will come to realize that your old enough to date. good luck!|`|NqMmvvgVaa	At 19 I don't see how it is any of their business. I think your best bet is to start thinking about moving out. Some parents have a hard time realising that their children grow up and become adults, sometimes moving out is the only thing that makes them realise you aren't a little child that they can control.|`|k1ggPrcuaa	say    "what would you think if you didnt have a boyfriend or girlfriend" and "what age did you get a boyfriend|`|fsHgUrcAaa	If you're in college, they probably just want you to focus on that.  Since you're 19 I'd just tell them.  It's time.
QsbB6vkoaa	ok i think that your ages have a lot to do with it, you should go out with your friends and when you get home you should try to spend time with her, also ask her how her day went, but not only  your sister you should also try to spend time with your brother, ask them to teach you to play wii, you might have fun.  i think it's alright to be jealous, my sister is 19 and i am 22, and we are best friends but we both have to understand that we aren't a pair, we are different people, and we both need our own privacy.   i don't think you should be ashamed because of your age difference. soon she'll be 14 and start turning into a young adult and then she's gonna want to spend more time with you. that's the way it is. me and my sister didn't really get along until she turned 13 or 14. so it's pretty obvious that she is gonna need you pretty soon, it's your job to let her know that you'll always be there for her.  i think that the best way to bond with her is to have a GNI (girls night in) rent a girly movie, get some chips and popcorn, sodas, and have some pedicures, manicures and face masks.  also try and include her in your shopping sprees, but don't forget about your brother. you didn't mentioned if you have other brothers, but if you don't you have to understand that it can be very lonely for him, so include him when possible.  like i said you should not worry about it, give her some time, and let her share her independence however she likes. because i have a question for you. do you ditch her when you are with your friends? if you do then she might feel the exact same way.  i really hope this helps :)|`|kvNbiQ3Gaa	girl youve gotta find a boyfriend or else, just some suggestion haha...  A to Q1 : its okay, its a natural feelings for siblings  A to Q2 : everyday you met her wouldnt you, just talk like normal siblings  A to Q3 : I dont know, but youve got to take care, look over your lil sis and bro  A to Q4 : maybe, as long as their happy to chat and hang out together, I dont care anything else    heh im an oldest son in my family also, but I always trying to make my lil sis and bro happy and make sure they dont harm them self, because we were meant to give not to take, that is our responsibility, I really hope this will helps you.|`|XL9CUrp2aa	Its normal and ok to be jealous,    why not play the game too, or ask her to go to a movie and tell her you miss spending time with her    If you do what I said about you wont have to worry about it    She is spending time with him because they share a common interest.    She will be back to you once the game gets old, your her sister and she needs you for girl stuff- thats way more important|`|63wQA2lnaa	Hm. well age doesn't really matter. i think maybe you should ask her to like go somewhere with you and talk to her about like life and stuff. just try and get close with her again. it might work like that. but its alright to be jealous.|`|66jX06Onaa	Jealousy is a normal feeling, but you need to get past it and be happy that the 11 year old and 8 year old are finding something to do together. At 17 you will be moving on to new things (job, college, etc.) soon and need to look toward the future.  Talk to your sister when she isn't playing with younger brother. (Dinnertime, etc.) Maybe find a movie you would both like and take her to the movies.  Yes, stop worrying about it. You have a bond - it hasn't been broken because she is playing with little brother.  Eight and eleven are a lot closer in age - you may want to think about what you need to be doing as a 17 year old that you aren't currently doing. (Like working, or volunteering, or joining a club with other high school kids, etc.)|`|PTP8ptDbaa	i know that is soooo hard i am fifteen and my brothers are closer to their ages than i am to them but i have learned to ignore that sometimes i spend time with the both of them with one at a time or with myself and my friends you are growing up but just remember that both of your siblings will and always look up to you as their big sis!  good luck!* :)|`|qsJQiICEaa	I'm 16 and my younger sister is 12. My older sister is 18. my oldest sister and younger sister aren't as close as me and my little sis are. (sorry if that was confusing haha) but my older sister feels left out ALL the time because me and my little sis are SOO close.     I can understand why you're jealous. I feel jealous when my 12 year old sister picks hanging out with her friends over me, or when my 12 yr old sis and 18 yr old sis leave me out. It's totally normal.     My little sis looks up to me too, and I know that'll NEVER change. Your sis of course still loves you, but I think it's good that your sis and bro are getting closer because all 3 of you have eachother and you're all siblings so you should all be close. Your little sis will bounce back to you eventually, you should talk to her about it!!! Tell her you wanna hang out with her more or somethin haha just don't even worry, it'll be okayy! You'll ALWAYS be her older sister, and when she gets older, you'll be the one she always goes to!!!|`|GT1ipOvzaa	being jealous is okay, and completely normal. dont worry.    sounds like you really love your sister, so, maybe you can try telling her you miss spending time with her.    maybe lure her back (lol only way i could put this) by inviting her to do some of her favorite things, like maybe taking her out for icecream or playing her favorite game, things like that.    hope i helped and good luckk!

AA11630994	this is all wrong. It doesnt matter if your hubby works alot, you shouldnt be even thinking this|`|lgXSmCQRaa	Well Im just gonna say Ive never been married (yet ignore the name) but it seems to me that you're wanting to leave something that maybe you should/wanted to leave years ago, simply because you have a reason now and things are easier. I can't tell you what to do, I can only offer some kind of advice. You probably have youngish children and you're just getting your life back, I can understand why this would been increased analysis of your marriage. You seem to have morals and a good sense of what marriage means for you, I do think that if you left now or at some point you would regret it. I'm not sure how your children would take it, your husband would either never see his children (due to work) or he would forever hate you. You didn't mention that your husband is abusive or anything (not that, that is the only reason to leave your husband) so I would say tell him that you need to feel wanted, you need passion and some excitement. Tell him the marriage is mundane tiring, do not tell him you are considering leaving because he will no doubt take it very harshly. Suggest some means of counselling, take a holiday or spend more time doing things you did before marriage.<br>  <br>  This is super long but I hope you read it and I hope I have offered some useful suggestions and I do sincerely hope it works out, its horrible when marriage does not.|`|lIpjuMTHaa	Ugggghhh I hate people who are unfaithful. And yes, you are cheating. Emotionally.|`|51tNYexBaa	Whoaaa, well here's what I think. Now that you have more time, you realized that what you have maybe isn't what you want. This happens a lot to couples after they have raised their children, the kids move out and the couple realizes they have nothing in common. You may very well be missing a lot...........good luck. find your happiness|`|67c5927fb7113617b07cd375a463e8fcaa	People have different views on cheating- you may not have physically done anything, but you're still going behind your husbands back. <br>  <br>  Infatuation, and creating an illusion of a better life over the phone, wont do you any good either. Why are you so hung up over the bloke not phoneing you? Do you actually miss HIM or are you just bored and lonely?<br>  <br>  Sitting mopeing isnt going to help. Go out with your friends/get another job, plan a weekend somewhere with your husband.<br>  <br>  But then to be fair, if you're picturing someone else rather than your husband/are that unhappy why are you with him anyway. Its not fair on him, your children, or you.|`|8DN2jyRsaa	you really need to sit down with your husband and try to explain how your feeling.i have to say,i'm very surprised that you married a man that you didn't love.how could you make that kind of commitment and have children with him,if that's the case?.life is all about balance and compromise,but not capitulation.regarding my countryman,perhaps your confusing infatuation,with love?.you surely must at least try and save your marriage?|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	Ok, I think you were the one that talked about texting your friend from the UK?  Next, you need to remember that you made a commitment. Try to think about the first time you met your hubby, how you felt when you first met, the love you have for each other, focus on those things, and the rest will fade away.  Trust me the grass is not always greener on the other side.  You made a commitment, honor it.|`|ZtHMfNSUaa	Talk to your husband... Tell him everything.

It is only lust that you are feeling. again be careful . Does he truly feel the way you do toward him or is he only tiring to get into your pants, for men can deceive women to get what they want . It happens more then women think. It is you who will be hurt in the end. Be careful.|`|ZzyEhSB1aa	I really don't know what to say.........this is quite common.  You have been married for a long time and it is natural what you are going through.<br>  I have a friend who had a similar thing happen to him, he then had a secret affair it was then ended amicably and they both returned back to their respective partners. But it has never been the same.<br>  <br>  All I can advise is that Deidre of 'The Sun' newspaper has an email address where you can email your problem and she will get back to you.  She has been working as an agony aunt for years and her advice is quite good.  I wrote to her around 10 years ago about family tracing and she gave me a wealth of information with some excellent contacts. So I would recommend you contacting her.<br>  Keep your query anonymous, you really don't know how your friends are going to react in your face or behind.|`|yepd9psLaa	Well something pretty close to what happened to you happnened to me ive been married about 4 years mundane no passion then i went on vacation and went out with some guy i met. He was obviously not "the one" but at least like a wake up call to something i miss that nice converstaion and truly enjoying someones company. So...im going to be divorced in about a year. I would say just chat with other guys maybe they can fill some emotional void of yours.
TthDWtPTaa	maybe
jjj6n5fEaa	You are making me scared of getting married! I have a totally different perception of a so called "wife". Why she should do that? Maybe she is not happy about something in the marriage, and this way is showing her disapproving. I can't imagine a woman doing that with no reason. However, nothing justify that approach toward a "loved one".|`|AA10025824	I just left a wife like that.|`|YjUyBWPEaa	That is terrible.

But you know what, in emotionally abusive relationships, sometimes the man actually looks for that.  He likes Alpha women, he was attracted to that, so when she hen pecks him in to the ground and emasculates him and makes him miserable for the rest of his life,   who's really to blame? not just her.|`|evW18jvIaa	I never do that.

FiCl71flaa	You seem to have a problem that appears easy to resolve. You like this guy and you indicate that he likes you back. This suggests that you guys have a line of communication open and that talking to one another is not an issue. It also means that you guys had to have spoken to each other in depth to realize you liked each other. So all you have to do  is suggest a night out at the movies , for example; do not call it a date and that will reduce your nervousness while allowing you guys to continue to talk and build on your emerging romantic relationship.  With time and increased interaction between you two , things would become normal and easy and free of stress , tension and nerves. I wish you both all the best and hope that things work out the way you want it to .|`|4S6V4sb4aa	I say just ask him,, From a guys perspective we get as nervous as you ,, I'm sure he will say yes..|`|3YpVVRWpaa	you dont have a problem darling you both like each other  just be open and smilely he will be with you|`|Bdo2GNA2aa	if you like him and he likes you just ask if he'd like to hang out sometime.    it shouldn't be a problem|`|wFWytGlxaa	Just do it.

You need to show that you are the more mature person in the situation. Plus, who knows why you didn't get invited to the other party, maybe it was just a mistake. If it turns out that it was a mistake and you don't end up inviting the other person to your party because you think you were not invited on purpose, then you will just end up looking stupid. However, if you invite this person to your party, and then this happens again where they throw a party to which you are not invited, then you should talk with the other person so you can see if its just a misunderstanding, or the person does not value your friendship.
TJiGs8S4aa	Doesn't sound healthy, from what I can figure out.  But maybe if you come across as confusing to her as you do to us here, it makes it easier for her to be ugly.  I don't mean to be unkind, but your question is pretty stream-of-consciousness.      Perhaps she has some kind of psychiatric illness, to act the way she does.  You still don't have to put up with abuse, though.  You could very calmly and quietly tell her, "if you are not going to be civil to me, I am going to terminate this call." then if she is ugly, hang up.  If you need to speak to your child, perhaps you can get a court order.  Good luck!|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.|`|zVZB1Hpwaa	too confusing I dont get you at all

ScHW4842aa	I was in the same boat. I was 18, and had always gone out with men about 5 or so years older than me. I had broken up with a 25 yr old (and dont say im gross. I just liked the way older guys dressed, had careers and were mature)   and as I was walking home from the train station, I said softly aloud: God, im so frustrated. Send me someone my own age. Where are they? Show them to me!    A few days later I met my husband by pure chance on the train. He's two years older than me.     Thanks God.|`|H7ENkTxaaa	Alright babe  You're beautiful,  you are the woman of my dreams,  and  you complete me.    How's that?|`|yorfmfiBaa	Poor kid. Cheer up.

Y6YGHsKjaa	I had the same problem. A friend of mine was being a real jerk and being mean to me and talking about me behind my back. So I complained by email to the person who she was talking to, who told the person who i thought was a jerk, then when I found out that the girl found out, I asked my other friend and she said that she didn't tell anyone, but I later found out she lied. And to top it all off, the jerk was making it worse by telling everyone what I said without admitting that most of it was her fault. But then I asked for forgiveness in person, and she forgave me.     I'm still a little angry about it, but at least I know that she forgave me.|`|I6JoE4CGaa	calm down. stop thinking about it.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	if you ever loved me let go, i will pray from the bottom of my heart and i am sure if you let go it will be easier. it is fair after all. a death for  a death

He probably thinks you need to take things slow|`|AA11595860	He probably felt bad for you. Maybe he wanted you to feel what its like to be held and feel safe.

ByUS0k8waa	You can use it in court. They actually make a program that can be used in court that will store everything he does so that you can print it out and use it in court. You do have to print it out in order for the judge to see it. Why not talk to him and see what he has to say about it first though? When you go looking for something you may find something you don't want to know.|`|MqCuDV4Naa	It's not against the law but it would go against you. It shows that you can't be trusted either. So the judge would rule that you both are at fault, and you would get less of a settlement.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	You don't need to catch him cheating in order to go to court to divorce him.<br>  <br>  But, your hacking action is indeed against the law.  You may end up in jail or being fined for doing that.|`|NS57cIo1aa	its invasion of privacy... and that is one of his right to privacy... i think you could get into trouble... however you are his wife so it could go either way|`|uO0NW2nZaa	against the law you know the privacy act|`|7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	Most experts agree that you should confront your husband about his cheating.  But you need to have a plan.  Choose the time and place carefully so you can discuss the affair at length without interruption.  DO NOT ask your husband if he's cheating.  CHEATERS ALWAYS LIE. Present the evidence you've gathered that proves he's having an affair - names, dates, places, times, absences, phone calls,  physical evidence, etc. Then ask him some pointed questions about his affair:  why he did it, how it started, how long it's been going on, how he feels about the other woman, what he intends to do now that you know.  Listen carefully to his answers so you can accurately assess the situation.  Then you'll be able to make a wise decision about what course of action to take.  DO NOT CONFRONT YOUR HUSBAND WITHOUT PROOF OF HIS INFIDELITY.  To do so will be a colossal waste of time. Most states have no foul divorces which means that you do not have other reason to apply for the divorce except that you can not reconcile. Looking through husband email is not crime.|`|RBRq8406aa	Him cheating or not cheating is really of no value to the courts. Very few states even care what or why someone is divorcing. If you are going to divorcee then do so but court is not going to care if you bring in those items or not.|`|Deb4iqbvaa	I'm not sure, but you google your state's laws. I would print everything out and contact an attorney.|`|8tJPK69iaa	You'll have to ask your attorney, but I would print them out just in case you can.
FBhjhjR0aa	I don't think you are jealous, and even if you were you have every right to be. I think you need to talk to your mom about this. If she has told you that her mom did the same thing to her, then I'm sure she will know how it's making you feel and she will understand. It may just be that she doesn't even realize she is doing it to the extent of hurting your feelings.     Just talk to her, if that doesn't change things, then take it from there.|`|M5XjqI40aa	It is clearly wrong that she treats you this way. I would have a talk with her and tell her how you feel. Let he know that if she continues to hurt your feelings, you will cut off all communications with her until she is ready to be nice.|`|cheXY6NEaa	You should talk to her about it if it hurts you, if you want to have a good relation with her then you have to have good communication|`|fusIwst4aa	Maybe, you should tell her how you feel,She is your mom, :)  xoxo,skullprincess|`|6b2f804b328b7906f19413c462e7e420aa	Why dont you talk to her and tell her that you're feelings are very sensitive and it hurts your feelings that she calls you ugly and fat.  Explain to her that you feel the same way that she did as a child when her mother didnt treat her equally.    Even if the rest of the world thinks youre ugly and fat you should be able to come home and be called beautiful since a mother can see you for your inside and not your physical features.|`|FF4J59pMaa	NO! You are not being jealous! She is being jealous. She probably sees how much of an awesome person you are and wishes she was like that. It is a very bad parenting style and I can't believe your mom would do that to you. You need to tell her how you feel. Tell her that it hurts when she says those kinds of things even if she is joking. I kind of go through the same thing because my dad compares me to my mom and my siblings all the time because I am kind of a work a holic when it comes to clenaing cooking and taking care of my siblings but it is because my parents work a lot. Well my mom teases me about that and always says I am teh favorite one the golden child or whatever. I don't do it on purpose. I mean its who I am. I am a very family orientated person but my mom started having kids young  so she didn't have her fun years so now that we are older she kind of wants those years back and I think thats why she is kind of like that with me. I just let it go cause i know my mom doesn't do it intentionally but I totally know how you feel. Just tell your mom how you feel and if she doesn't understand then maybe you guys just need a time out from each other. Hope this helps and hope your sitaution gets better!|`|clJllx5oaa	She's Jealous.    or    She's trying to act cool infront of your boyfriend.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	She makes fun of you because she is nutz.|`|zJX9wnKGaa	Maybe your grammar has something to do with it.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	No you are not jealous that is emotional abuse try telling her how you feel she may not even notice she is hurting you if it continues dont talk to her alone bring your bf with you when you need too|`|JyvG8dFcaa	your mom has issues with her self...and sounds like she takes it out on you..i am sorry...|`|UThG15FLaa	wow -  Well maybe your mother just has a bit of a crude Sense of humour towards you?

(maybe how you dislike the fact of it)      ? Deee|`|ixJSutYuaa	Bad parenting style.|`|ac4d6b8636c7ba158a7a3614617112c0aa	Maybe your Mom doesn't realize how this is affecting you. You need to tell her how you feel . She is treating you as her mother  treated her. Bring this to her attention- she needs to know. Most of all you are who you are and once you accept yourself as who you are who cares about how others feel. You are human . Good Luck and remember it is you who should accept yourself.|`|fp3KY1MJaa	sounds like your mother is a b***h. she obviously favors you siblings. tell her how much it hurts and that you want her to stop or you will stop coming over for visits.|`|1Sl45kHMaa	Your mother as a mother sorry to say but she needs a psychologist, she is traumatized with her passed and wants to treat you the same. I will just sit her down and talk to her. Also let her know is she continues to do that every-time you come over, you will no longer visit her. See what she says about that... If she takes it as a joke then that means truly she does not care about you. Set you feelings straight to her. Let her know what's up!|`|yT6dkHxWaa	Your mother sounds like a narcissist.  Have you researched 'borderline personality disorder', it could explain a lot, and is more common than you think.    The key is not WHY she behaves so badly - and yes, it is bad parenting, not your jealousy - but HOW you respond to her cruel behaviour.    Less contact is a good start.  Don't give her information, she'll use it against you.  Point out her rudeness when she starts up, "That makes you sound so rude/bitter/silly, mum.'  or ' 'you know a joke isn't funny if you are the only one laughing, right? Only, it just makes you look jealous/stupid, mum.'

ecc1d2c574a12e88946341945f06606daa	Well, there are two roads that you're gonna have to pick with this kind of question and figure out for yourself which road is right for u and your relationship. Some people can handle the fact that the person they love has slept and done intimate things with another human being while they were trying to find things out in their search, and some can't. Either way when you, if you choose to do so, ask the question of whether or not to know about other relations, that asked person is most likely to get defensive, so do be careful because you will treading some very thin waters if you ask, but most people understand that asking the said question will lead to more and more hardships in the relation and that if asker knows the answer then the mistakes of their lives are clearly shown, basically its about how strong you are, are you truly willing to test your love, ask and eventually forgive no matter what, or are you insecure about the love you have... its all about whats best for the both of you|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	No I don't know a whole lot about his past.

He volunteered to tell me right after we were married. Who cares about his past? All the women were nothing but whores and drug addicts. I have never talked about my past and the past is in the past.|`|f9crUDTwaa	yes ... I know everything .<br>       It's the past. It's part of who she is .|`|AA12382198	We started out when we were both pretty young....so there was only 2 other people before me.<br>  <br>  I know why they didn't work out....but it was fine because I wanted to know.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I really don't want to know a whole lot.
pmyHWGCkaa	well no matter if he got into serious trouble or not, it is YOUR decision. your job is to decide whether or not you like him. in somebody, they are a lot more than the things that their background say about them. for example, some really preppy girls like emo guys. their appearance and background doesn't always matter. it's what is inside that counts. if i were you and i really liked him, i'd keep it going. and by the way, guys are very forgetful, so if they don't call, it's just a guy being a guy.|`|EdidZdtlaa	i guess from how i was raised i stay away from the whole gang bit. i dont hang around stuff like that. and i would run if i were you cause alot of bad things could happen you kno. i think hes just bad news but hey thats just me and hiow i am. if hes really sweet to you then go for it. but he seems bad to me i wouldnt dat someone that got in trouble like that but maybe thats just your type.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	you are young, thank god women grow out of that "bad guy" thing. And even you are 16 or 36, if you arent officially dating and you have put your claim down "thats your man" guess what, thats not your man and he and do whoever and whatever he wants. They way i see it is if you like him that much, then you should make him your man, if not then dont worry about it. Cant have your cake and eat it too.|`|s9omDmHWaa	I think you should stay in this relationship and I would just be a little more cautious that's all. Good Luck!|`|GUgzfks9aa	well i think you should move on i mean how long is he going to be there? my friend had the same situation and then she found someone better and she is happy know.|`|hvZb0r3zaa	You don't need a guy like that. Trust me. You'll really get hurt/into trouble later on.
Mqy4Iom6aa	sure why not?   if you like him. dont do it just to ave a boyfriend though. because if he is being serious then your gonna hurt him. but if you do like him then go for it. but dont take it seriously untill youve been together for a while with no problems and you know hes serious that way if he does cheat or whatever then you wont get hurt as bad.|`|hEcKmleVaa	If you already know he's a player, take him for what he is.  Girls always think they are "the one" when in fact, there are plenty more the guy is flirting with.  Keep it casual.  This guy would have to work overtime to get me to believe him.|`|GM6RGpHJaa	He's yet another jerk|`|5ekis6tDaa	a player whos a football player lol  if u wan tto u should  -?-|`|73cc9c8a31eb89062f0b065264502cb5aa	Sure !    Go for it.  You'll have fun dating him if he's a popular guy.  For the player thing, well yeah he might fool around a bit on the side BUT that doesnt mean he doesnt love you.  You would be his best girl.  :-)|`|U01avfzxaa	yea go for it girl!  you gots notin to lose!!!!!
VjcYyRygaa	First of all, you really can't let him go. You guys seem really great together :]. But I think that maybe you should talk to him about it. But not in a accusing way. Just ask his opinion. And don't say your opinion right away, just talk to him about it all first.|`|UHQGlOPlaa	i read the first sentence and nothing more. just break up.|`|9f92a965bf24a2810239fd2d91f31b30aa	kick in the groin is never good|`|S6N0jSh2aa	actually i get where your coming from my fiances friends where exactly like that before we got engaged, its the biggest headache in the world and theres not much really you can do about it except believe that Ivan has the balls and the brains to pick the right choice, which hun in this case would be you, real friends don't lie and manipulate there friends away from someone they love no matter what they think, lest from my experience just let time takes it course and talk to Ivan about whats going on and how it makes you feel <br>  <br>  i hope this helps|`|wDKZoLHCaa	hey,<br>  well, i think that his friends should leave him alone for now. it isn't for him to listen and be told what to do by his friends. he should really learn to know what he wants, and listen to his inner side.<br>  <br>  talk to him about it, you really should.<br>  they keys to a great relationship is communication, trust and love.<br>  if he really loves you, he should listen to you, its the best thing.<br>  <br>  hope all goes well!|`|TGFc2Z6Caa	If he is allowing his friends to influence him to the extent that his friends' opinions are more important to him than your feelings, it is time to reconsider how much your relationship means to him. His friends can't break you up if he doesn't let them|`|goe3y4FPaa	tell him are ur friends '' in special ed.. or what??
v4DSVhc9aa	=] as i said before my dear, you should put him back to the proving stage so that you will see if he really IS sorry and he will NEVER repeat it EVER AGAIN. if ever he proved it and for some time you were contented about it and you were back together and he repeats it AGAIN which for the fact that he keeps repeating before...then...you have to let him go...<br>  <br>  your relationship will arrive nowhere if he keeps on breaking promises. what if he promised to be with you forever? he broke that too. then your heart will be broken and so is your life...<br>  <br>  <br>  just be careful of judging and if he repeats it AGAIN...then...my dear...you have to let go...<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck with your love life my dear<br>  <br>  <br>  bye =]
XoIHB2Vdaa	trust your gut feeling girl!|`|49vr5gidaa	the least you can do is give him one date. obviously this guy hasn't given you a good first impression, so give him one chance.<br>  if you go on a date with him, you never know what you're going to expect. during the date you might find out he's completely different !<br>  if you don't want to go on a date with him, chat with him for a while and learn how he really is. this way you won't give any impressions but you can still meet a great friend.<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  ? vee|`|FaFzixz4aa	Well if your not really "feeling" it for him then don't go on the date. Simple|`|Uhasekptaa	yes if he really likes you
o8NPR0PNaa	We all make mistakes!  Some are big, some small, some really stupid and embarrassing, others only mildly so.      I suggest you:  - focus on something you did that was really great!    - get talking to a long time friend   - go to a movie, bowling, arcade, or something else you enjoy!  - write yourself a letter, tell yourself you will never ever do that again!    Trust me, I am still paying the price now for doing something stupid.years ago!  Cannot undo what you did, regardless.      Take care!  Learn to forgive yourself!  ~ Suzi :)|`|jMffH1kzaa	Just let time pass. If someone in my class does something really embarrassing, I think about it for about a day, and then get on with my life. Trust me, people don't care as much as you think they do.  xoxoxo  jackie|`|c03cbe05d41932f0b8385112709ad903aa	OMG! i thought i was alone..all i can say is live your life everyone has embarrassing moments thats what makes u human! dont worry about girl! life is too short to stay stuck on little things.

cWy17SRnaa	He doesn't want your friend to ask him out for you.  He want you to ask him out.  He seems to like you.  Good luck.

9sKfvqQHaa	honey, you need to go and get yo man back!   if you want him to miss you so much then obviously, you still love him! Don't waste you time feeling lonely and depressed- you will regret going back to him in the future.   just go up to him and say you made a bad choice telling him to leave you alone.  tell him you want things to work out and you miss him already.  I'm pretty sure things will work out. you just broke up with him right? then I guarentee he still misses you!  I hope everything works out!   ;)   good luck!|`|qajX3kzPaa	If he does like youu, it doesn't matter wether you told him you leave you alone or not     if he likes you, he'll try to mend what he did|`|GM6RGpHJaa	Give him the time to think what he has done.  He needs to realized how you feel, then hint him about getting back.|`|63wQA2lnaa	i think maybe you should just talk to him. if it was 2 years than wow! that's allot. he should miss you. just talk it over. i promise it will be okay if you just talk to him. its happen to me before just like that.|`|niC7aoDQaa	well im not 20, but i know how you feel. some guys are just heartless people. i think that you should just leave things on good terms, be friends, and contact each other once in a while. to get over your heartbreak, your should go out clubbing have fun with your girls, dance with a couple of guys, your single again! dont rush into a relationship, because your wont be giving your all to the new guy, cause youll be stuck on your ex. if a new guy does enter your life, tell him what happend, and if your into the guy, say id really like to be with you, but i just went through a terrible break up and i need time to get back to normal. tell him youd really like to keep in touch and just take things slowly from there.|`|7f8EVUn5aa	give it a little time.  time is what it needs right now.    give it a week without texting/calling/seeing him.  see what he does.  If he immediately texts you within a couple days,  just tell him like you see it: "I need a little bit of time to think about us, but i'm not totally against taking you back."  If he respects you and leaves you alone for a bit, see what you feel like then.  If your still undecided, give it another week.    Time WILL give you a better perspective.  And not necessarily one that will lead you to breaking it up.    if he doesn't text you for weeks on end, that's not necessarily bad.  he's respecting the fact that you said you wanted him to leave you alone.  He's listening to what you said... how often we forget that guys can't read our minds/know what we want exactly.  So consider it a good thing.|`|cQILl6mzaa	yeah if he is really in to you and you are really in to him!|`|2hRyB0OXaa	I think that if he really liked you then yes, he will come back. He might not even have realized that you felt the way you did. I think regardless of what you said he will try to get you back. Then again, he might not, but if he doesn't then your so much better off without him and with a guy that really cares about you.    Hope I helped!

uBssj3Znaa	you should stick with your family ... especially if they aren't well and need financial assistance. You have already waited 3 years, what would 2 more be?|`|WBXi14WYaa	family first. you can maybe go visit the bf occasionally (airfare is so expensive these days) but your right, if something were to happen to your family, you wouldn't be there. if you visit for a few days every once in a while and continue to keep in touch, you can be there for your family =]|`|UWx1beYtaa	Stay with your family. This is a time when they need you the most and you will need them if anything does happen.<br>  <br>  You can always go for holidays and see your boyfriend and he can do the same for you. You've been strong enough to last 3 years long distance and I'm sure you can do another 2 right?|`|bT713RWqaa	are you an only child? how serious are their health issues? if money is the only problem..you can always send via interac banking or something.. but i mean if you are the only child.. it would be a very very tough thing to have them be completely alone... this is such a difficult situation...  would you be able to visit them every weekend? <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|vhuqAqNdaa	why can your boyfriend not move back now? could he move in with you?|`|3RfHq80Naa	How serious is it?  Is he talking about marrying you?  Do you want to marry him?  If he's not about to become your husband, then you shouldn't even consider putting him on par with family. <br>  Next, speak with your parents.  Maybe they have support you don't know about.  Perhaps your siblings or cousins can help out.<br>  However, in the end, your parents are your parents, and 2 years is not very long to wait for them.  <br>  Don't bother waiting if this guy does not want to marry you.  Make sure you're not his "Good for now" girlfriend and that he loves you.

ronomgTIaa	i have waaaay too many<br>  <br>  Love quotes:<br>  *Love comes to those who still hope although they've been disappointed, to those who still believe although they've been betrayed, to those who still love although they've been hurt before.<br>  *Maybe there are no right moments, right guys, right answers, maybe sometimes you just have to say whats in your heart.<br>  *A girl asked a boy if she was pretty. He said no. Then she asked him he liked her and he said no. She asked him if he wanted to be with her forever. He said no. She then asked him if he would cry if she walked away. He again said no. She had heard too much. She needed to leave. As she walked away, he grabbed her arm and told her to stay. He said "You're not pretty, you're beautiful. I don't like you, I love you. I don't want to be with you forever, I need to be with you forever, and I wouldn't cry if you walked away, I would die.<br>  *Once in a while, right in the middle of an ordinary life, love gives us a fairy tale.<br>  *Every girl wants a Prince Charming, and while he may be nice and all, I'm thinking that I'd rather have the guy that's gonna call at 4 in the morning just to say hi. Or someone who will stop by my house after just hanging up the phone because he wants to see how I'm really doing, because I said I was fine, but we both know I'm lying. Or the guy who'll stay home on a Saturday night with me because I'm sick. That guy, that one guy, he may not be Prince Charming to anyone else...but he'd be my hero. My "knight in shining armor." Anyone who'd rather stay home on a Saturday night and hold my hair while I puke... that's a hero.<br>  *Wait for the man who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep. Wait for the man who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the the world when you are in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you' re just as pretty without makeup on. One who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky he is to have you. The one who turns to his friends and says, 'thats her...'<br>  <br>  Heart break/Break up quotes<br>  *“Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love.”<br>  *Sad isn't it? How no matter what you do or say to me... when you come running back... when you need me again... I'll be here... right here waiting for you, I'll take you back... no questions asked. Sad isn't it?<br>  *You asked me what was wrong, I smiled and said nothing, when you turned around and a tear came down and I whispered to myself... everything is.<br>  *I missed my ex today, but its ok my aim is improving.<br>  *I wish I saved all the tears I cried for you so I could ******* drown you in them.<br>  *Life is for having fun. Don't be stupid and waste it on some guy/girl who is gonna act like he/she hates you tomorrow. Never waste it on some one who doesn't want their friends to know they're in love with you. Don't give that person the rest of you tears or a month or a year of your life when he/she treats you badly and doesn't mind to make you cry. Every person deserves some one who wants to brag about them. Every person deserves some one who makes them smile and laugh at their worst moments. We all deserve at least that.<br>  *This is for the broken hearted. I know how you feel. Empty, betrayed, and no happiness whatsoever. You don't want to laugh, because you know it's not going to help, but you don't want to cry, because it will just make you feel worse. You feel like your heart is falling apart, but not only that, but you know soon your life is going to feel like it's falling apart too. You don't think it will ever end, and no matter what this person has done to you, it feels impossible to stop loving them. And everyone wonders why if they have hurt you so much, then why do you still love them. That's the confusing part, you don't know why, you just do, and the people who hurt you the most, and normally the ones you love the most. And then, after a few weeks, you finally feel a sense of relief, like you're getting happy again, but you know inside that you're just going|`|utGddhnVaa	there's no blame for how our love did slowly fade and now that's it's gone it like it wasn't there at all|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	i like christina aguilera's song, stronger... for quotes|`|b65yrPX2aa	he gave her 11 roses 10 real one fake .. he said he would love her until the last one died..<br>  <br>  its not me its you <br>  <br>   loving someone is giving someone your heart and trusting them not to break it|`|06O8FaOjaa	EVERYTHNG HAPPENS FOR A REASON<br>  AND WAT DOESNT KILL YU MAKES YU STRONGER|`|eNkVSd9aaa	"Frankly my dear, I don't give a d@mn!"-Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) in Gone With the Wind.|`|9tqlD4vcaa	“It's afterwards you realize that the feeling of happiness you had with a man didn't necessarily prove that you loved him” - Marguerite Duras|`|x1FzJLwZaa	"Heartbreak brings us immense pain and suffering but in reality we must realize that it brings us one step closer to the one we are destined to be with."

RY9b6NT7aa	I've had drama queen friends before and they could be quite interesting and fun. It was never a dull moment with them. However, they always wanted to be the center of attention and could be quite manipulative. Because of this sometimes she could be kind of mean. Drama queens don't usually make good friends who are true but can be fun. It just depends what kind of relationship you are looking for. If she is getting on your nerves and not really fun in the first place possibly just find a new friend.|`|bT713RWqaa	haha yes i know a few drama queens myself. i dated one.<br>  <br>  ummm well if you can't adjust to her personality... perhaps find a new friend. or just teach yourself how to drain her out!

DlCcFu1eaa	Watch Tomb Raider and get an Angelina Jolie attitude. The key is don't snap back, just don't accept his crap. When he starts give him that "Who do you think you are?" look and just go about your business with a smile. When he gets agitated about it say something like "I thought you were talking to me but when you used the word ***** I knew that wasn't me." Stuff like that.    The key is to not let the upset out in shouting or emotional energy. Just be cool and communicate to him that you're not going to let him play you like that any more.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	You said he started acting this way after a deployment. Did something tragic happen during his deployment? If that's the case, then he could be suffering from post tramatic stress, and needs to talk to a professional to get help.    Or is it possible, that he had an affair over there? I ask this because I live in a military town, and I've seen and heard all that military does. And I know of a girl who got deployed, and while she was over there she ended up having an affair with her Sgt. He was married and had kids her age, she ended up getting pregnant over there by that married man. So I know it's very possible for them to have affairs even during deployments.|`|bjsOnyPkaa	Immediate counseling or we separate.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Time to find a place for you and the children to go and, from there, hire a good divorce attorney. Serve him papers and get on with life before you waste any more of it.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	Your husband should NEVER call you those names. Love isn't like that. Tell him he listens and goes to counseling NOW or he's gone.|`|r18PoGJiaa	Seems like a few people here are immediately thinking divorce is the answer. Really?  I think the military is taking it's toll. No one except people serving the armed forces know what goes on out there. I assume that the stress is consuming him.  Jumping to the conclusion that divorce is the answer at this point would be totally unfair to him, you, and the children.   I am not sticking up for this man at all. He is emotionally abusing you and the children by having them see what is going on. What you need to do is have a SERIOUS heart to heart talk with him and give him some options. Either he seeks counseling or for the sake of the children, you are seperating. If he refuses stlil, yes divorce needs to be the last measure. Maybe by then he will think twice and decide to get help to keep the sanctity of this marriage.   Sorry you are going through this, as a woman, you need to put those children first.|`|2PTzgYuvaa	who cares if this abusive jerk gets angry?  Stop putting up with his crap.

Good Luck   stay safe|`|3iNobwVraa	Yikes.  I'm sorry, and I understand.  I think someone forgot to tell you a pretty critical part of that respect issue.  Yes, you do have to show respect to get it, but you have to show it not only to others, but also to YOURSELF.  Do you respect yourself, or have you gotten a bit beaten into submission (not literally--emotionally and mentally?)  Honestly, I don't think the respect thing is helpful to you, it's rather an intangible.      I think the best thing you can remember is that you teach others how to treat you.  You have taught him he may treat you this way (he is still on the hook for actually doing so.)  So, how do you teach him, now, that he, in fact, may not?  I don't know.  It's SO much harder to undo a pattern once it is entrenched.  I really think you should immediately get a professional involved.  There is too much volatility here, and that is incredibly unhealthy.    Good Luck to you, and remember to respect yourself first.  Always.  And, fight for your happiness.  You've now seen what happens when you don't--no one will.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	I think you need to tell him very calmly: "I'm planning to leave you if you don't change your attitude toward me and start showing me some respect",  you say a "deployment" made his mood change this way?  He may need to seek out a VA psychologist because he might be dealing with post traumatic stress disorder and this you have become his outlet and his punching bag for his bad thoughts, feelings, and frustrations.|`|SrmR5iNxaa	You have to understand what a deployment does to you. I am in Iraq right now. I have only been here 2 months but it is already effecting me mentally and emotionally. I am changing and it's effecting my marriage. I don't think I will have a wife when I get back. That's just the way it is.   You just have to realize what that deployment did to him.  The only thing the will help is counseling.    God Bless|`|XMIpSxfmaa	sounds like ur a good woman not many left . he should be glad hes w  you & you should be proud 4 being one of the few role Models ; that know how a man is to be treated
FBhjhjR0aa	If you have this much concern for your friends safe being. Then you need to go to a trusted adult or teacher and tell them exactly what you said here and tell them you just feel that this girl at least needs to be watched to make sure that she's ok. Also tell the teacher or adult, that you don't want anyone to know that you told.|`|Run7dyraaa	How old is your friend? If she is a minor (under 18) she should have been removed from that house a long time ago. Her mother is committing Child Abuse. That is against the law. She can go to jail.  Why didn't you try to help her? Why didn't you tell a teacher at school, or another adult you could trust? Why would you let your friend remain in a dangerous situation like that?  Her mother sounds crazy. If you are worried about her, help her. Call the child abuse Hotline. Call 911. Call someone. Don't do nothing. Verbal abuse is as nasty as physical abuse. Do something for the poor girl before something happens to her.|`|ixJSutYuaa	The old phrase "words can never harm you" is not true. Mental abuse is just as damaging as physical abuse. If she is under 18 she needs to contact CPS. If she is over 18 she needs to leave that house.

gJE0ujbzaa	A lot of people are raised to believe sex is something that should be done, but NOT talked about. They can have some real inhibitions talking about it.    A lot of guys(and girls too), don't like to talk about it because they are afraid someone is going to tell them they aren't doing things right. This is particularly a problem with guys. For some reason, some guys think that being a "stud" means never having to ask how to do things.    You already know you have a big communication problem. Now you need to decide what to do about it. You can live with it-but you are going to find it will only get worse.  You can give him an ultimatim(participate in a conversation with me about this, or I'm leaving you), once you are both 18, you can tell him you want him to go to couples counselling with you to try and get him to open up, or you can just decide he's still too immature for a serious relationship and give up on him and move on to someone a bit more mature.|`|ZR34thBvaa	Tie him up and tell him everything you want while riding his weapon.|`|iQoCIHlGaa	well..  i would ask him why he was ignoring me then if he says not at all or no then u tell him how u really feel but thats just me b/c i dont belive in having secret feelings in a relationship=]|`|QOWA80Yiaa	well maybe he practices abstinence which is good get married  then he'll talk  good luck|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Buy a book like The Joy Of Sex.

Good Luck|`|D1WdXvyUaa	awwww, guys are like this you know...but, when I want to talk about these sorts of things with my boyfriend I do it on msn. It's fantastic for this sort of thing! Making them feel more comfortable and allowing them to answer in their own time without feeling any pressure. It took a couple of conversations before he got completely used to it but it worked...saying some things when together now is okay...I know he still might find it hard to talk about those things person to person but then again, so would I! Just a suggestion :)    Take Care|`|DlEwI1XPaa	dunno me 2|`|sIqQF5j2aa	Obviously he is just uncomfortable with the topic.  Some people are just shy about it.  Not every one feels that they can talk openly about it, and it could be quite possible that he's not ready for.  You could tell him that you just need to have this talk and that he needs to take it seriously.|`|shb1309caa	Uhm, how old are you, and do you only talk on the compuer?|`|AA11595860	Men don't like communicating babes.  They like action.   You want something done, get him to do it. If you want to know what he likes, just try different things. Believe me if your doing something right he'll COMMUNICATE quick! GL!|`|SRvQBg1Haa	hm... that's sounds like it could get annoying after awhile.      one day ask him why he doesnt want to talk  about that kind of stuff or something like that. and tell him that he can't say i dont know or anything that doesnt give an answerr.  (if that made sense)              you could try like slowly breaking him in with like the sexual talk.   like first start with like  ----->  hugging  kissing  cuddling  ---------->   then get into the more detail and everything.                      i hope this help.

OItPJZjBaa	I would say give it more time at least a few more months. You never know maybe she will ask for your number or she'll give you hers.

e3XC8M6Yaa	Okay, My best friend has a huge crush on a guy who once was my best friend. I'm really awkward around him, because I know he likes both of us, but he likes me more, apparently, because he keeps asking me out (and I say no, because I DO have a boyfriend) and then he asks he out, and she thinks everything is amazing. It is awful. But he and my other ex-boyfriend overheard me talking to my friend about a date I was going on, and boom! Problem solved. No more approaches from my former best friend and sometimes best friend's awkward boyfriend, and no more creepy ex. I don't know, I don't think the same thing would work for you. Try just talking to him.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	If he is more important to you than the friendship then go for it.  Your friend is just dragging you down anyway.|`|EdidZdtlaa	thats messedes up if you were supposed to go out with a guy your friend used to like. but ask her and make sure she dosent like him anymore. then if its all gudd get to kno him more.|`|rju0fqVcaa	go up 2 him|`|3YpVVRWpaa	leave him alone as long as you want to kkep your friend ship or what till your friend find some one else.|`|sWgekFwaaa	leave him alone until ur friend doesnt like him anymore|`|T3NAVsx1aa	You can talk to him as frends but if your frend gets mad @ u for  talking to him, then you should tell her 2 trust  u and that u wouldnt do anything to hurt her. If he actually tells u his feelings 4 u, then you should set him straignt. Dont be harsh, just tell him about how your frend likes him but make him promise not 2 tell and if he cares about u then he wont. This will help him 2 understand that  he is 0ff limets 4 u.  But dont get 2 carried away and fall in love with him!!!|`|Dx23osxWaa	do wat u think is best [[approch him]]|`|QOWA80Yiaa	well talk to him right now yes right now right now  good luck|`|vIr0Y0EVaa	You say that she used to like him, so I'm guessing that she doesn't like him anymore. And so, you can go for it. Just talk to him and see where it goes. Good luck.|`|sz6VWpDYaa	Ohhhh ive been in thihs sorta situation before. First no matter how bad it hurts you should confront your friend about it. If it really hurts her tell him no. If shes okayy and you want to get to know him too then you should go for it!    Good Luck!|`|m5a4OcnVaa	That happened to me too!!!   Just talk to him as friends.  My friend's crush is my best guy friend so she doesn't really care if i talk to him 24/7.   So if your friend asks just say we were just talking|`|s9omDmHWaa	I think you should talk to him. But just as friends! I don't think your friend will be angry or you will be considered a bad friend if you just made another friend. But if it comes to dating, you need to decide if the guy is worth losing a friendship if it comes to that.|`|nwXQqowKaa	If you want to get to know him too you need to ask your friend if it's okay first. If she doesn't want you to then you being her friend you should leave him alone. If she doesn't care if you do, You can choose whether or not you want to get to know him or not.|`|shb1309caa	Talk to him, get to know him, it'll be alright, and if your friend was a good friend, she'd get past what was, and let you be friends with him.|`|H4wXI1qTaa	You can be friends with this boy, but if your friend still likes him then you probably shouldn't take it any further than that.
Dh5CUjmkaa	I am sorry that your wife has had to do this to make money. I would start by finding whatever job you can find. If this means you have to work and Burger King, then you have to work there. Every dollar you earn is one she does not have to strip for. So maybe you can get her to cut back on the hours she works. Don't feel frustrated, I live in an area where manufacturing is the biggest employer and now people are being laid off all the time. So you not being able to find a good paying job is not you, it is the times. The reason why I am suggesting this is because I am a manager of a fast food business and hire convicted felons all the time. I have watched almost all go on to get hired at great jobs elsewhere. Sometimes you need to prove yourself trustworthy to get people to take you seriously. Someone will eventually hire you. Just keep faith. I do want to warn you, fast food is not glamourous, or high paying unless you become a manager. But it is a start, and everyone has to eat so it is more of a stable job right now. After you get a job, you need to sit down with your wife and ask her if she would concider getting a job where you work or one that does not involve demeaning herself for money. If she refuses, you know that she is not going to change her situation, you can either accept it and hope and pray nothing bad happens to her, or move on. Because really, she is only one step away from drug abuse and prostitution. Tell her that and tell her she is better than stripping for money. Tell her you love her and tell her you are sorry that you had to go to prison and leave her alone. Because of your actions, you caused this. Sounds like you are sorry and want to move on, hope it works out for you. God bless.
gJE0ujbzaa	If you want people to take you seriously, learning how to write in english, rather than txtspk, is a good idea. Your "frnz" are really your "friends", and "dem" are "them".    When you don't use correct English, it can be really difficult for other people to understand what you are trying to say.    I think you are saying you are jealous of your friends, and don't like them speaking to each other?    It sounds like you are worried that when they get together, they are going to talk about you behind your back.    Best thing to do is be sure you aren't giving them reason to talk about you(or at least, no reason to talk BAD about you).  Make sure you aren't telling one person one thing, and the other person a different thing. And don't say stuff about one person to the other.    It's really good you recognize your feelings, that they aren't good, and you want to do something about them.    Make sure you are acting like yourself with both sets of friends, and not acting one way with one set, and another way with the other.  Then you don't have to worry one set will find out you aren't like that with the other.  They will both know you as you really are, and there won't be any problem.    You won't seem weird or depressed, you may appear a little controlling though.    It might help you to talk to a school counsellor about what you are feeling. They aren't going to tell your friends anything, or think you are weird, and they just might have some good ideas for you to help you feel better about things.|`|Gf6stBUVaa	if there your friends you shouldn't be jealous of them , you are you for a reason , accept that and move on .|`|XVDZAiiVaa	man its not a big deal , you should be friends with who u want and if some friends don't like other ones thats there choice not to become friends you do what you want to do.|`|ayMXUVgvaa	its alright to get jealous because you dont want to lose your friends to other friends...i think that you should talk to someone..either your friends or someone..|`|vepPKpblaa	Well, one of my friends used to be in the same position as you are right now.    She used to not like it when I talked with other people. But now she has changed and she doesn't mind.    They key to stop jealousy in this situation is to not think about it. If you don't want to talk about it to your friends, just try to suppress the feeling of jealously - eventually, it will go away. Besides, I'm pretty sure your friends would become pissed off at you if you told them you are jealous about this situation. At least, that's how I felt when my friend told me about her jealousy.    Think of your friends becoming friends with your other friends as a good thing, as it will be likely that the friends in your group will introduce other people you haven't made friends with, and therefore you have more people to socialise with!|`|JqzFzavCaa	That's a stage most people get over when they share their crayons... but  depending on what kind of friends they are (male or female) you might have feelings for them. Or your just afraid they might talk about you behind your back or tell each other what you have been saying about one other. It's probably not that serious.|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	What the hell are you babbling about spell the words so we can understand, is this crap text language if it is no wonder spelling a problem today|`|rZuSN2kTaa	Get a life and get over it!!!|`|wiJBiwmQaa	you cant control  them...just let them be and if they are true friends they will still be friends with you. and if they arent...|`|3dcc4e932de9c8b89aae565f1ad8f688aa	u luk like a fool when u dnt spel evrytin out, it makes u luk unedjukatid.|`|ykCo6SDOaa	http://www.wikihow.com/Handle-Jealousy
2OBP8fqJaa	The essence of love is forgiveness. It's hard to do, and feelings can still be raw. That is okay. It's a choice to decide to start.    When my husband listens to me and values my ideas and opinions.     Being clean shaven and dressing nice and taking care of hygiene like trimming your unwanted hair, brushing your teeth more often, having clean ears she will want to kiss, and putting the seat down. Dress like it's 2009, not 1979. No offense, it's probablly not meant for you, but there are some guys out there that need to hear that.    When you are out shopping for tech stuff, think of her and just pick out a broach or something she likes. You don't have to spend much, just think of her without it being a Holiday.     Help her with things around the house, but don't expect a big pat on the back or you might be disappointed. It will take time.    Help her with things around the house, but don't expect a big pat on the back or you might be disappointed. It will take time. ( I had to say that twice)     Be polite and don't tell her what to do, but don't back off what you believe.    Go see "Fireproof" with her.     Talk maturely and look her in the eyes instead of focusing on the TV or computer.     If your computer is a problem (porn) go to settingcaptivesfree.com or dump the PC.    Listen to her even if it hurts what she says. Find out what she needs.     What most of us need are responsible men who look at us only and want to lead our family in security financially and intimately and think of our dreams also.    Let her know she is beautiful all the time. Notice her hair and how she matches her clothes.     Don't push for it, in fact just touch her shoulder from time to time and let her know you are glad she is back. Pet her hair as you walk by. Rub her shoulders if she has a headache. Get her some medicine if she isn't feeling well.    Smile and be happy.     Find out what you did or didn't do right the first time and try to get Christian counseling and guidance.     And the biggest thing that would turn me on to my husband is if he went to get counseling by himself to work on his own issues. Start leading your family by going to church, but don't judge her or expect her to go.   If my husband did this, I would flip out!|`|zH80yyDQaa	Get a new girlfriend and make sure she walks in on you when you and the girl are kissing.|`|m6FPXCeuaa	well she probably feels guilty...think of the resons that made her have the affair and try on those parts to keep the spark between you guys|`|67O85hIzaa	i dont think you should hit back at her but thats just my opinion.    Just talk with her FOR REAL.    Sorry for what happened!    =(|`|t3Zfddchaa	No she is not looking for a reason to stay...otherwise she wouldnt have had an affair in the first place. You just wanna believe it. She cheated on you, a line of trust has been crossed, it will never ever be the same.    if you really must, id separate and give it time...a lot|`|nmAjAH73aa	Try to focus on yourself and do things that make you happy and then she will see that you are a person who is busy with your own things and she will become a part of your world.  In other words try to ignore her.|`|Dh5CUjmkaa	That one is going to be hard. I would take her out and wine and dine her like you did when you were dating. Try to figure out why she had the affair in the first place. This might mean you have to sit down with her and ask her. Maybe you did not pay enough attention to her and the other guy did. But remember, she cheated, so it is probably her problem, not you. Maybe take her on a trip or take her to a spa. By making an effort that you want her, she would be cold hearted if she did not give you a chance.|`|d39dc2a48a86bf08c5bfb20d68522559aa	You need to go to marriage counseling to find out: WHY she had the affair; WHAT you can both do to strengthen your marriage, and HOW you can learn to trust her again. If she's looking for a reason to stay, insist on marriage counseling so that you can work things out. Otherwise, this all will just happen again.|`|9OFEj10uaa	im no romeo but from wat ive seen(parents devorsed)(dad devorsed 2 times)  try 2 do the unexpected like if she goes 2 work and when she arrives have a romantic dinner with candle light in your house...if u have kids and she usually cooks y dont u cook this time....    and wen u guys go 2 bed if shes tierd giv her a bakrub...NOT to hav sex or anything just so she sees how luky she is 2 hav u....but if it leads 2 sex....BY ALL MEANS.    try 2 spice up your intimacy, if u hav kids then it might be harder but a woman like when she gets treated differently then all the other tipacal men.|`|4Uj2SJP1aa	If you decided to give her another chance, then go for it.  How about buying her flowers and inviting her on a date or for dinner.  Or things you use to do before getting married.  What did she like before this happened, try to think back.  Surprise her with a vacation to a romantic place.  Do whatever you think you have to,  to get her interested.  You have nothing to loose,  if she sees you are trying your best,  and that you care about her she has to get back to being attracted to you.  If she returned its for a reason,  and you took her back for a reason.  People make mistakes.  Good luck.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	She wants someone strong, so don't do everything for her.  You need to be able stand on your own and let her see that you are able to stand on your own.  Do dishes, but put things away in slightly different places.  She will get irritated by not finding things.  Just tell her you find things to be more effective in there new locations.  Stop giving her access to all of your money.  Contribute only what is fair to cover your part of the bills and food that you actually use.  If she has a car payment you should not be paying for it out of you money.  Be fair, but not generous.  Start playing pool.  Do something that gets you out and away from her.  She will wonder why and where you are.|`|L6327Zrtaa	OK, I'm glad you're seeking advice.  For one, most of the advice above is really bad (no offense everyone!).  It shows what a great heart you have that you've forgiven her (enough) to bring her back. You sound like a really great guy.    THAT SAID, you have to change your behavior.  I have no doubt that she strayed because she found herself uncontrollably attracted to someone who may not be more educated/funny/charming/etc., but IS more masculine than you.  You need to show her your masculine side, and you need to show her that you're not needed and that you're desired by other females.    Sorry, but being nice does not make women wet (sorry to be crude).  Being masculine and showing that you're a desirable male does.  For one, stop being so forgiving, and stop being so concerned with how she perceives you. You have to truly get yourself to a point where you DON'T need her company, her affection, or her approval.  Sure, these things would be nice to have, but know that you DON'T need them. If you do need them, it will show.    For two, realize that since she put your marriage on the line for a fling, she's in the doghouse, so to speak.  Realize that if you met a women right now who desired you, you could go for it.  Realize that a lot of women will desire you, as long as you don't demonstrate wussy-type behavior.     Show your masculine emotions to your wife.  Don't hold back all your anger.  Show her that you're strong and masculine, and that you could F the hell out of any fine chick that came your way.  Step up the rough sex (if you're even having sex), and take the reigns, man.      Don't go to a counselor -- they do more harm than good.  Consider that you might have to put yourself back on the market.  Even if you don't, do what you have to do to make yourself more attractive to ALL women -- nothing sparks women's desire more than the desire of other women for her man.  Why do you think women nearly pass out at concerts -- do you think it's because of their profound musical appreciation?  Having all those women competing for the same 4 dudes pumps up their juices.|`|dTaGzh6Haa	Got any ideas why she came back home? Has she told you why she cheated on you in the first place? Is she willing to talk to you about it? At some point the two of you will need to begin a discussion and start learning to listen to each other without interruption. No defenses, no excuses. This is the way to start the healing. You won't like some of the things she will tell you and vice versa, i.e. it's going to hurt.   I wonder if she is consumed with guilt. If this is the only time you guys have had this happen then I would imagine she was in a lot of pain and was desperate for something. Maybe the affair made her realize that she really loves you, and she knows she has hurt you so badly.   Know this about a woman: the way it goes in the bedroom has EVERYTHING to do with how it goes OUTSIDE the bedroom. If everytime you come upon her all you want is to have sex...huge turnoff. Ick. Ick. Ick. Be aware of yourself and how you act around her. Treat her gently, like a woman. Don't be loud or demanding. Be genuine. I'll bet there was something emotional missing. There's much to be said about a man who provides safety and comfort for his wife...and I'm not talking about buying her something. It can only come from your heart. Hope this helps.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	judging by the fact that you're looking for a way to convince her to stay after she went off the reservation, the diagnosis is easy to make.    Please be seated...  You my friend are suffering from "I'm-a-female-worshiping-whimpitis."    See, it's like this. If you put them on a pedestal and kiss their butts and worship the ground they walk on and take the blame for their misdeeds, you will be unattractive to them. Women are attracted to men, not little boys looking to please mommy.    The solution is, you've got to reassess your clothes, body and attitude. You've got to get a new look, hit the gym and get a who gives a crap ( in a sweet friendly way) attitude. First get some other girls interested in you, then she'll fall in line. Being nice and chasing after her will only say to her "I'm so pathetic that even though you cheated on me I'm still going to kiss your butt". Women aren't attracted to pathetic losers. Get it in your mind that you're somebody important. Somebody who matters. Then she'll be attracted to you. Ask yourself, Would Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp or any other famous person act like this towards a woman? If the answer is no you're probably doing the wrong thing, wearing the wrong thing and acting the wrong way.    If you want to attract a woman, be what a woman wants. Women like men. Be a man. She may ***** and moan about it, so much the better. Never whine, never complain, never show weakness to a woman. You'll be happier and the women will start chasing you. I'm not saying be a macho @ss. I'm just saying be a man and have a man's attitude.    Good luck|`|AA10025824	Maybe its over.  It's great that you are able to take her back but something caused the affair to begin with and maybe she's just done.|`|fz63eDaVaa	Do you forgive her? If so, let her know.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Why are you trying to get her back?  She ******* cheated on you!  Go find a woman who won't treat you like ****, that'll bring her lust back.|`|krKMYVbFaa	Show her why she married you in the first place.  Be romantic and show her how much you love her and want her to be with you.|`|aleWoJufaa	Watch Meet Bill - Bill does some things; but you might not make your marriage work (he gets closer but doesn't) or you might.   You might be able to get your spouse back or not. Be patient, kind, considerate and warm (make sure you're heart is at the right place on the inside); she will see that you are the kind of man she wants.  Try to suggest marriage counselling for the both of you to attend, so that she will go to the counsellor with you and so you can work together for your marriage.  Sorry about your situation - it is nice that you really love your partner.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Actually you shouldn't be trying to get with her she should be trying to get with you.

Once you get that figured out you might be able to win her back.|`|AA10405438	Go back in your mind to the things you did for her when you were happy or began dating.  Romance isn't just sex for a woman.  The more you show her what she used to find attractive the easier it will be for the little sparks to turn into fire.  Please be patient.|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	be straight up with her and ask her what she saw in the other guy. Maybe you can do something to change yourself.... but remember that its a 2 way street.     PS> I would also freeze any joint bank accounts that you might have so you arent left stuck|`|QkYRnTPIaa	If your wife came back to you then she definitely wants to work on the marriage.  She knows that she destroyed the trust you had in her and that is something very difficult to get back but it appears you are willing to forgive and allow her to earn that trust back.  Make sure she knows this.  She probably also feels a lot of guilt but hopefully in time by forgiving herself she will be able to overcome this feeling.  I would also like to point out that she may not be looking for the "lust" aspect of your relationship right now but I would really focus on the "love" part of the marriage.  You're both dealing with a lot of hurt emotions right now so start from the beginning like when you were dating and get to know each other over again.|`|AA11946996	It sounds like you are kinda in my shoes. You can follow these MOST of these steps to become a better you and that will help in that area. I won't say to move on but you need to look like you already did, if you catch my drift homie.
ia9JZiX7aa	You should talk with him about what he wants rather than just trying to trying to decide based on his actions. I know its a really complicated situation, but just talking and knowing the truth about his intention will make everything a lot easier.|`|CUc2gqzjaa	wikidd complicated. but umm i think you should start ignoring him and move on
5ekis6tDaa	its the classic situation  here is a quote:    "A guy and a girl can be just friends, but at one point or another, they will fall for each other...Maybe temporarily, maybe at the wrong time, maybe too late, or maybe forever."    you have to really think hard and figure out if u are willing to risk ur friendship with the boy by telling him how u feel    and if you are ready to risk your relationship with the two friends who like this boy too.    but it sounds to me like you have a big flirt on your hands  lol  =D    good luck  -?-
bO2rzfISaa	No further details are necessary. If you're married you can take your child anywhere. People do it everyday. Ever taken your kids to Grandma's? Disneyland?     If you get there and decide you want to file for divorce and custody, so be it. It's totally legal.|`|GHd84xipaa	you need to give more details.you say you are married,is the parent going on vacation with out you?|`|d39dc2a48a86bf08c5bfb20d68522559aa	Yes. If you are married, you can take your child anywhere you like, so long as you are planning to come back.|`|I814g6ZBaa	If you think some harm is going to come to your child you should probably go talk to the police.   Otherwise, there probably isn't anything you can do.    EDIT:  Did you hear anything overnight?  I read you addt'l details; a call to the police might be just what you need to do.  Sending positive thoughts your way, Honey!!|`|kbIkVS0raa	as long as you are married and on the birth certificate then yes there is nothing wrong with that
g4iElgObaa	Make the cake yourself. Go to walmart, they actually have 3 tiered cake plates for that reason, buy yourself 3 boxes of vanilla betty crocker and vanilla icing, and make 3 cakes. Invitations you can also get at walmart and print off yourself, theyre really cheap. I would look on craigslist for a dress or even at a thrift store, they usually have nice white dresses for 40-50. Im sure your soon to be husband has a nice shirt and tie, he doesnt necessarily need a tux. A lot of pastors will marry you for a small donation. The marriage license will be about 60 dollars though. You could have a pastor marry you in a park, (if they allow it - most public ones will, for free or small charge) and have a small party there after, buy a couple lunch meat platters and some rolls, and have the cake for dessert :) I think it would be simple, but fun. Congrats on your new baby on the way & your marriage! GL!|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  Lots of us can give you ideas, but the main thing is....you won't be able to get much for that amount.....sorry....I am not trying to be mean...it's just the way it is.    It depends on where you live, but you should budget about $30 for the marriage license.  THEN, about $50 for the judge to perform the ceremony.  IF you are members of any church, then of course, check with your minister, but even then....you will need to give him/her at least $50.    ~ So that is about $80 of your budget.  If you have $400....then that leaves you with $320.  Or, if $300....that leaves you with $220.    For the rest:  ~ I would look at buying a very, very inexpensive dress or wear something that you already have.  Look at Target or Kohl's on the clearance rack.  Same for your fiance.  Get him some khaki pants and a shirt from Target or Walmart.   Hopefully, only spend about $75-$100 between the two of you (or less!).    ~ Invitations:  Really, I wouldn't even worry about invitations.  I would call family and friends.  If you really want invitations, I would buy invitation type paper (at Walmart) and make your own.  I have, myself, purchased this type of paper there.  Here is an example:    http://us.st12.yimg.com/us.st.yimg.com/I...  http://us.st12.yimg.com/us.st.yimg.com/I...    You can find packages of nice paper similar to this at Walmart.  You get 20-25 in a package and it's only about $3.00.    Then, bring it home and format it on your computer.    ~ If it was me, I would have a courthouse wedding and then have people back to your house for some cake, punch and coffee.  That is it!  There is no need for decorations.  Just clean your house and put out a nice tablecloth and have some sweets (cake and other things if you want) and perhaps some cheese/crackers and fruit.      Easy and simple!  Good luck.|`|sMUiGFPraa	Get fam to donate airfare and fly to Vegas. you can get married for as little as 75.00 in an Elvis style chapel. most come with a free room, a crappy one prob, but free.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	You aren't going to get much more than the essential requirements of a wedding for that budget.    Justice of the peace or a judge in your local courthouse will be the least expensive.  About $50 for the license and they may charge you a few bucks for the ceremony - I'd guess another $50.  Get simple rings cheap - check www.qvc.com for a decent deal/price.  Sterling Silver would be most affordable.  Maybe  $100 total.  Wear clothes you already own rather than buying new and invite just a few people to attend verbally and have cake & coffee at your home - - cake might run $20 - $40.|`|k6F9zkIRaa	You can find cheap do it yourself invitations at micheal's, joann fabrics, and even walmart. All you do is print them from your computer. They will run you maybe $20-30. Get a cake from Walmart, or a sheet cake from a grocery store. Get a nice dress in white (or any color if you don't mind) that may be on clearance! I always find great deals at jcpenneys! Decorations you can find just about anywhere but they do have some at the places where they sell the invitations. Depending on how many people your planning on having it, have the reception at someones house or look into a fire hall. Depending on the fire hall they might not charge you much. As for food, you can ask relatives to help you cook the food. This is what my cousins did and it worked out great! Good Luck and congrats!|`|ovnMPPhraa	Get married at the courthouse and have a reception at home.  get your family to help prep food.  Stouffers Lasagna, salad in a bag and some rolls go a long way.  Congrats!|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	Have a civic wedding and evite your guests to a BBQ in the park.  Nothing fancy, NO PRESENTS!|`|Y08YLysXaa	Hi,    I'm doing my wedding on a bit of a budget also.     Venue: The beach & then a BBQ or family dinner at home, a park, a cheap hall that you can decorate yourself, a family member who has a lovely garden or house? Do you go to church, have a minister that will do the ceremony for no charge? Mine isn't charging me...    Food: Get all your family together and cook cook cook 1 - 2 days before! Or have a cocktail wedding with fingerfood only. Just buy some cheap fingerfood and arrange for a family member to heat it up/arrange it and put on the tables.    Invitations: Buy some card-like paper of a size you desire and some 'velum' paper to go on top. Velum is an opaque somewhat seethrough paper. Type up your invitation in Word and print directly onto the velum. Mine came out looking very professional. You can then pin them together with a decorative pin that goes through both the pieces of paper up the top, or in any way you like (or what you find that's cheap!). If you don't really care about invites that much, buy a pad of wedding invitations, I have seen those too for about $10 for a pad of 50.    Cakes: Make yourself or have someone make it for you as a wedding gift (what I'm doing). You can buy simple cake molds (one big and one a bit smaller), and some cake mix if you don't really know how to make cakes. Then you bake them both, put the smaller cake on top of the larger cake and ice it, maybe put some fresh flowers on the top (so long as they're not poisonous flowers - roses are safe), it can look really nice - and it's cheap!    Clothes: Rent or borrow... many people still have their veils, shoes, costume jewelery etc and don't mind lending it. Wear a nice dress you already have or borrow someone elses. Wear a white tanktop and a nice detailed white skirt as the dress. If you want a full-on wedding dress, look in thrift stores or try on friends/family's.    Decorations: Simple vases, or even decorative glasses that you already have and cut flowers from yours or someone's garden... flowers are VERY expensive! If no one has a nice garden full of flowers, buy some cheap candles and put them on some kind of nice plate or stand to put on tables. Decorate chairs with cheap material from spotlight or other craft/sewing stores... tie bows around the chairs with it or let the 2 pieces just hang down. Ask people if they have nice table cloths, if you don't have your own. Sometimes you can find cheap enough material to cover the tables in a colour you want, too.    You'll need help from others! Just ask everyone, they will understand your situation. I hope you enjoy your special day and congratulations on your baby. The wedding day is not the be all and end all, a lot of people barely remember it in 10 years. Just enjoy it no matter what you end up having!|`|blVOODknaa	If you have a relative or friend, that has a great backyard, have them lend it to you for the day. Venues usually cost a lot and take between 15-50% of the wedding budget.     Now for invitations, you can either get creative and design your own from your computer or go to your local Walmart/Target and buy some there. I could create some invitations for you for free, just message me if you'd like that.    By clothes I am assuming you meant, your dress, it's really hard to find a dress but check out ebay. Or you can just buy a white dress at a store and accessorize it. Go to your local bakery for a cake, something simple but with some groom/bride topper. If you have Publix around, you can try one there too. You can rent tables/decorations for a day. It would be so much better to help if I knew where you were located. Anyway, I hope this helps.|`|HOK5C8n4aa	Have a civil ceremony and invite your closest family and friends to your place and have a dinner in celebration (I don't know where you live, but I'm assuming cold weather may put a nix on outdoor ideas).  Get a sheet cake and decorate your home.  Remember, the less you spend, the more you have for when baby comes and that money may save you from a tight spot.    Besides, all you really need is the love of the other and sharing that with the people closest to you will make it special.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	At Home, Borrow a dress or wear one you have, No tux just suits or nice pants and shirt. 2 attendants only, see csilkc.com for flowers.  Officiant see area craigslist your area to find one. Get a spiral sliced ham, make potato salad,fix a veggie tray, fix some fruits and have chocolate dip and caramel fruit dip. Invites from walmart $14.97 per 50, print on computer. Orientaltrading.com for decorations see the wedding catalog. Make your own cake decorate with silk flowers and satin ribbon. Walmart has the tiered pans from wilton, make cake using mixes, frost with canned frosting. allow it to dry a while and place ribbon as a border at base of the tiers may run strans of pearls( fabric or craft stores) around it too. decorate with silk flowers from dollar store or craft store or get from csilkc.com .|`|3MDY29gnaa	search your local Craigslist, and ebay  Maybe go to the court house to get married and fave a get together after for the celebration!|`|AA12245847	I would ask for some help from friends in this situation.  Have the wedding in yours or someone else's house.  Ask a friend to make the cake (betty crocker does the job!!) You can ask guests in lieu of gifts, to bring a dish or you can order sandwiches from Sam's Club.  Invitations from the Dollar stores are pretty nice for a casual event.  I have seen some pretty nice wedding decorations aswell over there.  I think it's all in the way you place the stuff.  Remember, less is more.  Too much looks cheap!|`|2W71X8gxaa	I think the best thing is to plan a very intimate, small ceremony. Only invite immediate family and go to your local courthouse to tie the knot (this doesn't necessarily scream "dream" wedding, but it's budget friendly).    Also, opt for a non-traditional cake, like a wedding cupcake cake. There is a great website that has a wedding cake directory, just type in your city and state and you will be able to find a local baker and get a small cake. I linked to their website... http://www.weddingwire.com/wedding-cakes    Hopefully this was some helpful information and good luck with the wedding.|`|scRDux1caa	As for the invites, I would go with E-Vites, they are free, just about everyone has an e-mail address, and they can be super cute and informative.  For the dress, try checking CraigsList. Some people may think that's weird but hey, your on a budget.  Have friends and family bring a dish to pass, and invite your close friends to help you decorate. I'm sure they would be more than happy to pitch in for the decorations for your special day!  Good luck! Best wishes for your new family!|`|rrN1QnlFaa	I found my dress at goodwill for 4.00 and then had it dry cleaned for 1.85 for a total of 5.85 Walmart makes cakes for around 100.00 but I watch alot of youtube videos and monkeysee videos on how to make my wedding cake and I think I am going to do that.. the park is a nice idea especially if they have a covered area you can use. decorations go to  the dollar store they have everything and watch Micheals craft store for coupons you can get stuff cheap that way... also pitch in with the family make meat and cheese trays, veggie trays, fruit salads, chips ects keep it simple you dont have to go all out.. and if you want throw on the grill and cook hot dogs and burgers its your day most of all enjoy and try not to stress it tooo much... and congrats and both the wedding and the baby :)
RRzcbvvXaa	i understand your feelings. i guess he was just trying to be cautious by thinking ahead, but by doing so he insulted you. i would probably feel the same way if my bf did that to me because it would make me feel like hes planning on not staying with me for very long. even though that's how it came across to you, i dont believe that was his intention by doing that. my suggestions would be to try to see if there is any way you can get on that plane with him, and if not then i guess you should decided whether or not you really want to go. i know that i wouldnt wanna ride alone on an airplane, but if you think it will be worth it, then do it.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Dont go on the trip and while he is gone pack all your stuff and move out.

He is hoping you will break up with him so he has the freedom to go on the holiday as a single man.  Do yourself a favour, dump him and spend the money you would have spent on the holiday on a treat or holiday for yourself.|`|tyn8k2cZaa	To me it sounds as if he was hinting that you might break up before the trip. Why else would he be thinking about stuff like that. It depends how much time is between now and the trip, though, I guess. I would tell him how you feel about being left out and I'm sure he'll understand. He could just actually be cautious for you as an act of love. Try to see it through his eyes and I'm sure things will work out one way or another.    Good luck!|`|AA10553671	dont go and find someone new.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	This kind of behavior proves to me that : he doesn't love you, wants you to break up with him, incredibly immature, mean, cold and shows that he doesn't care about what happens to you.  You said it yourself, why waste another day. Hun, breaking up is never an easy thing to do, but you know in your heart of hearts, that its what you really want and need to do.     I can't believe that he would let you fly alone. Maybe there is more going on then he is really telling you.     Its up to you, but I would be hurt enough to just call it quits. We now know where his heart really is.
AA11190264	hummm.. baby girl, why are you letting him back into your house? what he's saying is to get a rise out from you. to see you squirm and missable is his kick. if it's painful to listen of his childish-bragging then put a stop to it. don't allow him to come close to you or in side your house. ending a relationship is a painful experience; cut it clean; don't let it linger. it's more painful this way.|`|TsCMDYEkaa	Am so sorry to tell you this but he is f... with your mind and worst of all your feelings..he is intentionally hurting you If I was you I would get the help of a counsellor to assist you in the process of getting yourself out of this relationship that is toxic for you and spells further and untold suffering., but it is important you need help because it is not only you in this equation but your children too. if he has someone else that drives him, tell him to go to her for the bedroom and leave you in peace other ways he has to dump her and come back to you  in a fully committed way and WORK at fixing up your problems, but he Cannot have it both ways He cannot be half pregnant (sort of speak) either he is with you fully or NOT. don't let him play you.. all the best sweetheart
XN0cYCATaa	Can You Forgive Like This ?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY-C_36fl...    Do you know what Love is ?    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUNGW-KyK...|`|aLwrpMPXaa	Everybody, just back off  ! You love him, you have two children with him, your husband is reaching out....well, do the math ! Make sure at all times, you know the financial outcome of your marriage and be strong for the kids sake !|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Since he's seeking professional help, that speaks alot for it's self. I mean, if he wasn't taking that step then I would say leave him. But clearly his actions are showing that he wants to be a better man and husband for you.    With that said, I realize alot of people are going to tell you to leave him. But go with what's in your heart. You can also let your husband know that nothing stays a secret for ever. there will always be someone who knows and they will eventually start talking. So let him know that, and know that you won't give him any more chances if it happens again.|`|YjUyBWPEaa	No one can tell you what to do you have to make the decision for yourself.  However, is this something you can truly get over?  Im all for giving things another chance but 5 women?  To me that is just total lack of respect and regard for you.    If you do decide to try to work things out though I would make him seek counseling to find out why he is needing this attention from other ladies.  There has to be an unresolved issue there be it he has a sex addiction to he is only concerned with himself.  I would make him figure out why he is doing these things.  Honestly I think you should think long and hard though if you want to continue in this relationship with him cheating and cheating again.  I have a friend who stayed and she is now in her 50s and still doesnt trust her husband.  She loves him but is always living with fear he is cheating.  She confided in me that if she had to redo things she wouldnt have stayed.  However, now she feels too old to leave.  I think issues like this can fester with hurt and make you in the long run really hate your spouse.|`|Rzsudrzqaa	You should forgive him.... and then move on anyways. He's not devoted and committed. Your kids are going to lose respect for him as they get older they should have at least ONE parent with some self respect. Getting over a one time thing would be different but that many? I couldn't do it.  But.. its your life and this is only my opinion.  Best of luck.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Forget.I would seriously never be able to forgive him and I would hold grudges.The relationship wouldn't be good for either of us because I am also very vengeful.Especially if he had dipped his stick in 5 other women's pools. I would have to be happy before my kids could be happy and I just wouldn't be...I know a really sad case where a woman's husband was cheating and she ended up contracting HIV from him.It is really sad when things get that serious....    Another thing is it would always be in the back of my mind.If he were late I'd think he was cheating automatically.Trust would be thrown out the window.|`|74aZAQmMaa	Forget|`|NWH3MnE9aa	You are kidding, right? What the hell is an "emotional affair?" There was no sex but it "crossed the line" as far as you are concerned? Who he sleeps with, or doesn't sleep with is HIS business, not yours. I think we call "emotional affairs" friendships.|`|66jX06Onaa	RUN to the counselor with him - get him in there and under the scrutiny of someone who will chastise him and make him realize he needs to be good to you and his kids.     There is still a chance that you can mend your marriage, but let him know that trust is earned and that you will give him another year if you BOTH attend counseling. If he can't prove that he's loyal and faithful in a year, it'll be his fault, not yours if you divorce.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	Seek marriage counseling and go from there.|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	Going through a divorce is so hard for anybody, unless that person has no heart.  I feel for you, but you must do what you really feel is right.  If you do end up staying with him, you both should go through marriage counseling.|`|bjsOnyPkaa	If you still love him, then go get counseling however make sure that you find a good one. One who has practiced for a long time. In this case, I would pick a male as he can push this guys buttons and get some answers however don't expect miracles. Once a cheater, almost always a cheater. You have kids and a great financial situation so worth a try. Consider him to have two strikes.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Read my question on answers to see what I just went through. I forgave.http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|ugRN86bYaa	I think you want to stay so that's what you should do. I think the most important thing to me that you said was that he seems sorry and is truly seeking help. If  you get divorced, I don't care how good a dad he is, your children will suffer. Lots of people are going to write on here and tell you to leave the sob; he's  not worth it. They're right; he's not, but if you're like me, you have to give your family every chance to make it. I'm not throwing this stuff out wildly. I'm an expert. I married the same man twice. He was a cheater; sick in the head womanizing cheater, but he was a pretty good dad. The Christmas after we divorced, my children were very small maybe five and six, or six and seven. My son got a train set for Christmas and called his dad to come over and put it together. He waited all day and he never came. Until the day that I die, I will never forget the  image of that little boy sitting at the window waiting for his dad to come; and the disappointment he suffered when he didn't come. That was the day that I decided, no the day I knew, I couldn't stand for my children to go through life without him. Often,  if a husband remarries or gets with someone else, he takes on that family and yours gets thrown by the wayside. It even happens to super dads. If you're like me, you can't be happy if you're children aren't. And money? Well,  my daughter is a successful attorney right now and my son a successful businessman. Do you think I could have possibly put those children through college on a teacher's salary and a little child support?. No way. I am not a bit sorry I went back. Is it hard? Yes, ma'm the single most difficult thing you will ever do in your life. There will be times when the air will be so thick you could cut it with a knife; there will be times when you will cringe when he touches you because you will remember the skanks that he's been with. There wil me times when you will want to lash out at him, and say "How dare you do this to our family?" " How dare you disrespect the sanctity of our marriage?" "How dare you do this to me?"  I said those things a few times, but it didn't help. The only thing that helped me was my faith in God, going to church, lots of prayer and counseling. My opinion? Your children need him and I don't care what anybody says they need his money. A dad is someone who's there day to day, helping with homework, listening to prayers, going to baseball games and parent/teacher conferences. He shouldn't be the guy who shows up every other weekend to take the kids to a theme park. May God Bless you and your family. I promise to pray for you.|`|XD5WfExHaa	Of course not. But the husband should forgive and forget if his wife were cheating!    Right women?|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	Mental state?  NO WAY!   More like a cheating addiction.  He won't stop, cause you haven't done anything about it, except ask.   You keep letting him get away with it, then I suppose that's making your bed and laying in it.    If your really more into the life style he has given you, then I suppose you can cheat too and still enjoy your life style  and raise kids in a home with no real love.|`|SheAGLG5aa	I know what you are going through all to well.It can be tough to finally leave but you deserve better.Anyone who cheats,especially sexually should not get a second chance.Its sad because it is hard on the kids but he should have thought of that before this all happened.Its not your fault.Find someone new.|`|Jbifq3I5aa	you have to ask yourself if you want to stay in a relationship where it would be almost impossible to trust your husband..or to leave and have a life free from the disloyalty. i can understand that it would be hard especially with having children. but you have to ask yourself if your kids are better off living in the middle of a huge lie that you're putting on so they can be happy..or if they're better off with two parents that have their own lives and are both happy. don't put your feelings aside so you can give your kids the life you want for them. and for the love of god..don't stay in this marriage just because you don't want to give up the lifestyle you have now.|`|AA10553671	thats a tough situation and i'm sorry your going through it. that has to be a terrible feeling. what does he say? what does he want to do/ because his cheating shows he is not putting high values on your family and its worth risking the loss|`|KZlgdMeEaa	I do believe that u still love him but seeing as this was not a one time thing I would be gone... Even once is wrong and hard to forgive but 2 years of it would be way to much to forgive for anyone.|`|7Jsibcnpaa	You must decide where that line really falls......5 women?  Not only is is putting himself out there...he is also putting you out there.  I would first get myself into a doctor....STD's are sneaky too!  You'll never forget it and may never forgive him either....you'll only be able to mask it!  Being "in love" is like being on heroin...your life focuses around it and you're physically sick without it!|`|Kr09aQJkaa	Don't take this the wrong way....What kind of wife have you been over the past 7 years? Are you loving and attentive to his needs? Are you the kind of wife a husband would want to come home to?     When we become mothers we sometimes neglect our husbands. Looking pretty, being flirty, and sex get pushed to the back burner because of all the demands motherhood puts on us. Not feeling needed, wanted and sexually desired by your wife will send a man looking for porn or other women.     If he is truly sorry and seeking help I think he may be a good man who made a huge mistake. We are only human and it is possible to make mistakes and learn from them. If you decide to stay with him DO NOT bring up the affairs. Don't ask about them and treat him as though you trust him fully. A good man who feels trusted by his wife will act trustworthy. Give him what he went looking for. Be sweet, flirty, sexual, and make him feel like the most important man in your life. He will return the feelings.     A marriage can survive affairs. It is possible to repair the damage and hurt. Best of luck to you both and your boys!       If your a kid, unmarried or divorced gimme a thumbs down.|`|rUufku21aa	It seem like you accepted the facts that your husband cheated. And you are trading the lifestyle, security, and the happiness of a family unit to justify staying. If you are comfortable with it, than stay. I know there are STD to deal with, and the possibilty of loosing your husband to the other woman etc.. But if you are comfortable with it , stay.... BTW, ask your husband if you can do the same. Have an open marriage....|`|AA12262561	I believe your children will resent you for staying with your cheating husband. That's a bad example for them. Besides what are you waiting for, to catch an std that's incurable? My opinion is to leave and never look back. You have to have more respect and dignity for yourself and your children. Good luck.|`|NbU9Nk43aa	you really are kidding right?he cheated on u with 5 ladies.thats just what he told u.when kiss him your kissing those lasies LOVE BOXES WHERE HIS LIPS WERE!!!!|`|wwB3csfYaa	Alright heres what you do.  Forgive, then forget.  Take your kids, rent out a small apartment, get your own job and life.   Don't look back. If one day he changes good for him. You really need to move on. He's in a bad mental state because he hates himself, but it has nothing to do with him actually changing. Join a gym, go to chruch,(if you have a religion or are intrested in one) get outside, outdoors, get together with friends and drive to see close friends or family at least once every 2 months, make a 3 day weekend.   Your thinking you can't imagine being with anyone else, you can't imagine that you can find someone else but you will!|`|QkYRnTPIaa	So sorry for the pain you are going through.  Yes, yes, yes.  That emotional affair was definitely crossing the line because if he's pursuing a relationship hoping that it may become physical and you don't know about it then he is betraying your trust.  Obviously, he followed through and slept with numerous women.  I think you need to decide whether you can ever trust him again.  If you stay together will you always be wondering where he is, why he's late coming home from work, questioning certain callers that phone him, etc.  If he's truly remorseful and seeking counselling then this is a good first step but he is going to have to earn your trust back again and that could be for the rest of your married relationship.  I guess it all boils down to our actions versus our words.  If he's honest with you what he says and what he actually does will go hand in hand but if he tells you one thing and doesn't follow through with his actions then he is not truly wanting to change.  Being comfortable financially and staying for the kids that will see their dad model infidelity are not reasons I believe to stay commited to this man.  It's all what you're willing to put up with.|`|roGfyzcHaa	What are your kids going to do when daddy brings AIDS or HIV into the house? They will have to watch you and him both die a slow painful death. Why... because you couldn't leave that comfortable lifestyle.  Do you think your kids will still love their dad after he kills you both?|`|T9hKxmGPaa	Hmm.. If this was just one woman he cheated on you with, I could understand you wanting to stay with him and both get counseling to try to work through this tough patch. But he slept with 5 different women. It is one thing to be sorry for sleeping with one woman, but he slept with 5 other women. It is hard to see that he is truly sorry for what he has done.. When a mistake is made, you regret it, learn from it, and you strive to not make the same mistake again. But it is kinda hard to feel like he is truly sorry when he slept with 5 different people. True enough, he may be sorry for his actions, but it is a little too late to be sorry.     But as far as you go, you have to ask yourself some questions.. Do you think you can live with what he has done? Do you think you can ever trust him again? Do you feel like you can move past this?     The most important part of this situation is your children. It is understandable that your children love their father, but that is not reason enough to stay with your husband if you are really unhappy in this situation. Your children will be able to sense your unhappiness. Eventually, when your children get old enough, they will find out what happened and will resent their father for hurting their mother, but will resent you as well for keeping them in an unhappy environment.    No one on Y!A can answer this question for you. Only you know your situation and know your husband enough to know whether you can make this work or not. Besides, you are taking risks due to the fact that your husband could have very well brought STD's into the household. That is more important than being afraid to leave because you do not want to leave a comfortable lifestyle.. If you think your husband is sincere and wants to try to work it out and you are both willing to put in the effort and work to do it, then by all means, stay with him. You know where your heart and emotions are at.    But if you know in your heart that you will not ever feel the same way about him again, never be able to trust him ever again, or ever able to look at him in the same light, then it is best to divorce and move on because a marriage is NOT going to last without trust, honesty, and communication.    I, personally, would never stand for my spouse cheating on me. In my opinion, that grounds for automatic divorce because if he wanted to sleep around, then he should have never married me and stayed single. But since I am not married nor in your shoes, I cannot tell you to just up and leave him because you know more about how you feel than any of us on Y!A..    Good Luck in your choice and I hope you make your choice that is best for you and your children.|`|Dvc2BGUBaa	i understand what your going through..  the feeling where you are scared to leave him because you still love him.  And after being with him for so long your just used to having him around and you dont want to be lonley...  No matter what anyone says ultimately your the one who has to decide what you want.  Write down on paper evrything that he has done to you, just make a list..  when you read it im sure it will piss you off just thinking about all the stuff hes done on there.  when you get weak and he beggs you to stay, remember your list and ask your self if your willing to put up with that for the rest of your life.  Remeber we only have one chance to live, try and make it the happiest we can have.  Im going through somthing similar, its only been 4 days since ive left him, and im lonely and life sux... but im hoping it will get better..  despite being sad all the time, when i told him to leave, i actually felt a little relived!  I really hope this helps!   Stay Strong!
tFC13Xsgaa	yeah of course she is interested in you  go for it man  i wish you all the luck|`|P0wMTzDFaa	Yes,she does.    Try talking to your firends about it,then can help too!    Or you can tell her that you know that your friend and his sister have been talking to her about you.    Just tell her she's cute.  She'll probably get all shy and then tell you she is interested.|`|YORoyQlPaa	i think after your friends sister talked to her, she considered paying more attention to you and seeing if you are her type. and even though you leaving wasnt really a smooth move, i think you should talk to her in person when she makes eye contacts, to let her know what you think. because if you are just being shy and not as approachable, she may find it hard to talk to you.  i think she has a little bit of interest in you, and since im a girl, in my point of view, she was talking to her friens about you and thinking of whether dating you or not. and asking for her friends opinions on you. and whatever their conclusion gives, you still should give it a shot and talk to her! not just on myspace by the way.|`|vUFICF6oaa	Hard to tell I think she does!|`|niC7aoDQaa	haha well, it depends. we girls are kind of odd creatures. we go off at the weirdest things, and i know guys dont understand our reasoning behind certain things. theres a possibility that she was thinking that if her and her friends stare long enough, you would come over and talk instead of her going to you to talk. the guy is ALWAYS supposed to initiate communication in situations like this, it shows that you really are into her, which girls never know because you all have the same facial expression for EVERYTHING! lol but i think you should maybe get her number, call her text her, which would be easy since your shy. but start some small talk over the phone or in person, shes not gonna be a total b--i--t--c--h so go for it!|`|lsYRmKvZaa	Seniors dating sophomores isn't weird whatsoever.  I think she does though .. or else she wouldn't waste her time looking back at you.  She wants to make eye contact- which is really good. : )  Even if you're really shy, go up to her and talk. (you ARE a senior, after al)  1) She'll probably be excited that a senior is coming up to her .. her friends will be impressed  2) Girls love to talk to boys and such, obviously, but just get to know her, flirt with her, don't by pushy oranything.    She's younger than you, so you've gotta be the bigger (literally) person :)    hope it helps!|`|BgyN7oocaa	First of all, it isn't weird to be dating a sophomore even though you're a senior. she just seems nervous about dating someone older and is a little timid and doesn't know what to do. they might have been waiting for you to come over - the best thing you can do is to just take the initiative and start conversations/approach her. you can also check this fun site i found...    http://willshelike.me|`|sIqQF5j2aa	Well it could be a yes but also a no.  Some girls just run their mouths about things like that because they think it's cool that an older guy likes them.  Or she could really like you.  I am betting that she does like you though.|`|doMV803Iaa	GIVE HER THE ****!!!!!     No, but seriously, what are you waiting for? Go get her, if she's staring at you that means she likes you.|`|aEFTqJOtaa	Ask her out and take a chance for once! Also, it is nice that your friends are trying to put in a good word for you, but she probably thinks that you are making them do that and while it is flattering, it is better to leave your friends out of it. Tell her that your shy and dont want to move too fast but you like her and want to get to know her better. If I was her, that would work for me and I would want to give our relationship a chance. Good luck!|`|wAUuzUsTaa	im in the exact same situation as your girl and i think that you should go talk to her.  she just wants you to start the conversation cause i mean you are a senior and it is a little intimidating lol.  yeah the staring is a little wierd but you should just go talk to her next time

fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	It sounds like she is trying to edge herself away from you.  I would go and visit her and see her face to face.  Tell her you need to talk.  You can tell her you love her.  Tell her you know her since you have dated for over 2 years and lately she is not acting the same.  If you just "hung out" with another girl, would she be okay with it?  Tell her that is how you feel, like something is up.      I would want her to be honest with me, if I were you and just tell me if she didn't feel the same towards me anymore.  I would rather respect her for her honesty than be hurt by finding out that she didn't want to be with me anymore.    When someone "jokes" that they want to break up, there usually some truth in the matter.     I am sorry, but it doesn't sound like she feels the same anymore.|`|SQekGM8gaa	I nkow this seems cheesy but why dont you tell her all of this. Ask her the straight tuth. If she still loves you, she can make it work. If she doesn't then why bother trying to get her back. Maybe she just needs a bit of space or something. Your right it does sound weird, but nothing is going to change if you don't confront her.|`|wbcmHJ3waa	dont ask me|`|kUl1dCdVaa	well if she is cheating i would dump her. especially if she is lying about it. she likes someone else.. even if she is kidding about breaking up with u|`|67O85hIzaa	Darn Thats a hard one.To Tell You the truth i think that her friend that she was out of town with is just a friend because you helped her to a tough time.i think its a tough time for her.I think shes to embarresed t tell you that she has another guy as a friend but hey im only 11.

You must really care about her. Well, it's possible that she just wants to get out more with other people. She might need more attension... Um, maybe her friend has been makin moves on her and she is wondering if she still wants to be with you. Or maybe she is mad at you for something. It's obvious that she is unsure of herself when it comes to your relationship. Remind her that you are here for her. I'm sure she should already know. But it seems like she is keeping something from you. Not saying she is cheating but she is keeping something from you. I'm just not sure what by the information. But talk to her see if she still wants to be with you. remind her how much you care for her and how much you love her. Good luck! I hope everything works out for the best

KwNpyp3saa	Your parent think they are protecting you from getting hurt. They just don't realize they are doing more harm than good. They are not preparing you for life when you do go out on your own. Try to talk to them. See if you can sign up for events at your church or another activity. Another thing she could try is to become friends with other moms who are home schooling their children. Many parents I met who home school their children set up some kind of interaction with other parents and kids to let them interact with other people. Do you have a family member you could talk to about this who can intervene? I wish you well. Take care hun.|`|ScHW4842aa	I would take drastic action.   I would tell them that you are not happy with the way your life is. That you want to go to normal school and have friends.     If they resist - then I would complain that I was feeling sick and go to a doctor, and tell the doctor what is going on right infront of them. Tell the doctor that you are feeling depessed, hurt and trapped. The doctor will then tell your parents that they are doing you more harm than good.     If all that fails - I would threaten to kill myself. Emotional blackmail always brings out the best in people.|`|GHd84xipaa	you didn't give your age,so this is a hard question to answer with out more details.|`|66jX06Onaa	Sometimes parents don't realize how lonely their kids can feel. You need to sit down with one of your parents and talk to them about your feelings.     I don't think it's child abuse to homeschool unless you aren't learning enough. Many families choose to keep their kids close to home now because of dangers they see at public schools. And, not very many can afford to send their kids to a private school.    Talk to your mom or dad. Tell them how you really want to get to know people your own age. Maybe there is a homeschool group in your area your family could join - it's worth checking into.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	i don't think this qualifies as child abuse, but yes they are not being good parents, i think you should talk to them and let them know how lonely you feel tell the that you need friends and that you really wish for them to reconsider sending you to a public school. and if they don't tell them to at least let you join in some community work, tell them that will look very good in your school record. or they might let you join a swimming team or something. and offer to take more responsibilities at home.  as for the room you can also ask them for a little privacy. and give something in return so they will agree.  good luck|`|XUwtAWzkaa	Oh wow.. that's intense.. honestly I would die. I don't think that they can be considered child abusers by keeping you at home.. they either love you too much to let you go out in the world and get hurt ( overprotective ) or they are just psycho. You don't even have anywhere to runaway too either.. ahh this is crazy. I would just say throw fits and try to get into a public school.. or wait and deal with until your 18 and hit the road considering your a legal adult and they can't do anything about it.. that's what I'd do in your situation.. sorry I can't help anymore than a written response. Try and talk to them and explain that your dieing and like make it really dramatic and say you have thoughts of killing your self haha .. maybe that will get to them.|`|5kDoNq82aa	Ask your parents to join a home school group in your area. Perhaps you could ask them to take you to church they have lots of youth groups. Ask your neighbors about kids on your block. When you see them say Hi. Get a job at the mall. Lots of people there too. Then you can afford to buy your own things to put in your parents home. It may be small but it is the best they can do. Friends are important. Try to find some.
4oYAnxgiaa	Firstly I'm sorry that there are such idiots on here who have nothing better to do than make pathetic comments about something like this.    If your daughter knows you read her texts she will hit the roof and not speak to you, it will drive her away. I don't actually think that she needs to know that you know she's having sex...I think all you CAN do is to ask her to please be careful and that you are there if she ever needs anything. You could (though this will be awkward) ask if she's happy with the contraception they're using (this will determine if she is using any at all). Do you have any women around who could talk to her instead of you (if you have a partner, sister, friend, one of her friends mum?)    If she's been seeing the same guy for 2 years that's a good sign at least - it may have meant he respected her while she waited to feel ready for it and she's not just giving it away randomly like a lot of girls her age are doing.     There's no easy answer here, but to be perfectly honest she sounds like an extremely typical and normal teenage girl to me. It may have sounded outrageous, the things she was texting, but unfortunately, rightly or wrongly, that is how teens talk and act these days.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I think you should not tell her about looking through her texts, it does not prove she is sleeping around it just proves she has received these texts.  The time has obviously come when you need to have a woman to woman talk about the facts of life. If your daughter is having sex then she needs to know the implications of sleeping around and not using protection.  Kids today sleep around as its the new "can I kiss you goodnight" its not right and its not morally good for her emotional health but what can you do ?  If your daughter does not respect herself or respect what you say then all you can do is make sure she knows how to keep herself safe.  Clamping down on her social life or grounding her will only ensure that she keeps her distance from you emotionally and wont turn to you for help if she gets into any sort of trouble and I dont just mean sleeping with boys.  You may say at 15 that she is one of the sensible ones because kids today experiment with sex at a 12 and some girls get pregnant at 13.  Be friends with your daughter and let her know that you are there for her, this is a hormonal time for her and her emotions will be all over the place so be gentle with her and encourage her to be open with you.  Good luck.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I would very pointedly buy her a big box of condoms and give them to her. You're not going to stop her having sex, but you can make the point that she should be having safe sex.|`|Hzzdalavaa	You need to sort her out quicktime boss.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Noooo, never ever say you found her texts. That'll ruin you.    Say, "you've been acting differently, what's up?"    Ask questions until she admits it. She'll break down eventually, lol.    I'm 16, so I'm just doing what would sound normal for my sister. Funnily enough, similar conversations were had with her :S    Good luck, and, most importantly, don't over-react! Tread with care, if you over-react you won't be able to give her advice.|`|klcqgST9aa	Okay, well unless you lock her up, she's going to have sex if she wants to, there's nothing. She'll lie if she has to. I think the best thing to do is sit her down and talk to her. Talk about dangers, get her on the pill. Make her understand that her body is special and she shouldn't be flaunting it around, but I think if she's going to you may as well be safe.    Um, make sure it's sex and not sexting, or sexual talk, like phone sex, only via text. It's all the rage now. Also, maybe she's not doing intercourse, but oral or something. Get it straight.    Talk to a doctor, may as well, make sure she doesn't have STD's|`|Bgzq0K1Iaa	Don't tell her you know, she will then be angry that you read her texts and nothing good will come of that.    Maybe you could tell her mum or a female who is close to her to have a talk with her. Get this person to just say about how she knows that your daughter has been in a relationship for quite a while now and that she understands that she's growing up and might feel ready to have sex. Get her to try and get your daughter to tell this person that she's having sex. If the person can't get it out of her, she might be able to have a general conversation about making sure to use contraception and not feeling pressured.    There really isn't a lot you can actually do though.    If she's an A grade student in a proper relationship then you probably shouldn't be too worried.    Hope you decide what to do.|`|aCdya2qkaa	send her to the army for discipline|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Your too lenient, give her some discipline and morals.|`|hIdzQoquaa	Tell her. It'll make her feel really awkward and that's always funny.|`|RCZCeBQsaa	id be pretty pissed if my parents went thorugh my text. thats kinda messed up. id tell her it piss her off so much. get it on cam itll be funny. or put her in a straight jacket and lock her in her room.|`|WMnaQaJiaa	Most important, DON'T tell her you were reading her texts.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Not sure?    Here's an idea...    GROUND HER UNTIL SHE IS 18!! Take away her cell phone, take away her computer, take away the land line phone in her room if she has one. She takes the bus to school, she takes the bus home. She does NOT go out unless escorted by you.    Jeez. Better do something fast and heavy or she is going to turn up with any of a dozen incurable STDs or a bun in the oven.    She has shown herself to be untrustworthy to the extreme.     She's probably doing drugs as well.          Time to start being a responsible parent to an irresponsible kid who can get knock up just by looking at a photo of a guy's tally-whacker.|`|jtoxFsdYaa	Surely the first and most important question is - Is it legal for this guy to be having sex with a 15 year old girl? You don't say which country you are in, but in almost all, the age of majority is at least 16. So,if you do nothing you are condoning and even encouraging, what amounts to a serious sexual offence,|`|f5WU05Fraa	The best way to deal with it is to stay calm and approach it in the correct manner. I know she is having under age sex but the most important thing is that she is being careful and is being smart by using protection. Don't shout and scream at her that will get you know where, she needs to know that you understand and that being 15 the temptation is there and you understand. Stress that you will be there for her, and make sure you are easy to approach as she needs someone to turn to.|`|igFvprvsaa	I think you should approach your daughter about it. Honestly, its what's best, if she's going to do it, you should atleast advice her how to be safe.     It must be hard to find this out, but with teens today its reality.|`|r39x0G4Uaa	yeah you should say something.. just to make sure she is doing it safely x|`|BuQSBF8baa	I would just talk to her about it and tell her you know. I mean i cant say im a parent and i know what your going through, but im 18 and when i first lost my virginity my mother asked me if i was still a virgin, i told her yes because i didnt want her to know. but then i sit her down and talked to her about it. Its nice to be able to have someone that you can talk too. And dont be mad at her, it happens, and teens these days are having sex younger and younger, just make sure she is on the pill, because pregnancy is in the water these days, and i know your daughter wouldnt want a child at 15, shes still very young,  Just be there for her as much as you can. Talk to her as a friend about it. She might like it knowing she has a parent that cares and who is not going to get mad at her.|`|1oSWk2rlaa	DIRTYYY PARENT  [IM NOT SAYING IVE HAD SEX BEFORE] BUT  IF YOU WERE MY MOM, I WOULD BURN YOU!!!  *-10 brownie points* P:    ~but now that you know, you might as well tell her|`|10cnKUpxaa	Just think to yourself, what would Chuck Norris say? The true pure answer then becomes clear....|`|5esm3e1Baa	Issue her condoms and tell her to be careful who she has sex with.|`|ic5JUantaa	I think she'll be upset if she finds out you've invaded her privacy, so no, I don't think you should tell her you looked in her phone.     However,  you should sit down and have a serious talk with her to voice your concerns, without placing any blame, and definitely without bringing up the texts if she lies when you ask her what's going on.    Just give her your full attention, say you're worried, say you care about her, and if she ever has any questions or needs anything that she can come to you. Also, bring up birth control, STIs, etc. Do some research into a good doctor for someone her age and ask your daughter if she would like to set up an appointment to discuss having sex responsibly and safely.    Good luck!|`|53sVKcOeaa	If she's being seeing him for 2 years there is nothing wrong with what she's doing. I would say you just make sure she is using protection or atleast has some.|`|ucpMOO6Uaa	Dont listen to the people who are telling you to ground her.  Its your fault in the first place for going though her phone.   I think you should just talk to her about it. If she's an A grade student, then she probably knows how to be safe and what not to do. Also, If she is an A grade student then she must have a big enough brain on her to stand up for herself and not have sex because her friends are doing it. the most likely reason she done it because she feels ready and that she feels old enough for it.  I lost my virginity when i was 15. That was a year after me and my fiancee started dating. Now im 18 and we've been together 4 years. He was my first and I'm hoping for a long and happy relationship because we have both been speaking about monogamy. My mum and I spoke about it and now its out in the open theres no more snooping around and being sneaky about it so stop being cowardly. It also depends who those texts were off. If they were off the guy she has been seeing for two years then its ok. But if they were off someone else then You should probably talk to her and have go at her about morals and standards and that cheating is wrong..And if she is cheating on her boyfriend and she wont admit to it, then maybe you should have a word with him otherwise it may break his heart.  So all in all i think you should just go for it and be a man ans speak up about your feeling about this. And in future, dont look through her phone if you dont want any nasty surprises. Comprende.   Hope this helps  xxx|`|8Ml5DzJraa	i think as a parent u have full right to know what ur daughter gets upto and u shud confront her about it. if she asks u y u went thru her msgs tell her straight up that thats she's been stayin up late and the pushed u to do it coz if u'd asked her its highly possible she wuda denied to ur face. she's only 15 FOR GOD'S SAKE why the hell do u think there's so many teenage pregnancy goin on. she shuda had enough respect for u as a parent to talk to u about it and let u know. i fail to understand how some ppl can just say that for u as a parent its not right to go thru her msgs when its ok for a daughter of that age to go behind ur back and do things like that without discussing it with her parents first. Many ppl say it's a part of growing up well sorry to say but thats bullsh***t it's not growing up it's plain fun to them and bad influence, sex can always wait, but they're such in a hurry to do it and when they fall pregnant they cry like they've just been born and expect their parents to help them out coz they know that parents will always be there. if that was my child id break her phone right infront of her face and send her off somehwere where she wud learn to repsect not only her parents but herself too.|`|a8ced17abf52439ef9cae16ab57f4a2daa	Of course I went through my kids rooms once in a while.  It's how I got the best dirt on them.  Did I ever tell them?  Heck no!  I just had to get ingenious on how to get them to open up to me about what I found out.    What the others said about talking to her is right on.  I got on the pill at 15 and before I ever had sex.  My eldest is 20 and has been on the pill and is an avid condom user.  My 14-year old knows that its better to wait a while, but when the time comes, that she'll be taken to Planned Parenthood.    I don't practice "free love", I just practice safety and maturity.  If  they think they're old enough for sex, they have to be old enough to take precautions and since being the mom means you have to prepare them for adulthood, you get this awesome responsibility.    Good luck to you.|`|iT0Z2icCaa	well the first thing is to find out who is having the sex with her after all she is under the legal age does she know that the boy / man could go to jail especially if he is older than her , if she gets pregnant she would most likely ruin her young life and may run into lifelong difficulties with the childs father , your her mother she is your responsibility and of course you should and have the right to speak to her on those matters you could threathen to report her boyfriend to the police , meantime watch her closely and restrict her freedom within reason but do all this only after you have a good heart to heart with her . good luck .|`|e0urnErUaa	i agree with jessica|`|TKI1hcoAaa	if i did have a 15yr daughter, I would not allow it personally because the risks are too much, pregnancy will stop her acheiving in life, well at least make the process longer, I tink she should wait a while at least 18, I waited till I was 19, and Im glad, the amount of gurls in my school that gt pregnant was overwhelming and see where they are nw working at the local supermarket, and I dnt think thats where u want ur daughter to, I knw dis mite nt happen bt it cud
4uI0dF0zaa	Well if shes gay and your gay then this kind of works out. I mean there really aren't very many lesbians in high school or w/e school your in and i think she could still date you and not tell her friends and when the time comes she can come out and you guys will be a happy couple!!!!    If she doesn't come out of the closet then we have some problems. You need to talk to her and tell her that you are lesbian (if you already haven't) and tell her that you guys would make a perfect couple.Tell her you know she likes you and you like her. If she is worried about how people will think of her then maybe shes not right for you.    Well good luck.

[like if you know she plays basketball ask her if she likes sports or something and there you go, and easy conversation starter] now i know doing this is REALLY hard, but if you like her that much, you'll do anything. hope i helped!

zrk2VtPIaa	yes that is definately overboard. when she yells no negotiating, tell her: "i am not trying to negotiate, i will gladly follow your rules, but i would like to know the reason behind the rule." its not a crazy notion, even federal laws have to have reasons behind them. ask your mom to give you a chance, and if you mess up she can resume her previous rules. figure out what snooping methods she knows you know about. use one that she thinks you are oblivious to to let her know how much her mistrust hurts you. maybe leave a half hidden note (written to another friend of course) in your backpack saying that her mistrust hurts and makes you feel inadequate. also write that you will never learn how to experience things (like being responsible enough to live on your own) if she doesnt give you a chance. write that you'll never be able to trust your mother if she doesn't treat you with respect. good luck, theres nothing worse than idiot parents.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	I don't know why not either...ask her...parents have different values and rules...I was left alone from age 5..(not that thats good...thats just the way it was.)|`|CdTe8MO4aa	maybe she does trust you but she don't trust anyone outside the house  what if your home alone someone breaks in and rapes you or murders you your her little girl  think about it through her eyes would you let your little girl stay  home alone?    maybe she thinks someone is going to kidnap you  do u have a different father? maybe something is up    write a fake diary make up stories|`|uNIHqmH8aa	They may just be protective!

You grow up quick...being a teen is not that bad :)|`|PTP8ptDbaa	why do you want to be alone? that's the real question, of course they trust you if you say you are mature for your age i'll take your word for it! they might think you will do something unsupervised. take it from i am 14 about to be 15 and they don't let me do anything and yes i am too mature for my age. i think it's because of our very critical age that they won't let us do anything alone we may be mature but all of us have thoughts of what we could do if they weren't home! you should probably just drop it until you are older if your mom is as firm as you said then trust me she's not gonna budge on the rules!    good luck!!!* :)|`|66jX06Onaa	I remember leaving my 12 year old home once. I had the dryer running and was only going to be gone for 3 hours.     The dryer caught on fire and we nearly lost part of our house.  My 12 year old had good common sense and got him and the dog outside, but it really shook him up.    After that, I decided it was too much responsibility for the 'what ifs' that can happen when a kid is alone at home. When he was 14, he was allowed to stay home alone for short periods of time again as long as I could trust him (and the dryer was off!)    Trust is earned a little at a time. Your parents aren't sure if they can trust you yet. You have to be honest and open with them if you want their trust. Until then, they will keep snooping and will say things like "No Negotiating".     Remember, parents don't NEED excuses to make rules - they are the rules! They are responsible for you and want to keep you safe. Be patient, learn to talk calmly with them and don't make everything a negotiation. Calm, reliable, and reasonable actions earn trust with parents.|`|vOlGhIVTaa	it really isnt your age or anything else it is not that your parents do not trust you it is that they feel that you will not be safe. but for 4 hours at a time i do not think for a 12 year old that is too long so first stay home alone for about 30 minutes and let it gradually grow|`|hpIFZhkVaa	i hate my mom.|`|QmGptqkHaa	I totally understand your parents. You have to understand that you are ONLY 12. You're only in middle school for God's sake! Yes the world is getting more corrupted as the years roll by. They only want to protect you and prevent you from being exposed to bad things. I would wait until your in highschool at least to receive a more sociable life. But keep up the good work! One day you'll be thankful that you did! Stop asking, start respecting. The day that you can go out and be independent is when they recognize your responsibility.|`|kKD0m7qUaa	I don't know why either - but I think you should have a valued reason as to why.  When mom says No Negotiating next - I would just say mom, I don't want to negotiate this with you - I just would like a straight answer as to why.  Good or bad!  Tell your mom your open minded.  I think being almost 13 there should be some trust there, but why your mom is not opening up to you is beyond me.  She could have fears that you might let some boys over.  I think you should get an answer personally.    I let my 14 year old home alone and have since he was almost 13 also.  Girls tend to be much mature than boys anyway.  I think your mom should at least give you a chance :-)    I would try to catch her on a good day and ask if you and her can sit down and talk.  Then I would bring up this issue.    Good luck!|`|VQCsOpIbaa	If your Mom is yelling "No negotiating!" at you, you probably have been asking about it a lot. Called nagging, lol.  I expect the reason they don't want you to stay home alone for 4 hours in the evening is: 1) They are not going to be where they could quickly get back to you if there was a problem; 2) There have been problems in the neighborhood and they don't think it is safe; 3) They really prefer to spend more time with you; 4) They don't want to put you in a position where you or someone else could make a bad decision that would affect you negatively. Or...... 5) They may want you to go with them, not stay home!!!  Almost 13 is pretty young to stay alone four hours in today's world. Be thankful they care so much.|`|cIROBuszaa	Your mother loves you and you seem like a great kid.   I think she's having trouble letting go and letting you grow up.   She doesn't want you to become like one of those teens that go wild that go out and party, drink and have sex.   She's afraid that if she starts treating you like an adult, then she doesn't want the relationship between you and her to be in jepardy.     That's what I think.
TDiRmT9daa	Yes it's a deal-breaker. Not because of the family issues but because of the insecurity issues.<br>  <br>  You see, there are no family issues. It is his insecurity that is creating the issues. They weren't there before and guess what? They aren't there unless he's there. So it's not a problem with the family, is it?<br>  <br>  Insecurity will kill the most precious things in life - happiness, joy, confidence, success...relationships. It is like a germ that infects everything and everyone that it touches. The more you feed it, the more it grows - no matter what you give him, you will never be able to make him secure. It is a very, very ugly monster that is always hungry. The more you give (and give up) the more he will need and demand.<br>  <br>  When people choose to blame others and make issues rather than deal with their own insecurities it is definitely a red flag. If he was a secure man, he would have given your family a 2nd, 3rd, even 10th chance before judging. You deserve someone who makes a genuine effort to honor and respect the things and people who are important to you. Don't settle for someone who needs to make everything all about him. You will not be happy - you already aren't!<br>  <br>  EDIT/ADD: Your family isn't coming between you. They have done nothing but meet him once. He is coming between you and your family. There is a difference!|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	Yes, it is a deal-breaker. Boyfriends will come and go, but your family will always be your family, and you will need them.

Oh, and as for the text messages thing, I do not think it is weird, I do not have text messages either, if someone wants to get in touch with me they can pick up the phone and dial my number. I agree with the people above me who are saying that looking up her parents online would be considered stalking (I am married and I have not changed my last name).|`|QMbxBynZaa	sweety, ive been in her place before. and shes trying to be nice an let you down easy. just let it go, and stay friends. also, take it slow. like dont ask her out alot. wait for a long time and maybe do it. but yeah the lookig up her name is a little stalkerish so dont do that ;) lol|`|e8bf4cd0733c71e8557b69243c277c8eaa	it probably is something her parents told her but if she is a grown woman she has a mind of her own. it sounds like she stuck up and acting selfish. you can do alot better. the Bible teaches us to get married so she is wrong in what she saids.|`|YzxTweFWaa	only send one text if she don't reply to the first one she isn't gonna reply to the next 500 sorry <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Akzm5roBVZR7b030rSovlCjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225141142AANljvo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|79zgiERCaa	Man, you sound cool I feel bad for you...<br>  If this happened to me, I wouldn't hook up with her...<br>  <br>  Sorry to say but she seems like she has been brainwashed.<br>  <br>  All the power to you man.|`|uSsoTMZgaa	She seems unintrested in you but doesn't mean you should lose hope.

TthDWtPTaa	your an old maid
yW62Xm9caa	well u could get him alone and say im sorry but we kinda all know what were doing but you don't and make up some excuse like we all practiced for hours and hours and we got a gig or something we tried calling you but you didn't pick up.We already said we were going to the gig so we had to go without you sorry and then say it went really well and were going back but because it was only us there we asked if you could come but the manager said that he liked it the way it is.We are really sorry and then suggest a name of a band he could join or say he could create his own because he is soo talented (If you complement him it will sound more truthful and it might make him feel better) you may want to consult his friend before kicking him out the band and just tell him nicely or actually set-up the plan and get a gig and everything then pretend to call him but actually don't call anyone just pretend or you could tell his best friend that he just quit and wanted to make a band of his own or join another one.Change the words to make it sound more realistic.When hes gone you can get a proper gig!|`|KkKCKu06aa	Tell him straight up he's immature and if you're planning on making a career or what have you out of your band, you can't have people like him on board.<br>  <br>  there's no nice way to put it. tell him the truth!|`|tKtBX18Zaa	No offense, but this question makes you sound very immature....<br>  Anyway, the best thing you could do I guess is to talk with the guitarist and just say that his friend is hard to work with and it is affecting the rest of the band. Don't just say "I want him out b/c someone else is better!"|`|APW85P3kaa	The best thing to do is to talk to him about how you feel about his drumming. Don't go saying that he sucks and he's immature, but you know, tell him that you think he's acting a little immature and its hard to work with him. If he really was your friend, and you had a bond, he would take it seriously.|`|dpAD1KoEaa	jessica! thats so cold! first off you need to get him alone... then you just tell him this... " you know i'm always looking out for the band right? I always want whats best for it... so heres what I need you to do..." and then just tell him what he has to do to to stay and let him know that if he doesn't like your plan that he can always go start his own band...|`|SC91Uwrhaa	You can't. If you say he is immature then I'm sure he'll take it in that kind of way. Just talk to him about it. Tell him to take some lessons and learn to be mature or leave. His choice.
Z8e6viABaa	ok im a dude and i don't know how old you are but the no classes together is a great thing because 9 times out of 10 you will break up but it definitely sounds like he his in to you my advice is to talk to him a little more and just ask him out and if he said you were cute he will say yes|`|j9SP0xLcaa	Well! It could be the start of something. Don't come on strong. But flirting is one thing, most of the time boys are clueless. Just be yourself and if he doesn't like you for you, forget it. Trust me, you want a guy that likes you for you. Dont change for him. <br>  <br>  ~Tess~|`|hUXBOQETaa	jus keep talking him. he likes u|`|MGEYaehVaa	Of course he likes you!  Flirt with him!

He totally likes you!  :-D|`|goe3y4FPaa	i like u.. how about that.. betta.. have some booty..girl.. that guy.. is a weirdo.. tell him im gonna go ''Chuck Lidell'' on him when i see him.. pitty the fool..|`|uklVm81uaa	It sounds like it is going pretty well. If things keep progressing you should get his number and do the ole "Oh __ this is your number. I must have miss dialed." lol works every time. <br>  <br>  Remember guys are usually just as shy as you! They love when the girl is willing to take the first steps!|`|DKGiGbxGaa	proof read what you had wrote because know body like a dummy.

Just play it cool, take it slow.. if, and when you start dating, don't be too clingy.  Thats a mistake a lot of high school girls make.  Knowing when to give space to him (and to yourself) is key.   <br>  <br>  As for tips on getting him -- if you're too shy, make it more obvious online if you absolutely have to.  It would really be best if you could just ask him out in person though to go out for dinner/concert or something. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BCjLy9oiaa	He may be a closet homosexual.

Probably he was planning to ask you to go out with him or he was avoiding you for some reason of that he was embarassed when you're with him or maybe he was just shy. Either of those options.<br>  <br>  This happened to me 3x already.... And those options that I gave happened to me....^^|`|hY6XS42Paa	what you should do is hang out outside of school. It would probably be best to do with a group the first few times,. then hang out just the tow of you and see where it goes from there...
KPXwwwMMaa	Follow your mind. It knows better. If you must give the guy a chance again, then tell him you'll date him in 6 months if he can go that long without another girlfriend, and without making you upset. <br>  <br>  If he can make that happen, then he might truly still be interested in you. If he's not willing to spend 6 months as a single guy, working to improve himself, then he's not worth your heartache.
fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	You are married?  How is he answering your phone if you are married?  He shouldn't be doing that.<br>  <br>  How could this guy be in love with you?  You are married and you should tell your husband about this.  He may just be a bit envious of you and your husbands relationship.  It doesn't  mean he loves you.  I hope you are not even thinking about entertaining this idea.  I would stay away from him and not allow him to even hug you.

IqldoJPEaa	Nobody can answer this the correct way for you.  The answer to this question, as it always is, depends on the type of boy this is.  Some like to hear those things, others dont.  You have to get a feel for the situation and see what type of guy he is before you make your move.  This is why most people wait to say things like "oh, I like you alot" because it generally takes a little bit of time to get to know someone.  Besides, how much can you really like someone that you just met right?|`|AA10455206	It may be but keep the conversation going, keep him talking about himself and by him talking you will slowly see how he is.|`|yGwda7wPaa	I don't think it is ever too soon to be honest.

He sounds to good to be true!|`|d37c5ee31c76a82db600500139be1a25aa	yes its too early.  u should get to know each other more before telling him that  maybe when u know him enough..give it a try. :)    good luck with that girl! ?|`|YGpciehTaa	wait a little bit because  he will think you're desperate  and you'll scare him away|`|E9WFPlvVaa	noo, tell him how u feel about him, just dont get to personal and tell your probloems and wat not to him because it might scare him off =D|`|Mah1BetPaa	Look at his Myspace first... says it all... :-P
18ZACuQZaa	I would "NEVER" have relations with my boss for a promotion. Why should I sacrifice my dignity and self respect for low life that would only use me for a play thing. People like "your boss," aren't concerned about you, your feelings or your future. They're only concerned about their own selfish desires. I'm a business man, not a prostitute. Don't let pressure from your boss cause you to make a critical mistake. It's better to lose your job, than to lose your diginity and self respect.|`|ugRN86bYaa	I like Elizabeth's answer; that only works one time in a million.   I'd be afraid I'd do it and then wouldn't get the promotion. What ya' going to do tell the police? Really, I think it's a form of prostitution.|`|IdNH4Vrnaa	I wouldn't!  I feel it's akin to prostitution.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	yo are disgusting|`|Xd7bXerQaa	i think anyone who would think this and consider it would be a whore this is a reason why your not getting promoted not because your not screwing him or here|`|SrmR5iNxaa	i would why not?|`|Dh5CUjmkaa	I have, and I married him.|`|AA12107138	I wish I am your boss.|`|YjUyBWPEaa	No cause I have to much respect for my body and myself for that.  Honestly whats the difference between that and standing on the street corner?  Its both effecting how much cash is in your pocket!|`|pnxzK1nhaa	If i were not married than I would def do it.    If I were married than I wouldn't.    I am more for myself than other ppl when I am single.I am also a very wreckless and spontaneous person when single too. I hardly think of consequences.My bf is what keeps me stable.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Ewww no    Harriet|`|COmp4sIuaa	I'd get with a hot female boss, hell yeah!|`|aXYiOskmaa	not a chance.|`|KILFoc6kaa	Im very happily a housewife, so I guess I do, but I don't get promotions.|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	Never, and if there were an innuendo or attempt to try that on me I'd sue the company.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Outstanding question. Been there, done that.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	A lot more than would be willing to admit on Y!A.|`|Dud46s2Daa	Yuck, no, one of my bosses is a complete pervert anyway and makes nasty comments to see how people react.  I'm not that desperate for money and would never be.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	If I was a cheap f*ck, then yes I would merit my success by sleeping with my boss.    But as a child, there was some very strong morals and work ethics instilled in us. And my parents told us that hard work would get us where we needed and wanted to be. That success never happened by opening my legs for anyone.    You couldn't pay me enough to sleep with my boss for a promotion.|`|0HUHHzIQaa	Not me!!!  THen again... My father is the boss's boss, so technically... I don't need to have relations with my boss to get a promotion:P hahaha.
zxdgYPBSaa	I think he got bad grades in school, so you should learn from this and get goods grades, a good college education, and then a good job so you don't do this to your kids.|`|ZT2ZVSPoaa	All three he's mean tell some1|`|2binExjTaa	next time you get money from some source other than your parents, keep it in a safe place and dont tell them! or if you do earn up to 200 next time from your parents, and he asks for some for taxes, say you spent it all
eXj6Ro5Raa	It means he smiled at you.|`|nQZEJz5yaa	it probably doesnt mean anything. i smile at everyone! also i guess if he didnt smile and just looked away, that would be kinda rude. well not "rude" but yeah u know... i think he just wanted to be nice, or maybe instead of saying hello he smiled|`|K80lNAnmaa	nothing... I smile to random people just to be friendly.|`|FHRJcBqKaa	Probably nothing.  You caught his eye.  That's all.|`|3iNobwVraa	What does a smile mean???      Hold on, let me get my super-secret-decoder ring out and crack this one for ya.  Hang on, *rifling through purse*, OH NO.  I can't find it!  I think my sworn enemy may have gotten her hands on it and now SHE will know what all my smiles mean.  ZOOT!      Sorry, you're on your own...this is a disaster!
ZeFyWGOCaa	You don't need a theme or a color scheme. Your bridesmaids can wear what they like, that's the way weddings were done before the era of mass-marketing. It's all fine if your wedding is not about copying the WalMart trends, but I suggest losing the vests. No vests if your wedding is going to be about real people in real clothes.|`|sMUiGFPraa	A color scheme will help keep things coordinated. Just pick your colors and tell the brides made to mix and match to those colors. What type of bouquet are you having start from there. They can still pick what they want without clashing at the the alter.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	You can absolutely have your bridesmaids wear whatever they want. They don't have to wear the same style or colour or even colours in the same family. People mismatch at proms and everyone looks lovely.    Keep in mind, though, that picking a bouquet colour that suits the various dress colours will be tricky.  If you chose different bouquets for each woman, that would work.|`|5dRvtaGgaa	Don't get it.  What's you're question?|`|ycNt74yyaa	Not sure what your'e asking but that kitty is oh so cute.|`|HOK5C8n4aa	It's really just to make sure that everyone looks good together.  But it's your wedding and there are lots of colors that look together.  You can do whatever you want.  If you want to let them wear whatever they want, you can.    If you want to give a list of colors they can wear, you could do that.  Or just colors you wouldn't want them to wear.  Really, it's up to you.  It's your wedding and you should do what makes you happy!|`|gK0vcdnDaa	Technically you don't have to have a color scheme.      Color coordination is generally a means to have the ceremony and reception blend seamlessly together as well as had the bridal party stand out.  Plus then planning the tables/favors and decorations goes a little easier since you have a set group of colors to choose from.  If you don't want them all to match they don't have to, but you should at least attempt to not have them all clashing.    I know that I'm dressing my family/bridal party because I don't trust them to dress themselves, I say that in a very jokingly serious way.      I have chosen a few colors and am making them public so people know what is going on.  If people want to match then great, if they want to be neutral then thats good too.    Entirely up to you!    Good Luck!  -Elle|`|Y08YLysXaa	You can have whatever you want. I am having red flowers, groom is having red vest, 1 bridesmaid is wearing red dress and te best man is wearing a red tie... so we'll match lol. But my mum is wearing light BLUE! and my dad is wearing something random too. I don't think it really matters. I just matched my bridesmaid and best man.|`|884v4VhGaa	It makes the bridesmaids happy. I was told to pick a dress for them to wear. I think that they don't want to show up in a colour you'd hate, so they'd rather you request it. If your bridesmaids are willing to pick their own outfits, take them up on the offer and don't give them a chance to change their minds!    ETA: I hadn't considered that they might also be worried about clashing with each other. Some women get really worked up about that sort of thing. (I don't get it either. I think it's the same sort of idiocy that says you can't wear a dress more than once).|`|UUQXNhMtaa	You don't, you can just let everyone do their own thing, and have an eclectic mishmash if that is what you want. Should really be quite unique and colorful. Each groomsman could wear a vest that coordinates with a different maids dress reguardless of the color she happened to choose. Some of the flowers pink, some blue, some yellow, some red.   Not as bad if you at least say all pastels for the maids but can be a mess otherwise. You never know who will choose the red in the middle of the pastels or the pink in the middle of the primary colors. You do have to set some rules of style, and length of dress. Say all long or all street length. It helps too to give some hint of style as in all strapless or all short sleeves or all long sleeved.   Think pictures, some dresses long, others short or mini, some pastel some deep colors, all different color flowers etc. could look skitzo. That is why you want to set some guidelines.|`|2D6rM8Z0aa	Because some colors just plain don't go together. A coordinated look is much more appealing.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	You don't HAVE to, obviously. Choose to plan the wedding the way the two of you want.|`|AA10378447	Don't do it if you don't want. Have a Rainbow Brite wedding.|`|PBdPD748aa	a colour scheme is put into place in most weddings to ensure the colours you have (dresses, centrepieces, flowers) dont horribly clash and look terrible! There's nothing wrong with that... unless you couldnt care what your wedding looks like....    Edit: weddings vary a lot when it comes to colour schemes, some are very strict in the colours coordinating, some are flexible but most just stay in a boundary so their wedding doesnt look like a circus!
rVPT2tx1aa	a guy has probably hurt her in the past. ask her about it. just explain to her through your own experiences.|`|avj8rGA1aa	Shes probably a lesbian.... theres no hope for her.
pSpWOsiQaa	dude quit being a ***|`|QkKXX6igaa	smile at them, laugh at what they say, make them feel special, poke them?  do something to get their attention, but please just choose someone you really like, girls hate guys who flirt just to flirt, like those girls who hang around you all smiley and giggly but they are taken and just doing it to mess with your mind.|`|nwXQqowKaa	If you have really high standards then there should be no room for you to be shy to talk to girls. Thats a little backwards. If you want attension get attension. Get into their conversations ask about school. See what they are intrested in. Just slowly get yourself involved in thier lives.|`|iGnUYe9Haa	It may sound kinda dumb, but just say hi occasionally.  Then start to talk to them a bit more and see where that goes.
Mdv5lv8haa	yea she probabaly dose....if she knows you remarried that most likely did it....no woman want somone whos no one wants....so believe it or not she probably startin wantin you again when you re married and now that your single its her turn...youshould play hard to get...let her no you no shes wants you but if you ant her just dont show it as much as her....becasue she can always "want out" again...exesar exes for a reason....but you have a addvantage cuz the balls in your court....its up to you wat happeends next|`|FSKiPO1Laa	stay married with new wife.be friends with ur ex nothing more|`|1lU2B1PZaa	Shes horny. But dont take it too seriously, just have some fun.|`|Y08YLysXaa	I don't think you should be in a relationship right now, considering all the marriages and divorces. You are just in and out of marriages... and she sounds immature. Besides you're 20 years older... she will be alive long after you... that's a huge age gap|`|bf7711519184031a4029ec03ac2717bfaa	start over... as friends tho... if the love is still there then you 2 will eventually get back together|`|YjUyBWPEaa	She wants something alright!  Id play it safe til I found out what she is wanting.  Its fine to talk to her and rekindle your relationship.  Just make sure you dont jump in heart first when all she is looking for is some easy cash.|`|yGwda7wPaa	It sounds like she is interested in you.  The photos make me think she is at least interested in sleeping with you.  Why did she want out before?  I wouldn't trust that she is going to stick around for the long term.  But, if you want to have some fun with her, that is about all it appears she is interested in.|`|g2tGislaaa	Play into it but you don't want to get hurt so take your time. Besides do you really want to be divorced a 3rd time??? Make sure its for real!! Think with the right head if you know what I mean!!!|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Keep checking your email.  She wants you back.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Give her a call then, and tell her that you received her message and she can come over to pick the photos anytime she wants.  ;)|`|ugRN86bYaa	There's lots of age difference, but love knows no boundaries.|`|tOwK65PRaa	sounds like she is messing with your mind, but it wouldn't hurt to mess around again.|`|ab08ce8d0c96d3f3b3c871c338bb4351aa	if she came right out and said she doesn't want to get back together she likely doesn't.    If she's sending photos of her in a thong it sounds like she wants to get a little action and probably knows she can get some from you.
Mizlm9ndaa	I'm 27 and I'm single, too.  I've almost been married once, but it didn't work out.  I'm thinking of starting a cult. ;p|`|j5Zm7Rndaa	ok I'm only 17, but I believe you are at the mark where 50% are married and 50% are not, so you arent in bad shape. (well that is at age 25, but who cares)|`|L6327Zrtaa	I'm 31 and single (I have a 21 yr old gf).  I love being single, both in and out of a relationship.  When I see a single girl who is approaching 30, it's kinda a red light, so I proceed with caution.  I prefer to date younger women because I don't have the whole biological clock/marriage thing to deal with.|`|h8ZRUUNnaa	I know the feeling, but Im 22 and single and have a sucky love life...|`|AA11032806	That not me but I have tons of friends that age that are single. They seem to be having fun!
YbvLSyiraa	While he's sleeping..just kidding!   You could put hit him where it REALLY hurts, like by putting green hair dye in his shampoo or something along those lines.|`|dCUOdbEbaa	I would not fight with action or words. Just tell your mom. If you fight with him it is going to make the situation worse. Be a lover not a fighter. Be the mature one in this situation and tell a adult.
r6lEsstAaa	just be like i love u in a light tone, or like your so amazing, that's what i do with my friends|`|YCLqFB5Oaa	true story:  Me and my bf bob were walking around and we saw this japanese chick that i always stare at because i think she is way like way pretty.  he goes up to her and says.  My girlfriend has a lesbian crush on you. Take it as a compliment.

e633afd58fd578ab66287bf7228318fcaa	Hmm... If you are that size and "feel it is small" - then you need a reality check. That is average ;o)<br>  <br>  My wife is max 5% of yours, and that IS small.. She's doing fine, and surprise, surprise: my proudest moment (as a man) was when she said she didn't care to have them bigger.<br>  <br>  So these things work in mysterious ways. Don't try to figure it out - just enjoy ;o)<br>  <br>  "Surgery"? Suppose you mean cutting up the breasts and squeezing those round gopples in there... That for sure would have been over my dead body! That would have hurt her so much - and besides would have looked ridiculous... and would have made her feel insufficient for the rest of her life. I certainly don't believe in those glimmer ads that promise you rosy happiness.|`|fEO94qHXaa	Girl, maybe you need glasses. I'm 5'2 and I weigh 100 lbs. I'm a 34A and I love it. It's proportionate to my body. If you go any bigger, you might fall forward. I'm not against surgery at all but I'm happy with the body I was born with. I don't feel like I need to enhance anything. Also, girl's who are short and petite who have ridiculously large breasts tend to look thicker in body size. Be happy with what you have. I wouldn't mind having larger boobs but what's the point in investing money into it especially with the economic times these days. Think of it this way, if you were to have your breasts augmented, would you be able to look yourself in the mirror and still feel like the same person?|`|lJH0h3TQaa	I am personally a 34B and I LOVE it. One of my best friends in high school was a DD and she was already saggy, but she wore a push up bra.<br>  <br>  So honey be happy you don't have huge boobs. <br>  <br>  On the surgery I would say its the only way to get bigger boobs where they won't end up as saggy. But I still think its a waste of money and defies who we women are.|`|prU72N2Vaa	If u want a guys opinion on small boobs i think they are even better looking than the big ones.  The hold up so much better so much hotter.|`|oTEYvL7oaa	i feel great wearing a 34B at least i know i won't have any back problems! More than likely when you have kids they will get bigger so, i wouldn't consider surgery **my personal opinion**|`|CBa9G4j4aa	I'm a very small girl. Only a bit over 5 ft tall. I wear an almost B but still in A. I wish I had bigger boobs sometimes but then again like the girl above me said I won't have back problems and they are going to be hecka saggy when you age. I wouldn't get surgery but that's your personal opinion. If you feel you will be more confident then consider it.
392b18ae97259a7518f51868eb7ea463aa	Consider the hard part done! You and him talk before and after class, the ice is broken, it is smooth sailing from here on out. Just ask him for his number. I am serious, it is that easy. Don't beat around the bush or make it into something that its not. People have cell phones for a reason. To be connected and to talk. So, on Friday after your class when the two of you are about to part ways, just real casually ask him for his number OR ask him if you can give him your number.     Chances are that he also wants to get to know you more. But, proceed with caution as you are only a freshman and he is a senior. Don't want to set yourself up for another heartache.    God bless|`|HcxaErXkaa	try to find something in common and just start a convo!|`|u4CuUmwdaa	watch youre dad|`|EvvWL0PSaa	........|.....  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|ad5ycXvvaa	fIND oUT WHAT HIS INTEREST ARE. YOU KNOW FAMILY VALUES SPORTS GOALS EDUCATION FASHION. JUST EASE IN A LITTLE AT A TIME|`|lLTxgpd3aa	well during the 5 min you do talk you should ask him for his screen name/ email/ myspace/ number/ etc. that way you can talk outside of class....or pass notes in class lol|`|Q3bk7fzUaa	just ask him to come out for a night out thats happening in your freshman year, then get chatting.|`|dcavQKc6aa	See if you have lunches or study halls together.  Try to meet him then if you can and just say "I was bored and had nothing else to do."  If you and some friends are going out one night, invite him and see if you can get his number "just to let him know what time and stuff."  From there it should start to get easier.    Hope it works out! =]|`|dpQqBGVCaa	when you guys are haveing your little five minute coversations just casually say " i gotta go but we can finish this conversation over text..whats your number?" and then you can text him sometimes. but dont text him to much or he will think you are annoying..ALSO if you have off campus lunch ask him if he wants to go! hope i helped|`|Zvv9yc4taa	Hand written notes are a miracle-worker!  make it simple though, so that if someone esle gets a hold of it all of your guts arent spilled onto that note.    Write something like, "hey, couldnt help to notice your shirt-it looks really nice on you!"  then ask for help in that class and if you could possibly meet later for food and studying    or ask something simple in the note, like what TV shows does he watch!    It'll start SOMETHING! and works for the shy even (me!)  lol  good luck|`|xmK56dIXaa	Well, I know where you're coming from, I've had that problem too. If you guys get any homework in that class, bingo, that's the key right there (as in working with him after school or something). But, if you guys can text or something too, I think you guys may be able to become really close. If you just come off and so it sort of easily, but still are able to interact, it won't be long before he's the one who starts calling you and wanting to hang out, you know? But yeah, best of luck with that, I hope it works out.      Oh wait, no homework...? Well... idk, but still, just maybe try to hang out if you can with him.|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	try to get his phone number nad text...its easier to talk that way and the fact that u have his number/he has yours makes you automatically more like freinds.     you can be like, can i text u abot the homework|`|cd37yLuZaa	umm...open your mouth when you see him and form the words to say "hi"|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	just be yourself, guys like that..  start a conversation and keep it going.|`|YSx70imwaa	Myself I wanted to go a little fast, and I made him sad, I sad that he did not talk much.

Gg98y12laa	HOT IS JUST A SEXUAL TERM YOU SHOULD RATHER BE CALLED CUTE AND BEAUTIFUL THAN HOT|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Do you realise that by overanalysing small things like this it will eventually drive you insane and you will become a cat lady.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	yep, and btw, he's really confused.|`|FWsv3Schaa	no, it just means he looks at you differently. its not about wanting sex from these "hot" girls. i prefer when my guy calls me cutie or beautiful instead of hot, its just not as meaning full haha|`|7quYBN4gaa	yes. hot is being refered more sexually. cute and beautiful is on a more personal i like you basis.|`|MDtBuOaMaa	he respects you and its awkward to say that to your "friend" so ya he does that cuz he wants to stay together with you|`|iFOBRO79aa	It's a guy thing saying a random girl is "hot" is just a typical thing.  When he says your cute/beautiful he means it that he has a lot more respect for you but yes he does think you are"hot".|`|KuNEDHFzaa	I would honestly rather be called beautiful than hot, any day. I definitely think it's a sign that he respects you. But i wouldn't exactly say he wasn't interested in sex when it comes to the two of you. Keep talking to him. I'd bet he likes you ;)|`|tkb78LQVaa	hot and sexy are more visual/derogatory when a guy is talking about someone. he likes to look at them and would definitely "hit it" but wouldnt wanna be in a relationship.    beautiful/cutie means he looks at you alot more diferently- he actually cares about you.  he doesnt just wanna do you he also wants to be in a relationship.
qWIha03Iaa	I think he's embarrassed about what he did. And I know you probably have the erg to call him and try to make things right again, but I think you should let him come to you. When he's ready and willing to talk again he will get a hold of you. Just try to give him his space for a little while at least.|`|wFWytGlxaa	Well than you shouldn't be calling him.    Any guy who makes you feel uncomfortable, and than turns around and ignores you!?    Ugh... I DON'T THINK SO!    Grow a set, and move the hell on.    He's 19.    Your 16.    What he wanted was sex.    And that's what he didn't get.    Good Luck|`|sEZXNychaa	i think you should|`|YCLqFB5Oaa	he's on his period.|`|clipc9yJaa	He is probly is avoiding you. You are deff not mature enough to date if u listen to ur friends. the age diff is too much especially since u are in high school and he is in college. I would jus let it alone and move on.|`|C46DNX11aa	Just because you are blind, your friends aren't.He got what he wanted from you and now he has moved on. If you call him, he will only come over for a booty call and after that you will not hear from him again. Unless you only want him to think of you as an easy lay, you will leave him alone.|`|bAvWkOdUaa	he's a fag.  seriously, let him go and if he wants you then he will try to talk to you  dont waste your time youll get too attached|`|ARkypV19aa	don't bother plenty of fish in the sea|`|XUwtAWzkaa	No.. hes obviously using you, all of the signs are there woman, open your eyes!!!!|`|0QX6U31Zaa	dont call him cuz it seems like he only wanted you to make out with and dont act so desperate cuz that scares guys away n hes not worth it if he forced you to do something you didnt want to do so forget about him and move on|`|CMPerTsOaa	I have had a similar problem.. from the way he is treating you, your friends may be right about him using you. He is only talking to you when he wants something, and its hooking up. He is probably coming to you when nobody else will give him any.     When guys want something, they will say/do anything to get in your pants. Main line.    And when some guys are in collage, they tend to do a lot of messing around.  In all honesty, you should let it go, find someone who is more mature,   and wont  disappear, and then come back out of the blue.|`|9ttS7helaa	its deff not worth talking to him, i dont know if im right but it seems as if you care more than he does, if theres anything bothering him he would let you know, if not hes just not intrested anymore. it was rude that he didnt talk to you after the time he made you touch his d**** and it kind of shows that he doesnt care what you think of him. i think you should just forget about him before you get attached and then get hurt. good luck ;)
GITeQCsdaa	Just find a nice time to go up to her and start a conversation like, "I notice sometimes you're looking in my direction..."    And ask how she is and what her name is... stuff like that. Small talk.  Maybe offer to be her study partner or something. Good luck. :)|`|P1oLYKzGaa	send her a note or meet up with her after class and just say "hi".  Or if you follow her out to the parking lot and you find out which car is hers, you could leave her a note on the windshield or slide it through the window!  Maybe you could drop her a note in her purse if she has it open as you walk behind her.  Next time she looks at you, wave.|`|G0O1M5XZaa	When she is looking at you look at her and wave her over or slip her a note somehow. Go up to her in the hal way and say hi I caught you looking at me but its cool because I wanted to talk to you. That gives you an excuse for you to go up to her. Good luck.|`|7quYBN4gaa	eye contact is always a good thing. does she smile when she sees you? either before class or after class walk up to her and ask her if she'd like to get a cup of coffee or hot cocoa. if she says yes; shes interested. if she comes up with a flat out no; then she's not.   good luck!|`|NZLh6epWaa	Start casual and just sort of talk to her about the class and if you guys both know something else then talk about that then maybe you could start to ask her different questions about herself... then try to go from there im sure seems how your in college you know the rest!  good luck :)|`|nURj5ERqaa	ask her if she wants to go to a cafe with you, you're in college, it's called MATURITY :)|`|oELUYx4laa	Yes, I do that to the guy I like all the time.

Ask her general generic questions, like what classes she's taking, what extra-curricular activities she's doing, etc. tell her about your classes, activities, etc. and if she's friendly and feeling you back, suggest you and her hang out or get a coffee sometime. The worst she can say is "no", which can suck, but trust me, it's not a big deal.|`|79EQ3qrdaa	I think that you should pursue the girl and show her that you are a gentleman and see if she is interested in you. Be her friend first then make that connection with her like study dates and what not. Good Luck!!|`|yGwda7wPaa	I think a good way to get to know her would be to ask her questions about the class.  Perhaps she would like to get together for a study date?  Good luck!|`|COmp4sIuaa	Approach the f out of her and ask her if she wants your children.|`|AA10741561	Looks like she is.  Find a way of talking to her and that might break the ice.|`|C156l7vWaa	if she's staring at you, then she probably likes you, go talk to her or partner up with her one time during class so you can talk:) good luck:)|`|ySvWezDdaa	just find an excuse to talk to her, ask her about the class, or borrow school supplies, ask for the time, whatever.  if you notice something about her, comment on it to start a conversation from that.  or just say something about the teacher, test, etc and have this start the conversation.  good luck! :)|`|a6QK1oQFaa	ask her a question relating to ur subject like you need help or that u dont understand etc. then ask abt her like how is she doing today- and eventually start talking and getting to know her more..soon enough u will say hi to her at other days...meet up with her...tell her that shes the prettiest girl etc. and then ask her out!!...it takes time just stay cool and show that ur interested as well :) good luck!
glJelAKTaa	She'll kick you out of her house.|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Yeah, otherwise if you have a friend over they might accidently spill it out! ~I LOVE DEREK|`|8IhNkHZ9aa	yes|`|yorfmfiBaa	yes|`|qLJnCj0Naa	Yes just be honest!   :-)|`|COmp4sIuaa	........|.....  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|n8nGuu70aa	ya|`|o8LJqzZyaa	yes remember that's your best honest friend|`|oMTsDcNBaa	Yes. Be honest. Parents don't like it when you keep things like that a secret.|`|clipc9yJaa	How old are u? yes u should|`|YCLqFB5Oaa	She prolly already knows. she just doesn't want to tell you.  OOOooooOOooo.  i think she knows every little secret you have ^_^|`|4drQ38qZaa	Yes. Before she finds out and loses trust in you.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	you really need to tell her.  if you continue to lie and your mom finds out, your mom will not trust you later in life.  if your mom doesn't approve, ask your mom if you can take your bf home to meet her.  if you act like an adult about this, your mom will make an adult decision|`|3mQPQen5aa	Yeah|`|4f752e2d3f5f42ca67188c6c79a7a283aa	yes tell your mom parents dont like sneaky kids trust me!! i have done the samething and got caught being sneaky!|`|ZT2ZVSPoaa	I wouldnt i like risks|`|8HwwNUFxaa	depends on the kind of mom you have,and how old are you.id suggeste if she asks you,the just say like"i like someone..." you know?|`|CAtgXDSTaa	ha! i just wait till my parents figure out. or somehitng like that. i never tell them.lol. :)|`|qWlLjdJgaa	nah then she'll nag u all the time, y bother?|`|6mgSzMkAaa	no they will flip and ask what she is like and pretend to be on your side but really they dont want their baby boys getting into "trouble".|`|HSVXaQPQaa	Absolutely.|`|0zW3gWfEaa	It depends on the situation. Who are you dating? Would he be appropriate to your mom? How old are you?      Honestly, honesty is the key, but it honestly depends on the circumstances.    Next time, for better results, please give more details......      so from your answer,    I would say yes, because it is a good thing to be honest in the first place.|`|l5NGSmYDaa	just casually mention it in a conversation.|`|0d9a6DQvaa	Nahh don't tell them lol play around with them a bit|`|r3JiFTSOaa	yes she is your mother  for peet sakes r u gonna not tell her u have cancer next  jeese laweese|`|PmRbUgMoaa	Well DUH!! Your going to loose you trust.|`|IbOtB3IGaa	I had the same ? too.  when my mom found out that i was dating it wasn't as bad as i thought it would. i thought she would get all mad but she was really cool and she was like why didn't u tell me sooner.  she actually wanted me to hang out with him and stuff. she even wanted to meet him, nerve racking!!!! it turned out i should have told my mom i was dating sooner. so yeah u should tell her!!|`|msr6s66gaa	i think you should. if you are honest she probably wouldnt have a problem with that. if she finds out through someone else.. she will probably be very mad. plus then theres no worries of having to sneak out and make up excuses when you are out with them|`|d7T2XrXvaa	one of my regrets is keeping my mom out of my love life. when i first started dating i didnt tell her and when she found out, she got sad and felt left out. i felt terrible.. now, i talk to her about my boyfriend and i love having someone mature to talk to. dont hide it from her, i'm sure she'll appreciate you trust her enough to keep her involved. its great having an adult to talk to when youre young.|`|ycIMOWqDaa	if your mom is one of those interrogating mothers, like mine and every asian guy's mom (not being racist, just all my friends that are asian have pessimistic mothers), than slowly day by day bring it up to her that there is this guy you like.  If she opens up and says that she likes him, say that you want him to meet you so that the awkwardness can go away and she can personally get to know this mystery man.
MOsTFLqMaa	have it when your comfortable with the person u want to kiss, and if it's your first kiss keep it simple just a sweet gentle kiss  good luck|`|omqS0q5Naa	When you feel comfortable and it feels special.Just a simple kiss don't go all crazy.The first you will always remember so make sure it's perfect one.
rXORvIstaa	It depends on the level of dissatisfaction.  If you are miserable, don't stay.  If you like the person as a person, have a normal sex life, don't fight much, have children and a nice house, its hard to leave a situation like that for a much lower standard of living, and the emotional heartache of breaking up.  Even if there is a lack of love, you will miss that person, especially if life was decent as I mentioned above.  It's tough out there to find someone really nice, because those people don't stay available for too long (usually) because they are usually looking for someone nice to.  But, with the Internet, it might be so much easier to find a compatible partner than back when I was dating.    It can be hard at times, even in good circumstances to be married to someone your are not in love with.  If they know you're not in love, I doubt you will be with them long.  If you don't want to be with them, why are you?  Sometimes, you might not love someone to the level you'd like, but there are feelings there none the less, but if you don't want to be with someone, that is your choice.  Good luck.|`|yGwda7wPaa	It is very difficult, but it depends on the circumstances.  If the person is abusive, I would say get out immediately.  If they are kind and good to you, then it is not so difficult.  If you have children, it is even harder both ways.  It is hard to be alone as well.  I say give it time and really think about why you don't want to be with them.  If it is something you can resolve, try as hard as you can.  If it is abuse, then get out.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	why stay with them then. it's even harder to stay in a marriage with kids when you don't love each other anymore. The kids may be hurt at the time, but they adapt well. It's harder to have the kids watch their parents not be love, I personally think it's harder on the kids to stay in a love less marriage than to split and remain friends.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Not hard...as long as the on-going monetary reward (in any form or shape) is inversely proportional to the level of dissatisfaction about the marriage.    That's why lots of people tolerate unhappy marriage and/or cheating spouses as long as they can continue to indulge themselves with material decadence while in the marriage.|`|ugRN86bYaa	Depends on several factors: how he treated me, how nice my house was, how much money he had, and how my life would be without him. Money isn't everything, but it sure is nice to have. Money's not worth any kind of abuse or perverted activity. But, if he's a normal guy, go for it. Sometimes I think women go for exciting guys and are miserable when the lie, drink, cheat and verbally or physically abuse them. I read once if you want a calm, normal life, marry a calm normal guy. If he's calm and normal, I'd go for it.|`|AA11124885	Very hard, homelife is tense and miserable, kids suffer more than anyone involved.|`|bjsOnyPkaa	I am in that situation now after 2 years. I made a huge mistake and will be going into counseling for the 2nd time but now I realize that it may not do any good because I don't feel I love my wife. The acting and games that go into this become very hard. I can act for so long and then my true feelings come out.|`|VfuCXCRAaa	Life is too short not to be happy!     You should never settle, and go through the motions.  If kids are involved they will see you aren't happy, so move on but if you have childern keep them your main concern!  Then try to find someone you actually want to be with and are in love with!|`|e5df938f156d6be3bb105ddd037ebe44aa	It is like driving on a highway, wanting to exit but not finding any exit ramps. Everyday you are living a lie. You feel as if the oscar should go to you for best actor. You do get along most days, if only to keep the peace. You're true feelings do come out and then the guilt hits you like a ton of bricks. Guilt for not loving them or not wanting to be with them. You crave love and intimacy. Real love, real intimacy. Not the fake ones you have now. You wonder what real happiness is like. You begin to doubt yourself. Ok, so it's not that hard, lol. It just sucks!
2f37c4a51d965f4120f1f09e594cddb5aa	Step cousin.  But if he's a nice guy, you may just want to refer to him as a cousin.  It will make him feel more like a part of your family.  And if he's a dweeb, you can always call him "my cousin's stepbrother".     Hope this clears things up!
HypqcnJaaa	It's your birthday money!! Of course you can buy whatever you like with it! If you were bugging your parents about it, that would be a different story. :)|`|AhO0Uoppaa	no one cares|`|AA11263103	no, you wil spoiled if you parents get you all of this stuff.and you want more|`|flYO5vg2aa	no.|`|OMcIR0gYaa	you got money for your birthday... spend it the way you want if perfectly fine to spoil yourself  once in a while ^_^|`|WYo59zLOaa	Omg! what are your 12? spoiled for what?|`|WV36m31Zaa	yes|`|rQH2J6euaa	i had a phone like that, it was a pink chocolate.  it was really convienient to have the music on my phone and the headphones, it never leaves my side, but it did kick a big chunk out of the battery...|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	your money, your toy.      its spoiled when its your folks money.|`|392b18ae97259a7518f51868eb7ea463aa	No, I don't think that it is spoiled of you at all. Especially if you are using your own money from your birthday. If anything, it sounds like a wise decision. Besides, chances are that you will use your MP3 player a lot, even after your field trip. Just do a little research online and read reviews to see what MP3 player would be the best for you.    Hope this helped and if you do go ahead and get it, enjoy!|`|edbeaf74946e31ae50c17ddd80060083aa	I don't think it's spoiled to do that; maybe you should donate the old one if your concerned.  Maybe the Boys and Girls club or something.|`|0viBGF9vaa	Its your money it doesnt make you spoiled, but i would save up for something you really want if you already have an MP3 as long as it songs on it. Besides talking to your friends on that long of a field trip...the conversation never ends|`|wCJdbMakaa	no- its actually very considerate of you to put this question up. A spoiled person wouldn't even care (probably have their parents buy it for them)  Birthday money is for buying what you want!! (=  (hope this helps)|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Have you explained to them that you cannot load music on to your cell phone without spending another $185? They may not understand.|`|qaz8mAKtaa	No|`|Nytn8HB8aa	I don't think it's spoiled. If the mp3 player is in such a dysfunctional state and you're offering to buy with your own money, there shouldn't be a problem.     Cell phones don't help very much on long field trips.|`|ibx6vKihaa	nooo not at all its perfectly normal & okay mp3 players are good :)|`|U6WmAb6Jaa	nope, but you memory cards are not that expensive you can buy a 4GB for 20$ and 10$ headphones|`|z2zZCJDRaa	It's not being spoiled if you buy it for yourself... and you will be being spoiled if you get all this nice stuff and then you complain to all of your friends about how awful everything is.|`|gPVon8Wiaa	No I don't think so because it is your own money and mp3 players can be used a ton.  Plus the maker of the headphones and the memory card might go out of business.  I would go for it.|`|QGMDQ017aa	Well i do not think that is spoiled because you can actually save money by purchasing an even cheaper mp3 player. You can purchase one at:    Wall-Mart   http://www.walmart.com/catalog/catalog.g...    Best Buy  http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...|`|9yFdxmHwaa	No, you are not spoiled. Not yet. But you are close, very close.    Do this from now on - Whenever you want something new, look for a replacement first from what you have. If you don't have a replacement, then you ask for the money to buy things. Convince yourself first. Then convince your parents why do you want it desperately or why the replacement is not worthy?    In this case, convince your parents about the price of mp3 player. It would save batteries of your cell phone. They could contact you if your batteries hasn't run out by listening to music, on the field trip.

WMem5AGoaa	Mentally place her in a different light, like think of her as slut or something, quit mentally putting her on a Pedestal.|`|FiCl71flaa	I think you have an issue here. Ask yourself why you will have feelings for another person if as you insist  you are so happy in your current one and want to save it. It would seem that there are some issues in your current romance that you have to deal with no matter how minor or innocuous  they may appear. Having said that , I would be remiss if I did not add that we usually  do not have control over whom we develop feelings for . What we can control to a large extent is what we do with those feelings once we recognize them. So what I will suggest to you if you truly want to remain in your present romantic relationship is to address the issues and/or problems in it and not deny them. Be honest with them and resolve them. Then to the extent that you can, cut off or reduce the amount of contact between you and the new person. Focus on repairing and/or strengthening your present romance and building it. With the passage of time and minimizing any future contact with the new person, your current feelings for her will abate and subsequently disappear.|`|oI46t9lVaa	you cant help what you feel but eventually it may go away it goes away when you are ready to let go hope that helps lol|`|5r48jn7iaa	you cant make yourself not like someone. you cant really control how you feel in your heart. but maybe you could think about bad things about this person..and only think about the bad.|`|1bHaB8xvaa	You... can't.... as far as i'm concerned.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	You can't. Just focus on your real relationship and put some distance between you and this other person. Eventually the feelings may fade, but you will probably always feel a bit of attraction to the person. Just remember that just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean that you are somehow inhuman. You will find other people attractive from time to time. Doesn't mean that you have to act on it or let it mess up your current relationship.|`|ZGbwp9E0aa	If you find out; let me know =)|`|UY89MaBSaa	u neva stop having feelings for people u can only repress them so that they r at the back of ur mind sum people can do this beta then others but its just mind over matter    i noe because i have liked sum1 since year 5 (thats 5 years now) and now i hav a boyfriend i hardly think about him anymore

It appears that a scoop train is fuller and wider base, where as the chapel is looser and longer. I hope I'm describing this right. Just check the visual above and it shows a good group of examples.
7RUqEJzLaa	To me, it's actually moving your lips and using tongue(If you want.) Although personally, I don't think making out has a time limit to define it.

pzLDXL6gaa	Where are the stats that it's mostly white women?    Oh well, I suppose I can believe it, but I'd like to see something.    I think false allegations are disgusting and wrong.     It's so hard to prove things though.    I suspect there are far fewer false allegations than rapes which are never reported.    Harriet|`|AA10025824	Is there a statistic like that?   Or do more white women get raped in general?|`|X40Ww89qaa	2% of reported rapes are false claims|`|vj2pWs9Maa	I'm white, and I'm not going to take offense to your generalisation - we're all guilty of doing it at some point!    To answer your question, I think people who make false claims about rape - regardless of race - are DISGUSTING and despicable people.  They are so warped that they don't realise they are ruining someone elses life with false accusations.|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	Yes, let's pick on race, that DEFINITELY has something to do with it.   Yawn.|`|HcxaErXkaa	i think making false claims is awful! the cops investigate the crime which is a waste of time when they could actually be investigating a real crime!|`|PtUJNBFRaa	I think it is wrong and just inconsiderate. They should not do it, and need to relize it's wrong! I disgust it.|`|SgKFNuHAaa	women who make false accusations just want to get attention...because they don't know what else to do to get someone to notice them..|`|2QS8j9aOaa	The reason's people can make false claims would be they are embarressed they gave in and later face the consequences of either being pregnant and think that they will be in trouble so they are desparate for not being in trouble, so they say it was rape. Too bad, for the person getting in trouble that did'nt rape that person. But on the other side is the true rapist that get away with that vulgur crime of rape.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	I feel any "person" no matter what color or race, if wrongly accused of rape, should have to spend time behind bars themselves!!    I have and have had friends of color, different races  and male and female.  I'm pretty sure the lieing part doesn't have to do with their color, it has to do with each of their personalities.   If I may be so bold, a very dear friend, or I thought for many years, was colored. She was the biggest liar I've ever know!  ( in my female friends).  So, I really don't feel it's the color, but  the person.|`|JvCzgVnGaa	they want attention no matter the race|`|IdNH4Vrnaa	I don't understand why this is in marriage and divorce, however any woman who reports a rape when they have not been raped is an enemy to women everywhere.  NOT because it gives other women a bad reputation, but because the real victims have a harder time getting justice.    Let's not forget that if men could just control themselves, no woman would ever get raped.  I'm sure some women rape too but the overwhelming majority of rapes in today's media are perpetrated by men.    On the race issue, I'm white and have recently made a profound realization.  An epiphany if you will.  While watching Southpark of all things.  People are people.  Do people with paler skin sit on the loo any different?  We are all just people and only identical twins can ever look identical, so we all look different.    I don't like people either.  But I respect them as their own entity and give them the right to their own views.    Take care.
f4SYAgJeaa	dude, ive experienced the same thing, the thing to do is to keep acting like your her good friend, talk to her and stuff, and all those friendly things that you do, actually, keep BEING her good friend and wait out her relationship with support for her actions and decisions and then assess y u like her, and you rele dont need to STOP liking her so long as you dont do anything crazy based on mixed feelings because there is no need to stop affection for a human being<br>  <br>  however, if u want to, that is stop liking her, then you have to be a little cruel on the inside, dont say anything mean, cuz u still wanna be friends, but on the inside u need to focus on her flaws, amplify and exaggerate them until you feel a bit of disgust towards her, you may be able to convince yourself that you do not like her anymore but this is dangerous as it may cause you to stop liking her as a person altogether<br>  <br>  its up to you, your choice as its your life and your affection, the only thing you should act upon is the answer to this question "What do I want?" its not selfish, its natural|`|x5mDmNlOaa	IMPOSSIBLE............<br>  once you realize that at your age you are not old enough for mature relationships then you will realize what friendship is|`|X1V5Unaaaa	i think telling her is an option. you should just tell her, and not hold back any feelings, so then everything is there and she'll either be with you OR let you go as boyfriend material so then it can put your feelings at ease and itll be easier to move on.|`|PgGK3gy5aa	would like help on my question too (<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoThdr46v9k_32vYdzLTOonsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225143914AAopRvb)">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> its quite similiar<br>  <br>  i am trying to just stay friends with my girl until their relationships possibly ends, as horrible as it sounds<br>  but its hard work! good luck|`|rs4lvlwKaa	You could try to see her as just a friend instead of the object of your fancy. You could just try to c her in a different light and maybe while ur at it look at other girls besides her.|`|kRGLfo0haa	hhmmmm that cant be done sorry, just tell her dude.|`|n0mktOIJaa	Well you can't really control how you feel unless theres a reason why you shouldn't like her<br>  Did you guys go out before?<br>  I need details
7f8EVUn5aa	no it's not just like the movie.  he might be into you, i have no idea.    he's being an insecure guy.  they have more insecurities than us women, you know.  He doesn't wanna seem desperate because he doesn't want to be rejected by you.    now that you know that, don't you think it's kinda endearing in a way?  nearly all guys do this.|`|uVkMdIJNaa	he proble doesn't know what to say to you|`|E9WFPlvVaa	well he doesnt want to make himself seem eager nd reply 2 secs after u sent it. or he just has more important things to do , work, xercise, watch tv, eat lol guy things =D|`|niC7aoDQaa	ugh, i hate when guys do this. he could be doing it purposly or technology would be slow. wait a few dates to see if he's really interested or if hes looking for another booty call. take things slow, which you should always do cause you dont wanna get your heart broken|`|FibIwPLzaa	he may be busy at work or something? or he likes you alot he just doesnt want to seem to desperate and clingy ..    i have the same problem with my boy  but who knows they all crazyy lol|`|H5jkHN29aa	dont worry.. if he didnt like you he wouldnt go out with you ..my bf does the same thingg ..lol|`|PwOgrFk9aa	I guess that would all depend on the type of guy he is. If he is always on his phone and he for some reason isn't texting you/ emailing you then it is a bad sign.  But if he just isn't a phone guy then just give him space.  If things are flowing then let them flow.  Don't be so anxious.  When you rush into things, that's when they fall apart.|`|wFWytGlxaa	He can take as long as he wants.    Y'all ain't in a relationship.    Just let things flow, and don't start nagging/bitching about "why are you ignoring me?"    If you wanna scare a guy off, that's just the thing you should do.    But if you don't...Well you get the picture.    Good Luck|`|YCLqFB5Oaa	He's just not that into you.  Move on.|`|AA11032806	He;s weird, doesn't look too into you, unless that's just how he is. He may also pretend that he's not too into you so he doesn't look desperate hehe   Time will tell, don't get too attached though.|`|QUan5l0Baa	well thats what my boyfriend doess;;  but he doesnt carry his phone with him..  even though we're thirteen dont mean that its all we think about..        when he does text back though he is very sweeeett.  i love him...          good luck(:|`|65FipYz7aa	maybe it takes a while 4 him 2 recieve it|`|1UKcEW93aa	He's probably trying not to seem desperate. I think he's just nervous and when you message him he wants to follow the, 'Try not to seem desperate' rule.    You should be straight up and ask him why he takes forever to reply.|`|DOSUTY74aa	maybe he is just busy|`|YGpciehTaa	dont worry he's probably just trying to play it cool  but trust me the whole "why are u ignoring me" and stuff  approach really scares guys away so be careful  but good luck :)

E9WFPlvVaa	well, some women "her" likes being over powered, and if she had orgasms then yea, she liked it. so just go along with it, if not it might be akward for the both of you. =D|`|sPGsiIksaa	i wouldn't what if she regrets it and blames you and then you end up losing a friend not to mention you might regret it|`|JkQ62zOmaa	You dont always have to **** her hard, in fact sometimes its not right to do.     **** her gently.

She needs to work out her issues, not indulge in them.|`|A99uzyeFaa	It's very fun.|`|wFWytGlxaa	Yes, it would be.    Please tell her to seek medical help immediately.    Just my 2 cents|`|YCLqFB5Oaa	that is disturbing on so many levels.  you prolly have been watching too many documentaries on cults or something..|`|AA11032806	Do it, she wants it, you do too. No reason not to do it. U live only once!|`|W88S5Xjiaa	... Not my cup of tea but if she wants it, talk about it and go ahead.

And don't be a wuss, leave a couple of red marks or even black and blues.    Seriously, the trust is already there so give her what she wants.|`|yyvcryrbaa	if it is something you both want & can handle -sure.|`|niC7aoDQaa	hmm...well sometimes girls like domination. if she wants it give it to her, but listen to her. if she says ok stop now, stop, dont, DONT keep going. just be careful, and make sure that shes 100% okay with it, because us girls can be vicious if you do something wrong, she could easily say you raped her. ..maybe you should get it in writing that she was okay with it, even though that would probably scare her off... but take it slow|`|65FipYz7aa	just do it cuz she  wants 2 see how it is when she wants it|`|nwXQqowKaa	I think that it's a little wrong from certain aspects. But i guess if she wants to take a bad experience and use it for her advantage then why not. As long as the both of you are okay with it. I wouldn't recomend doing that all the time. Just sometimes. Cause it's a little wrong idk how it is but it just seems that way.
lvelp0CGaa	LMFAO ..... I HAD to scroll down prior to answering to see just how many women dared answer this before I commented and I see 1 poor girl sighing because we dont get to answer , yet at the same time I know why you didnt ask the women because they usually always answer with yes and explain why they would do it again because women are fantasists not realists and they never understand until they're divorced truely why they made the mistake of their 1st or 2nd husband .    I'm going to answer for BOTH of my ex-husband's A. Because my 1st husband doesnt come to Y & A and B. Because even though my 2nd husband has an account on Y & A he never reads the questions he just asks questions once in a blue moon .    Ex-husband   1 = Yes he would because when he gives his heart and soul to a woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with her especially when she never complained , earned her own living while at the same time came home cleaned / cooked and raised the children while he used his money for what he wanted she payed all the bills ( he never told me the truth about what he earned he claimed $600 a week after tax I found out years later he was earning $1800 a week how clever was he and how stupid was I for trusting him ) , he cheated on his wife 5 time's through their 12 year relationship and she still stayed so why not re-do it all again knowing she'd let him get away with it time and time again and never ask questions about his where abouts or his income .    Ex-husband  2 = He was married twice and BOTH time's the girl's proposed to him at least 4 time's before he finally caved in and married them , his 1st ex wife ripped him off for over $30,000 and kidnapped his son to another state and used him as a pawn in her power game as revenge because even though she cheated on him with 3 men during their 9 year union and 1 lesbian couple she wasnt the 1 who finally ditched the relationship he did and she was having none of that .    His 2nd ex-wife = ME! - Worked through out the entire marriage while again coming home to cook / clean and raise not only her 4 older children from her 1st marriage but his 2 children ( 1 from his previous relationship prior to the 1st marriage to 1st ex wife and 1 to the 1st ex wife ) along with raising our 1 child ( yes that makes 7 children ) he also attempted to hide his earnings and pay outs but child support lets all mother's  know the income of their ex=spouse now so I am totally aware of what he earns and who he pays what to .    NO he wouldnt re-marry either of us because he doesnt believe in the whole ring and piece of paper to show anyone he wants to be with them until his next woman comes along . He loves cheating though he did to all 3 of us .|`|1e6f604cf1a39b5020cfb6fee099e6f1aa	I would never marry my wife again. After 16 months all I can do is look back at all the warning signs that I ignored because I was "in love" and chose to ignore. Even when my best friend and sister tried to take my blinders off of me. My wife and I should have never been together. And now we are separated. Divorce will follow soon.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	After 27 years together she's still so hot she's got 20 somethings hitting on her, the sex is great and so is the food. And sometimes she's fun to do things with like backpacking and such. And she's never a b-word. Compared to the women other guys are stuck with, she's a treasure. So yes, I'd probably do it all again, but I'd handle things much differently.|`|AA10025824	No, absolutely not.  But by the time I left her I was so worn out that I can't remember why I wanted her in the first place.  I didn't know how stupid I was until I was with her for a few years, she was completely self centered and self absorbed.  Any conversation was one sided so bad I don't think she even knew me.  So going back would do no good.  I don't think I'd get married at all if I could go back knowing all I know now.  (I mean I wouldn't marry anyone at all, not just her)|`|xgWf3SKxaa	yes i would get married agian because i have never been married LOL|`|V5xHaIAcaa	Yes, I am sure you will consider this a smart *** answer.  Trust me, it is dead serious.    Married 20 years.    Had I to do it over I would stick with $1,000/night hookers.  Get this straight - I would have lost a lot less money, and been  damn happier    And no, I am way past being "bitter"...just am now a realist    Don't do it|`|bjsOnyPkaa	I know one thing.

And, I would never change anything that resulted in my child.|`|GHd84xipaa	if i had a choice to remarry the same person again,no i wouldn't make that same mistake,because i know what it was like being married to them.i have been married 4 times for a total of 27 years.if this one doesn't work i will not marry again.i feel it's not to be.|`|RAGAcJV7aa	i was married 18 years with three beautiful children. as my kids grew she wanted to go to work  i had no problem with that. anyway she met a younger man and of course they started an affair. i was not having any  of that we argued she fabricted lies against me to defend her actions. im now single i love family and knowing what i know today i wouldnt marry the same person but i would marry. in this world if two people can find eachother and create a union and a family it adds a little beauty to this crtazy world.
Wl926hKnaa	why dont you just add him on facebook? chances are he'll just say 'who's this' and gives you a perfect chance to start a conversation..<br>  <br>  or,your friend,abigail could suggest to blake that you all go out somewhere!<br>  only thing, be sure not to hurt abigails feelings if she likes him aswell and you end up meeting with him<br>  <br>  (:|`|NQFV2AdZaa	You could tell Abigail that you like the guy so much and if she minds you going for it, seeing as she has Blake. <br>  <br>  Then you could ask Abigail if she could get Blake to arrange to go out as a a foursome with Tony and of course you, so that way you could all meet up and get to know one another! Good luck and i hope it works out for you!
pBajQp7laa	Well if you've been friends for a long time then I guess you should tell her that you love her too but not the same way she loves you.|`|1a370a32d49eb577cd4ab9146d28bdd0aa	aw. she seems like shes really in love with you.  im not sure if i would end it if i were you.  just tell her, you love her but you want to take a break for a little bit,  make sure you dont just kick her outta ur life completely.|`|ezI5HwRWaa	Well if you aren't sure it will work out, then you do need to end it. She is only going to get more attached. If you know you aren't the one for her, then end it. Yeah it will be hard, but she will eventually get over it. Don't let her tears convince you to get back together with her, because then you will just be miserable again and have to break up with her again.    Don't break up with her in school in front of everyone.|`|6Nk6CQe1aa	the best way to end it is not in school in the hall way for a sensitive girl like her you need to plan somewhere private and alone that you can talk + try not to end it in just one sentence really talk about it with her she'll be really sad but u gotta do wat u gotta do|`|RUtqgcpZaa	YIKES! Okay, well it will be hard to break- up with her, so try to find a guy that likes her and that she will be interested in and hook them up. OR you can try to annoy her and try to get her to break- up with you. Or find an excuse to break-up with you. Like a close friend or relative has just passed away. I realize these are bad ways to break-up and they're very cruel, however try to avoid her finding out. If she's as bad as you say, then buddy, you got a lot on your plate. By the way, why did you go out with her in the first place?
TkPFp8vqaa	I think you should give this girl that wrote you a comment the best answer..she deserves it for reading this looooooong explanation...I wish you good luck...and never question God's decisions or God's will...remember that God works in your life through mysterious ways...|`|bc13b66e27e894dd132ea06c6e15bbdcaa	sounds like you need to be more confident about yourself, and you need to just have more faith.     it might also helped if you let yourself have more fun. i know how you feel, because it's almost the same for me, except i'm a girl and i've already graduated from college. the best thing you can do is to get out, have fun, and enjoy yourself. remember that as a guy, the numbers are always in your favor. getting a girl is easy. just tell her what she wants to hear, and make her feel like she's the most important person in the world
tfTQ6Cuuaa	shes playing head games. tell her no. and its not love.|`|rqNb6FIraa	Tell her that she needs to make up her mind about whether or not she wants to be with you. It's not fiar for her to play with your emotions like that.|`|05WgItGKaa	It depends on how it makes you feel. Do you love her enough to be able to stick with her?|`|zyXgsuNRaa	she seems hot n cold to be honest.  she seems to flimsy   back and forth back and forth  if your serious about her, lay down the law,  ask her if she wants you or not [: End of story  good luck :DD|`|BgVWSApdaa	Why is it that you two can only last a week?  Figure that out.  Something is very wrong.    You can say whatever you want to say.  If you want to say no, go ahead.  But you shouldn't say yes until you figure out what went wrong.  And whatever you decide, make sure you protect your heart!|`|175eecfe93291a6be0830097e2cf9ab4aa	hmm?  well it seems she is unsure of herself and maybe is not ready to have a serious relationship with you or anyone at this time for that matter.  the question is are you ok with that? if not, then maybe you need someone who is more serious.|`|WE3OcsQOaa	she seems very unsure of what she wants,  ask her why but ask her why she wouldn't do it again.  think about it, she will prob just end it again.  so i would say no|`|Cvp2WRcsaa	Sorry hun, but I'm taking a wild guess and saying she's not really in love with you. If she really were in love with you, and you were in love with her, your relationship probably wouldn't be so on-again off-again. I would say that you shouldn't get back together. Most of the time in relationships like this when people break-up and get back together it's not because they love eachother, but they love the time they spend together. For example: The girl may love having you to go to the movies with, not really you. But maybe your situation is special. If you really like this girl, say yes. But honestly, she sounds a bit needy.  Hope everything works out|`|5Lx8fDrkaa	Babes, sounds like she's playing head games with you. A girl who says she's in love with you wouldn't do that continuously. I suggest you sit her down and have a chat to her about where you stand with her. You don't have to say yes. It's what you feel is right. Hope this helps. Good luck. x
bf45adaee7ba5b85f6205b99d9e235a1aa	who cares... live life to the fullest!!!!!! let her know!|`|hA6JDWsFaa	just talk to her and ask her out. what have you got to lose?|`|GlnBbf1Eaa	Just tell her you have nothing to lose i liked my best friend last year and i didnt say anything.  Now i regret it because he doesnt talk to me anymore.|`|16k7hM5Oaa	for one your probaly not fat your just fluffy and i kinda have the same problem|`|b0cf194d51a7889f74b6caa215c4087daa	ask her|`|bQ6LNgGbaa	Sorry, unless she seems extra interested in you during class or something, I don't think she actually likes you.|`|ENAEcBOmaa	reword this. does she even know you?|`|BGc1WOy3aa	no offense you sound like your in jr.school  but just go talk to her  and tell her you like her  but dont rush anything|`|98qz1Ebdaa	Oh, she LOVES you!  Be cool, talk to her, touch her hair, and slap her butt when you can. Girls love it, trust me! I am a dating consultant. Follow my advice, and pick me for the best answer, cuz honey, this will work.|`|rS5oHNGjaa	Ok dont worry so much. She might like you back. This is what you do. Talk to her as a FRIEND, and then grow up from friends.|`|mE0MY4nGaa	it depends. if you talk to her a lot and stuff thats good. if she looks at you a lot and smiles thats also good. if while she hangs out with the other kid, she keeps looking at you, to see if you are looking that usually means she is trying to make you jealous and dude dont worry if you are fat|`|TtVk8S4aaa	you should tell her like express your feelings!!|`|FkX0TKhtaa	act cool and unfeeling =) don't show that ur obsessed with her but yet be verrry understanding and caring. just smile and make some funny jokes. well too bad..actually lose weight, she doesnt want u to like her, so quit sticking to her|`|3P5q5Nwyaa	Dude, she's totally trying to make you jealous. You should probably do something about it before it's too late. She's hanging out with that other guy because he knows what to do with a lady like that. People most likely call him Alphabet, because he's the ALPHA male and you can BET on it. You better put your lovin' in her oven before it's too late. All of your lovin'. Good luck.|`|WMem5AGoaa	Since you're fat, ask her out go for a bite to eat, and she wouldn't care what your size is just as long as she gets her free lunch!|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Yeah just bump on to her and check out whats she has for you in her heart and accept it  wholeheartedly.
NvW6voPJaa	Hi and congratulations on your upcoming wedding!    NO, that is not too much red.  It all sounds perfect to me.    Yes, I would go with the red sashes around the white chair covers....very pretty.  You can even go with a few red roses in a vase as a centerpiece.....or something like this:    http://images.snapfish.com/33%3B56523232...    I think it all sounds nice and very pretty!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Not at all, sounds just right colour-coordinated.|`|hMavMBo4aa	I don't think that sounds like too much red at all.  It sounds like a nice balance.  I would go with white satin bows on the chair covers.  That might be too much of a red theme.|`|k6F9zkIRaa	I don't think it's to much red at all! Red is your wedding color, I'm adding my colors in as much as possible! I'm sure white will look just as good as the red on the chairs but if I were you I'd put red on the chairs to tie you wedding color in with the reception! But which ever you choose will look fine. Good Luck!|`|eb190b35bcb8aa5a4b46e86e8974f17eaa	No its not too much red at all    Congrats on your wedding!!!|`|HiSVA9p8aa	Not at all too much red.  It sounds perfect.    I'd suggest ditching the chair covers altogether.  Save your money for something that really does matter.|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	i don't think its too much red... have the red tied to chair covers and red flowers at reception... keep everything else white.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Not to me sounds fine.|`|vLVbVtDSaa	It all sounds really great!  Especially because it's a wine-red, which I think always looks really elegant and classy.  I would say yes to the red tie on the chairs too.  Having a theme (or in this case color) carried throughout the whole wedding can leave a huge impression on guests and make the day that much more memorable.  Have fun :)|`|20f48fd2f5814755e839599a99c717b3aa	I think the tie/vest that matches the wedding colors is very dated. Very 80's/90's.   A sleek black tux or suit with black tie, is far more modern and at the same time, classic. Men just look sexier in a classic black suit.     As for the chair covers...If your centerpieces are red flowers, I would go with a black satin chair tie or even alternating between the wine-red and black.     By the way...I think the wine-red sounds gorgeous, just giving my honest opinion.
TkPFp8vqaa	It sounds like a cute love story from school. It sounds even funny while you describe it. I definitely think he likes you and obviously you also like him so...good luck you two...I'm pretty sure something is gonna happen between you two very soon...|`|oAYCestzaa	he DEF likes you girl :)|`|2vYI7UYhaa	he totally loves u!|`|mOZfR8yhaa	he likes you if he tickled u to the floor it is a yes|`|40qTdKuPaa	You guys like eachother seriously! You should just talk to him and ask him if he likes you, because you like him. Talking is the best thing to do if you wanna get answers and figure things out. Hope this helps.|`|KRDwCai5aa	he likes you.   that is so adorable. :]  keep doing what you're doing, because it's obviously working.|`|hgBSYQmBaa	he sounds way into you, just keep flirting and something will happen|`|DhbnTyEraa	ya|`|pIkPHuWyaa	Oh yes, he likes you.  You are doing great in just keep flirting and playing around.  He is totally into you.|`|1593dcb1ac07c226ebcb09eead0d7fc4aa	he only wants what a girrl can give him and if u dont know what that is ur in big trouble|`|h8dHAhxCaa	Well since im the only guy so far...... Ya he's way into u.  Trust me I would no.  We like to tick yall off sometimes|`|nSdYPN8Raa	it sounds like your chances are 50/50 its hard to tell because not only does it sound like he likes you but it sounds like hes just a really good guy friend to... jsut let it be for now but if your feelings for him grow, make the decision to either make a move or let the feelings die down and remain his friend  hope this helps =)|`|amAcoXz4aa	he totally wants you    just keep being your self    something will happen soon    good luck|`|sYgaPhgeaa	in my opinion poking and tickling are major flirty signals. it sounds like 2 me that he likes  u  but he doesn't think that u like him!!! so u should get 2 know him some more and spend some more time w/him!!                         p.s. this has happened 2 me b4 and it turned out that he liked me and now we r dating!!!!!!!!!|`|uzVMSVJpaa	he definately likee yuu !! ;D  go for it[[:      goodluck(:|`|LEWHQtNTaa	Omg it sounds like you two like eachother.

Just keep flirting and see what happens... & if you flirt way too much, then he'll get the hint that you really like him .. and if he doesn't like you .. he'll back off.|`|ad2854c8911dd7ce0fd1a3926f235710aa	I thinks you guys like each other it's just up to both of you to let it happen and if it goes somewhere good luck sweetie|`|98qz1Ebdaa	Well, all the symptoms pretty much result to you liking him. I mean sweetie, I know. I've been around for awhile. He so loves you. Just keep flirting with him. One thing you should say to him is, " you are so funny!" they love it! then, when you are passing him in the hallway, smile, play with your hair,  or poke him. good luck! i hope you like my answer! = )|`|XOOpHjhiaa	Girl he DEF likes you. Take that puppy home quick! : )
L6w8YmoOaa	I know my girl likes v-cuts, lol shes perfect tho. I love her more then anything. Im soooo beyond luck and blessed to have you baby girl!!!|`|hgBSYQmBaa	sometimes it doesn't matter as long as the guy is in decent shape and takes care of himself!  some women don't even like muscles.  I guess however, to answer you question, a 6-pack is better.|`|ucbrBXK2aa	i like both.|`|AA11032806	Both sooo sexy|`|J7ByVZ3Aaa	Rather have a six pack.|`|0ZGcpe60aa	i'm probably one of the only girls you'll find on here who hates six packs.    ...  okay i don't hate them but whats the deal?|`|HcxaErXkaa	a good body is important! as long as the guys in shape and isnt like scrawny and wicked skinny! thats all that matters haha|`|tKfOcgDlaa	both|`|RD2xHWPoaa	Ok I think a 6-pack is the hottest thing around. I love a guy with a six pack!!!!!!|`|iGALjsbXaa	i like them both but the six pack is hott without a doubt :)|`|r3f7xN4vaa	the v cut... just something oh so sexy about it... lol even if he is skinny with no six pack haha|`|YV0hGLh0aa	i like 6 packs but i think i would go for a v cut 2|`|1bcf2zgYaa	both...|`|t8VEswrmaa	6-pack but not too muscular thoughs guys freak the crap out of me! haha|`|1hwqe8CMaa	v-cut for sure :)|`|E9WFPlvVaa	i think having a "happy trail" and 6 pack is HOTT!!, but if i had to choose the ,..6pack.....dah|`|BpIUZyqKaa	i leik em both ! :)|`|ZaxpQSO5aa	I kind of like the V-cut better, but either is fine, of course.|`|X40Ww89qaa	both are a result of low body fat|`|QUan5l0Baa	six packs are hotttt.?|`|MRpSUNNhaa	well a six pack is super hott. but a v cut is amazing. that makes  me drool and is super sexy.. that makes any girl want to have sex with you. haa.

f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	Most fire departments have a large room in the back for their members to get together, thus "fire hall".  :)  It's basically a big conference room at the fire house, with a kitchen space next door.  :)    Our volunteer fire dept rents it out to help pay the bills, and 4 times a year they have pancake breakfasts there to raise money.  You can easily fit 100 people in one most places.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I've always known fire stations to have a hall where they hold banquets (like a VFW hall, but they are often attached to the fire station).|`|irLnPW4aaa	In some areas, the fire department often has a big hall that is rented out for various functions like wedding and such, much like the VFW, Elks Lodge, etc.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Our wedding reception at the local volunteer fire station.  We are both volunteer fire fighters. Most stations have a party hall, ours doesn't, so we are using the engine garage. It was perfect for our theme. Quonset hut shaped, so our theme of snow and winter fits perfectly, decorating it to look like an igloo.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	In smaller towns, it's a community hall that is adjacent to the fire station that is used for various events.
kERP7zAhaa	i would. because he's a nice guy and we'd have fun together|`|nNYBhelGaa	heck yes|`|HimBbU6caa	No, because I'm not trying to reopen the flood gates. Dancing is a sensual activity that builds sexual tension. If my ex had friendship and conversation in mind she would invite me for coffee. <br>  <br>  I'm a straight up person so I would flat out refuse with no sugar coating. I would expect the same from others. I have little respect for people who beat around the bush. Don't smile and say "yes" when you really want to say no. It's selfish and weak.|`|CKWABfYIaa	if he was cute den i would say yes to him...... but if you want to turn him down den just say cuz he ya ex n u like somebody else or just say u dnt want to...|`|b538976641cc2a50041772f307796f66aa	If I wanted to get laid yes. If I did not need it then no.
sJ7GzZLbaa	youre annoying and obviously have self esteem issues. you are not fat and you know it.|`|AA10455206	Hell no, you are Not fat at all.  Love yourself the way that you are and thank God that you are alive.  You look great!  Tell your friend to stop telling you lies and maybe she's jealous of the way you look.  Jesus loves you just the way you are and he is ready and willing to give you a new life and be your best friend.  How do you find him, he's just a prayer away.|`|Y0O6971laa	ur not fat at all; you're thinner than me me and i'm normal weight.  u have a nice body; your friends a jerk.

Hey, you are not even close to being fat at all. How does your friend look? Maybe she's saying stuff like that to you because it helps to hide her own feelings inside, even if she might be skinny too. Do not pay attention to things like that. Try to make a joke out of it or something. I am built very weird to, and a lot of kids said things like that to me, but i never really cared what they thought about me. I knew myself, and its time that you actually start accepting who you are and realize that there is people in this world that just want to break others down and see them fall.   You're stomach is not ugly at all either, everyone is unique and love it. Life would be so boring if everybody was exactly the same. Just think about it. If you have something that is different, there is nothing wrong with that, it defines you for you, and not someone or something else.|`|4wFbQH53aa	hellll no your not fat. i wish i was skinny like you!|`|nXSpS3Axaa	No, your not fat.|`|CNSGz12zaa	Cant really tell..take the rest of your shirt off :)|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	Okay seriously dump this friend, regardless of the consequences.

There's a reason your friend doesn't have any other friends...it's because no one else would put up with that garbage.  You seriously  need to go into counseling of some sort and soon.

Next time your so-called friend calls you fat, say "No, actually I'm not. Would you please stop saying that?" If she won't stop, and you really hate this, then just drop her. She's not your friend if she won't stop when you ask. Don't worry about the parent thing. I used to be best friends with my mom's BFF's son (yeah, I was) and I stopped being his friend for the same reason--jerk.|`|ZIJvBQAMaa	Not at all. Your perfect! I am rude and honest so trust me I would tell you if you were. Maybe she really thinks that she is fat so she tries to someone make herself feel thinner by calling others fat. She has issues. I would just tell her "I'm not fat, I am Hot! Too bad your face is ugly, you can't really change that; can you?" "Your parents are so attractive, are you sure you are really their kid or did you just get the bad DNA?" HAHAHAHAHA Then see if she ever calls you fat again! :)|`|b1NRf4VCaa	i would healthy food not junk food and do some excrise.|`|Pn6aqpulaa	You are not fat, and you need to understand that, from the picture you are just fine.

Honestly I think she's just jealous that you have such a built toned stomach and legs. Just be like hey I know I'm not fat so wtf is your problem? Sorry about your anorexia. I have issues with my weight to and I'm trying to accept that I'm not fat but it's hard because I'm dying to be a stick figure!|`|krkpHSOhaa	Most likely you friend is jealous!  You obviously are not fat AT ALL  Just don't listen to her...and you probably need to find a new friend.|`|88549bab6924439810ef4c92c64e5634aa	First of all, she isn't a friend if she is putting you down. No matter what your size is a true friend doesn't make you feel bad about yourself for nothing.    You really should get medical help if you think your fat. You've already had an eating disorder once and it could easily come back. You obviously still have that way of thinking if you think you're fat (which you aren't by any means). Seek some sort of counseling before you get into heavy teenage years where almost everyone becomes super self conscious and anorexic prone girls are most likely to pick up (and keep) that habit.    Good luck!!|`|eTxk4lSxaa	You look fine and for peace of mind, find out your BMI which I know will fall into the normal range. Tell your mum that you really don't want this toxic friend to be in your life and see if there is a way that contact with her is limited.   Get it into your head that you are fine and beautiful.   Now go and find something that makes you happy and explore everything the world has to offer.|`|BgVWSApdaa	You are not fat - you are skinny!!!!  Do not lose any weight.  You look great.    Tell your mom that you don't want to hang with her because she's calling you fat and that its getting to you.  Your mom will understand because of your past problems with anorexia.      Keep up that confidence!|`|fQiiuwlHaa	No you're not fat!!!!!!! You look like you sucking your stomach in though. Not one to judge, but your friend must be really dumb to think you are!! Or maybe just jealous because she isn't that skinny!! I'm very skinny too and I always get called the opposite. Anorexic. You're lucky because it makes no since to call you fat, but when people start calling you anorexic the word spreads and it starts being believed. Anyway, Enough with my problems. lol. Don't listen to you friend. She doesn't really know what she is talking about.|`|zVZB1Hpwaa	no you are not you are no where near to be called FAT!I wonder how fat the other gurl is stupid brat!I hate those kinds of people!Im very sorry sweaty that people with rude minds and that are jealous of other people call people rude names!Tell her would she like to be called Fat!Next time she says that yell at her and tell her that you dont appreciate that at all!|`|yOFWD0unaa	Sounds like your "friend" is a jealous bi@tch! Tell your mum to speak with hers. What she is saying is wrong and stupid. You are NOT fat in the least. No wonder she has no friends. Tell her to grow up.|`|R7oQ7Dygaa	omg you are so not fat. your friend is probably just jealous|`|HcxaErXkaa	omg your not fat at all! i wish i was so skinny as you, i really am fat!!!!!!|`|2aJ7gHQgaa	You are honestly not fat.  Anyone who tells a post-anorexic person that she is fat, especially when you're definitely not fat, is not your friend.  If your parents are bffs, maybe you could talk to her or talk to your parents, but somehow you need to let this girl know that it is NOT ok for her to call you fat or grab your stomach.  You seem to still be really down on yourself (based on calling your stomach weird and writing "fat me" on the picture), and you should find friends who are more encouraging.  You might also consider talking to a school counselor or another adult who you trust.  You are beautiful, and hopefully with some help, you'll be able to see that.|`|392b18ae97259a7518f51868eb7ea463aa	Fat? Are you kidding me? If anything, you are very thin!  So to answer your question, no you are not fat all. You are very, very far from being fat.     PS: For anyone that is heavy, there is nothing wrong with that.     Anyhow, your friend probably calls you fat because she is jealous of you. Whenever someone picks on you or calls you names, it is because they are insecure with themself. One day when I had my shirt off, one of my friends told me that I was putting on a gut. I looked at him, then back at myself and just laughed. Let people talk. Just know the truth deep down inside.    Stay strong and don't ever let someone else cause you to second guess yourself.    And for the record, you aren't built really weird and nothing about you is ugly.     God bless|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Stuff like this kills me. You are not fat, you could gain 20lbs. and still not be fat. Some13 year old girls are unbelievably  mean,  and some girls will be mean all their lives. Do not obsess over your weight, if you fall within a normal range fine. If you are healthy fine. What is most important is that you choose to be healthy, sometimes that is uber thin, sometimes not. At the end of the day, concentrate on becoming a versatile, multifaceted, educated, individual. If being a size 2 is all you have to offer, it gets boring pretty quick.|`|dpst3yD9aa	Your not fat! Trust me! every1 thinks their 2 fat or 2 skinny! i just recently learned that people who think their fat sometimes can end up almost DEAD because they think this! don't go down that road! It's something you will regret when your older! It seams like this girl might be jealous of u. You said she only had one friend (you) right? Well why do you think that is? Think about it before you do something horrible that will mess up your life forever!|`|qOE7wBbFaa	you are not fat and you know it.  And if you don t then i m telling it to you now , No you are not Fat , you re friend is probably teasing you when she sais that , don t worry you are not Fat but be more sure of yourself !!!

Sometimes friends like to tease you when they are jealous or just to do it.|`|9kHN3ar0aa	no you are not fat! your friend is a douche. your stomach is flat and fine for a 13 year old. it's not toned or anything but your only 13 so it shouldn't be! you look perfectly normal or even skinnier than normal.|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	No, you are not fat.  Remember when people start to pick on others or call them names, it is usually because they are not happy and are jealous of those particular people for one reason or another.    Never feel about how others tell you.  They need help when they call you names or pick on you.  You should just smile and give her a hug, she must need one.    You keep yourself healthy.  Your stomach is not ugly, it looks well toned, not weird or ugly.|`|NH0vq9Kjaa	absolutely not fat...ditch your friend or ask your parents for advice....cause shes not being right|`|2oSCT3viaa	aw no   shes probably just teasing you, me and my friends do it to each other all the time and we're not fat    so just play along|`|CGWp29Fjaa	you are not fat...  dont believe her.  when she says "your fat"  just say "your jealous or at least i dont look like you"  that way u feel better and she feels bad for calling you that.|`|ae24FseFaa	omg i had the same thing happen my parents had friends and this girl did this kind of thing and i couldnt ditch her, but hey i talked to my mom, so she cut back to seeing them, try that, now we arent friends.    girl, you are not fat at all, your freaking slim!!!!!!! dont listen to her thats happened to me, but thats cause they're just making fun and joking or just jealous.|`|U8gIdoXFaa	I dont know what your friend is playing at calling you fat. Surely if she is friends with the family she would be aware of your anorexia. She's cruel and needs to be told to shut her mouth.    You are not fat. You look great.|`|Okr25OpPaa	omg nooo youre totally normal... most of it's probably muscle. Everyone has to have some fat on their body... and wouldn't you rather be called "chubs" than "anorexic"? i know i would! just keep those workout up if you really do feel that way and make sure to buil d muscle not fat... its better to be buff that the chubster.|`|L7zGOYM5aa	you are not fat!!!!! I am 5' 7" and I am 140, so you are doing great! If you feel unhealthy, you should just exercise and eat right. :) best if luck|`|NGT9HQmnaa	Just because your parents are friends doesn't mean you have to be. You have to be social & friendly but not "friends"  You may be her only friend because of the way she treats people. You are by no means fat, chubby, heavy, or anything of that nature. Your tiny if anything I would say you are a little to on the thin side. Maybe you should talk to your mom about the things that she says to you so you and your mom can find something else for you to do when they are over. Even if you just stay in your room and your mom says you have home work. Did you think that maybe she says these things to you because she is insecure about her own weight? You have a great stomach I am very jealous!|`|r5ck3vaEaa	Actually, i think you are too skinny. Only jealous people will say mean things. It is what bullies and ugly fat girls do. Just hang around ppl who are positive.|`|ZQAPiCuBaa	ok first off your not fat.. get over it ok. and stop with all the dramatics, you just want attention and people to tell you that your not fat. and as far as your friend goes, who cares if her rents are friends with yours, stop talking to her your old enough to make those decisions and as for you being anorexic when you were seven, well i don't even no if you knew what that meant then. but your young your body is changing and it will all even out within a couple years... and stop pitting yourself have fun and stop worrying about what others think... ok|`|g24rjg51aa	well onceyour five feet you should weigh 100 pounds(normal weight) every inch after that should equal 5 pounds you said you were 5 foot six so that means you weigh 100+ 6 inches=130 you arnet fat your completly normal weight right on the dot|`|oC3J9mckaa	hell no! ur not fat|`|6Nk6CQe1aa	wat r u crazy i'd say your skinny u have a great body  tell your "friend" not to call you fat cause your not tell her your sensitive about your weight  if she cant except that then she's not your friend and you dont have to be friends with her :)|`|ZT4yO3bfaa	First of all, in complete 100% honesty, you are NOT fat at all, so the fact that your friend is calling you fat is ridiculous. Second, a real friend would not make fun of you even if you WERE overweight, or in this case, if you truly have self-esteem problems. It's normal for someone coming out of an eating disorder to still imagine themselves as overweight when in reality they're not at all. I would advise you to seek some professional counseling and have a long talk with your friend. She needs to respect your feelings.|`|bYHoIykSaa	One, you're not fat and second you need a new friend.|`|kvu1dQFjaa	Your not fat! maybee your friend is just jelous|`|NaRWcxiXaa	I hate when people ask these questions, and they arent fat at all.

I have a 13 year old sister in the same position except she's never been anorexic. Our parents are best friends and the girl is mean to her. You need to stand up to her and tell her how you feel. I know it's hard to stop being friends with someone cause your parents are friends but at the same time you parents wouldn't want you to become anorexic again because their friend's daughter is horrible to you. You can only be so nice. Tell her how you feel and if she doesn't stop explain it to your parents. I'm sure they will understand. Don't let some brat make you feel insecure about yourself.|`|W8PSmSHTaa	No, you are definitely not fat at all.. Girls naturally have a higher body fat content than boys do, and when you get older/taller you will most likely get even skinnier, if that makes you feel any better. All girls look better with curves and it makes you look healthier.    Your friend is probably just jealous. You should have a heart to heart and tell her to stop because it obviously seems like its hurting your self esteem.|`|HJkAXiyVaa	No. And to think you are, I would honestly say you still have some psychiatric issues. I say this not to be mean, but in my fully honest and most helpful opinion.    Ditch your "friend" is, actually, probably the best advice I could give. If anybody talked to me that way that didn't have any other friends to begin with, I'd make it clear to them that they need to change their attitude. I don't see how it would matter if your parents are bff's with hers; if your parents are understanding enough (and if you told them that she's been psychologically abusive to you to begin with) hopefully they'd get the picture.|`|i0AjtUSOaa	no your not and if she insults you then she shoulnt be your friend|`|pgF6i0L4aa	you are not fat, and f her for saying that. Seriously you should just tell her off, cuz friends dont do that. and if ur parents r mad, who cares you will be better off w/o her. and do not go annorexic, its sooo unhealthy.|`|38L6tVFraa	I would say no|`|ogXYWRPwaa	not at all!!!  what kind of a friend do you have?!  you have no body fat at all.  =]|`|c27ab8b6f7be6ebfecf52253598d6c39aa	girl shut up! u need to gain some weight before u fall out!
xoXkHOVsaa	They are being overprotective.  BUT you still live in their house and for the next four months they can snoop all they want.      Be a civil as you can with them until you get into college.  Then you will be out of the house and have all the freedom you want.  I don't know about your state laws, but you can probably go get a license on your own.

mtmMQH4Xaa	What the hell, I'll take a stab at this.    Personally, I don't think there is anything, but I could be wrong.  Also you shouldn't worry about it, your young and it could be that you just like your boyfriend and are not madly in love with him.    It could also be your boyfriend just doesn't know where your ignition switch is, or doesn't care.    Chances are when the right lover comes around and knows just the right things to say, the right places to touch, somebody may be answering his question, HELP! My girlfriends a nymphomaniac|`|C2olZsNiaa	We need to know what you consider low.  You may just not be compatible with your boyfriend.  he may want it 2 times per day while you only want it 4-7 times per week.  everybody is different.  I know that when I don't want to have it as much, it is usually because I don't enjoy it as much with the person that I am having sex with.  Sometimes the sex becomes routine and it doesn't excite a person.

They dont relize you are doing it i promise and when they relize they will stop. But about the telling everybody thing just tell her to stop and if she doesn't dont spread rumors about her just say to everyone that she is wrong that i used to like him but not anymore they wont bealive you but just drop it and then they will start to c wat a b your friend it      hope i all works out    xox|`|rqNb6FIraa	Act completely independent. If you act like you don't ned her then she'll realize how much she needs you, then she'll follow you and treat you liek the leader.|`|YCLqFB5Oaa	go like this.  YOUR FIRED.  and then walk away and tell everyone her crushes.|`|uVxvPx0Faa	Your friend is emotionally dependant on you, if ignore her and go hang out with your other friends she will come back and may act mad, simply tell her to stop talking about you to your other friends, she needs you and will feel lonely without you as she said she cant talkt o the crushes without you, it may also be that your are better looking than her so she is trying to feel better.|`|pmkP39hcaa	first of all, dont do back what she is doing to you. I have been in a friend ship like this before and it lasted eight years. I finally just stood up for myself. If after you do she wants to be friends and changes then great but if she doesnt then move on! her loss.

xMyvEdOiaa	I would be excited to know my real family, but scared they wouldnt accept me.  I would also be sad that the family that raised me wasn't my birth family, but they would be my "family" more than my bio ones.  I would like to get to know my bio family if possible.|`|sqmIO2u5aa	If ever it happened to me, I would be eager to know my real family... To know if I have brothers or sisters and for sure I want to be with them after I found them. But if ever I don't know there location, Probably I will search them using this reliable website http://www.web-detective.com/....To have their contacts, address and other information I need to know them more before seeing them in person...
3593990737e2529f3d37c4d45d8ea4dfaa	Be happy with what you have.. looks like your friends are either complaining about you or themselves.. dont pay any mind to that.. be positive (=|`|dcb3369ea9b5295be3b0a8fc70e891feaa	they have to discover it by themselves...|`|fJgt7ZXbaa	Go eat a quadriple pounder...supersize....dont throw it up....  make sure u always eat heaps of stuff around them...like alot.|`|SdYOAb62aa	In my experience, there's nothing you can do to convince girls they aren't fat without them discovering it themselves.  One of my best friends is skinnier than I am with an amazing body and she keeps saying she is fat.  Note: I am very very skinny.|`|LN4dAkWQaa	it really depends are they much bigger than you. If so just say that the only reasone that they think the are fat is becasue they look at you and say omg she is so skinny. Also don't let things like that get to you i am like you a lot of people are like oyu i jsut say ok when they say i am skinny jsut say that but ignore it but if it really bothering you tell them when they say you are skinny they don't just sya it once it feels like that they say it everyday. And if they react badly just tell them it was bugging me i really needed to get that off my chest!    hope it all works out and please dont jsut read this info like it has just been riten to anoy you it has been riten  so that you can take it in and think about your life.    hope it works out xox|`|TqWXXZ34aa	NO,...its to bad. That your friends are so self absorbed with there appearance. The only reason why they are saying that they are fat is because you are thinner then them. They are jealous of you and would never tell you.  There is nothing you can say to them to make them actually believe you.  i would just say "whatever".. and talk about something else
1OiTO7Wfaa	its not frustrating at all, first of all tell your friends best friend she cant "claim"people. your new friend needs to realize that she is allowed to be friend with who EVER she is allowed to be friends with and that if her so called "best friend" is her best friend as she says she would learn to accept you two having common interests and getting along, and if she werent being so close minded about the situation she would see it possible to have you as her friend as well. It seems like you and your new friend dont have any issues but that your new friends best friend does. I think the best advice i can give you is that, you and your new friend need not to worry about her, dont let one person get in the way of making your life one worth living, if you  always let one person get in the way of a minor situation then you'll never find peace. the key is change, your new friend probably realizes things are changing and she may not knwo how to deal with it but ask your friend "is this good change?" when she realizes that yes, it is good change she will accept it and be more able in getting to know you better and moving on with another chapter to her life. (: hope that this helps you (:
uvWuVWb1aa	Know that the two of you will disagree, and that's ok.   Give him time with his friends.   Don't feel like you have to give and give and give. It's a two way street.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Just be yourself. Be reasonable. Know that sometimes you will argue and it is ok, it's not the end of the world. Don't forget who you are, you are more than just one half, you are your in person. You don't have to stop seeing your friends, stop enjoying all the things you did before and become a different person.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Learn to be his best friend and f**k like a wh*re. You'll stay married for a thousand years.|`|gZ5OI7P9aa	Lingerie instead of  sweat pants|`|ugRN86bYaa	Go to church, pray and make God the center of your marriage. Research it! Couples who pray together; stay together.|`|7cjqT33Baa	I honestly rolled my eyes when I read that question because it's just so needy and neediness is so unattractive.  Be your own person.  Have your own interests, always seek knowledge and growth.  Keep the relationship fun, laugh a lot and seek out adventures.  Always speak up with your own thoughts, make sure your husband is taking care of your needs as well as his own...and I'm sure everything will work out just fine.|`|LQiWKZZQaa	Show up naked.  Bring beer.    Anything else is bonus.
SC91Uwrhaa	I think my eyes just went crossed! Yikes that's a mouth full! Ok, you're so young and you are going to have girls lie about you and talk about even in years to come. My suggestion is just ignore them and make new friends. They obviously don't want to be true friends, so they in turn are not honest and they don't deserve your friendship! Drop them and make new friends. If they are making trouble for you then tell someone... Either an adult or a confidant.|`|d1P05XfPaa	Your in a wrong place on a wrong time!|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	THEY ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS. Ditch them, and go find TRUE friends who wont do that to you. Dont hang out with a certain group of people. Be friends with all kinds of people, old, young, white, black, latino, green, blue, purple. Lol. If you dont hang out with a certain group, then everyone will know your a TRUE friend, and that will bring you even MORE friends.|`|4aWWpCXzaa	Thats a really tough situation I know i'm in a situation like that right now with two other girls also,but I stood up to them my other firends were too scared to but, you always have to rember your the better person and don't fall for the fake cry either trust me.Also you can find other friends who accpet you for who you are.If it gets to out of hand maybe you should tell an adult.Don't let them show any of this bothers you because that only shows them their not winning!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!
e8bf4cd0733c71e8557b69243c277c8eaa	i made the mistake of doing it in high school and it was wrong. I disobeyed God's word ans sinned against God. I am 31 now and yes i regret it. I am now in love with the man I'm going to marry and I know I have taken something away from him I can't get back. we have both committed to each other that we are going to wait until were married before having sex. we want it to be something special and not something we will regret. I hope this helps you and you will make the right decision.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	...I had my first sexual experiences in junior high actually,....and no!...I have no regrets!...are ya kiddin?<br>  I had no regrets because mostly it was the girls who were initiating all of the sex.<br>  Surely us boys initiated some sexual stuff too reasonably...but the girls seemed more inclined and desiring of sex then most of my buddies and guys my age back then anyways!<br>  Yikes huh?<br>  You go girls....!!!!|`|e489ymwhaa	i didn't do it even now i am still pure not like those dirty demons|`|DPjSkuoyaa	Wait till you're married.|`|aQSv8fPFaa	i had sex the last month of my senior year in high school.. i don't regret it at all.. i mean i guess to be completely honest a little part of me wishes i could have waited.. but i feel more mature.. like i know more about guys and relationships.. i dont know everything because im still young (19).. but it made me stronger in a way i guess... i still strongly recommend to wait for anyone who is still a virgin.. it truely is a special thing to still have
7RUqEJzLaa	When he said 'me too,' he probably meant to say 'you too.' If he said me too, then that would mean he loves himself as wale, and I seriously doubt he would ruin a special moment like that by saying that. No worries.|`|rnXLZJyXaa	Means he doesn't think the same way of you...I know...it is guy talk lol.|`|SRZza0cWaa	he a slef centerd byotch?.<br>  i dont think he means it like you do..x|`|7OTJW7fAaa	Each person has a different comfort level about saying "I love you".  He might be self-conscious about saying those words.  Judge him by how he treats you and acts towards you rather than the words that he uses.  <br>  <br>  Also, understand that you can't expect someone to feel the same intensity about your relationship at the same moment that you feel it.  Cut him some slack and just see how he treats you over time.  It will become clear how he feels.|`|cce9d5d3e1f6a8bafb5bad987d7a425baa	honestly us guys love you<br>  most of the time we think that you already know that we love you<br>  so we dont really specifically say itt|`|kERP7zAhaa	it means that he loves you too|`|79zgiERCaa	Prolly nervous.<br>  <br>  He loves you.<br>  <br>  Unless you are under the age of 14.|`|yKx5wwOuaa	Well I think he should have said the whole thing. I think he is just self-center.|`|m6E7oi5Qaa	He's probably saying it because what else was he going to say?|`|lMu2J3pNaa	i think he meant to say "i love u too", just didnt kno how to say it|`|VTixPge9aa	means hes gonna break up with you after he ***** you|`|T0jeHlJ7aa	ask him. thats the only way to be sure|`|UHQGlOPlaa	if he likes you and you said it, he my not have be ready. but he wants to be with you|`|i4DRfoboaa	AWWW!!!!!<br>  he likes himself<br>  <br>  HE must be gay.......wink......wink...

uBssj3Znaa	if he will lie to you about his age, he will lie about other things.|`|U5BZPvIZaa	I have to be honest, I've lied about my age before to guys... If he said he was 20 maybe he said it because he likes you and thought that you would freak if he told you how old he really is? My current boyfriend is 25 and Im 19... What I would do is try to get over the fact that he lied to you about his age and go out with him a few times, see what he likes.. But make sure hes just not some perv whos in it to get some booty from a 17 yr old lol.. Just try him out, see how he is.. Remember, Love knows no age. Good luck! =) <br>  BTW thanks for answering my question! <3
VjUqAZuUaa	Aw honey, it's tough but you don't need a guy! It isn't absolutely essential for you to have a date, I didn't have one but I found that people didn't really spend much times with theirs anyway. Have a blast with your girls at the happy, energetic songs and when it comes to the slow ones, either find another group of girls who are dancing together or get a drink or go find a guy and drag him to the floor! <br>  <br>  If you really REALLY feel you have to have a date... do you have an older sister/brother who you can ask if they have a mate who might go with you? Or a mate of yours who has a friend who could be your date? Or are you in any clubs or anything where you could get a date?<br>  <br>  But seriously, it isn't the end of the world if you don't have a date because you can still have a great time! It can be better without a date because you aren't tied to one guy and it's more fun. Hope you have an awesome time!|`|vGh3WsU2aa	wait until theres an open guy and grab him|`|w6weeb7Daa	Get a date. There is at least one person without one, and if you are at prom without one you could find someone else to dance with there.
TkPFp8vqaa	You will probably like the movie : " The Island". Maybe you found your clone. It's not that creepy...it's rather interesting...|`|47eaf46122c4f549d5ee0bdf2f43622eaa	dude.  one time i went to the bathroom and i looked in the mirror and someone that looks exactly like me was staring straight back at me.  and i was like.  WOAAAA.
07ajIEKHaa	Try to go to school near where she is going if she is so stuck in her ways. Or possibly you need to evaluate if this is her way of getting out of the relationship. No disrespect intended, just seen similar things in the past.
edbzQMl2aa	u could end up losing him as a friend if u tell and he doesn not like you back. wait a while and see how things turn out between him and his gf<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225142600AA3RwWX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|HtwhcFdfaa	He has a girlfriend. Don't do anything to break them apart.<br>  <br>  Wait for him to tell you he likes you. That way you did nothing wrong.|`|7ko9czaaaa	he has a girl friend if you say anything you will lose a friend,|`|b538976641cc2a50041772f307796f66aa	You can do two things nothing or risk the friendship. It sounds like he wants closeness with one girl and sex with another.
WMem5AGoaa	I think she wants you to compete for her heart, to win her over, YES she's trying to get you jealous to see how you react and what you're going to do about the situation since she already sensed your fondness towards her.|`|yGwda7wPaa	It sounds to me like she is confused.  I would watch out.  She would not likely be interested in a relationship for very long and might not be true to you.  Good luck!|`|LEWHQtNTaa	Well it sounds like not being restricted to one guy sounds like dating more than one.. but the whole schism at the party sounded like she liked you. Sounds exactly like one of my friends she liked this guy and my other friend was doing all the talking. When I like a guy, I talk to them, and they always end up asking me who I like lol and if they don;t like me they tell me who they like... But i think she likes you! But yes she doesn't sound like a safe person to be in a relationship with, would probably not be very strong|`|KHic5rAaaa	Honestly, it's probably a mixture of being pissed off at her boyfriend and playing hard to get.  She's obviously interested in you if she gave you her number and you talked for a long time.  You can't blame her for being a little bitter since her ex cheated on her.  She's probably a bit vulnerable as well.  Also, girls play hard to get!  It's fun and we want to be respected by the guy we're pursuing.    As of now, I would just keep talking to her, which shows that you're still interested.  I wouldn't do anything dramatic like trying to kiss her or anything.  I would just keep up calling her and ask her to go see a movie with you...but keep it casual.  Don't act too interested but don't act too blase, like you don't care.    Try to keep your conversations lighthearted and funny.  Don't act all serious with her, but definitely try to throw in some flirting.  If you keep this up, it'll eventually progress into something more serious.    Good luck : )|`|kPwHlu45aa	Okay, this is my opinion but she so likes you!  I think she just told you that because she was scared to tell you that she like you but I don't know, that's just what I think...but I would wait a lil while before doing anything or whatever because she just got out of a relationship..  I think she was making you jealous just for the simple fact that she may like you....
ZQWEgFZ2aa	If you know for sure that he's not gonna make the move, then you either have to make the move first or just flirt with him. Flirt with him a little so that he wants more of you. Hope this helps!|`|IRAtmZhTaa	first of all i f u don't know him like if he is't one of your friends then i would say that  its more of a crush you've got rather than you like him ...yes there is a difference.    & secondly, jsut smile, smiling & laughing is contagious. eventually he ill approach and if he doesn t then he probably doesn t have a crush on u|`|iGnUYe9Haa	... you make moves.  Don't mean to be that guy, but that's why its called making a move.|`|KmvNyVZiaa	hrrmph spend time deffineatly, and If i were you id get too a very very comftorable outdoor spot with him and then break it too him and say i want to start a relationship.  I for one as a guy like it when girls are bold and like to get what they want.|`|AA10277384	Just do it.    If you like him, and he likes you, but he's not going to make the first move, then you have to.     Otherwise, he won't know that he likes you (hey, he could be oblivious to your feelings), and you'll lose your chance.    Good luck!

But in this economy you better hope he gets another job to help you support your 7 kids.  Because now he has no income to help you!  So theres where i see what you did was wrong.|`|0mGTnktlaa	you are not only WRONG but STUPID. you have just taken food out of your kids mouth trying to get him back. sweetie you really need to grow up and keep the focus on all of those kids you NOW have to feed on your own or with my tax money. you could have killed him with kindness than to take the money out of his pocket. THINK with your MIND and not your HEART the next time. when he told you that than you should have went the next business day and filed child support on his nasty butt and trust he would have felt that pain for a long time to come but you would have been getting MONEY to assist with those kids. THINK, THINK, THINK, use your NODDLE. GodBless|`|mbv2jLqDaa	Wow....no, you did what you had to do!  That is unbelievable!  I hope things go well for you and your kids.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	The phrase "cutting off your own nose to spite your face" comes to mind here.

Sounds like you two deserve each other.|`|OlNFzx8eaa	CAN ALL OF YOU ABOVE JUST SHUT THE F**K UP    wrong wrong wrong , ur all gay     now listen you wasnt wrong with what you did cause it was wrong for him to do it     all you do is go on child benefits and you goverment will pay your childrens fee here in UK its around 50 pounds a week     50 * 7 = 350    feed ur kids there you go !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! woopdi doo    next you take you husband to court     for financial support obviously theyll MAKE HIM WORK IN THE STREETs if they have to     and then u can live life to the full and plus i think the gov pays for you aswell not sure though     yeh     so everyone above shuuushhh     ur all losers u have no lives     i rule     ur all wasted in ur lives whereever your from         :D take care and good luck sweety :D|`|7foornMVaa	Not only were you wrong but you are also STUPID.

There is the issue that he cant pay support now but was he paying it before?  The good news is he cant pay for his girlfriend's kids either.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No. He got himself fired anyway. He did it.    It would be hard to get child support though now he has no job.    Harriet|`|yGwda7wPaa	I don't blame you.  That is horrible!  Good luck to you in the future and with your children.

By making it so that their father has no income in which to help support them.  He'd have to wether he wanted to or not.  Well you went and ruined that.  Rule number one of a divorce never get the guy fired.  Now support will be set at the bare minimum or nothing at all.  Better help him find a new job.  Good luck in this economy.|`|AA11080047	there is no scorn like a women scorned. i think you acted appropriately good on you.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	How can help provide financial support for his children now that he is unemployed?|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	Hell NO   I'd of done the same.

Also make it stated that if you drop dead, half of the retirment is to go to the kids too.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Wrong?  Maybe.    Will what you did help your situation in raising your 7 kids - no.      And from what I have seen with my wife - and the relationship her 2 kids (now in their 40's) now have with her ex-husband (their father) - they are so eager to have their.....Dad (I prefer the name "sperm donor") in their lives - that they do not care that he abandoned their Mom and wouldn't help to support them.    I married their Mom, 8 years after the divorce and if I hadn't paid for things they would not have made it.  The sperm donor now crys to his kids about how much they owe him because of how much he sacrificed to pay $100 a month to support his kids.    Give me a break -$50 a month for a kid will not even pay for the lunches.  I never counted how much I paid.|`|bYoKSMNKaa	Now wot are u gonna do? U feel better?

Be strong, get well, get rid of the jerk. Good luck!|`|FBhjhjR0aa	are you currently seeing a professional? if so, then on your next visit with them, tell them what your husband is doing. say the same thing you said here. Express to the therapist how it's making you feel, and see if the therapist will allow your husband to come in with you on your next visit, so the doc can explain to him how wrong he is for throwing it in your face, and hanging it over your head.    If that's not an option. Then I suggest that you go to another doc and see if they diagnose you as bi-polar. Don't tell the doc that you think you are, or that you have been diagnosed. Do to the new doc as if it were your first time.,|`|4fC6EJWfaa	No, he can't take your kid away, the court needs to okay it and decide whether or not you are fit to take care of your kid, take him to court just to prove that he can't.

If you are working with a doctor and are taking medicine, and have no problems with your children, you should have your children.  I would get a good lawyer if I were you.  Threatening you to make you do what he wants is not the behaviour of someone who should love and honor you.  I would understand if you are depressed when he is treating you that way.  Perhaps some marriage counseling?|`|NqMmvvgVaa	If I were you I would start going to a lawyer now and tell them these things so that they will be dated and documented in case you need to go to court in the future.|`|ugRN86bYaa	He's using your child as a pawn to get his way. That's horrid. Ignore him. If you decide to leave him, don't let his threats scare you. Judge's only take children away from parentes who are on drugs, in jail, or skanks; and lots of times not even then.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	That's a empty threat.  If you're Bi Polar, he would have to PROVE you were a danger to your child.     Find a therapist you can trust, and tell him/her what's going on.    Good luck...and take care of you.|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	He is talking out of his azz to get a rise out of you.

Do you have extreme mood swings? Do you get manic and do irresponsible things that you regret? Do you endanger your child? Or are you just depressed because you have an asshole of a husband?|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	I know plenty of bipolar women who have raised their kids just fine. Or so, so fine.     It really depends on if he's seeing things your not. Many that have bipolar  are also in denial when it has anything negative about themselves.   They refuse to see the real person who they are  and how they actually behave.  They feel everything they do, is the right way  and that's just the way it's going to be.     I have an old, dear friend who suffered from bipolar  and it really would of been better for her 3 kids  if the husband wanted to care for them, cause she really did make their lives terrbile  in many ways. Mental wise.|`|pCdEenoHaa	Listen to me:  You need to get away from him.  I'm not even close to kidding.  My husband used to threaten to take custody of my child from me all the time (even when I was still pregnant) when I didn't do what he said.  He is an ABUSER even if he doesn't hit you.  That is intimidation.  The thing is: They're idle threats now, but watch what happens if you don't cave, and you cross him.  I speak from experience. You need to cover yourself legally first (hire an attorney), and then get out.    PS- No, the courts will not simply take your child away because of a diagnosis as long as you are following the treatment plan for your condition.|`|b5UV15gCaa	Well I have dealt with my ex-husband who was diagnosed with bipolar. They just treated him for depression because they said that diagnosing bipolar can take years of monitoring to detect. I could not have gotten full custody on those grounds unless he hurt the child i any form... which he did not... but different states have different laws. you may want to check.... but I am pretty sure if you are seeking medical advice and heeding it.. you should be fine.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	My wife of 22 years is bi-polar and tends to get depressed at times.  But she still raised 2 kids cause her husband walked out (busy chasing women).  I came along 8 years later and helped raise 2 teenagers.    Sounds like the husband is mean and rather than discuss something with you on a level playing field uses the threat of taking the kids away to get you to give in to his demands.    I seriously doubt if he will stop doing this.  You have probably given in to him several times to avoid the risk of losing the kids.  He now expects you to give in when he says these words.    People with depression need help from someone who is supportive - not someone who will push you down further when you are depressed.    Stay in close touch with a doctor in term of treating the depression.  My wife takes fish oil.  Yep, tastes bad - but it does seem to help.  Another treatment for depression is sunlight - people tend to get depressed more often during the dark winter months when they are more likely to stay indoors.      And would suggest you consider if it is in your best interests to stay with your husband.  Or to seek counseling for both of you.|`|ZeVyIfHFaa	There is a stigma if you have been diagnosed. He should be concerned at all times not just when he is upset with you. Make sure that you are taking your meds and doing your therapy, for the sake of yourself and your kids. if he is out of line just be assertive and say something like "if you see I am being unsafe around the children, let me know, otherwise back off and do not use my diagnosis against me.
yGwda7wPaa	I think most likely you were a rebound.  She probably thought she was in love with you at the time, but as time went by, realized it was not true love.

If you`re here having doubts about her and how you should feel about her, then she`s not providing to you what you need, which is security. In a relationship it`s very important to feel secure about who you`re with, but she`s not giving you that. It`s very clear she`s unstable right now, whether because she just ended a long relationship, the fact is, who cares. You`re you, you`re not her past and if she can`t be honest with you right now, for you to keep on trying will just be useless.  Talk to her one more time, but honestly, this doesn`t seem to be going anywhere.

Trust me, I'm a guy, and we don't like girls trying be something that we know they're not.    2.. Guys like a sense of humor in a girl.    3.. They like a girl that is caring and passionate.    4.. We don't mind a little perfume but don't over do it to the point that people are gagging over it because it's so strong.    5.. It doesn't matter if they are good at sports either, we'll play volleyball and badminton.    6.. We like a girl that goes out, but not overdoing it. Sometimes it can be better to chill at home and watch a movie.    7.. We like girls who has good hygiene.    8.. A girl that takes care of her body(that doesn't mean skinny girls, but a girl that eat wells and exercise.)    9.. We like a girl that cares for us, a girl that will always be there when you really need her the most.)    10.. A nice dressed girl is what we look for, too(That doesn't mean dress like a total slut and flash us but if a guy is going to notice you, you have show of a little, not everything, but just a little of what you got.)    These are 10 things that I like in a girl.

xoXkHOVsaa	Tell him how you feel.  You should have a baby when you are ready.  He needs to respect that.      If you are already pregnant, then research all of your options and make the decision YOU are most comfortable with.|`|qAgF5R3Yaa	I truly understand the situation that you are in.  I want to have a baby and my girlfriend is pregnant right now I have been trying and trying to get her pregnant knowing our situation.  We are in a interracial relationship and her parents have never heard about me and we been dating for 4 years.  You see I knew the risks and she said something about about waiting and now she can't be more happy to be pregnant from me.  She loves me and that's all that matters.  He's doing it because he believes in his future with you and he wants everything out of life with you.  If you truly feel in your heart that you want this then go for it but, if you don't feel it then talk to him about it. In the end just do for you two not for anyone else.|`|igFvprvsaa	Maybe things are moving a little to fast.  I think he is excited to be with you, but maybe its all a little too much.    be careful, some guys are selfish, they only care about one thing, having you for themselves, getting you pregnant may be his way of making sure you guys are together forever. think about what you want, no one other than yourself should make your choices for you.    i wish you the best.|`|AA11993358	Tell him. That's the only way he can really know how scared you are. If you are pregnant you only have so many options: keep it, abort it, or give it up for adoption. I don't know you're age so I'm not going to give you my advice on what to do. My friend was in a similar situation and she kept it and is getting married and even though money is tight they are making it. If this is what you want and what he wants y'all will make it work. But the only thing you can do is lay all the cards on the table and tell him exactly how you feel. If you're relationship is going so well then he's probably really excited. A lot of guys want a baby but won't admit it and once you think you're pregnant they get more into it. Bottom line tell him everything you're feeling...and take the test cause there's a good chance it's a UTI or something.

dGL5xCrqaa	I had the same issue when I was in high school.  It was an awful feeling. You try to be understanding of their situation, and you also understand that life is what you make it and you need to stop putting yourself down.  The issue is, how do you stop putting yourself down?  You seem to be going in the right direction, you're starting to hang out with a different friend circle, that's a good start. Maybe get a job and meet friends that way, do something that makes you feel better about yourself. What is your favorite thing to do? Buy some new clothes, change your hair, do something fun.    You probably aren't the ugly friend, maybe your friend is model gorgeous, but I'm sure you're pretty too.|`|LN4dAkWQaa	hunny when that happens tell her how you feel that is what i did and it resolved everything. Alsoi bet if i met you one day you would be the most hottest girl in the place. Everyone is gawjuss ok. Noone is ugly. I always used to think i was the ugly friend but then you just ask your friend i sometimes feel like the ugly friend am i really ugly. they will say no and that will boost your self esteem also helping you to come to think that oyu are pretty.   also just us make-up and nice clothes and pose and take pictures of your self look at them and think what you dont like about your self if it is your face jsut think that there are more uglier people out there ok.

kPz2ayvyaa	I have an 8 yr old and I live in California too and let me tell you, the court will let him be in her life but you are incharge. Do not let him bullie you or let the court system bullie you around. I went to my local community college and took a course on Family Law. I did not need a lawyer. And fought him.     In time the court system will see what a lousy and unstable biological dude he really is and you won't have to worry about him again. The only thing is that California will not force him to pay you a dime. But keep him on support because it will screw up his credit and they will take his drivers license away.     Just keep your head up and educate yourself with the court system. Just know that you are not alone.    Good Luck!|`|49d74bd8b100117274d25e31b1942932aa	Don't sweat it.  he can surely ASK - but,   if she has the same last name as you right now - it most likely won't happen.     and,  i'm sure your daughter can have some say about it.  she is 9 afterall.    so, that I would NOT worry about.  Guys tend to say things to get you going, in hopes you will drop the case.       soon he will say he's going for custody.      but,  guess what,  it never happens,  its a threat that doesn't get followed through.  -i actually have experience in this area.  I went to get my sons name changed because i was getting married- and if I didn't change it - he would have my maiden name.   The dad requested to have it changed to his.   But,  they let me change it to my new husbands because "It would make the child feel like part of a family unit"  because he lived with me.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	I'm not sure.  Sorry.

But if he hasn't been in the picture w/ your daughter I believe the court won't grant it. Especially since now she is 9 yrs old. Is writing the last name you gave her on her homework.

I know it's a lot of red but I didn't like anything that was supposed to 'go' with red... none of it looked good. Anyway, grooms always wear black whether it's hot or cold (usually), so why not red? I am... I just hope I don't have too much red!|`|xLu1BnECaa	There's nothing wrong with those colors - pick the ones you want!  The bigger potential complication is whether you will be able to find dresses in those colors when you're out shopping for them considering most would say those colors are "off season."  If you shop now, you might be able to find some still before the spring/summer pastels flood the stores.  Otherwise you might have to order the dresses online without seeing how they fit your bridesmaids, or postpone the wedding until June/July 2010 to give you a chance at getting the dresses in those colors next fall.  Good luck!|`|HiSVA9p8aa	I just went to the David's site to see what 'serene' looks like.  It leans quite a bit toward teal and it's still a fairly dark, heavy colour.  For a summer wedding, it would be better if you switched the blue to something a bit brighter.      Perhaps a cornflower blue or 'oasis;.  You could even do 'Horizon' which has a lot of life to it even though it is a fairly deep blue.    Keep the burgundy because it's mostly an accent colour.|`|WxHrlOwnaa	I think those colors sound pretty and it is you wedding so who cares what anyone else thinks. BUT!!! if you do go with serene as the color do not go to davids bridal for the bridesmaid dresses. I was in a wedding with that color and the dresses that were picked out showed any and all sweat/water stains. it was horrible!|`|rlUUaSgqaa	They're not traditional summer colors, but you can use whatever colors you like.  I had a summer wedding and had the bridal party wear dark blue.  I actually got lots of compliments from people about how nice that color was even though it didn't match the season.
WDs4fRoxaa	We might be lucky enough to marry someone similar to us,  but expecting their family to be like us is too much to ask.    You can not expect a woman who has played such a huge  part in her son's life to start calling and asking permission  to come over.    Instead of asking her to schedule her visits, why not just stop  answering the phone and door when you feel overwhelmed.    It will take some of the edge off.    You can also start taking some of the kids over to her home  and dropping them off for a while.    It would give you a break, give her something to do, and prevent  her from being over top of you.    Best wishes|`|ScHW4842aa	Hon, you are not going to like what I have to say.     I am newly married. And my inlaws live in another country. But if they did live in my country, I would automatically open the doors of my house to them - whenever they choose to drop by, they are welcome.     Now - I understand that it is a ball breaker. But, it means that you have to work extra hard and make sure the house is always top notch clean, you are up to date with washing etc. If you have a schedule, then take your MIL with you wherever you have to go.     If you think about it... do you have a choice? Your MIL will never stop. Your nagging will only annoy your husband who sees her as his close family. Im sorry. But us DIL's lose this situation time and time again. All you can do is try to accept it.|`|4ssSgfYEaa	She needs to talk to you about all the details date, time, length of visit!    That is horribly rude to just show up!  Maybe she doesn't have a clue that she should set it up with you.  Maybe your husband told her anytime is OK!    You have every right to ask her to discuss this.

2JeCyjF8aa	It is like this only in America where we let idealistic notions be programmed into our expectations, yes it is like this after high school too. The worst part is that people dont even realize they are subconsciously analyzing people to find something wrong with them, it is the basis for how everything works from being hired to a position to being promoted, to finding a partner, every moment in time you are being judged by somebody else, and chances are you are also doing the same to some degree. This is why everybody hates America, because we have literally corrupted the world with our stupidity.

AA11319441	One of the most selfish things I've heard today.  You are right for trying to protect yourself, but where is this relationship going where your worrying about something that really isn't that big of a deal.  You can stretch school loans out almost forever.  Most aren't more than $100 or so a month (unless he has HUNDREDS of thousands in debt) and can be very flexible in the beginning when you can't pay as much.  But anyways, if you want to end it over that...feel free.|`|faT4MyVkaa	One of the most important things in marriage is to be on the same page with finances. It sounds incredibly selfish to me that someone would say to a spouse, hold off on your education plans so that you can pay off my education loans.    My wife and I were both dirt poor when we were married, and shared the debt in everything. She was conservative, and I was not. I eventually learned.|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	that's been a bump in the road for a lot of young couples.      I don't know what the answer is, but if it helps I've heard of that alot.    My wife came with a $10k nut.  That might not seem like a lot today, but in 1986 that was pretty sizable.  Almost 1/2 a years salary to put it in perspecttive.       well it wasn't her fault, her dad never made a lot and their were 7 kids in that family.  Didn't change who she was.      Marriage wasn't about $$$$.   We got through it.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	I think if it's true love, he'll still be there after grad school.

BgVWSApdaa	How old are you?  My daughter was 14 when she made that decision (we were going through the divorce) and I told the judge when we went to court.  The judge made sure her dad agreed to that (though my ex wasn't happy about it) and then it was approved.      Honestly, its really sad.  He misses her and it makes holidays really hard because my other child goes to see my ex so the 2 kids are apart every other holiday and for weekly visits.  Its hard on me too.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you can at all handle it, try to see him.  But only you know the circumstances...|`|AA11319441	You don't have to go if you don't want to.

Tell him when he is least expecting it. He will like it.
3187cafaa9313c5c6575c8397c98a79eaa	Sadly, you will probably not find happiness to this. It is comparable to blacks and whites getting married in the USA. In the past, you would have been disowned by your parents, on both sides. But as time has passed, people have become more acceptable. But, Muslim/ Christian, that's like a whole new start. I'm afraid you and your love will have to be trail blazers, and may never get acceptance from your parents. It's hard to say let love rule in this case, but there is never an exception that i can think of when you shouldn't let love rule and follow your hearts. Before you are muslim, or christian, you are first people . Blaze that trail, and don't look back. history and your children will thank you, and maybe people like you will help to unite the world one day.|`|b87ee7794207ceaf35296b9c24769096aa	The chances of your plan working is next to nothing. A Muslim woman is not allowed to marry a non-Muslim by Islam. HOw can you teach your kids about Islam if you are clearly in violation of one of the basic rules.  You live in a free world. Please do what you please but don't fool your self in believing that your marriage will be accepted by any practicing Muslim.  He will convert to Islam if he Truly loves you and likes Islam. Otherwise you are opening a can of worms.  Good luck in whatever you do.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	You could, if you were willing to risk the wrath of sharia law and the local imams.  By the way, are you Sunni, Shia, Sufi, or Wahhabi?|`|yGwda7wPaa	I personally think that it would work out well for you both if you got married.  If you are both honest people with moral values and love each other, then the religious differences can be overcome.  You don't have to believe the same thing in order to love each other.  For your family, I would talk to them and try to get them to understand that you love them and want to be a part of their lives, but also have to do what is right for you.  Perhaps with time, your family would accept it.  They are trying to control you, because they think they know what is best for you.  Once they got to know him and got to see how happy you are together, perhaps they would change their minds.  Good luck!|`|0viBGF9vaa	It is legal if you are in the united states, im sure it is in europe too but im not positive.

Keep the good relations you have with your family but in the end they will have to make their own choice.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Listen,    Religion to young people is very transient. As you get older, it becomes VASTLY more important.    You parents know and understand this.    When you have children, he's going to want to take them Christmas Carolling, he'll want a Christmas Tree; he'll want lavish feasts and presents and Chistmas Mass.    That what he grew up on. He'll want that for his children.    You will want a solemn Ramadan, small meals at midnight, frequent visits to your Mosque, and all the celebrations of that season.     That is what you grew up on. You'll want your chidren to share that.    What is supposed to happen during the holiday season?    What happens when his parents come over for Christmas Dinner, and your parents come over for Ramadan observances?    Which parents will the children listen to? Will they pray to Jesus or Muhammad?    And can you imagine the suspicions, the conflicts, and the arguments at EVERY family event?    Do you expect your parents (or his) will be pleased that you've both abandoned your religion? Do you want to inflict them with fear for your soul?    Do you expect your families to hold their tounges at family gatherings? Will your parents enjoy a nice ham dinner with his family? Will your parents be offended when offered a drink of beer or wine? Will his parents be offened when you're parents leave the party to go pray towards Mecca?    I'm sorry, but this is totally unworkable unless you both leave your families permanently.     And even then, you'll be raising children with no clear relgious identity. They'll be embarrassed and confused, unsure of their place in society.    Face it, LOVE DOES NOT CONQUER ALL. DIVORCE RATE IS UP TO 52%!!!    If either of you could think beyond your own desires and wishes, you'd see what a total disaster you're headed for.     Your family will never understand. Frankly, I don't blame them.     Good Luck!|`|ugRN86bYaa	You should marry him and accept Christ as your savior. When you meet Christ, you will have a good friend who is a true and living God. Then you will have a happy marriage. Christian marriages have a better survival rate than nonChristian marriages.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	I have never understood why the conflict over religion.  Different rules and practices but we still pray to ONE God. God wants us all to get along and love one another.  We are all in this together.
5DJzp6bMaa	Way Over Blowing this, relax its His Parents|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Have you asked him why he always goes there first?  I do think that's weird.  He should come home to you.|`|NoZAofgOaa	have you tried telling him how you feel?  and i am on ur side with this.|`|ugRN86bYaa	No, you're right, but you're fighting a losing battle. If you haven't mentioned that you want to go with him, you might do that. Otherwise, there's not much you can do without his resenting it. I know a woman who got out the Bible and showed her husband where it says something to the effect of a man shall leave his parents and be with his wife, and Wow! the husband  and his parents both got really mad and it caused lots of problems.   You have to pick your battles; I'm not sure this is one I'd pick. But this is just my opinion. Hopefully, someone will have a solution.|`|S3UxNOhdaa	No, you're not overblowing the situation. He should come home. He is unaturally attached. If you are close enough to your in-laws, ask his mother what you can do..ie what is his favorite dish growing up, etc...They are probably going to have to tell him he needs to GO HOME to his WIFE..and what's he doing there. Otherwise, if this just started recently, you might want to show up at his parents house for dinner to "cook dinner" with mom and see if he shows up.|`|G50ucmllaa	Not at all.  Your house is his house, not his parents.  I wonder how his parents feel about this.

I found out that............he liked his mom's cooking better, she spoiled him  and he felt better taking a dump there, instead of our home.     I guess I may of overblown this  too, but then again, he was cheating with his cousin and she was always over at his moms.|`|ab08ce8d0c96d3f3b3c871c338bb4351aa	hate to say this but my EX-husband did the very same thing. We lived next door to his parents for the first six months of our marriage and he would go straight over there before coming in the house....and then he wondered why I was mad when he spent an hour over there and I'm sitting at the table with dinner ready.  We are no longer married. This wasn't the only issue but his mother especially definitely didn't help our marital problems and it was due to the lack of "cutting the cord" that caused a lot of them.   I don't think you're overblowing it but after six years I'm not sure what you can do to get it to stop.|`|Sl0iE8cbaa	I don't think that there is anything wrong with his behavior. I am sure that he calls your house his house also. I still call my parents house My House as well as my own and I have been married for almost 20 years. I think that it is good that he has a close bond with his family. He could be doing something wrong like going to a strip club or meeting up with some other girl before coming home. Count your blessings and the next time you see him give him a big hug for being such a decent gut!!|`|bYoKSMNKaa	When i first started reading I was thinking this has to be a young guy but 45??

Probably has myspace account or signed up to a secret dating site. Porn?? There's definitely something. Look and you will find.
yPf96Vvfaa	Perhaps his frustration is the sum of many unhappy events held back. Has your relationship been plagued with problems over the years? A recent argument could have been the final straw.|`|JnXmSLDfaa	Hi,  I don't think there is anything you can do except drive yourself crazy if you try to go after him.  And, yes,  '''someone can just walk away like that'''  and it's done all the time.  If you are committed and he isn't, it's not worth it to keep on hoping for a change.  I married a man I was just insane over and did everything I knew to try to keep him and to keep winning him back but it really never worked .  We married and divorced twice and finally I got it into my head that it would never be any different, and that no matter how I felt, he would always be able to just up and walk out on me.  I could never do that and I never wanted to even during the fights and hurtful times.  I wanted to live my life with this man and for us to grow old together but it just wasn't that important to him.  Those were painful years and it kept getting worse.  He always said he loved me and was always coming back but that's because he was always leaving.  Until finally that last divorce that I filed.  I was always so hurt and so upset and depressed during those horrible times, I can't believe now that I ever put up with such abuse, emotional abuse, and I wonder what in h*ll was wrong with me that I did.  I guess Mother Nature did a double whammy, a cruel joke, on me to make me think that I was in love.  I'm not even sure what that is anymore to tell you truthfully.      Another husband of mine, one I trusted so totally and never had any problems with, never doubted either, one day just disappeared.  For 31 days I didn't know where he was nor why he was there and I couldn't believe he'd left on purpose.  He also just up and left.  I found out later on that he was selfish and a coward and that he went back to his first wife ''just like that''.  We had been together for almost 4 years and I honestly believed it would be forever.  I was so stricken that I hardly ate and lost 30 pounds during those 31 days.  I lived on water and coffee and cigarettes and a cracker or an apple every so often, and not much else.  I was really sick at heart and mind, too depressed to eat.     Now, I've been married to a good man for 23 years, where did the time go ?  and I STILL know that he, or anybody, could just up and walk away any day if he took a mind to.      My honest and sincere advice to you  is to just close that door to this man in your mind and walk away and stay away.  Look at it  as a wonderful thing while it lasted and let it go at that.  I told you my story, part of it, because I know how hard and hurting it is, but the further it goes, the worse it gets.  I wish now that I'd cut my losses at the start and saved myself a whole lot of heartache.      There's someone else for you just around the next bend in the road.  Keep going.|`|DeWADdQaaa	if it's been happening just in one month, it may be another woman! a relationship doesn't just randomly take a turn for the worse, something triggers it! and i have a gut feeling yours may be female related :/|`|fXbjFHhzaa	people grow apart, its normal.  just be strong, he probably wasn't the one for you, you'll find the right guy eventually.
1up5ij4iaa	I did it and LOVED it.  We both love the song by Ricky Martin, "Shes all I ever had", and we had the song played with a guitar and keyboard when I walked down the aisle.  We had the song "Longer", by Dan Fogelberg for the girls to walk down the aisle.  We used the song "Here I Am", by Bryan Adams leaving the reception.  Everyone talked about how wonderful it was.      Also it is not tacky at all.  We had a black tie wedding and it could not have been more beautiful.  If you want email me and I can see if its possible to get the beginning of the video to you.  (I havent gotten it back yet, but I can request it.)|`|b7TueUUPaa	my best friend was married on january 3rd and she had Contemporary music. it was beautiful    its your day do what YOU want! ask your future spuse though!!|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	I wouldn't consider it tacky at all. I'm walking out to Sade, but considered several of new options like Beyonce & Jamie Foxx "When I First Saw You."  Mainly b/c my b/f said he knew when he saw me that I was the one, mimics the song's lyrics.  I think it can be done nice if you choose a sweet song that holds some significance. Beyonce's Halo might be a good contemporary choice, an old Mariah/Whitney Houston song might also work. If you like other genres of music just think of a sweet recent love song that represents the moment you walk down the isle.     www.WeddingWire.com has a great long list of songs to use during a ceremony a lot of them or contemporary songs. You might see something that would stick out to you.|`|AEOcAVcYaa	It's not tacky at all! It's YOUR day!! And, the music that you pick will be special to you and your fiance, so it will make it all the more beautiful. At least in my opinion. I fully intend to use contemporary music all through the ceremony, including when I walk down the aisle. So, if you want it, use it!|`|WzAHKILcaa	Not at all- I am walking down the isle to my 3 best friends singing "happiest girl in the whole USA" and when we walk back down once we're married it will be "when I'm 64" by the beatles.
WDs4fRoxaa	Take control back from them by giving them control.    Make them responsible for themselves.    Buy paper plates..color coded so you know which belongs to who.    Give them each their own time to wash laundry.    If they miss their allotted time...they will not have clean clothes.    Give them a list of chores..if the chores are not done...  they get no money...can not leave the house...get  their video games taken away...no cell phone...no  use of the house phone, etc...    If they still will not do what is expected...go in their rooms  and take what you wish away from them.    Any child that does not go to school gets a job and gets into  an alternative educational program.    Any child who acts violent gets the police called on them.    Any other offenses you deem worse...are cause to be filed unruly.    Best wishes|`|a8ced17abf52439ef9cae16ab57f4a2daa	Take lots and lots of deep breaths.  Talk to their school counselors, talk to other parents, talk to your parents, call social services and ask about teen and parent classes that may be available.      And keep your kids in the loop!  Let them know what you want: do you really know what you want?  What is your dream home situation with them, what is their dream home situation?  You do the digging for info and then involve them in fixing your home life TOGETHER.    You've got my sympathy as I've got 3 as well.  We mostly do well, but there are those times I think I'll go insane or feel like a failure. Thankfully those times are far and few between.  Mostly, I talk to them and let them know that though I'm not perfect, I'm willing to do ANYTHING to ensure we remain a close and loving family.|`|TqWXXZ34aa	YOu get a piece of construction paper and a red magic marker. You write a list of chores that they have to do every week. one chore per kid.  Example :  1. take out the trash  2.do the dishes  3. feed the dog/cat etc.  4. clean your rooms. Vacuum weekly,dust ,and clean your bathrooms.  5.If you take something out of the fridge you must put it away.  6.Put your dirty dishes in the dishwasher.  7.etc. """"""   Not doing any of these chores you will lose a Privileg.  1. Take away cell phone  2.No going out with friends  3.Lose of phone for the evening  4.no going out on the weekend.  5.Take there car keys away from them.  6.No video games for the night.  7.To your room.  8.etc"""""""    The reason why your teenagers disrespect you like this is because you never set any guidelines.And they know that "MOM" will clean up after them. They need to know that this isn't a free world. You need to start showing them that in life you need to work towards something in order to get better things.  You need to stop this behavior now be4 they continue to walk all over you and everyone else around them.    Be prepared they will laugh at you and be mean. But you hold your ground and laty down the law. You discipline them and follow through. You do everything in your power to make them listen and contribute to the house hold. YOU are not a MAID!|`|FVDTXM68aa	Sit them down and lay out the rules. Start taking privileges away (i.e. no going out or seeing the bf/gf until you help clean the house, no taking the car, no more allowance, no more shopping trips, no more eating out, etc.). That should whip them into shape! Or simply tell them that you will not pull their weight anymore; you are taking care of your things, and that's it! If they want laundry done, tough. If they need help on homework, tough. Make them learn that they are not allowed to treat their parents this way! It's a family for a reason! Everyone is a team! If things get worse, then seek a family counselor. Good Luck, Mama! :) You can do this!|`|4ssSgfYEaa	We take away the TV, game boy, etc.  When they act better, then they are ungrounded from the electronic toys!    If they like to eat, then they must do chores first!  Make an old fashioned chart of chores, so there is no mistake of who does what on what day.    No new clothes, or fun things for them, no privileges if they don't help.    Teenagers can drive you crazy!|`|MMxpuYfHaa	FOR SOME ODD REASON ONCE THEY BECOME TEENAGERS THEY THINK THE WORLD REVOLVES AROUND THEM , I ALSO HAVE 2 TEENS AN THEY ARE LAZY AS WELL , SO I MAKE THEM EARN EVERY THING THEY GET EVEN MEALS," I DONT COOK IN A DIRTY KITCHEN" AN "I DONT ALLOW THEM TO LEAVE A DISH AFTER THEY EAT" ,,,,, TRY BEING A LIL TOUGHER ON THEM AN THINGS SHOULD CHANGE ......

AA11765749	You don't really TELL them. It'd be kinda weird if you did. What I suggest is DOING things for them. You know, help out with a little chores, or LISTEN to them when they're speaking to you and respond (most teenagers don't). Also, ALWAYS remember special days such as their birthdays, or their anniversary. Planning something special for days such as this shows them that you care. Buying expensive gifts that they want or have had their eye on for a while helps too. Like, for Christmas, I wanted to show my mom how much I appreciated what she does for me, so I saved up a little money and bought her a Dolce and Gabbana perfume that she has wanted for 3 years. For the teenager/parent relationship, actions speak louder than words.|`|U0JYa0Fxaa	i don't.... last time i talk to them i told them to leave me the f alone
dZxjXHA2aa	Start really paying attention to how he talks about her and/or to her and how much.  He talks about her being a back stabber or a jerk, etc., you're safe, he's just still getting over whatever she put him through.  He puts her on a pedestal or comments on how she liked certain things, her favorite color, whatever, he's still into her.  If he talks about her at all after more than a month of being broken up, he needs to get over it and you need to move on to someone focused on YOU|`|NactmHwqaa	Does he roll over while you're sleeping and start pleasuring himself to a picture of his ex?|`|6wIfS0b9aa	if he doesnt talk to u like the way he used to then it may mean something.  u never know though.  boys r complicated.|`|1a370a32d49eb577cd4ab9146d28bdd0aa	ask him about it.  he shouldnt lie,|`|NoZAofgOaa	ask him?  listen to the way he answers you.   like was there hesitation,did he look you in the eyes when he answered.  was his voice shaky or cracked.|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Its never a Great wrong thing to remember the ex especially when its in a man life.It will actually helps in the long run for him to evaluate your presence in his life and shower the best towards you and that's all depends on you very much.|`|kG6VWsGvaa	If he brings her up in the conversation a lot.|`|Ly20pGC9aa	he probably does.  be straight forward with him.  and tell him you wont be mad at if he has  some type of feeling for her still.    hope it helps,  xoxo,  gee.|`|1593dcb1ac07c226ebcb09eead0d7fc4aa	r u hooking up with him?|`|ilbMPWmzaa	WAT EVidence do u have, dont jump to conclusions before talking to him about it. good luck|`|Mdv5lv8haa	akem if he had  choice between u and her who would he pic.....but act like your joking it made t easier for me to ask....|`|40qTdKuPaa	You wont know untill you ask him. When you are dating a person you should be able to talk to him about whatever is on your mind, and he should not judge you.So dont be scared, just ask him what you need to ask him, and if he lies, the truth is always revealed somehow and someway! hope this helps|`|B2pOra7laa	well if he keeps talking about her when you talk to him then he might miss her|`|jYMlAN4Paa	Ask him. Tell him to be honest.|`|6ca30cb50430766371c341c3ac305c90aa	Ask him. Easiest was to know.|`|tvOAeGAnaa	Your gut instinct is NEVER wrong! That is for sure. Go with your gut feeling!

There are lots more.|`|4rn3cGy0aa	ask him.|`|DVdl6ffPaa	Ask him. If you know him well enough you'll k now if he's lying. If your afraid to ask then it obviously doesn't bother you enough.|`|KWWU4ajzaa	check his texts, look at his myspace, ask him,ask around (:        ? IM SORRY ?|`|SWusuL12aa	If  he is constantly talking about her in a more than friends way then yea he misses her. If he passes up opportunities to be with u in order to please her then that is also a sign. But asking is the best way to be sure|`|iqxNk5Wnaa	if he still has her number in his phone and if he mentions her quite alot saying eitha negative or postitive things|`|AppQtFkfaa	Then you should talk to him like friends, not like a couple.

Good Luck|`|d33bcbd593928814e3f161d896536701aa	asking him wont work, he couldnt tell u the truth and even if u do u wouldnt believe him why? simply because if he does he wont tell you cus he might not want to hurt you, and if he doesnt you wont believe him cus of the reason that got you to ask this question here. So ill recommend to watch for any strange behavior, or see if he mentions her a lot, or try to make comparisons between you and her, but if he havent done anything and is just you imagining things then just trust him|`|T18Z2sGRaa	You will see changes in his behavior if he is thinking of someone else. He will not be as close to you as he once was. He will not call as often as he did. He will feel distant and distracted. He will be silent when he was once talkative.     Most people think about their ex's. It's human nature. But if he is comparing what he thought he had with her to what he has with you... Then you'd only benifit yourself by putting him out to the curb and getting someone who cares about you as much as you care about them. Life is too short to settle. And everyone deserves more than that.
6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	Actually, I've heard of this being done before. I think you should ask around to different jewelers before you buy your engagement ring so you can know if you can upgrade. The design of my set would make that a little hard, but yours maybe not. There shouldn't be a problem though, it would be good to know how much the prices for a new diamond would be and how much the jeweler will charge to re-set your ring. Actually, I was under the impression that changing diamonds/doing upgrades can be considered a great anniversary gift.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	It depends on the exact setting but most settings can accommodate the switch to a larger diamond.    Why not just get another diamond ring (for your other hand) when the money is available?|`|6r6Laeozaa	So let me get this straight, you don't like the ring your boyfriend/fiancee gave you?    Last time I checked the engagement ring is a symbol of love.    If my gf didn't like the engagement ring that I give her, well I would assume that she is more materialistic, and I would not be proposing to her.    Lucky for me, my gf will love any ring I give her.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	yes you can always "upgrade" a ring you just won't have it for a week or so|`|nujen4dmaa	Hi Nicole,    Why don't you give Tacori or a jeweler that stocks Tacori a call and ask them.      They maybe able to just change the head to accommodate a bigger stone down the road.  I don't know how elaborate the setting is that you are looking at so I can't say for sure if it can be done.  You might like to ask if they are even willing to do it.      As Tacori is rather high end, I don't think I would be willing to mess with the setting.    If you are sure you are going to upgrade the original stone why don't you start out with a cheaper setting.    If you plan on upgrading also make sure you buy the stone from someone who is willing to upgrade later on.    Many online vendors have upgrade policies.  http://www.whiteflash.com and http://www.engagementringsdirect.com are examples of online vendors that offer this service.      IdealD
0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	A friend w/benefits can certainly become more serious. The most successful relationships start out as friends first.    Yes, guys experience emotions/feelings with sex. For the more mature guys, sex is an expression of love. For the less mature, sex is proof of how good the guy is and does not require emotions or feelings, just his ego and a few body parts. These are the guys who treat their partners like objects who are there to give them pleasure.|`|WV36m31Zaa	women use sex to get love,, men use love to get sex
tfTQ6Cuuaa	Try a fruit smoothie. They are more like milkshakes and you could add in vanilla ice cream to make it smoother. Have you tried fruit yogurts? Do you take vitamins? Ask if they would be willing to try either of those options first.    Are you overweight? They are probably just concerned. If you start an exercise program and lose some weight you may be able to talk yourself out of this one.|`|yYgsyopAaa	First off, water doesn't contain nutrients, so, blah to that point. Second, do you eat jello? Put fruit in it to mask the flavor...wait...flavor...hmm, what kind of jello, kool aid, lifesavors, etc do you like? Cuz most food like that comes in fruit flavors ~ cherry, lemon, lime, strawberry, whatever. If you like the flavors, you should be able to eat the fruit.    You can always take vitamins...although the chewable kind come in fruit flavors...hmm...
XjBKV2ohaa	Give your friend a few days to cool off.  Then tell her you screwed up and you're sorry, and that you don't want to hurt your friendship.  Whether she forgives you or not is up to her, but you will need to be genuine with her either way.  I wouldn't expect to be able to fix this by tomorrow.    It is much easier to lose someone's trust than it is to gain it back.  It will take time - maybe months of being consistently responsible - for you to demonstrate to your parents that you have become trustworthy.

BUT, there is a possibility that the guy will eventually like you.. so you never know. so yeah, you're just so close that you can relate to each other like brothers and sisters would.|`|C02ASCzpaa	Sometimes, guys are just nice.  It's not an angle or a front.  For guys, friend can have a lot of different meanings.  Sister is a good one.  (Girl)friend is another option.  He sounds like a good-hearted guy that you should be able to trust.|`|6DNCqunDaa	He must of thought you never liked him very much or he just never liked you. I know a couple people that just come across as friends and I would just look at like a sister. He never wanted a relationship with you or thought you didnt want one with him and did not want to get shut down.|`|sB2MvRR5aa	He probably just really respects you and doesn't like you in that way. That's not a bad thing! I think it's really great to have a guy friend. I think he might feel that way for a few reasons... he might like older girls, he's gay, he doesn't like girls yet, your not his type, he's shy, he respects you too much to like like you, he does like like you but hides it orrr he likes someone else.|`|1JjZZ7mlaa	To be completely honest with you.  I am this guy.  This kind of reaction will stem from when you have become friends and he has become so close to you, in helping you out with problems and other stuff that he doesn't feel for you in a romantic way anymore.  Trust me, I am a big brother to many people.|`|Gv6UW2p2aa	All it means is that he likes you but not in a romantic way.  There's a big difference between a freshman & a junior.  To him you're still too young to be close friends or dating, but he still likes your personality.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	Well the fact that you're younger is probably the first clue.

23c0c10dbc7c5d1840f5c4de91f1c424aa	Your premise is not true!  I could ask the opposite question. The real question is:  Why would you allow your partner to demand that you not get a break, a rest, some alone time, time off, time out, some space?    Mutual respect is necessary.|`|o503YPrqaa	Depends on each persons physical activities at work and at home. Also depends on age.|`|OdyhybhQaa	because it is usually thought that men should do the hardest work since they have stronger bodies than women. and many husbands doesnt want their wives to do strenous work because maybe they love them or maybe because of pride.|`|YeChwo70aa	Definitly know what you mean! ugh|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	My husband's not like that.

I'm a sahm and my kids can wear me out but he's in the military and has a very demanding (physically and mentally) job.

When I first met my fiance I laid the rules down. From day one I made it clear that we were not in 1942 and I was not going to be some wife slave. I give him chores to do. He is allowed to be tired and rest so long as what needs to be done is done. I give him simple things to do like the trash or a small load of dishes. He also respects me and allows me to rest too. Men tend to think they work all day and that they typically work harder than women. Not all  men think this way though. You should try sitting him down and talking with him. Tell him that you are a team and that you deserve a rest as well. That when you love each other you wouldn't want to see each other suffering or doing all the work around the house. Maybe set up a schedule to where you each have equal days to "rest". Communication is one of the biggest parts of a relationship. If he Truly cares and loves you than he will understand your feelings. My sister went through a similar problem. Her husband would wake her up early every weekend to get up with the kids. Its not healthy to be in a relationship that is not equal. Good luck and remember that not all men are like that.|`|b9791c0d942f7d7caa7f70d6161e349caa	what does it mean to be "allowed to be tired" you are either tired or you are not .you need no ones consent for that.  do you mean that when you are tired, you may not be up to some task that he wants you to get done, or activity that he wants you to participate in and he is less likely to offer you grace when you  are not up to it?   its hard to comment without more specifics.   but both spouses should offer one another grace. but sometimes we need to suck it up and "git er done".|`|AkTw3RQuaa	Good question  Only a man can answer this question'  Listen to this..I had the flu and had to cook,clean, wash clothes, & watch the kids  I was home from work  Next time I will drag my *** to work  I get more rest at work!|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think it because you women allow us to.

(:|`|BE2vknbHaa	You should never tattoo anyone's name anywhere on you and if you were to do that put it somewhere more classy then your butt.They are way better things that are more sentimental to give people besides their name on your butt.|`|TT6Nk0JNaa	Not me. If you break up with him messily some day, do you really want to have to have a tattoo removed from THERE?|`|M82QkRSLaa	lmfaoooo.. def go for it if yu love him why not? if yu get divorced whos gonna see it anyway? .. and if yu get re maried  get an x tattooed over it and yur new husbands name below it lmao|`|Y08YLysXaa	Haha, I think it's great! Why marry someone if you feel like having their name on you forever is too long or too risky. Marriage is meant to be forever. I think he'll be totally surprised and flattered. Just don't get it on your lower back or those typical places, looks trashy.    Just dont get this... http://www.rankmytattoos.com/f/uploads/s... lol|`|363YPQ62aa	Oh it will be a surprise all right lol don't do it it's never a good idea|`|AkTw3RQuaa	HELL NO  Nothing lasts forever  You will be stuck with this tattp 4ever\Painful corrctive measure will be taken  Halle Berry had David Justice's name made into a flower, after their divorce  Is he tattooing your  name on his body  1 month..girl you crazy  Wake up from this nighmare|`|eXj6Ro5Raa	Bad idea. Never mark your body with a man's name. You never know what the future has in store for you.|`|cwmcALJyaa	His name isn't Bob is it?  - just think only have to tat the 2 Bs hahaha. ; )|`|DqUXn5wFaa	have it done in ALL CAPS THAT'LL SURELY MAKE A STATEMENT!    Good luck, and make sure to always leave it smooth!|`|joA5Rcyzaa	that is a dumb idea|`|Xpj8Mn2laa	Sounds cool :) Maybe get it in a fancy script (most tattoo places have books full of fonts) You could also get the date you got married tattooed on to your wrist/neck/butt - could get it in roman numerals.   Great idea!!  My partner got my name and our daughters name on his arm and designed a tribal like pattern to go around it.|`|PUUXbVK2aa	"happy valentines day honey! some random guy/girl tattooed your name on my ***!"|`|AA10568019	I don't like tattoos, but if your husband thinks they're cute then maybe it's OK.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	It depends on how your hubby feels about tattoos.  Not all men like tattoos and not all would like to see themselves on their wife's ***.      Feel it out first.  Kinda drop subtle hints or ask him hypothetical questions jokingly about it--to see if he'd be into it.  Because trust me, you don't want to get a tat like then and then find out he hates it and now he has to look at it for the rest of his life.  You'll probably only get one position from then on.  ;-)|`|utQC6dhjaa	i don't think branding yourself is ever a good idea...  sorry|`|EnBhiRp3aa	classy.....|`|2b262d236b57238a4521e83f95a4b9feaa	Don't do it.

180db111cb7c264e5bd192d677bd9c1faa	Stephanie, Stephanie, the things you young ladies get yourselves into is just amazing to me.      He will cheat on you,  1.  Anytime you get a man while he's with another woman, be assured, he has no compunction about moving onto someone else even while he's with you.  Your questions about trust should have been foremost in your mind when you moved in on the other woman's man.       2, this man has no respect for you whatsoever.  He called you an a**hole among other things.  He blew up at you for asking a perfectly valid question.  There is no honor in this man.  What are you doing with him in the first place.      In the harshest way possible I'm going to suggest to you that you pack your bags and get the hell out of Dodge while you still can and that you have no contact with him at all.  This is not Daddy material at all.  If you miscarry, it might be better then bringing this man's offspring into the world.|`|NqbBjS0raa	Way too much drama for a young family without any marriage recourse rights. I can put it another way why are you two still  together? It's time to grow up or quit playing house as a couple. Temper, temper and the babies are going to be born right around him before you know it. That is unless you decide it's time to call it move on to a more peaceful life without this bf stress. His past don't speak volumes for him and the cure is way too much work if he is that defensive. Besides he won't turn that corner for you and the babies. It's too much fun having the fun on the side and a slowed down wife who can't prove much other than innuendos. Name calling always shows his class and he was thrown out of  anger management classes due to getting too hostile. Seriously you have a loser in your mix with a capital L.......|`|rh12tX8Naa	The question you asked him was an honest question that should be answered without attitude. It sounds like he's guilty about something because he was defensive about it. You shouldn't worry about this bull ****. There's a baby inside of you and that's all you should care about. Distant yourself from him. That's what i had to do with my baby's father. He was stressing me out HARDCORE. I haven't talked to him in a couple weeks and i'm so much happier.|`|JyWCPVfzaa	You need to remember one thing and one thing only:  A cheater's always a cheater!|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	your both in need of growing up.  i weep for the future.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	I agree... you both really need to step back and really look at yourselves.  He is a known cheater, and will continue to do so. His behavior in your statement indicates that he will certainly continue to do so. He just admitted guilt.  You should not be making babies with this lout.     The answer? Get him to go with you down to the county courthouse for a civil marriage ceremony... it is cheap and gives you more legal rights. It also gives you an answer as to whether or not he ever intends to do right by you. If he refuses, you need to move on.
KpEayiqcaa	i would be at her side taking care of her   :)|`|COmp4sIuaa	Haha, I don't feel anything unless she's either seriously ill or I care about her. If you're asking if it's a turn-off, no, not really, because I don't plan on sticking my tongue down her throat when she's infectious.|`|wnI04x8Kaa	if she cant hang I can find someone who can|`|b7gUW0CRaa	oh yeah i notice.i feel really sad|`|bNx1q5oWaa	of course , if you really like a person you're gonna notice lots of changes|`|UiWbfi3Raa	i don't feel so good about it and it makes me feel that i made it happen but i didn't.if i don't know about it and she's not at school i worry a lot|`|zCS9KpIWaa	If I like her and shes not in school then yeah I feel left out at least when I think about her.    Please Answer Mine http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|0ZGcpe60aa	i'm a girl, but wow this is such a good question! :]|`|SZnU7RXuaa	if ure close to her tlk to her|`|CNDdRFR2aa	yeah i was gonna ask this girl out but she was sick the day i wanted to so i had to wait. holy $@&  mother  %@ er i $ @&ing hate her she rejected me that little  &@$ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but she is a very nice girl so i felt sympathy for her being sick|`|9TofcXJWaa	i can always tell when my baby aint feelin right. i cant stand to see her sick so i take care of her|`|cf7CUClpaa	yes   because if i really like her  than i have probably realize it   as soon as i see her.  when u like someone u usually like to know what they doin and what they thinkin so yea he should know|`|6YeexwvAaa	Guys should notice. There's a fine line between being caring and being like "Wow, you look like Hell."     It's a perfect time for a guy to put on some charm.|`|oMIxJTO1aa	I hate when my girlie is sick, so of course i notice..her health is very important to me. Hard when you are away and cant pamper and take care of her, but when your together and shes sick all that matters is makn her comfortable, and tending to and spending time with her till shes back to 100%, i think its important to be there when your partner isnt themselves or feeling well.|`|sk0FHA0Qaa	well personally, I would stay around all day to be with her and help her and take care of her :p and make her feel special|`|AA11637257	Like doing everything I can to make her feel better|`|SX8z9Zg0aa	I feel pretty normal.  I know for sure because this is happening to me right now.|`|qtWrgLs5aa	Most would definitely agree that it makes the guy feel incredibly sad or helpless....    And of course he is bound to notice... if he pays that much attention to you (as he does if he likes you) then he can definitely notice if something is wrong or you aren't feeling well.|`|jgZYmkJFaa	depends on how sick she was. if it was minor than i would go and visit and stuff but if it was serious like ebola than i would go nowhere near her. but i would still feel bad for her.
q89VjD62aa	OK hun! Take a deep breath and relax. The good thing to kno is, that's all in the past its over. And as for being popular WHO CARES! I'm done with school and in college. Popular kids are lame and mean to a lot of nice kids. Why would you want to be just like everyone els? You are your own person and have you own gifts. You'll make new friends be brave be confident. And as for the kids you don't like the best way to get someone to stop picking on you is to show them no emotion at all. Just walk away from them. You don't need kid like that in your like. Grad skool and middle school was horrioble for me as well. But high school and the real world is not like that. People grow up and at the age u are now kids tend to think there (excuse me but) hot Sh%t cause their getting older. Don't let them get to you. Believe that your awesome and cool and show that you're brave outgoing and confident in yourself but don't act like your better than anyone. I'm my eyes everyone is an equal. You will make new friends. Trust me. Let those other kids be that way and don't care. You do not need that. Theirs the ones acting like little kids. Not you. Best of luck hope this helps|`|7a3AkKVTaa	Get over it.  Move on.   It's your past for a reason.|`|b9791c0d942f7d7caa7f70d6161e349caa	most of these problems will go away when the rest of your brain develops, (21 years) until then consider this. God put your butt on your back side, so that you would leave your crap behind you.
4PKpQVxEaa	It really does sound like he likes you and it may be hard to let him down easy if he asks you to be his girlfriend. Just tell him that you value the friendship you have with him too much to move onto another level. Tell him that you don't think you should get involved with a guy in highschool for whatever reasons you have.    Just tell him how much you care about him and that you'll always be there for him. Shy guys are usually more sensitive and you don't want him to completely detach himself from you, right?      Hope it all works out! ^___^|`|jqhvxWzGaa	just tell him, with words. be clear and be strong. he'll continue to beg you. if the begging bothers you, tell him to stop or you can't be friends any more. seriously, it might sound a little mean, but being as clear and direct as you can is what's best for him as well as you.|`|Pt9SRn6Jaa	well first you need to make sure he likes you before you make a big deal out of nothing.then if you know he likes you try drawing some lines without being mean and hurting his feelings.and if he still doesnt get the picture then you have to tell him that your not really interested in a relationship.thats better than just saying your not interested in him.|`|0to7XkTzaa	tell him i think your a really nce guy, but quite honestly im not into the whole bf thing yet.... lets just get to be really close friends, then we'll go from there|`|DAeuUBqnaa	alright, clearly he has interest in you.  but if you really want to set things straight..just tell him straightforward. If you try to give him a sign, he might misunderstand it  so just say...  "i know your interested in me and all, but i'm not ready to date. your a really great guy. but i prefer if we stay friends since we have a really good friendship. i dont wanna ruin it"  say it nicely and he'll probably understand|`|TtVk8S4aaa	you should tell him what your feeling about express yourself!! just stick with him as best guy friends then when you are older do the stuff you do like be bf|`|DYd1Builaa	are you crazy i have a bf and i am in middle school k so...... i mean there is nothing wrong with having one i mean there great and if hes cute and u like him i say go for it|`|40qRRVDWaa	maybe you should try it out, you never know, but of course if your heart says no, follow it!  i mean u might as well try  it out, but if you'd rather not, just casually say idk, like idk if i would want a commitment  now like if u hear someone else is going out and u too are talking about it , idk be casual to give him a hint|`|pIkPHuWyaa	Be honest with him that you like him as a friend, but nothing more.  If he wants to be friends with you, he will understand.  If he continues to pursue you even after you have told him no, then I would kick him to the curb.|`|oVXNsu54aa	Just when your friends talk about him in a mean way stick up for him by saying STOP! My friends always talk about my other best friend and today i just yelled at them to STOP that it was really mean because he doesnt have many friends. For the other guy who likes you just let him know that right now you are at a friendship level with him.    Hope it helps.|`|TQHHH7kxaa	if you like him as a friend and keep him as friend going in further can ruining your friendship and can turn sour fast|`|AgiwOGbUaa	Tell him what you've said here about yourself. If he can't accept that then he isn't really a friend and was just some guy after  what you're not ready to share.|`|wnI04x8Kaa	Stop being friends with him, only a girl thinks it is possible to have a friend of the opposite sex. Trust me you would be doing him a favor you you just quite being friends with him and sending him mixed signals let him move on and find someone who really dose like him|`|hlXxuOOTaa	if you dont likehim too then just be friends. if so, get it on.|`|BQGHIoIqaa	tell him your not ready for a commitment
6wxgyGy5aa	Tell the person that it meant a lot to you and your husband that they could be there to share your special day.  Also make sure to thank them for whatever gift they gave...and make sure you personalize it.  Don't say "Thanks for the gift"...instead say "Thank you for the lovely....."  People love to know that their card is made specially for them and isn't just a quick note repeated to everyone.|`|W0hNoMSsaa	(Name of groom) and I were so happy that you could be with us to share our special day.|`|AA11320495	for Thank You card wordings visit :  http://www.weddingcardshoppe.com/thanks-...
TVcvkC4baa	well it depends on what you already talked to her about. Well maybe you could talk about the bancds that are old and new, movies, fruits, vegtables.... Random things make a girl laugh!|`|dz7ZepS4aa	Ask her what she wants to do in the future. Or if there was a few dreams she could fufill what they would be|`|PBO836YBaa	Ask her about her life. there is nothing I hate more then when a guy is all into himself. and ask questions about what she says. stay involved|`|AhtaOu9aaa	let it flow talk about whatever comes to mind...your life ...her life...great movies...great songs...the more natural the conversation the better and more comfortable shell feel|`|7I8gNo9Taa	honestly? i would like to talk with a guy that knows about cars and motorcycles, but if she doesnt care about that stuff, maybe just what's going on in her life|`|TtVk8S4aaa	anything you come up with

Penelope Cruz (Iberian Spanish) dated Tom Cruise.  Selma Hayek dated Ed Norton.    So, yes it does exist. However, it depends on the type of Latina. If she is diverse and open-minded then yes. If she likes to stick to her own, then no.
JyWCPVfzaa	Because you are 14 and a minor. Do you know in how much trouble your parents could get if they get caught letting you drink? Do you even have an idea?? It doesn't matter what other parents do with their kids, your parents are responsible enough not to let YOU drink. What is drinking anyway? It tastes yucky and makes you feel like a mack truck ran you over the next day! It's not even worth it! Enjoy being your age. Do things a responsible teenager would do for fun. Growing up too fast will make you miss a lot of fun things. There is no such thing as turning back time and that's what you'd want to do if you try to grow up too fast.|`|ScHW4842aa	The only way I would drink at 14 was getting up in the middle of the night and going to the bar in the lounge, drinking all the whisky and then filling it up with coke diluted with water to look the same colour.     funny huh?|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	You are still wet behind the ears and your parents exhibit great parental  guidance and most of all love. Actually I think it is trashy to see someone your age drinking.Why oh why would you want to drink like that.Are the others trashy people?If they are you need new friends.|`|rh12tX8Naa	YOU'RE 14!!! Legal drinking age is 21. It shows they care. If something happened to you, guess what....your parents will get in trouble. I wouldn't let my 14 yr old drink.|`|UMg1CL7baa	I dont blame her for not letting you drink. she can go to jail for it. And unless you have been drunk before you wont know how you are. I have friends who lost their virginity for being too drunk. I have a friend who almost died because he was too drunk. I have a friend who got his head stuck in a car door when he was drunk. Being drunk is not all fun and games. You need to really know what your doing. You cant just drink and expect it to be all happy. Its not always a happy expierence. I have had my share of great times drunk and bad times drunk. Personally, id rather not drink too much.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Because you are too young to drink. It is their job to keep you safe. They are being responsible and you should not drink.|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	your 14.  your parents could go to jail if they let you drink.  and your 14.|`|R0M1WCmZaa	"Michael" is right anwser..you can wait until you are 21 years old :)|`|BE2vknbHaa	For starters its illegal.Your parents are apparently sane and good parents compared to what your friends have.|`|6KdOLvTvaa	1. you're 14  2. what's so fun about getting drunk seriously?  3. you've probably learned all the consequences in health so why do it?    and your parents could get in major trouble|`|180db111cb7c264e5bd192d677bd9c1faa	Wren, the answer is that you're 14, just like Michael and the rest have said.      The other reason why your mother is not letting your drink is because she's smarter that the rest of the parents and she probably loves your more than any of the other parents love their children.      The situation is this Wren.  You are not finished growing physiologically or hormonally yet.  Alcohol will definitely mess with your biological make up at this time.  Not only that it will impair a lot of your brain functions.  This is why it is not appropriate for you to drink at this time.      I doubt that her decision is all about being responsible or not but about your health.      Hug her for her concern.|`|xO0IjDpNaa	i think someone wants to grow up to fast. your only 14!|`|b7c904040c8591e1ed0462db83098f2aaa	You are underage, not only is it unhealthy it is ILLEGAL.

Read This:  http://www.liverinfo.org.uk/AboutYourLiv...  http://www.imperfectparent.com/topics/20...|`|IdZMRz7zaa	Well, I started Drinking when I was 12 years old.. Biggest Mistake of my life. I am pretty much an Alcoholic now.   My parents never let me drink OBVIOUSLY.     Your parents obviously care about you, and do not want you to drink.  They are being good Parents, Whether you want to believe it or not.  I know you think oh I hate my parents, they wont let me do what I want.. It's my life, they should just let me do what I want..  Well, If your parents didn't care about you they would let you drink.. Be happy that you have such great parents, seriously..  You will understand why they do that when you get a little older Hun.  Take it from someone who has been through it. If I could go back in time and choose not to drink, choose not to try and be cool or fit in with everyone else.. Because it is the "Grown Up" thing to do..  It's not cool. It doesn't make you look older.  I'm sure your friends will be just as happy if you didn't drink.. and if they don't then they are not your real friends.|`|isCTS30Kaa	Your 14!! so what if your friends drink their parents should go to jail you have to be 21 and over|`|omqS0q5Naa	BECAUSE YOUR 14 hello!!!!!!!!!!There is absolutely know way I would ever ,ever let one of my kids be at a keg-ger party and defiantly not drink at 14.You can find lots of positive ways to spend your time.You don't have to follow the crowed.You could set an example.|`|NgkkzBOEaa	It is completely legal for 14-year-olds to drink, assuming they have their parent's permission.  Your Mom probably won't allow you to drink because she is simply afraid of the concept of you drinking, not the actual alcohol.  I just want to emphasize that it is only legal if your parents are present, and if you have their permission.|`|3SYnZEZ9aa	Your parents need to wear out your little 14 year behind and quit letting you hang out with those other kids!  Tell you what, you better be happy I'm not your daddy there boy.  Fact, I'm fixing to figure out how to get in touch with your dad.|`|AqvEHHsTaa	your responsibility isn't the issue.  Your body is still growing at 14 and alcohol will damage your brain and other vital organs.  Your brain can't understand completely or comprehend this because your brain isn't really mature (finished growing) until at least 25 years of age.  Your mom is acting responsible for you.  Not to  mention that it is very illegal for a minor of your age to be caught drinking.  They just sentenced a mom last year for 5 years for allowing her daughter to have a keg party at her house.
xoDPMdtyaa	Well in my opinion just forget him.  I've had to many girls that i have like that just don't give me a straight answer. in time you will realize that hes not the best guy in the world and you will move on.  i mean seriously forget the creep..........and if he likes someone else let him crash and burn when he realizes that this Hannah girl might not like him.  Honestly i think that would be funny. So just forget him and move on.|`|IRAtmZhTaa	u can't make someone like u   if he doesn't like u, as hard as it is, u have got to get over him|`|BwNiS2Hmaa	it happens...forget about it and move on|`|BQGHIoIqaa	forget about him|`|47jMXUkkaa	get over him by likeing another guy|`|LeoazSyAaa	foget him look for sombody new|`|SKkb4xNiaa	it's really bad when that happened this only happened 1 time to me but i forget all about it at it really work if you tried and think it this way it would really work there's to many mans on this world you are not going to die for one think it this way and you will really forget all about that shiet(boy that you have crush with).|`|iCI1rwdBaa	i know this might be hard cuz you like him but i think you should break up with him....if he doesn't like you then what is the point of going out with him?  hope that helped.....good luck :)|`|RRTTWtxOaa	sorry you have to move on...  hey...u might be lucky...cause my crush didn't like me back..so then i moved on...i like someone else...turns out my ex-crush likes me back!!|`|TtVk8S4aaa	maybe forget him or just tell what your feeling about or dose he like you? something like that

Believe me - it is AWESOME to not be married.    And you don't need to apologize to anyone for wanting to have sex with any women. Only a MARRIED / ATTACHED man apologizes for that.    Here's how it works:    If I am NOT in a relationship with a woman...   I can sleep with whomever I want whenever I want.  And she can NEVER call me "a cheater" for that.    Some women will "try" but they always FAIL.  Because it's not "a relationship" yet.    That's why I NEVER get into "a relationship" for at least 3-6 months. Why would I? I don't even KNOW the girl. Dating only. Dating is the period of time you can selectively look around for whoever you want, without having to apologize to anyone else.    Since you are getting married.... you don't want to put your fiancee in the position of calling you a "cheater". Either don't have sex with her sister... or dump her and DO have sex with her sister.    Those are your choses.  And you can smile about it.... because you didn't give your fiance the chance to call you "a cheater". That really makes women MAD.    Too bad.

DqzhHZnoaa	take a look at yur picture then come back to me.    not all guys are like that, and if you took the time to put a shirt on and take a decent picture, yu'd find a good one.|`|z6SWHngRaa	I know!!!! I ask myself this every day!! Why do good guys have to be SO rare??? I  wish we could get it through their heads that.....ugh. You know. :( I wish that, too.|`|a3ce5dcedd3e461806ec66bb0ac57aa3aa	Some men are just JERKS!!! They wouldn't know a good woman if she punched him in the face!!!!|`|OFGV2Jj2aa	well, you just need to find the right guy, whenever I go out with a girl, its usually for a near 2 year period, we never have sex or make out exessivly or anything, Im gussing all your finding is guys that dont really like you, that or they are stupid and get bored too fast. (those guys will never get a real realationship btw.)  good luck|`|WnmrkIPvaa	Guys are loving...well a good amount of them and the others just have a hard way of showing it....  but if your patient you will realize there are some great guys out there waiting for you and they dont always want you to be there playboy bunny for them....      you should answer my question i posted please!!!|`|AA10025824	You may be shopping in the wrong place, that's all.  We're the same as you and want pretty much the same thing, once we are mature enough to realize it.  So hold out and you'll get what you want.|`|rurfFLDkaa	i dont know why most women see every guy the same lol. im not like that i actually had respect for my last girl and went at her pace.|`|OiUiEMr0aa	yeah that would be awsome...if i could snuggle with my girlfriend at the end of the day and go to sleep, cept she is in italy >.|`|2vazHHXeaa	Give guys who are only interested in looks no reason to like you.    Dress plainly.|`|dyV5gDx3aa	Ill be completely honest, this is not true. Its just finding the right guy that is the real trouble. Ive never treated a girl as an object, but as an equal, someone ive cared about. I avoid dating chicks i have nothing in common with. I do show my girlfriends that I care and I do it simply because I mean it. Most teenagers and guys just do it as a means of simplicity because they havent grown out of the "OH IVE SLEPT WITH ALL THESE CHICKS" phase. Its all on the upbringing I guess. My parents were always telling me about the "right way" to treat girls and others. I really do thank them for that as it provides for a great relationship, a true love if I were to say it.    Simple solution to finding a guy of that caliber is to simply NOT give in and not have sex with him. If hes a guy who waits and doesn't keep pressuring you, it seems to be a guy who values you and a long-term relationship. Dont let these "guys" and years make you believe that all guys are in it for the sex. Their are guys out there who value all that you want. I am one of them and while I maybe single atm, its not because im a loser or anything but just because Im pickier about who i date seeing as how i value longer and more meaningful relationships.    Well I hope this helps and raises your thoughts on us guys.    Good Luck finding the one! You will find the "Mr. Right" and you will know it. Just give it some time|`|f2351df7f1503426fe917ae40eb8a8a2aa	a lot depends wat kind of guys a person has been wid...ur askin where r da good guys...but trust me...  way i've seen around...95% gals go for da wrong guy...n not da guy she shud be dating...cos somehow da wrong side...da brash side attracts em....n da guy she shud be dating...always ends up being their best friend for life...  she wud share every small..every imp thing wid him...but..wud never consider him da bf category...  after getting hurt...from her bf...she wud always go 2 her best guy friend...n pour her heart out..n wen shes done....she'l be fine n da friend wud b cussing himself...as she shud be wid him..but wud never ever consider him...  da same story goes for guys.....  n someday in life...wen u realise dat da love u been searching for...da person who'd understand u..is nowhere else but right besides u....till den it gets too late...for da love inside dat guy also fades...for wanting n wanting..waiting n waiting for her 2 realise dat he's there...  as for sex...da guy who straight away comes 2 it....u got 2 judge him before u even wanna go out wid him...  y am sayin dis............  cos i've been sme1's best friend for 9 years...n a pain reliever for her till today...|`|oiyugIE0aa	The guy I am with is actualy very loving....but it is very rare to come across guys like that... :||`|9ataTglwaa	AMEN!!! i agree with everything of that!! oh my i wish they could be like that! but only in fairytales.|`|YpeYdRsmaa	men like this are very rare|`|UkpBCpk4aa	ahaha, clearly your targeting the wrong men, and there all kinds of normal people who like what you do( Me :) )  I think this is coming down to how sexy the person is, but if thats a big factor for your dating then thats a bit of a problem im not saying lower your standereds but don't have sex with the hotest guy, you know what im sayin meet someone with your likings and don't just go to a party for a booty call.|`|DlGV1xv9aa	the guys who are loving are too much of pussys to ask girls out... thats just what it is
kSlN7MjEaa	Yes she does like you .  But she is playing games.  She is only 17 she has a lot of power over guys.  She doesnt want pinning down - she's young and she wants to have fun.  Dont take its so seriouslly because she's not.  You're another guy who likes her this makes her feel good so go along with it but be cool dont make it obvious you are dead keen on her. She can play games so turn her down sometimes say you have to rush off - you are going out - dont be so available anytime she feels like it.  Dont let her do your head in.|`|hjvwMgKoaa	All I had to do was read the first paragraph to know that she totally likes you!!! And when I read the rest she really does like you!!!

Move on|`|XsSMIdBtaa	it would make me sad, becasue it seems he doesn't like me any more|`|lOkWLI9Caa	Sad.   I  think my heart would drop. I would not feel he loves me. I would probably try to let that guy go.....wait.........unless he gives thought to lt and regrets not kissing me. I think the only thing that would make me truly happy at this point is if, when I least expect it, he surprises me and grabs me by giving me this long passionate kiss.     Oh, wait, that sounds too much like the theater...........|`|y8jIXgOdaa	OUCH, soooooo sad!!!!!!|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	it would make me feel embarrassed that I even asked him something like that.   Good gosh girl, he's over you, get over him.    And he's right, when it's someone you don't love a kiss is just a kiss.     Move on.|`|XRn0Ai3Naa	Im sure he still has love for you but doesn't love you. Im sure that will hurt because i always told guys that i had love for them but didn't love them. If some one tole me that i couldn't kiss them in your situation yeah it will make me feel sad and mad  but you also need to realize that you guys aren't together anymore and you really need think maybe he still loves you but if he kisses you in will hurt him because he still wants to be with you. Hope i helped.|`|MjkDTovqaa	I wouldn't ask them that question.    I would just assume already they didn't want to, because they weren't.  And no I would NOT think they still loved me.    In fact if I still felt that way about them KNOWING they didn't still feel the same way, I would distance myself from them,  why torture yourself?    I don't deserve to be tortured, if I have learned nothing else in this life, it is that.|`|QaFpVkIXaa	sad. crushed like glass.|`|x3istER1aa	sad|`|yngXCPjEaa	Sad : (|`|Isl4B5rYaa	heart broken|`|qAgF5R3Yaa	he's probably over you and not trying to go down that road again.  when you two broke up it hurt him and he's not trying to be hurt again so he's just standing his ground and not letting his feelings get in the way of your friendship with him.  trust me he wants to kiss you though.|`|vhraHxtNaa	neither. you should be happy that they didn't lie to you and say they missed kissing you because it would just make you think they still had feelings for you when in fact they didn't. the way i see it is you should be happy that you didn't stay in a relationship were the other person didn't love you and that now you have another shot at finding your true love...|`|3RDOPzGeaa	sad VERY VERY sad :(
BY6OSDSeaa	kinda sounds like she doesnt really like either of you and shes just a flirty person|`|yRpS6mNbaa	it could be  a sign that she likes you  but then again it wasnt my ear she was whispering in  but i dunno  ask  find out|`|FIFoGNIxaa	Ummmm, I don't think it matters if she's a senior. I've dated ppl  older than me. In my opinion she might not like either of you. If she's an honest person than it could be different.|`|Y7dgRyJAaa	she doesnt like either of you..shes a senior...she should be dating guys her own age...as should you
IyfLPrJHaa	Thats VAGUE information sorry. I would say in my honest opinion as a girl and had dealt with exes she is just trying to be nice and be a friend..if you really want to know ask or ask her out on a casual date|`|SoFeInwKaa	She just wants to be friends. [:|`|1GxMGmkqaa	if she text back then you're in! and if the texts are back and forth then i'd say youre in! give her a chance and see what happens....  good luck!|`|8ltKj9VKaa	i think that shes probably still being nice to you and that shes just trying to conversate with you she dont want to be mean or anything and i dont see anything thats wrong with that n e ways.|`|40qTdKuPaa	Who knows? If you want to know you have to ask her how she feels, theres no way of knowing something unless you ask the person with the answer! Hope this helps!!|`|pIkPHuWyaa	Ask her out on a date.  If she says yes, she still likes you. If she says no, then you know that she was just being nice.|`|TtVk8S4aaa	maybe both if you broke up you wouldn't be really texting to her|`|JxpbxteHaa	was she flirting in the txts  if she was maybe she wants to get back together with you|`|dVrw5p6Waa	Its hard to say girls are hard to read. Here is a test that might help:  Stop texting her. When she texts you, don't answer for a day or two, if she keeps trying to get ahold of you she either likes you, or she has a high opinion of herself and does not like to be ignored. Now if she gives up on texting and actually calls you after a day or two, she is most likely interested. You could just ask her to be safe, though.
Ir51Eb0Kaa	No.|`|AA10227142	no|`|0fVtHNtmaa	No. it isn't odd at all.|`|HOdisPCWaa	Yes however it may lead to it later, by ones own hand or with a little help from another?|`|ztb7OCvyaa	No. Girls are placed in exciting situations too and we don't climax. Like when a hot guy dances all over you in a club, etc. Most people know how to control their excitement.|`|fyP3WLoPaa	Not strange at all, close your eyes and remember the moment while you... well you know what guys like to do.|`|SLYOcEU9aa	No. If a guy blew his load every time he got excited the world would be a really messy place. A little control is a good thing dude.
411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	ok, this is from a mom's perspective: if she is having family problems ask if she wants to talk about it.  If she continues to have these bouts of uncommunicative-ness, you may have to dump her.  She needs to lighten up some.  Sounds to me as if she is going thru some tough times, and needs more help than you can give her.  Or she may need some guidance or just someone to talk to. Either way, she is being uncommunicative to you.  If i had had a bf I could talk to,when I was a teenager, it ( he) woulda made all the difference. I had no one,and that was why I ran away from home. No one would listen to me and thought my mom was "mom perfect"   when in reality, she was "Mommy dearest".  I was being abused and no one knew.  Maybe this is what i going on with her, there is something going on and she doesn't know where to turn. It is good that she has someone to talk to, but on the other hand,if she is pushing you away, I would take that hint and dump her.  But talk to her and let her know you are worried about her.  Drop a hint like" maybe you're going thru some $hit, and need to talk about it. Like you're being molested , or abused in some way."  Say the word, "abused"   a couple of times, to let her know u are serious.  Don't just keep it all light and fluffy, by saying   " going thru stuff."   Be specific.  if someone had said the word " abused"   i woulda opened right up.  No one did.   i wasn't ashamed of the abuse,but I was afraid of my mom.  maybe when u call, her parents are standing over her shoulder, and she cant really talk to u, in private.|`|B1WxEIyXaa	Ok, here's what you do, leave her with, "i really care about you and i want to help cheer you up but i'm not going to push you, so if you're willing to talk about it i'm glad and here, i don't like to see you this way.  It's good to talk to someone."  She'll cave soon sir.|`|AhtaOu9aaa	Ok, here's what you do, leave her with, "i really care about you and i want to help cheer you up but i'm not going to push you, so if you're willing to talk about it i'm glad and here, i don't like to see you this way. It's good to talk to someone." She'll cave soon sir.     totally right you like her but not when shes in this attitude...and it sounds like shes like this alot ...try time with out her and maybe shell stop being so angry because she realizes shes sad without you|`|YxtVrRiSaa	wow. i was like, EXACTLY like that in my last relationship. i don't even know why, though. i do agree with the first person that amswered you though. i wish my boyfriend had said something like that. it would have made me happier. but for sure don't say anythong about kissing. ugh. girls do NOT like guys who are obbsessed with kissing.|`|LEhVYWjaaa	HI THIS IS SUSHMA HERE K JUST 1ST THING IS FIND OUT WHETHER SHE LOVES U TRULY OR NOT IF S  DEN TRY TO TALK TO HER CLOSELY TAKE HER TO HER LIKING PLACES BUY HER AND GIVE WT SHE LIKES DONT BE RASH TO HER IF U REALLY LOVE HER HOLD HER HANDS AND SAY HER U CANT LIVE WITHOUT HER U REALLY LOVE HER DON MIND JUST ATLEAST ACT AS IF UR WEEPING K BUT ONLY WEN SHE SAYS SHE LOVE U OR ELSE U CANT DO THIS & IMPT ASK HER IS SHE AS ANY PROB IN HER HOUSE OR IS ANYONE TROUBLING HER K BYE|`|aQT37RaKaa	All girls are like that or at least are like that in some point in there life. It's hormones. Ask her nicely if there's anything you can do or plan a nice dinner/date. If nothing works just give her some space until she's in a good mood. You never know what could be the real reason for her bad mood. If it just gets worst, you may have to dump her b/c she needs to lighten up.|`|C4bxnKDXaa	shake it off dude...go to the gym. Leave her alone on days like this. She will come back to you later tot alk about it|`|7I8gNo9Taa	just give her some space, she'll come out of it, and if she doesn't, or it gets worse, she should seek medical help|`|yvWIt3Ubaa	At least you got SOMEBODY.|`|K22b6fr6aa	well i think that you should just tell her that you just want to cheer her up because you love her but your not gonna keep trying if she acts like that..it might just be hormones or something=/ sorry:(

kI2JrDCoaa	I agree.... Just give her a picture of you so while your on a date she can gaze at  your beauty.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	Take her out to dinner and get her a new neckalace or a peice of jewelry and take her out to dinner. Or get her a gift certificate to a spa or like a place to get a facial, manicure, pedicure..etc I wish someone would do it for me!|`|H2bpuDsKaa	buy her some chocolate covered pretzels......|`|S8CZBCe2aa	Can she exchange you?|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	Get her a blender.|`|6aVtiTKiaa	Uh huh ... just wait until the morning of, walk up to her, throw your arms wide and tell her what you just told us.

35bca0c72ab6cb775834cc63ed591ecbaa	i really no what you mean, i hate it when ur scared of running out of things to say coz it usually makes it more likely to happen if u no what i mean?    soooooo..........next time your walking past the bench say hi megan, how  r u? or when u see her at school smile or wave or something like that, she'll get the idea that ur interested, i'm sure. and as for the looking average, if she's spoken to u and you guys get along and make each other laugh and all that jazz then i'm sure thats not gonna matter to hr unless she's really shallow, which not many people are. :)    hope this helps :D good luck|`|hd7aNTFXaa	dont rush conversation, just start talking to her little by little every day... and talk to her like you would her friend and eventually you will develop a relationship with her... and if you still like her then ask her out!    good luck :]|`|IX1CqF5waa	WELL WHEN UR OUT OF STUFF TO SAY,SAY U HAVE TO GO TAKE IT SLOWLY...|`|CNSGz12zaa	Just talk and tell her you like her. It is not rocket science|`|AA12108398	start talking to her friend and ask her to get you close to "Megan" and then your in. just be yourself and start a conversation. get her alone and take a walk away from everyone else then you can talk to her whenever you want to.|`|PJelxn5Xaa	Don't put her on such a high pedestal to start. She's human. you have to grow a backbone and just do it. Things will only be awkward if you let them get awkward. If you remain cool and confident it wont be awkward.|`|EnkSP0Vtaa	Pretend like she is someone that you've known for a long time.  Don't think of her as a girl you like, think of her as an old friend.  Also have confidence, I'm really shy with new people too but if I just pretend to be confident even if I'm not I can always get a conversation going.|`|2vazHHXeaa	Go up to her and talk to her for a minute or two.  Then just walk away.    She'll be confused because the alone-ness of it may mean hint that you like her, but the brief-ness will catch her off guard.    She'll come to you.|`|A3pVEWm0aa	Just pretend that she is like all your close friends that you have no problems talking to. Fake it until you make it!!!  Start a conversation with humor. If you have hung out with her before than you should know her sense of humor. Just walk up to her and make a joke about something funny you saw on your way to school or something observational. Almost all women consider humor to be the  1 characteristic they like about a guy. Then take it from there. Good luck!|`|salUkgKhaa	well, just act the way you normally do and don't shy. just try to find things you to will have in common|`|hjvwMgKoaa	If she is sitting alone she is probably wishing that she had someone to sit with or talk to.

And when you go to sit with her hint to her that you like her she would LOVE it!!!!!|`|0qNuPw5taa	well you should go and sit with her just be yourself and you guys could talk about things she likes or find out things about her. even if it does get awkward its ok cuz whenever youre getting to know someone it usually does get awkward|`|zH80yyDQaa	Go sit with her on the bench.

zQ0mUDBUaa	well i live in cali san jose to be exact and i know that right now there is alot of tension between us (mexicans) and blacks for whatever stupid reason. Its only with the dumb *** gangs though. I've dated black men and stuff sooo no its not a problem unless you make it one. Seriously even though they are fighting with each other i see alot of blacks with mexican women all the time around here and vice vera so i think its just the guys who are beefin and not the women. my uncle married a black women and took in her kids who were full black and they love each other very much. My daughters lil b.f. is black sooo its not as big as a problem|`|pjgMW6qaaa	No..  I lived in long beach, ca  And I saw blacks dating mexicans all the time...    Im mexican and dated a black guy before my husband and no problems...    its dangerous with gangs but nothing more than that|`|MVxFOI5naa	I think in California there is an issue with rival gangs but if you don't mingle with those folks in gangs it shouldn't be a problem for you.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	If you go dumpster diving and live in the ghetto, probably.|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Lol i live in the south and latin people and black ppl get it on all the time.|`|Y08YLysXaa	That's a terrible thing to deal with... me and my fiance are both blonde/green eyed so I guess we don't have to worry lol. Although I'm actually a total mutt but came out looking white! Anyway... if you live very close to gangs and see a lot of that crime activity, and you know there's tension, I would be a bit worried. But I think the internet is just making you paranoid.  Anyway I live in Australia so we mainly have greek/italian/english... so I can't say much about it other than try not to worry and I'm sorry you have to deal with this kind of prejudice     :)
AA10604300	God has not given you the free gift of eternal life......not yet.    I am sad to hear of such a loss.    As for the broken hearts, only Jesus the Lord can fix this,    Jesus came to heal the broken hearted, and   he knows your pain,   so do I by the way,      God has this free gift you see,   all you have to do to be healed of the broken heart, is to do what God says,   and the first thing that God wants you to do,   is ask the Lord Jesus to forgive you and to save you from eternal separation.  Jesus is ready to help you to live a life of Joy and peace,     only will you accept his undying love for you, when Jesus died on the cross and rose again, it was so that you can have   forgiveness and comfort from God, from all your earthly pains.
6b2ed66d1deeb6d5b77496a168089f4aaa	is he looking for a job??? I remember whenever I left my job, I went into a very deep depression, and I knew I was going to leave my job. He is going through a lot. You have to be a wife and be there for him through thick and thin. You have to help him find meaning to his days. Help him whenver he needs you. Its kinda hard when somebody is treating you bad. But there needs to be a lot of talking and a lot of sex too. Come on revitalize your whole life, it is a big change. Try to get him out of bed by having mmmm other parts of the house etc and then try to talk to him etc. Show him he is still worth a lot to you guys.|`|gp5KrhrPaa	When the children are asleep, take him to the living room, or the kitchen or so, tell him how you feel, and that if he doesn't straighten up his act, that your sorry, but you just can't take it anymore, tell him that and give him another chance, most importantly for the kids. (if they're you and his children if not, just canel that last sentance.)    Good luck.  Im sorry as well.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Your a good wife...he'll come around sooner or later.|`|CKpPpK0saa	dont leave your husband, you have kids it can hurt them. you love your husband though dont you :). dont leave him cause he is a lazy a** just kick him off his butt and tell him to get a job. dont give up on your husband. he can do it if you just PUSH him!|`|AA12272885	Give him an ultimatum, start looking for work, or work around the house.  If he does neither, then walk.|`|gqmtPx8gaa	Having lost my job recently myself (i'm now back at work thankfully after nearly a month off) I can sympathize with your husband. He's probably going through a bout of depression.     Men view themselves as the family provider... and when they can't provide they feel like a failure. Give him some more time, eventually he'll get out of his funk and will get down to seriously looking for a job. If he doesn't come out of it take him to your family doctor and have them discuss the possibility of him being depressed and maybe some meds to help him out.     I realize it's frustrating on your end, but please have some more patience. Try to be supportive and understanding. I'm not saying you aren't already... but arguing and fighting will only worsen the situation.    Good luck!|`|Kr09aQJkaa	You catch more flies with honey but you catch even more with sh**. Lay on some serious sh**.     Don't nag him or pass out chore lists like his mother. Be as nice as pie to him. Be sweet, supportive and give him lots of love and attention. After you have been sweet and loving for at least a week tell him he has to look for employment. Tell him you need him to do it for you. Trying to take care of the kids, home and bringing home the bacon is breaking your spirit. You need him to rescue you from this burden and he is the manliest man for the job. I'm sure his moodiness is because he is down on himself and feeling like he let the family down. Build him back up again before he sinks into a full blown depression.|`|omqS0q5Naa	You married him for better or worse.So this is worse how ever you made a commitment and you need to keep trying. You don't just give up on your marriage because it gets hard you have kids to think about not just yourself.You can make it work talk to him.
HDxRtZmvaa	So totally have! And then she went on the date him >:(   It's sort of like, once she feels that he's wanted, she wants him to. It's physcology|`|9x8ryDv6aa	Yes it's horrible.  She wasn't a true friend.  You need to get a new friend.  She would do this constantly :(|`|E46glB9Kaa	umm.. sort of. not really.. but i see it a lot. That's why i don't really like telling people who i like because they'll end up dating him even if they don't like them. ...um im kind of like that. If you tell me that you like this boy, i`ll sort of just see him in a new light and i might develope a little crush on him.. it doesn`t happen often but it has happeend before. i wouldn`t dream of actually hitting or dating on him becasue i respect my friend more than that.|`|b9791c0d942f7d7caa7f70d6161e349caa	no|`|F8Qwlvbjaa	look up the definition of a friend.|`|tAYXUXreaa	Oh not only have I had a friend do that but on the last guy that she did it to I had actually started dating him and she made out with him one night. She also lied to me and said it was not true and that it did not happen. The problem is that everyone that was around her happens to be friends of mine for at least 20 years....so I knew quickly that she was full of ****! I thought this person was my best friend. I no longer even speak to her. I just could not be friends with someone who would treat me that way. Nor should you! Have more respect for yourself and you will have friends that should treat you better. I know it sounds stupid, but it is true!|`|FIFoGNIxaa	Actually, that has happened to me.    I really liked this guy a year older than I am ( I still REALLY like him )  He was soooooo cute!!!!!!!!! Then when I told my friend I had a MASSIVE crush on him she was telling me she deserved him more!  It mad me really mad!!! She doesn't like him anymore though.|`|C02ASCzpaa	Sounds more like an arch-nemesis.   Sometimes people befriend the people they are angry with.  Be careful what information you give her...  You could even try to use that to get even with her, but that really isn't worth the time and energy.  Neither is her friendship.|`|BY6OSDSeaa	i havent, but ive seen it happen A LOT...   theyre usually jerks..my policy is i dont tell people who i like until im REALLY good friends with them. or you could use reverse spychology and tell them a guy you dont like so they will go out with them.....
zdIQTA9Yaa	got to give it sometime to get over you're ex but obviously you still like him and if he breaks up with his current wait awhile and ask him out but with the other guy give him a bit more of a chance|`|5bZ2sPO3aa	Yes|`|BvgMVNk5aa	i dont think that u shud wait, if u really like ur ex then just go for it and maybe hell dump his gf, maybe u two r just meant to be =)
76nTvO4iaa	What brand is the dress?    Are you buying it off the rack and want the corset back added or are you special ordering it?    If you're ordering the dress, check with the bridal shop to see if it can be ordered in corset back.  Many of the bridal gown people can make the dress button/zipper or corset back at no extra cost, but you have to ask..|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	It depends on what the going rate in your area is. Take it to a local seamstress and see what they can do. It shouldn't be that difficult. You can get recommendations on the local boards at http://talk.theknot.com|`|deAyKj2Uaa	you can have the person who does the alterations take out the zipper and have little eye hole things put in, then you can lace it up.  it shouldnt cost more than say 50-100 dollars.  a friend of mine had it done and it looked absolutley beautiful!!  good luck! :) :)|`|A7JSg6BVaa	I have the same issue with my dress. I bought it because it's almost perfect, the zipper just won't do up all the way. But, the shop recommended that I get them to put in a corset back instead. So, they gave me a shawl that matched my dress fabric (it's cheaper than buying the fabric to make the laces and facings), and they told me to bring it back about 8 weeks before my wedding to have it fitted and done. They told me it would cost about $80-$100 (and I'm near London, Ontario, Canada). I hope that helps!
28WJwHf4aa	Yes, this is definitely possible!    It really depends on the tailor for price. Ask around and get different quotes at tailors around your area. I had a bridesmaid dress tailored and it cost me $65; another bridesmaid had the exact same alterations and it only cost $30. The quality she got was much better, too!|`|Y08YLysXaa	I feel you. My wedding is in 3 weeks and my dress only JUST zips up! My dress would be expensive and difficult to make lace up, because it has an invisible zip (ruffling around the zip). So my dad's girlfriend picked the seams at the sides of my ribs and then sewed it with a smaller seem which gave me about half an inch around the back/ribs. That is only useful if it almos zips up, or zips up but very tight. Depends on how small the dress is.
YzpJxYBOaa	Wow, I've heard of a scooped neckline but the only descriptions I've ever heard of for trains are cathedral, chapel and sweep, which is more of informal train that just sweeps the floor off the hem of the gown.    If you can get in touch with the person who listed it, check with them.  They might have made a mistake in the description or they really meant a more informal, sweep type of train.

UMg1CL7baa	Children are the greatest gift a person can ever ask for.  i say why wait?|`|NC9FV8bLaa	Go for it!|`|AA11961672	there is never a "right" time...so I say go for it and good luck!|`|F3nlVXJ5aa	I'd be interested in knowing what makes you think you'd get pregnant on command?  And why you think it's only your decision.  There are four individuals making this decision, you and your body, your husband, the baby, and God.  If you haven't had a child before did you know there may be or could be a problem with his swimmers?  Or with you because maybe you're on the pill?  Did you know that under stress sometimes things don't work?  Why not send him to a clinic and save the sperm so that you can have a child when you want to whether he's here or there and on your body's schedule.  That way when you two get together he will know you're there because you love him and not only because you want a child.
r4kCsu1Vaa	Yes, you like her.  and i know High School love,   Im in High School too.  just sit by her in class, if you can.  she would like it.  become her friend (if you aren't already)  and get her cell number and call/text her.  My friend (we act like a couple but we aren't dating, long story),  she likes when i call her pretty. and we ask each other questions and she likes that. she also like when you call her (obviously).  well there isn't much more i can say. I'm less experienced than you are so, form here you are on your own.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Well, DO you like her? How are we supposed to know you innermost feelings?

Xyy7KHURaa	Bro, I think they are watching way too much TV. Many girls live in a dream world, and they will prob never be happy. That girl will more that likely spend her entire life searching for that cowboy, then when she turns 40, she will be like, oh crap... I married a redneck, lol... Hang in there man, and enjoy lifes journey.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Well, women do watch tv and all the hunks on tv are what they are comparing guys to. Of course, they don't know that looking like that is part of their job, and they probably spend 6 hours a day working out in the gym to get there. And if they were actually dating one of those hunks, they would have to stand on their head to catch their attention, because he would be looking at himself in every mirror, window, or table knife in sight.    Of course, after reading YA, it seems like a lot of women are still settling for the same old losers.     So you have the advantage there. Good luck.|`|pAyl6M1faa	be yourself! don't change for shallow women because they won't respect it, and also, no guy is capable of making these types of women happy anyway.|`|nHi1mioBaa	We are not becoming too picky.We already are.Sorry,but i bet you guys are picky too.I mean,you would be fine if you understand the girl.Good luck!|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	It's weight not wait and you shouldn't starve yourself!

We're immersed in the world of perfection. Everywhere we turn, there's a beautiful woman who is skinny and in perfect shape with an amazing job, and there's a gorgeous and perfect man who's a real "guy's guy" with a great job and a chiseled body.     TV and the media has gotten our hopes up and tought us that it's not right to choose someone less than "perfect". it's stupid...but that's what we're tought.|`|DqzhHZnoaa	a lot of them, yes  me ? no.    all i want is a confident, fairly attractive partner|`|kSlN7MjEaa	Why is she going out with you? Because she likes you thats why.  Forget about the other girls you met who wanted a "type" of man and just be yourself.  You sound like a decent well grounded guy who knows what he wants.  If it turns out she wants some mythical guy and you are not it - well thats her loss.  Yes I think girls expect a lot these day but so do the guys.  In my life .I have met  handsome men and beautiful women but  a lot of them were vain and shallow.  Looks are on the outside and deceptive  - whats inside is far more important.  If you get the two together looks and character you have hit the jackpot but it doesnt happen very often.   Good luck on the date,
FiCl71flaa	How can anyone know how you feel if you say nothing. It seems that though you care about this girl you have not said anything to her in the 7 months that you have had an interest in her.. What you need to do is to correct the situation. First of all, talk to her and and tell her how you feeling about her.Then you have to tell her in a gentle manner that the guy she is now dating is no good for her.Give her examples and reasons why you say so.For example say he is a jerk because he -------. At the end you now tell her why you are better for you such as you love her, care about her,you are honest  devoted and loving and so on.Finally make your case to her on why you are the best guy for her  and to give you both a chance at happiness  and to grow old together. I wish you all the best and good luck.|`|pAyl6M1faa	if you act jealous, you WILL lose her for good.  if she's your friend, just stay cool and she may turn to you for a shoulder to cry on. If you don't want to stand by and watch this girl date some dude you don't like, drop her cold! that will get her attention for sure, but i'm not sure if it will make her drop him for you, because there are too many factors that i am not aware of to make that guess.    good luck...|`|frpCK0utaa	She doesnt have the problem, you do. You've got a cse of jealousy man. And calling your best friend a shallow ***** is harsh to be honest.    Unless theres a chance you and her will get together, you are going to have to learn how to deal with her relationships with other guys.|`|jxseTHg7aa	she is going to do whatever makes her happy so just tell her how you feel about the situation things like these have a way of working themselves out|`|T3W4Mf50aa	"granted girls are shallow bitches"?...  maybe she's not into you like that|`|258mrT2Paa	What is her problem? ?    just look in the mirror mate, she is "picking an idiot jerk " according to you, so what does that make you ?, then you say girls are shallow bitches......... you have so much to learn and a change in attitude would be a start, if she likes this guy so what, she has a choice and you was not on her list.ask yourself why you lost her 2/3 times before ? (not looking for best answer either) just giving advice as asked by you.|`|AqvEHHsTaa	like most females, she probably can't see the good ones standing right  next to her.

Tread carefully but might be something worth looking into.|`|2e2ab08fee1b7fc9f1b2e5fc001d1de2aa	Her problem is that she's a FEMALE! All girls are the same way in all the wrong way! Stay away!

For right now just be happy for her.|`|75bcffedeed2e98b419c4ef51d05351faa	First, your perception of girls being shallow bitches is interesting.  Generally when one forms such an opinion it is because they think this way of themself, shallow that is.  From your post it appears that you are no catch, and whether she is with a younger guy for all the wrong reasons or not is irrelavant.  Her choice in boys/men is her decision ... and truthfully and clearly ... anyone with any hint of maturity would see that there are plenty of reasons why she didn't choose you.  How about spending some time on yourself so girls would find you more desirable.  It's not about looks, but what is in your heart is a deal breaker.  That is, unless the girls are as inmature as you are this moment.|`|Z11jZXOmaa	don't take it out on all girls. I would never go out with a boy just because he is attractive and he treats me wrong.

7igxiGrAaa	There are plenty of things you can use ribbon for. You can make bows to put at the ends of the alters, or to tie around table decorations, or flower girl baskets. You can tie them around chairs. You can even use them on your invitations.    I got married in August. We used ribbon on our invitations, I hole punched the tops of them and thread the ribbon through and tied a bow. We also had a bottle of champagne on each table, which had a blue and white ribbon bow on each bottle. We had some ribbon hanging from the ceiling of our white tent to help spiff it up some.     There are plenty of craft ideas.  http://wedcraft.com/ This site has a whole list, not just for ribbon but in general.  http://www.superweddings.com/bridalcraft...|`|oe81XFO0aa	craft them into bows, maybe incorporate flowers into the bows and put them t the ends of the pews or chairs maybe|`|W05piyBxaa	sadas|`|bm1rsts7aa	If there's a trellis or something you could wind it in that.|`|DqetlSB6aa	maybe add flowers to them and use them to decorate the isle leading to the alter|`|cGbTJobeaa	You could use them in a variety of ways.    1) for the flower girls, instead of having a white ribbon that ties around their waist, you could replace the white ribbon with peach and/or mint;  2); you could wrap the ribbon around the handle of the flower girl's basket.  That way it will be a little more colorful in the photos;  3), you could tie your hair back with a nice ribbon and that way you kinda sorta match their wedding colors;   4) you could pin a border of ribbon along the top edge of the head table or the gift table; or  5) you could create large fancy bows and have them on the outer edge of the seats where the wedding aisle is.    BTW, I am proud that you are trying to make the best of this and are offering helpful ideas to your Nana and trying to figure out how to be friendly to the military personnel at the wedding.  You are going to make your dad and grandparents very proud. You rock!!!|`|f2bac623dfde443d62529e17e73d64c0aa	idk around the door ? or somethang!!|`|UkpBCpk4aa	on the front back middle section of the car, where your vows are gonna be..|`|8eb3b233aef711e6c66be9d2f17d46b2aa	you can make bows and drape material along side of the tables and pin the bows. or you can make them curly and hang them from the ceiling somewhere.|`|sIdoUK2Laa	bows around:    chair backs  ponytails  wedding favors  car  doorway|`|tbtTjevxaa	after the priest says i now pronounce you husband and wife...get someone to pull some kind of strings and it rains ribbons on the audience..idk?!|`|77YJU6IYaa	you could put them on the pew's in the church. Depending on the size. Or you could decorate the cake table.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Cool.......tie them to the ends of helium balloons...make the ribbons long and use them as part of the table decor....they will have to weighted at the ends somehow so they don't float away.....    I was thinking of a Wishing Well where guests could write wishes for the new couple and pop them in the well..the well could have a sign saying  Sweet Wishes for the Bride & Groom.....or, remember the shoe box 'mailbox' kids make in grammer school for their Valentine's Day Cards? One made with bridal wrapping paper, bits of white lace and some of that ribbon could be used instead of a wishing well if making a small tabletop one is not possible (they are easy to make)  Find small note paper like post ems and pencils...the pencils can be tied with the ribbon if it's narrow enough and the guests can keep the pencil (who can't use a pencil)?    The ribbon can also be used to decorate the chairs the bride & groom will be seated in to 'reserve them. They can be wrapped several times and knotted around the stems of the bridal bouquet if the bride is using a long stemmed bundle.....if she wears a hair piece of flowers they can be cascaded down the back and against the tulle of the veil will look pretty....if I think of anything else I'll add it.    Feeling a bit  sneaky?????  Wanna have fun? During the reception can you (with some help) sneak away to the bridal get away car & decorate it?....here are some things you can do.....    1) Fill the entire interior of the car with balloons...the kind you blow up yourself....stuff 'em in good so when the door opens.....    2) start saving tin cans & soda bottles/cans-have your grandpa punch a whole in each and thread some of that ribbon through...then tie several to the back car bumper like streamers......decorate the antennae with a few soda bottles & ribbon....  With washable paint on the back window write just married....and wrap the entire car in saran wrap...they'll hafta cut through it to get inside.....|`|5LT6LRUZaa	you could use the ribbon to tie around the nosegays/bouquets    one neat use for them is to find heart shaped Styrofoam and with strips of ribbon cover it...the ends will be raw but you just trim these off and then finish the top end of the heart..then decorate with flowers and additional bows etc and hang these from the ceiling of the hall or the tent you are using...you could buy some really inexpensive frames at the dollar store..different shapes and sizes, spray paint them all to match if you want to then use eye hooks and screw them into the top of each frame and then string the frames on the ribbon tying a knot on either side of the eye hook to prevent them from sliding...I attended a wedding where they did this and strung it up behind the cake table on the wall...it had photos of both the bride and groom as kids..and then the two of them together...leading up to a easel with their engagement photo..    you could use the ribbon to tie off favor bags...to designate the wedding party table and family tables at the reception...one really cool option I've seen at a wedding was going to the dollar/discount store and purchase a variety of cheap toys...(nothing that makes noise!) for the kids to choose from at the reception...I recommend the activity books and crayons etc mini puzzles and board games...keep the items to choose from small and for added fun for the kids bag them up in little waxed bags and tie them off with the ribbon...green for boys peach for girls and let them grab bag their favors...they can have there's during the reception and have a little area cornered off for the kids to go to to play have some books and quiet games there that can occupy them in case they get bored as most children do at these events...you could simply use these ribbons here and there as just a little touch...or you can totally incorporate them in the total decor of your reception...there are so many possibilities...I could go on but I think you got the idea???    Congratulations to you!|`|0XWVUMCAaa	put them on gifts|`|R7DKpBF3aa	if you have a DJ at the wedding, you could tie them in bows and hang them around the table. ot time them on the chairs at the reception.
MH3Xtmgyaa	holy ****.  theres actually decent guys out in this world.  this honestly amazes me.    yes its normal not to have feeling towards anyone besides your family.  you obviously havent found someone who brings these feelings on.    and yeah these feelings do exist.  but you have to wait for the right person who makes you feel them.|`|AA10997370	these feelings do exist....because sometimes you can meet someone, that just makes you forget about all yor problems...someone you can be with, who loves you as much as you love them, as isnt scared to say it. its amazing when you do meet someone like that, they just complete you|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	no honey, those feeling DO exist.  And it happens kind of by chance.  When we search for these type relationship we as humans tend to force the issue which causes the natural part of it to disappear.  So, just wait, be patient and when the person comes along and you are both content with just hanging out, laughing, and you find her smile so irresistable then you know you've found that relationship.    Just wait for it.|`|fHHeal1Vaa	i fell in love when an old man of 64 appeared at my door and let himself into my home putting a gun before my head and forced me to smile and say I love you "like you mean it" he yelled at me. He told himself that I did it out of my own "desire" and "wish". Like any rapist.
2wZcWe98aa	OF CORSE!  Well as long as you have a wonderful personality and everything someone wanted. Theres no need to have sex. And plus, I tihnk it would be so amazing to get married and know that the pereson you are going to have sex with, is totally clean, you dont have to worrie about std's and such, and its jsut soo pure.|`|7I8gNo9Taa	shoot i would probably get into a long term relationship with you, i think that it would make me respect you more|`|zIISRkjMaa	yes. nothing wrong with your decision.|`|54a8ab2a075f3228053ce1f8fb3b394aaa	Of course! YOu never know....she might be waiting, too.|`|RPTwjyjIaa	Why are you asking only girls who are a perfect 10? Is that the only girl that you are trying to date? If that is the case you may be disappointed. Regardless, I think it all depends on the guy. If he had a great personality and compatible I think a girl would be willing to wait if the right guy.|`|jT1mPev9aa	probably the only type of guy i would go out with|`|5FCiKNaGaa	yeah, but i m only 14, so i dont even plan on doing that soon|`|x51SQHxDaa	ur like the perfect guy i want to wait till marriage and i would love to have a guy who shared the same belief any Girl would be Lucky to have you|`|AA12359831	i would. forget your guy friends. as long as you make out and stuff you should be fine. a relationship isnt all about sex unless your one of those guys.|`|UtwMxaPzaa	That is no reason not to date someone. I will say that's it's harder to stick to that than you can ever imagine. But I think girls will respect that, even if guys don't.|`|INybXKozaa	Of course.  If you can make me laugh,  if your not lame,  if you make me happy,  i could care less about sex...  I'd rather a guy be pure.|`|OexSvLjoaa	hell yeah!!!! did not know there were still guys like you.|`|oPKDBzhtaa	of course i would|`|BvgMVNk5aa	yea, totally i think TONS of girls would really respect it , since most of us find it hard to believe there are really guys out there like that. Theres nothing wrong with that i think u cud probably get more girls then u wud if u wanted to have sex.|`|CIKr28xoaa	def.|`|K5BLCZPkaa	Yes, I want to wait too! I'm only fourteen so I wouldn't do that for a while anyways, but yea if you had a good personality then most definitely!|`|RonpMv7eaa	The hot girl will never believe you.|`|QZLzCWKDaa	i like guys like that   i'd want to go out with you because of that fact  very attractive  in less your ugly|`|X8BJ5rSSaa	yea i would, definately, i mean im not the 'save myself for marriage' type myself, but thats because im more the 'do anything to please my man' type so if i was going out with someone who wanted to wait for marriage that would totally be ok with me if thats what he wanted and that made him happy.|`|6yM22fblaa	it'll be perfect .|`|Bo11l8xQaa	I'm just about 15, still completely a virgin, (only kissed :p) but the answer would probably be no. The reason is because that those desicions are usually religiously made, and as an Atheist, I really don't think I would ever enter a serious relationship with a religious guy. The thing is, it can cause a lot of friction, and it also shows different ways of thinking.  Plus, on the wedding night, that would be a TON of pressure!|`|08tdupUSaa	Ha I would.  Many girls look for that.  You just gotta find the right ones.  No slutty "hot" girls.  But when i'm older i'm going to be looking for the guy who will wait with me.  keep it up and ignore your friends:)|`|ba4abba3585146bf9e998aabaecede47aa	ha yes. im not having sex till marriage either. so i wouldn't care.|`|8NtcEOLVaa	Yes, i go for a guy with personality not a great u know what!|`|dz7ZepS4aa	Of course I respect someone like that because I am. Saving yourself is like a gift. when you get married you can give that gift to some lucky girl and hopefully she can give you the same thing. Purity is something to be valued and I respect you for that a lot. :)|`|Y6YGHsKjaa	I probably would! I'm a Christian and we believe in virginity before marriage. I think that that's an excellent choice, and I applaud you!|`|KcR829Edaa	I think that is a good thing! I don't know if it's religious or not but i would go out with you. I know i wouldn't want to be pressured into sex by a guy who was ready to do it before i was. =]|`|QFlCOKqbaa	yes|`|hjvwMgKoaa	I would have problems with that. Girls can want it pretty bad too, just like guys do. Although all girls are differant. Im sure that there is a perfect girl out there for you who would be willing to wait with you!!! I wish that I could be able to make that decision and keep that too, but i'd have a lot of trouble.|`|iffeWcbWaa	Actually I admire that. I think thats awesome and you should encourage others to do the same!!!!!! Staying pure and waiting is the 2nd best decision you will ever make in your entire life!|`|Mn97YDIyaa	My girlfriend also will not have sex until she is married, and I respect that and I'm going out with her, so if I was gay, I'm sure I would go out with you :)|`|FrPVteUIaa	Ya, i don't want to do it til i'm married too! :-)|`|COmp4sIuaa	Way to steal the topic from the hot girl!|`|RoTLnFGZaa	I'd be more likely to be with you,  because of that very fact.  but girls are very different. some will be interested & some will not. pure&simple.|`|SGvVkkl5aa	ignore your friends and what they may say.  its a good decision and I hope my boyfriend will feel the same way about it as I do.|`|nHi1mioBaa	I would def. go out with you if you are cute,polite,smart and nice.  I dont need sex to make me happy.Just a hug,a kiss, and cuddling would make me feel like in heaven :)  im serious  so dont worry about it   it show me your a nice guy,i def date u|`|caArlzCvaa	yes :]|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Yes.|`|8LzZvPwjaa	yes, I would....yeah, it is true that I enjoy it...but I would be willing to wait if I was in love with you
9DtJeAUKaa	No, not weird at all. You already were paired up for a project, obviously you all worked & spoke w/ each other. So it's not like walking up to a stranger & trying to strike up conversation. Just always be yourself w/ everyone & always follow your instincts.     Start speaking more, get to know each other & if she does the same & a friendship blooms ~ start running around, spending night w/ each other, talking on the phone & all those fun things best friends do. :)|`|zJg1tYPpaa	no it wouldnt be weird and just compliment something on her then maybe ask her where she got it from|`|9LdcBLuIaa	No that wouldn't be wierd at all.    ........|...  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|edcTNpg8aa	YOU ARE EXTREMELY WEIRD!|`|rkjQpGNWaa	just say hi no its not wierd lol.complement her shoes or something...|`|0ea180691059f1d8601a9cee62729757aa	I could never hurt to be friendly. If she looks at you weird you may want to stop though.|`|cb4HEkGhaa	i dont think it will be weird and you can start talking to her about something you both like|`|VTiyxgCtaa	shes just a girl like you, start up a conversation to see what she does.|`|71RMmp2Kaa	no, its wouldnt. its good to make new friends, and a way to make new friends is to talk to them..|`|A471ENIBaa	are you  lesbian|`|9H86ri12aa	you mean will be best friends right?  just normally start a conversation with her and in time you'll get to know her.  it's not weirdd sometimes you just know that someone is bound to be your friend!  good luck my child.|`|L0j9urloaa	Of course not! You should definitely start a conversation with her.|`|9IGPrWBLaa	No, it really wouldn't be weird at all. But if you'd like to start it out slow, begin with smiling at her in the hallways, and then gradually work your way to saying hi, a convo, etc.     Bring up something about the school day, homework, a cute guy, etc.    Also, you could talk to her about music, a tv show, or a book.    There are millions of possibilities here.    Good luck, I hope I helped you :)|`|COmp4sIuaa	No, you're just saying hi. I say hi to about 200 people a day. Teachers, students, janitors, doesn't matter, I'm just that kind of person.|`|Xx2fMy1Xaa	It's not weird. to start a conversation, say hi or how are you doing?|`|PzbRJrTKaa	no, just talk to her, you guys will become friends.|`|F8Qwlvbjaa	ask her about what she thinks about the project that you are doing.|`|eaQuLKbgaa	yes it would be soooo weird...jk jk  talk to her say hi, smile at her and bring up things that u have in common, then hopefully a friendship will spark. itll probably be less weird for u to do it when shes alone|`|uzmcXWSVaa	go ahead and talk to her.   everyone likes to make friends|`|G4wEL4qoaa	No, it would not be weird.|`|ytl2PONXaa	not weird at all if it's the right way.    saying "HI THERE!!" in loud words would be weird.    Saying "Hey, how's it going?" would be normal.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	Treat her like you would treat someone who's already your friend.|`|mG6Pu12Paa	Just say Hi to her.  And start talking, maybe she feels the same way.  Nobody can have to many friends.|`|6lxQ1a3caa	No, just start by saying hi. For starting a conversation, just be yourself and don't talk about something you don't know much about. For example, don't talk to her about politics or religion. Find a common ground, about maybe music, movies, or whatever.|`|FIFoGNIxaa	that;s not wierd,  it actually helps you to meet new people!    You should talk to her in the halls!    Me & my friends do it ALL the time!!!|`|tMuUh6YGaa	no, it would be a little weired if you have never met, but you did do something together. maybe she is thinking the same thing. I would just ask her a question like her favorite color, or mention something that is going on in school, or maybe give her a complement. I really hope i helped!
5a2XVczMaa	**Firstly** if you have some older BIGGER friends or family (even friends of family), get them to stand at the door, make sure unwanted people don't ruin your party".    Make sure the music is good  And make sure you have good speakers with lots of Bass (if not, borrow some).    Get friends to bring some music (or copy there CD's so they don't loose them at ur party) That way u know they like the music.  Nice food to snack on too and maybe even a BBQ with sausages.    Have dance (or even break dancing) Competitions.    Play "Spin the Bottle"... Who ever spins the bottle has to kiss whoever the bottle points to.    Place bets on the games ur watching (but don't use money, use something else??) Maybe whoever looses has to kiss the host) LOL!!    OR you could just let the party take itself where ever it goes.    Have fun =]|`|3TdT5mG2aa	LMAO? Reputation? PLEASE!|`|fscgp7iFaa	Firstly be reponsable...there are probably gonna be guys there so dont get into...anything you'll regret. Just be yourself. Play I have never. Just smile laugh.|`|CNSGz12zaa	A bag of weed, a keg some barf bags and a good cleaner!|`|wKvlzq2Xaa	???    As in, if you're bad your reputation will be ruined, or if you're party isn't AWESOME then it will.    If you're parents trust you to have the party, then have it.  Don't worry about it.   If one of your friends is an idiot and does something stupid, then it's not your fault.    If you're worried about your party not being 'cool' enough, then you aren't cool, and you have no hope in life.|`|GK00Rz5caa	Loooots of music.    ........|...  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|fZCfJWpOaa	I'm guessing this is a Superbowl party?  I don't know if you need much more than the television, snack food, and drinks (soda, etc).  Make sure you have enough places for people to sit for the game (bean bags if you run out of chairs, etc).      Don't offer alcohol.  Not only could it come back on you if one of your friend's parents find out (and with 15-20 people, one probably will), but your parents could be charged with providing alcohol to minors if those people's parents wanted to press them.  Just hide the alcohol before people come over and tell them your parents emptied the fridge.  No one will know the difference and everyone will be safe.  From being arrested or accidentally causing someone else's death while driving home.    But, if you wanted to be extra prepared, look up some party games for those that get bored easily.  You can decorate for the party with sports themed decorations.  Have a contest to see how many beer, soda, doritos, etc commercials are shown in the breaks and have the winner for each category get a prize.     Here's a site that had some other party ideas, too: http://www.celebrations.com/article/Supe...|`|sIdoUK2Laa	your high school reputation means nothing in the real world so stop trying so hard.|`|zII43iA8aa	if ur rep depends on it whyd u throw it in the first place and maybe u shudda thought about it erlier stupid and u shudnt even be drinking|`|QADhk0nFaa	well if you live on a farm and you have a barn or somthing that is warm do it out there so the house stays nice also ya u prob will need alcohol but all the parties i have gone to people just communicate and walk around and talk to there friends have a bit of music playing and dude its good! and fun:D have it a BYOB (bring your own beer) so you dont have to pay for anything,|`|eX8i4vwRaa	well im in high school too and i feel like the only parties in my school are based around alcohol, slutty dancing and makeout sessions.|`|eE7Np0n6aa	Play "Questions Only", "Scenes from a Hat", "Irish Drinking Songs", "Hoedown", "Three-headed Broadway Star", etc.    Reference "Whose Line is it Anyways"|`|AsSMWbdyaa	I miss high school! =[ but with the right people your party will be the shizz! I dont wanna promote alcohol usage but I have to say beer pong is the "beez kneez" lol so if you could get an older brother or super cool aunt it'd be fun|`|eT4oBXONaa	definatley do not just try to "blend in with the crowd...i have a twin sister and she and i decided to through a party and we made it like "a masquarade" them so that everyone got cute little masks when they walked in! and obvi. the hostess gets to be the cutest one there!  :) have fun oh and dont do the whole alchohal scene in high school it ruins your brain cells and makes you look old-not cool at all!|`|ldAJ3Et8aa	Have sex.|`|4KMSKrxQaa	have a sex party or...... yea thats about it|`|ui5uEr5Oaa	well get some weed good music acholol of course lots of snacks and drinks|`|AA12359831	spin the bottle. 7 minutes in heaven.|`|SGh5R0rraa	invite more people and get a lot of really good music... have the music turned up and make sure the food is just snack stuff... just have funn|`|67b89f175f9e6da423ea726e431c5ba0aa	i think u should not do the alcohol thingy..  i know i know, every guy wants it, but nooo..  stick with the dancing and make ur music last a long time and make it good music with lights and u know, the type of music anyone would dance to like hip hop, reggeton, or any other thing.  the alcohol will make it turn out ugly!|`|jtK3pgwiaa	Well if it's your party that your hosting then just go nuts and let people do w/e they want. Make sure you have good music.    If it's not your party and somebody else is hosting it, go nuts there too.|`|UkpBCpk4aa	Ok think of the interaction with women and men. Dancing is keen alchohol is another big one because high school + alch. = party    Mostly think of things you could do with the opposite sex. spin the bottle, Seven minutes, Grind Dances to break the tension and spare bedrooms :)|`|OaxXT5nzaa	Your high school reputation is the last thing in the world that matters.  Seriously?  Are you losing sleep over this?|`|iEVwHmchaa	15-20 ppl? r u crazy or something. i cant belev u cant even manage that little amount of ppl. tlk about ur REPUTATION. as if you have any. last time me and a couple of frends did a party for 300. no probs|`|Ig61vCA6aa	yes, reputations a BIG thing. too many cliques, u may fall into the nerds.haha    this is what u do. lots of drinks and junk food  popular music  tv  cleaning supplies handy  ur younger sibling as a coat person  ...yea. and free some rooms so couples can make out.  provide lots of space. parties, even 15-20 can get cramped.    good luck and dont let ur high school reputation slip!!!|`|H7kmp0qdaa	Get someone 21 to buy you alcohol but don't play beer pong because you'll make your house reek of beer. Your parents will probably have lame liquor like disaronno or something which is gross.    Just make salami roll ups and bagel bites and stuff like that. chips and salsa... Have a few mix cds of whatever kids your age listen to these days- don't play full albums from one artist because if it's lame everyone will be like ughhh. You can dance and maybe play strip poker or something to that extent. Apples to apples is a fun party game too.|`|04vGJbIUaa	do you have a pool?|`|Y7dgRyJAaa	1. dont let people in that are older...they will take 100% advantage of your house, no matter how cool they make you feel..dont do it    2. dont take your parents alcohol..bad idea, they'll notice and you'll be screwed    3. depending on how old you/your guests are...make sure cars are parked on different streets than yours..neighbors can suck    4. keep guests in a few rooms only...restrict to living room/ kitchen/ basement...dont let people in bedrooms...you'll have to worry about changing sheets and stuf...nasty    5. make sure trash bags are everywhere...leave a few windows open to air out the house    6. dont expect it to be like typical movie houseparty...there will be drama...you will be a nervous wreck..and will probably have a bad time    7. have a few friends sleep over to help you clean up, and so you have an excuse for why the house is a little disorderly...sleepovers can get messy     have fun, be good...dont do anything stupid :-)|`|dxYgLvEBaa	In High School? How old are you? Are you old enough to be allowed to have alcohol? Your reputation is already in the hole for not providing these information. Stay away from the boost. Have everyone gather at the party with their textbooks and start doing a party group study. I know this sounds stupid but it is for the sake of your reputation.|`|9XridN1faa	okay  you started off great with like the food and dancing and everything..  try to set aside a place for cool video games, for the guys   and  have like 10 pounds of food. try to put breakable out of sight like the cupboards under the sink or dish closets..BEER PONG is always fun..  and keep an area to those who want to get away from the party..make sure the people who are coming are the people you INVITED HTH :]]|`|aaPx1eehaa	act naughty|`|DHNFkSLcaa	Get weed, have sex get wasted, listen to pimk floyd. It helps thxs=]|`|jg3bbxR8aa	I wouldn't suggest alcohol. If someone finds out you had underage drinking (even if you don't intend on it) you could get busted by the cops and get big fines. I also would expect more than 15 to 20 because your friends could tell their friends and you could get a lot more. I a fun party, but keep rules and don't let things get out of controll. You can have a fun party with out ruining your reputation. I hope I helped.|`|jAvK15bcaa	if its like the way it was when i was in high school, 15 - 20 easily becomes more than that.  Some people will bring their own alcohol and expect the guys to be wanted to get some.  at least that was high school for me.  you might hang around a different type of crowd, but if your worried about your reputation it doesn't sound like it.    suggestions:     definitely have some guys monitoring who gets in, cause big parties become busted parties.|`|iL4irhhkaa	Beer pong. One of the better drinking games to date. First, you need a ping pong table or a table of similar length. Start with 12 plastic beer cups on either end. 24 total. Making a triangle. 1 cup, then 2, then 3 then 6. Fill each cup halfway. Two teams. 2 per team. each gets a ping pong ball and attempts to toss the ball in a beer. The beer must be drunk by the opposing team when made. You may bounce a ball in and it is worth two drinks. But when a ball is bounced it can be blocked. Only when bounced. When the cups get down to 4, you may rearange them into a diamond. This creates a whole in the center called the glory hole. Any shot made within the glory hole is an automatic win.   For this game to work you need plenty of beer. Which you shouldn't drink since your under 21....
BgVWSApdaa	You want control of something that is out of your control.  You need to recognize that you can't make her forget anyone.  Look at what you're putting yourself through?  When you two were together, it didn't last very long, right?  I think you should let her be.  Let her work through her feelings for this other guy but don't put yourself into that situation at all.  Protect your heart!  If you are meant to be with her, you will be and at the right time too.  In the meantime, move on for now.  Let your heart heal and hang with your friends.  If she does come back to you, it would be best if she is free of any other guys.  You deserve that.|`|C2olZsNiaa	The word love is being thrown around like a football.  Love is not that easy.  I don't think that she loves either of you because when somebody is in love ... they only have eyes for you.  Move on...do you and a new love will fall in place.    You don't want a girl that can't make up her mind because who's to say that if you get her back that in 3 months she won't find another guy that she "loves".|`|Xyy7KHURaa	You can't control love, sorry bro. If love is real it's more powerful than any of us. She will make her own decision, and you can't make it for her. She might just need time. But remember she is your ex, and she is with another guy. So I think she already chose him, and not you. I will have to agree with the other guy, she prob doesnt love either of you. But it's hard to tell, because I dont know you all.Take this as a learning experience.. Life is not easy, and you will get through this. Learn from it and grow strong.
Q1MI6L96aa	I think you answered in your third sentence....you are a "girlfriend." If you can be happy with that arrangement, then keep moving forward. But it sounds as if you need to move on and find someone who will treat you with respect.|`|AA10248966	YOu move on ASAP. He's toxic and probably bipolar.|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	Always forward, never backwards. Move on!|`|h9L1AtMsaa	I would say that it over, he hurt you once and you loved him anyways and you had to get over him. Now he wants you back because its convenient for him?? Screw that, why would you even give him the chance and what makes you think he wont do it again, this is probably why you don't have the same feelings as you once was. He broke your heart and you had to pick up the pieces and put it back together.What did he have to do?? Realize he was stupid...yeah, but his heart didn't hurt. JUst tell him look you hurt me once, Im not going through that again and how do I know you wont do it again?|`|2P2K0rl2aa	I would advise you not to.  The reason why he was perfectly happy was because he was perfecly happy with someone else.  Now she's gotten rid of him, he has decided to return to you - (otherwise known as his back up plan).    Do you want to be some cheating mongrel's back up plan?  Well if so, then get back with him.  If not, get a real man who knows how to treat you with the respect you deserve.    Best wishes xxxx    PS:  Bipolar is nonsense.  Your ex husband just behaved badly, that's all.|`|H2bpuDsKaa	Out with the old and in with the new..........move on......he had his chance with you and he blew it.....|`|YeChwo70aa	counseling is the best idea, even though you will never fully trust him again|`|4y1R8DoWaa	Don't go back!!! Once a cheater, always a cheater...|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	So the other girl he was screwing around with behind your back didn't work out, hah?  Oh, don't we all feel SO sorry for him!    You should tell him you don't have time for him when he calls because you have a f**k buddy you are dying to see because he does all the things for you he couldn't.|`|1qXLDOiPaa	guuurrlll!!!   NO you shouldnt get back with him after he cheated then HE left YOU   it should've been the other way around!!   and hes probably acting like that cuz now hes lonely cuz the other woman probably left him! so now hes crawling back to you!   You already said it for yourself that you dont feel the same or want him any more..... so you already know the answer to weather you should stay with him or not.... just follow your instincts!!|`|nT7eoF66aa	He's playing games. RUN.    Best wishes.|`|DfdK8lWRaa	No No No No.|`|TRt4tWGFaa	Well since we're going to talk about it.. First wife married two times,,had  three boys by her,,married a another woman,,had custody of all; three,  not because i was better,,only because on paper I was better able too..   When times were on the outs with this wife,I would visit my ex-wife,Yes she had remarried also,,but was on the outs at that time also..Long story short =Ex=Wife's make good quick stand ins..One good disagreement,,  good by..Hello honey I'm home.
vBUEbIvwaa	i am having the same problem as you have now. But sometimes you know what i do? i just listen to my ipod so that i will never hear what that person is talking about. i just move in the world that i createe. if  you love music trust me it helps.|`|0K3h93FAaa	The best way to ignore them properly: Is to NOT ignore them. It's cruel and mean. HOPE THIS HELPS! :)|`|Iswub0E0aa	Well if you are not looking to hurt their feelings then, don't answer their calls, ignore them when you see them.  But, if you are trying not to hurt their feelings tell them you have a lot going on and don't really have anytime.|`|4vhTUtVfaa	join a sports team, tell them you have no time, do excessive amounts of homework, LIE!|`|Ng0oiFvhaa	the best way to ignore somebody properly is just to say (im sorry)or another things but the important thing is not to lie..hope i helped u :) gd luck

Look how many super hot girls chase after super ugly guys|`|YSbCVt3Uaa	She probably loves you for both. However, in time she will get to know the inside better and the looks will no longer be the main attraction. Some good looking people can become very unattractive if they have a crummy personality.|`|iGnUYe9Haa	... does it matter?   haha jk, but seriously,  i have no clue.  If you find out, share.|`|40qTdKuPaa	You have to ask her straight up. Do you like me, or my looks ? And thats it. If you feel she is lying, then she is. Always go for your gut feeling, and you will always win! Hope this helps|`|x51SQHxDaa	ask her|`|bLARMYAfaa	Your looks are part of who you are! Now enjoy your luck, don't ask silly questions. If need be, work out to keep those abs she loves.|`|ukiRDDTeaa	b/c she'll talk to u, and laugh with u, and pretty much just be connected witht that person inside.|`|sjkfjTBdaa	I really hope this is a joke cause thats one of the vainest things i've ever heard  But please put a picture up just for kicks|`|NBBRWd5Gaa	if she meets someone who looks better than you and ditches you in a flash then you'll know|`|r84vevqBaa	Just, you never know right away. For my love, I didn't know I loved her until after I had to move away from her. You never really appreciate a person until you don't see them for a while.     Try spending lots of time with her. hang out, be friends. To know if you love someone is simple. You are comfortable with telling them EVERYTHING. Absolutely everything. You need to be able to hang out with them and do fun stuff with them as you would with your buddies.    You need to be able to love their qualities as much as their faults. Love them for what truly makes them, them.     If you know you love her, you'll know if she loves you back. If you know the feeling, you know when she is reciprocating. You'll recognize it.|`|I59dkJksaa	depends haha how old u?|`|A471ENIBaa	get acid on your face and if she stays with you she likes you.|`|dz7ZepS4aa	Thats hard..um ask her what she likes about you? Sorry i couldnt be more help|`|XLviqEynaa	she is not in love with any you will soon see what she relly loves.  i read that of i foution cookie i think the answer is money.|`|R7DKpBF3aa	wear like a cowboy costume or a dorky hat and see if she still like you. haha.|`|VR2HGqTbaa	well, from my experience, u HAVE to ask. you must ask, or you wil be unsure and that can lead to wrong assumption, recking ur relationship. asking is a universal way of knowing.    hope this  helps|`|8pGATK0Laa	to simply state it: change your look. if she doesn't break up with you or make a major deal about a new look then you know she is in it for you.   but also keep in mind if she doesn't like what you change doesn't mean she is in it for your looks only. she was probably first attracted to you because of how you looked and then she got to know you more and then liked your personality so she pursued the relationship     i guess it might not be as simple as i thought...oops|`|mHt73Uvhaa	Ask her what she likes about you. You'll be able to tell from what answers she gives you. If "you're hot" comes first, then you've found your answer.|`|DrfgUr5iaa	well i think we your in love with someone all they want to do is spend every waking moment with him/her and they also always think about them   like all the time also if they say i love you then most of the time people that say that they mean it   they can like your looks and love you but is she always staring at you if so then she is most likely just likes the way you look  i would say she most likely love you and likes the way you look this is coming from a women too so i hope i gave you some good advice if not i am sorry i tried my hardest to give you my opinion
mtmMQH4Xaa	I don't know whats wrong with her but I do know you should get her in a cool bath and bring that temp down, also put a cool cloth on her forehead.    wish her well|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	sorry, but your sister is faking her fever.  Just because the temp outside is cold does not mean it will affect the temp of a human body inside.      You guys need to leave her alone and tell her to sleep it off.  I guarantee that by morning with no attention she will be fine.|`|Q1jpLEbvaa	She could be very sick. Her body is fighting an infection, check her lymph nodes in her throat. If they're swollen, she has something. If she does, take her to the ER now and tell them she's very ill!    A 104 fever is very dangerous. I hope she feels better|`|AA11108018	First off how could we even begin to think whats wrong her.  Take her to the doctor get her checked again>  If it get worse go back to the ER
6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	Well it would be cool in your story if you went overboard. Maybe, the guy will parachute and on his way down ask, have a horse drawn carriage ride through the streets of NYC...just think really elaborate and extravagant.

4fC6EJWfaa	When I was 16, I had a huge crush on a guy who was legally blind, we went on one "date" out to dinner and I read the menu for him... we ended up being really good friends for about 5 years (we were on the same swim team... I used to read his warm-ups and cool-downs for him off of a whiteboard, I did everything I could to help him when I could) I gave him one of my gold medals when he came to me sad about very narrowly losing a race  He was an awesome person, always made me laugh sometimes till I cried :) Always wish I would have asked him out officially but I was too shy. Does that answer your question?|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Yes, that way I would never need a face lift...seriously I would not say that blindness would put me off someone, however not being able to communicate with one another would be a strain for instance if that person were deaf but look at Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Andrea Bocelli and Geoff Healy for instance, they all got married had  successful careers (in the case of Stevie and Andrea still are)  and had children too.  Being disabled in any way is always a trial in some way or another but it should not stop love coming into that persons life, it does not stop them being a human being with emotions.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	yeah of course i could.|`|HunSyQaSaa	I think I could.The quality of the persons character is first.|`|AA10248966	Absolutely. Sounds wonderful as long as they are fab people.|`|nZXJrAAjaa	Yes of course. If you really like to date one why not right?|`|WjxqhZG9aa	Why not?  Those are ideal circumstances, and if you click, then there's no reason that a disabiliity should stand in the way.|`|Y5IUse1vaa	If the person was fairly independant, I don't see any problem. I would be a bit apprehensive if they expected me to become a full time carer for them. I would hope that I could overcome my silly fears and love the person for who they are, not HOW they are...If I were ever to become disabled in any way, I would like to think that  I could be as normal as possible and enjoy a good relationship with anybody, due to my personality, not my disability!!!|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Love conquers all. l don't see the problem|`|QC94IKIxaa	Yes. Especially as I,m old and ugly. Actually I'm sat here with a beautiful female who doesn't give a toss what Ilook like and she loves me to bits. She's my cat!|`|4x5ajsUpaa	Yes, I would not have a problem with this at all. At least you would always know that they would not judge you by your looks and would be with you for who you are.|`|AkTw3RQuaa	Love is blind  When you fall in love you do not see skin color, religion, creed or any thing but LOVE  Most blind people are independant  OPEN your eyes if you love you..yo love him  You will see (no pun intended) your way thru thisT  So the answer is YES, if all the other parts fit the puzzle  Like if he had a job, sense of humor, decent, honest,common sense   YES I could enter into a relationship/marry with a blind man !|`|eaQuLKbgaa	i could, could u? doesnt matter what other people think, its your choice lady|`|repO76qoaa	Yes but I would do all the driving :)|`|Y08YLysXaa	Of course.

Y08YLysXaa	Umm... rich, or have huge debts, but I'd probably assume they were just rich... probably spend too much on things that don't matter. I'd wonder if they invest as much into their actual family, as opposed to all of the materials. But I have never had that kind of money, so don't really know what I'd do with it! I'd like to think I'd be sensible and live an ordinary life and keep my money a bit of a secret... but I think I would splurge a bit, lol|`|1qa4dFVXaa	My answer would be, what does this have to do with marriage and divorce?    So in the end, I'd get a divorce|`|3iNobwVraa	Nothing, whatsoever.|`|MMnjWEM7aa	Either they've worked hard to become as successful as they are or they're spending money that doesn't belong to them (ie: credit cards)to keep up with the Joneses.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	I hope that isn't my standards for judging people.

lJhl3wLAaa	No. Maybe in the 1960's but not now. I would say about 10 to 15% marry their HS sweethearts. The majority find their mate in college or at work. People change so much from 16 to 24.

AsNcyJZGaa	baby girl, you need to talk to your friend. does she have any idea that you like this kid? if she does, then you have bigger problems. if not, then problem averted. simple as that. talk to her... then take it from there. if you know how to choose the right ones, your friends can be your backbone.|`|yGwda7wPaa	I would talk to your friend and ask her if she likes him.  Tell her how you feel.  If she doesn't like him, and she is your friend, she will back off.  Also, if you really like him, tell him.  See how he responds.|`|e56f34b226a134831834a176960b7128aa	You mean a lot. Not alot.

You dont love him when you just started fliring with him!! If you like him THAT much, you should get to know him and dont have a heart attack!|`|DAeuUBqnaa	wow touch competition  well..do you have any sign that says he might like you back?  cause he might like you better. even if a girl is flirting with him, doesnt mean he will like her back  so make sure or find out who he likes.   Or you can ask your friend like "do you like matt? cause you seem to flirt with him alot?" make your friend say something  if at the end, you really can't find a way, just straight out tell matt how you feel. i understand how you can't stop thinking about him, but you will have to be patience!|`|9DlHjdPnaa	Girl stop being desperate and weak & have some self-respect and dignity. It's girls like you that guys play about. So you're easy. If he truly liked you or found you attractive you would not be asking this question right now. He would have made it known. All guys fancy slim tall pretty girls, thats human nature. This is actually quite embarassing hon, even kids arounf 12 13 are more smarter & wiser and dont suck up like this. Gosh.
tBDVQlbjaa	I had the same situation a few years ago but it was a little different.  I want to say don't take it so seriously...but I also don't mean slack off.  Science sucks and it's a pain, I agree...but try to embrace your teachers methods as a new experience.  Even though the girl isn't really your friend...just be nice to her, it won't kill you.  Also, try to ask her to do some work too...if she's stupid though I would rather do the work all by myself...  Just think of it as, if I can pass this class with an A or B, I can pass any class with an A or B.  Think of it as trying to prove your teacher wrong by showing you can learn through labs AND by taking notes.  Make it a mission for yourself to prove that you can succeed in any situation.  Whenever you have to do a new lab...try picking a different partner each time.  I know that sounds scary for being shy, because I am too.  But honestly, if someone says no...big deal it's over they said no.  You won't remember any of this stuff in a year I bet, so live it up and make the most of it.  I can't help you break out of your shell but I can try to motivate you and give you a little boost.  Be positive.  You will make it through it with no trouble.  Good luck! :D|`|BwNiS2Hmaa	Okay, well for the shy part...you should be yourself. Don't care what others might think when you say something/do something..etc. You only live life once so might as well enjoy it! Once you start speaking up and being confident, life feels 50x better. Trust me, i've been there. So yeah, just be yourself and enjoy life.    Science class, sounds similar to my situation. My first semester class was liek that as well. I just passed time talking to 2 girls who i really didn't like, and they didn't like me. I had no choice though. Even all the guys were jerks so i just got by like that. Finally, I finished that class! After writing my exam, I don't have to bother looking at any of my classmates faces again. A semester goes by pretty fast. So you shouldn't worry about it. You said its in the middle of the 2nd semester. Well you got half of it left! Not bad...at least  you have that one girl to work with. It's better than being all alone. If you're stuck doing all the work, sometimes you gotta deal with it. Thats just how things are sometimes. But don't worry you'll get through it just fine. :)|`|NIzZm4b3aa	talk to the girl like how u would talk to urr friends. Comment her new shirt(jeans,ect), ask her what she did 4 the weekend, stuff like that. Try to start a conversation. Just remember to laugh and have fun. For the teacher, try taking notes while doing labs. Or go to ur teacher & tell him. Good;uck!

I think they should relax a little.|`|zidR98rPaa	wow you need to be a kid you have to much responsability tell them what you said to us and see what they say tell them you have to much to do and if they get mad or upset just tell them that ur a kid and they should worry about there buisness themselevs.|`|tc8nbxmyaa	Yes they do ask too much of you. Even if they are strict and close-minded, talk to them about this anyway.|`|LXxxAzIqaa	Just choose to focus on school and don't worry about everything else.

XD    myspace.com/myloveoutweighsignorance    :)|`|sB2MvRR5aa	Think: what is worse? Losing her friendship from this fight or having her hate you? Also, she is being awful, she has no right to treat you like that. If you let her get away with it then you might as well be encouraging her. In my opinon you should find a new friend; someone that will treat you with respect. Pull away from her slowly. But, if you still want to be her friend then you have EVERY right to ask her what's up. If she says "nothing" then don't bug her... move on. It will be good to have a closure. But who knows maybe she does have a reason and you two can work it out.|`|iUBURTb7aa	OMG!!!!!! THIS HAPPENED TO ME TOO! like my best friend gets mad because i "copied him" and he got so p. od. that i had to just say "dude why are we fighting?" and then he said, "idk i think you copied me or something" and then we started talking and became friends again. you should try to do the same thing. if you do, i think it would work between you two. just try to find out why she is mad, and then say sorry even if your not, and then talk about it. then you may be friends again! vote me the best! jk.........
kERP7zAhaa	guy with a gun|`|EYLSyeajaa	well their both potentially dangerous:    satan is evil. guy worships evil. murder is evil. gf gets murdered.  i dont like the sound of that.    guy with gun. pulls trigger. dead gf.  thats not much better.    guy with gun, i guess. snipers are hott ;D|`|SF5WnQFQaa	GUY WITH GUN!|`|COmp4sIuaa	Satanist. He can't kill me as quickly as a guy with a gun.    Neither would be my friends, though...|`|jeHTjvbaaa	Lol weird question man... how do the two correlate?  Plus, I shoot guns and I'm not dangerous at all!... well, maybe just a little =P|`|gp5KrhrPaa	A guy who is Satanist, it's just a religion, it's not changing who he is, just his beliefs|`|AA10652271	neither one.|`|N8GLJpdlaa	a gun    paintballers are hot|`|lRemKlvOaa	wow please dont tell me your a satanist with a gun. but people with guns arent always bad or atleast goin to kill you|`|cdUCCHgaaa	omg the gun. becuase if hes a satanist then satan will make him shoot me anyway!  the gun could be protection anyways.|`|2Y9U5jlGaa	Really niether but preferably the guy with the gun. Because call me a loser if you want but I am a proud Christain.|`|8Gm9dKOiaa	i want to try to talk to the satanist and how its kinda... wrong....but if i do die by a guy with a gun so let it be?|`|zIISRkjMaa	gun. the satanist would probably sacrafice me.|`|jYMlAN4Paa	The satanist. I've known a few. With the exception of our beliefs being a bit different, they were awesome people, very kind and helpful. Sadly, most people have no clue what their religion is about at all because of fears fueled by other religions and their stereotypes, movies and killers who claim to be satanists. Sad, really.    A guy with a gun...I don't trust him. Been with many guys who owned guns and it was very uncomfortable and difficult to be around them.|`|BIcLN41jaa	I wouldn't date either.|`|DqzhHZnoaa	satanist.    we just wont talk about religions. guy with the gun can kill me, dude.|`|9LGInLsYaa	NEITHER~!|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	Since I will never become a satanist, and I am sure he will want me to convert, I will pick the guy with the gun.  I would rather be shot than sacrificed to satan.|`|4l90fBqIaa	I rather talk to the satanist and hear all the b*llSh*t he has to say|`|SXS2Gf72aa	You've got satanist wrong.|`|OFGV2Jj2aa	living in the small Idaho city I live in, seeing someone with a gun is not rare at all. a satanist is not a potential threat, so either way, I dont care much for... although if I saw a guy that looked gangster-ish with a gun, I might be pretty freaked out, but here, its just hunters and cowboys and all.    btw, why is this in the singles & Dating section?
fHfVRcqbaa	Okay, this is a little freaky, and I am not even going to go into the psychology of the reasons that make this weird.    Having said that, there are pills you can take to induce lactation.  I don't know if I would talk to my regular Dr about it though, LOL!|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Oh, Lord. I have to go vomit now.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	You and your husband are just plain weird more then anything else.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	I've read about ppl like you guys.Hey who doesn't like a bit of nipple action, I don't like it to the point of feeding bc my nips would get chapped but whatever floats your boat...Google it.I read somewhere that if your hubbs sucks regularly milk will come out on its own and you will start to produce it.When I say regularly I mean at the same times and for a prolonged period of time.I don't think many women do this.Hey, i've heard of ppl who have necrophilia and that is much crazier to me than this is.|`|XTBlOf9baa	I really just have to say, that there's been this big uproar over whether or not breast feeding should be allowed in public places or whether pictures of it are appropriate online such as Facebook, and it's really because of people like you and your husband that turn something natural and beautiful like breast feeding a child into something disgusting sexual and degrading. It really saddens me to know that when I have kids I'll have to hide in bathrooms to breast feed my child, stay at home when my child needs fed, and be restricted on something that's natural, because there are sick people out there like you that sexualize something like this.|`|Rzsudrzqaa	Thats actually pretty normal. I find it erotic also BUT, no... we've never done it... because I HATE lactating.. I breastfed each of my kids as long as I could stand it but having CONSTANTLY leaking breasts kind of ruins the fantasy for me.   But to each his/her own.|`|ScHW4842aa	I have actually thought how cool it would be to breastfeed my husband too. I cant wait to have a baby, (obviously not for that reason) but it would be such a bonus to be able to be that intimate with him.     Im not joking, either, incase this sounds sarcastic.|`|ugRN86bYaa	freaky and sick|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	lol..I can tell you my ex husband and I did this but after I had just given birth. He wanted to try it etc...no big deal. Not to sure how you would go about doing it though if you are not pregnant. Maybe ask your Dr. They have pills to stop producing milk, maybe there is one to start too!...lol  Good Luck|`|1nk8WPrtaa	I think it's awesome! I used to force my husband to drink my breast milk. But I was already breastfeeding. I used to love squirting random people in the face too!|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	My second husband tried to take over the breast when I had my second child. I had to finally cut him off  cause he was taking my son's dinner!!    I haven't heard of anyone inducing lactation before.  Better hope you find a freaky dr. :-)|`|gJE0ujbzaa	I understand it's pretty common. Do a google on it, and you'll find lots of groups dedicated to it.    It's not very safe to induce lactation if you have not been pregnant. It means taking hormones, and it can really really screw you up.  Particularly since no respectable doctor will give you the hormones needed for what you want, and you'd have to take a big risk buying them illegally.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	I think what 2 or more consenting adults do in the private is there own business - as long as both are of legal age and mentally competent.    If you wanna do it, go for it.      Married 22 years.  But haven't done that - not yet anyway.  Hmmm, honey got a minute?|`|JVvnET59aa	Haha..this actually turns me on too. I'm not sure why?? I've never done it but have fantasized about in many times. LOL :)|`|zHwlGhIAaa	its nothing wrong with having a fetish as long as it does not include children or animals.  Always remember that the women that explore fetishes with their husbands are usually the one's with husbands at home insteado f with other women.  when i couldn't lactate for my son i took fenugreek it is sold in gnc and other health food stores look it up it may work for you. good luck and have fun!|`|Y08YLysXaa	Inducing lactation is NOT HEALTHY. Just let him suck on your nipples, geez.|`|VBCPdcetaa	That actually sounds like fun. never done it though but i hope you find out how!|`|jjj6n5fEaa	It's very nice that both of you have found some thing very exiting and turning on. I wish you can make your dream happened very soon, but if it was impossible, then just move on and don't think about it.     Good luck with your exiting dreams!|`|lvelp0CGaa	Actually this is not freaky to 89% of society how ever you are explaining your desire wrong and the explanation your looking for to your desire its got nothing to do with the mother instinct or the desire to breast feed . Whether you have children or not .    During intercourse the most explicit erogonous zone is your breasts and the nuzzling you desire is not to actually release milk to your spouse but to just feel the warmth and nuzzling of the mouth and suction upon your breasts . Many couple's enjoy this sensual enjoyment .    Its not freaky its quite enjoyable so dont confuse the meaning and scare men all over the world with this interpretation you've chosen and ruin it for the rest of us this is not some freakish breast feeding fetish .    Honey Bee 1 has absolutely NOTHING to do with the other get over yourself . People like you misintrepreting is what causes government and common street people to catagorize and try to have public breast feeding stopped geez it aint rocket science to learn the understanding of things .|`|Tgqji3lLaa	My girl and I have the same fetish as you and your husband.  Nothing is wrong with it!  It's yum yum for me lol.    Have fun!
oaF2kaXAaa	Nah. Move on. In this game of love and hate the only answer is the separate. I have learned that if you ever have to break-up with someone once, twice.... or more even... it is not the right person, and you are only wasting time when you could be out there finding the right person.|`|DbNbWQflaa	yes dont give up maybe you can tell hm he needs to  open up more cause you want to help and you cant if yo dont know what is going on. some people are just that way closed up and shy or they may think they feel stupid or vulnerable.|`|23bs0kAKaa	Yes you just have to sit down and talk with him and tell him that he just has to try to open up better and more often, and promise that you will hear him out well and not just shoot him down or get upset (thats what hes worried about i think, that you will get mad)|`|3JfADTIDaa	Ask yourself. Will you work with him on this issue for five more years? Communication problems most times run deep. It could be tricky, and you might end up hurt many more times before he even begins to improve. weigh your options, how much you're both willing to commit, how long you've been together, etc. Good Luck|`|iQDjdr2naa	No. no matter how much you try, a relationship cannot work with only one person communicating and trying. He has to give too for it to work. so if he is the type who would rather bottle it in than avoid conflict, for the rest of your lives your relationship will be great for a while (on your end) until he's reached his limit and explodes on you again. this won't change unless he changes and you are able to get him to tell you when things bother him. ask him, in all fairness, how he expects you to do any better if  you don't know what it is you're doing or when to upset him. i say dont even try again cause the same thing will happen unless he does something different. good luck!|`|DqzhHZnoaa	help him.  tell him he can tell you anything, and make sure he knows you mean it. tell him no matter what's wrong, he can tell you, and trust you with that information. be open and honest with him, and let him know hes not alone. if you really like/love/care for him, then yes, its worth it|`|zcMZFmnnaa	move on. communication is the building block of a relationship. with out that you have only the first level so to speak. you should be able to tell each other everything. even if that everything is that he is unhappy with you or visa versus. but at least then one of you can walk away and find happiness. the other will end up regreting losing you.|`|xg0jALAgaa	NO. Communication in a relationship is most important. If you feel like this guy has the qualities you desire than take another shot and work on the communication. But if there are more lows than highs why fight against the current. Remember Friendship and Communication is key.
rQfzifT7aa	In truth it probably wont. Unless the both of you are willing to start communicating. When I say that I mean able to talk to the other one without the other one being so defensive and an arguement starting. You have to be willing to make a fresh start and start a new friend ship and gain an understanding of what the other one wants and don't want.  Being clingy is one thing and I see nothing wrong it but suffocating is something else. Start a friendship and build from that.|`|AA10248966	Marraige counseliong to redefine the relationship and retool the marriage.      First, however, I;d get in ten to twenty slots in a therapist's office alone.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Your husband has either got tired of you or is a selfish prick.    He got married to you and now he said your crowding him...that's a crock of bull. He just has taste buds for some other woman I think.|`|mbDp1IHuaa	Go to marriage counseling right away.  I am very sorry for what you've been through & what your going through.  good luck & i hope you have a happy ending :] ?|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	It doesn't survive. Move on and learn to be happy and independent with yourself, then find a man who loves you more then you love him! Best advice grandma ever gave me.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	You need to have joint marriage counseling if you want to save this marriage.  To be fair, you probably did a lot of damage when you were being so clingy and smothering.  That kind of behavior can seriously impair feelings.  And - I wonder what you are learning with the counselor for yourself?  You can be independent, without an absence of caring.  It sounds as though you are being independent in a defensive or hostile way, as a reaction to his attempts to get you to be more independent.  To be helpful in your life, it needs to be a positive and loving independence, not a negative and defensive one.  Love is something you have to have in yourself for yourself, before you have it to give away - this is not something that someone can give to you if you don't have it already, otherwise it is like trying to fill a bottomless pit.  I still don't see that you love yourself - I just see that you are walled off behind the castle moat.|`|oGoIxiQ0aa	it won't.|`|NfFXo1uFaa	i hate to say it but a lot of women are going thru what you are experiencing.  Seek professional or supportive groups to help guide you.  You DO matter.|`|4y1R8DoWaa	If he really loved you, he would have been more supportive from the beginning.  I think your marriage is over....|`|bB8b7HXvaa	Well, when two people don't care about the only thing tying them together, usually it won't survive.    You need to both go together to a marriage counselor if you really want to save the marriage. Also, try talking to friends who know both of you really well about it.    Otherwise, I suppose the only thing you can do is divorce him. I think what happened to you at first wasn't love. You never experienced the love of your parents as a child, and were desperate for something to hold onto in the absence of other things. Marriage is supposed to be the permanent bond of two people who love and depend on each other at all times. If your own husband says you're smothering him, he isn't treating you the right way. If he doesn't care to make sacrifices for you and the marriage, then he doesn't deserve you.    But don't take anyone's word for it until you see a marriage counselor. Find one right away and go talk to them.    I hope it all works out. Good luck.|`|NegxfXzgaa	Sounds like you just latched onto the first thing that seemed reliable,dependable,secure,and trustworthy.You are learning how to be independent,take what you have learned from the relationship,and GO. Be you're own person,and be more confident in the future.It is a step by step process,this is one of you're steps.Continue to see the counselor,and grow and be stronger.
rO0nsbs4aa	you can be sexy but not slutty. you can rub his back slowly but do it once in awhile. it will leave him wanting more.you can avoid him sometimes but don't make it seem like you just vanished. Sex helps too but that will make you seem like a booty call.or you can do what i do you can give him a kiss he would never forget.you first give him a normal kiss then you slowly put your tongue in his mouth and trace the outline of his mouth.slowly touch the tip of his tongue to his then back away.it will leave him wanting more.|`|pAyl6M1faa	great sex helps with this situation.|`|66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	Kill his pet.

You wont know unless you ask him. Dont be scared. If you want answers you have to ask questions! hope this helps.|`|AA11865982	You just be you and if he happens to like you then great. If not then well, I'm sorry that's just how it goes. People have different tastes, but the thing is if he really likes you, he will. If not, then move on. There are a lot of guys in this world.|`|K2Et4Hyaaa	make him happy and dont be mean and never cheat on him and dont let it get boring|`|NWpitkauaa	give him the best ******** ever|`|2b7NEgyMaa	Get him a bouquet of forget-me-not flowers..hehe|`|Tw5BP4Z8aa	I already told you stop asking multiple times damn|`|aWPfvwilaa	LOL I asked this too! So far I have gathered to be yourself be fun and give head  Some of the answers were funny but I loved every answer  (((hugs!)))|`|4l90fBqIaa	I don't think you have much control over this, it depends on him if he likes you fine if not just move on,that's just how it goes.
r4vihoHIaa	People do die and life goes on. That doesn't mean forget about her though. You do have to assume the best and have yourself prepared for the worst. If the worst comes or you even never hear anything again, you have to move on and not let it effect your life. I'm sure your aunt would be upset if you didn't live to your fullest potential because of her. After this long it might be smart to honor her but live your life. And don't let people get you down about it. We are cruel creatures, brush them off your shoulder.|`|AA11108018	When a love one disappears like your aunt did you never really totally get over it   In the back of your mind you wonder what happened and why it happened.  In time some how you learn to live and go on but never forget.

kSlN7MjEaa	Tell him you like him you are sorry about the gossip.  If thats the only reason he stopped going out with you he may take you up again.  If other people are gossiping there's not much you can do except ignore it and dont join in with them by adding to it!!!!!!!!!  Gossip can really wreck relationships. In your case all might not be lost so give it a try. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Guys don't like girls who get into a lot of drama, it's a fact. Change your personality a little bit.. or change whatever is making him not want to get back together with you.|`|VTjevIEHaa	stopp the gossip i guess.. tell him its nt gonna happen|`|Pt9SRn6Jaa	steop the gossip make sure that things wont go haywire as soon as you two get back together.

Do you really want someone who, besides being dishonest with you, apparently doesn't love you? You can let him know that you're open to other options, but you're not going to wait for him forever. Be true to thine self.
0PHRkiomaa	The poor man has been driven insane by the ridiculous askings of his church. I mean.... it sounds like his marriage failed because of her not him and now he has found someone he wants to be with his stupid church frowns upon it! It's enough to drive anyone insane! He feels trapped by his beliefs vs his heart. This is why I think so many religions have it wrong. Religion should be about love not about frowning upon those who have found themselves in hard circumstances. My new partner had an episode like you're describing. He married his wife because she "accidently" got pregnant, and after years of abuse from her left.... then when we got together she harrassed him to the point that he lost it oneday. Triggered by me because I said I'm not sure if I can deal with her harrassing us (she was ringing me constantly too). He was curled in the foetal position sobbing (and he has always been the strong non emotive type.... I'd known him for 5ys before this) and I realised.... there is only so much the human mind can take. He thought he was going to lose me and couldn't cope with the fact that it was because he'd made all these mistakes and slept with a woman he didn't love, then married her because she was pregnant. Your man reached his threshold when you said that. He did this because he couldn't bare the thought of losing you over this. Your his love in his mind, and in his mind his past mistakes are why he is losing you. The poor man. By the way, men are more prone to these psychological breakdowns as they are less likely to show emotions all the time like women tend to do, They bottle it all up til it just explodes. He's been trying to keep it together for you. That's my opinion. The only thing his ex has to do with it is that he views her as the biggest mistake of his life and the thing that is preventing him from having a happy life with you.    Oh... and no, the behaviour is not normal in the sense that people don't exhibit this behaviour every day. But it is normal in the sense that everyone's mind will reach breaking point at some stage. Have you ever lost control? I'm thinking that many people can't understand these breakdowns as they haven't experienced them before (lucky people). I myself have experienced it on three occasions. Once when I lost my house and nearly my father in a bushfire, once when I was raped, and once when I divorced. Once you've been through it yourself your pretty understanding when it happens to others. And the fact that he's a man doesn't make it any different. He's still human. If you had posted this question here as a guy asking about the women he loves I'm thinking your responses may have been a bit different. He's stressed to the max.... try and guide him to some counselling.... a psychologist not some religious person from his church.|`|onbwN4csaa	I agree with RMF.    You crushed his world.  Stuck between two loves. He's love of god and he's love for you.    His love for you rates among to best. Just look at his two loves.    He believes in both.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	Please don't have children with this man.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	This guy has problems that he needs to deal with.  Do not even consider being his next wife. Give yourself some space away for him.  You can not fix whatever is broken in him.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	I mean this in all seriousness.....be afraid, be very afraid. That is NOT normal behavior...not at all! And this might also give you insight into why his ex beat him up. Can you imagine dealing with a grown man acting crazy like that for an extended period of time? Do not just walk away from this guy...RUN away...quickly! He's obviously not stable.|`|Y08YLysXaa	Wow, he sounds stressed. Pressure from the church can drive people insane. We often view them as authority figures and when they tell us something is unnaceptable, wrong etc it's easy to feel very influenced by that. If his wife beat him up, I think that is grounds for a divorce. I don't take divorce lightly, probably adultery and physical abuse are my limits. I think you two should take time out from this very strict church and consider talking to a different minister from maybe a non-denominational church. It's a good thing to go to church, but it is more important to have a good relationship with God and not be clouded by other human beings' judgements.    Very religious people told my fiance and I that we couldn't be together, because my faith can be rocky. It's unfair for people to decide who can and can't be together. I'm sure his church cares about him but I don't think they are helping him at all. He obviously didn't just get tired of his wife and divorce her, she beat him up!    I hope you two can sort it out.|`|wk1RDK3raa	This is definately abnormal emotional behavior. One has to think that he could be dangerous to your health and his. (Physically)~ RUN!|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Could you not just change your church to one with a more realistic veiw of LOVE and relationships. I do wish you both all the happiness that a truly loving marraige can bring|`|MVxFOI5naa	He is deeply in love with you and deeply hurt that you won't wait for him-give him another chance or change churches and get married in a more accepting church.|`|lvelp0CGaa	Oh yes he is very patient and loving , wait a minute it was HE who made claim the church wont allow him to re-marry again until blah blah blah .....    Did you know that in the time both before and after the lord marriage had absolutely NOTHING to do with religion ? No ? wow there you go ya learn something new everyday .    He has you right where he wants you he is divorced and is bitter for what his ex put him through during the marriage your young naive and easily lead and you believe everything your told . He is neither self controlled nor religious he is a control freak who has to have everything his own way ALL the time , his ex wife is lucky to be free of him , he is very immature and a mere child compared to real men rolling into a foetal position after hitting himself in the head omfg thats just so wrong on many levels RUN AWAY and dont look back he is an abuser and your lucky to be free of his stupidity . He needs to just grow the hell up using emotional blackmail after using the church to hide his insecurity to re-marry that is so 1970's .    He inflicted the wounds from his 1st marriage failing and he damn well knows it man if I had your address I'd come show you exactly what I mean about his abusive behaviour but I dont so I just hope you have the sense to leave this male . NO NO NO NO this does NOT mean he loves you it just means everything he had worked so hard for to control you went out the window so he upped the anti by emotionally abusing you in a different manner please dont have children with this person because you will be back in 2 years time pleading for advice because he is hurting you and your children emotionally and physically , oh I'm sorry you thought christians couldnt break the law of a book written for man by man to control man / woman and child and physically / emotionally / verbally abuse their spouse and family ? Yeah you need to wake up right now .|`|GQrSSRAhaa	I think it is abnormal, if it scared you take it as a sign. He seems to be very emotionally unstable. Can you imagine yourself being married to a man who can act that way instead of trying to communicate in a normal manner? Not me, sister. It hard to realize that sometimes the man who seems like "the one" really isn't what you want at all. I'd count myself lucky that I saw this behavior before vows were exchanged and try to move on.|`|mFZeEm9paa	That is EXTREMELY abnormal, and I would say based on what you said that he has a mental problem and is using you to try to cover up his own truth. Sorry to say, it isn't love, his reaction is most likely not even about you, and it is definitely not about his love for you. It is him trying to purposefully overreact, and getting the reaction he wants from you... Not to end it.    This guy is a great manipulater, you need to keep your options open. Think about it, why on earth did his ex WIFE beat him up? Usually it is the other way around. Something must have gotten to her... There is alot to this man that you don't know.     MOVE ON!|`|fb2d92b771dcd4d8b2d1dc3da6af3e05aa	its odd that you have to even ask if this is abnormal behavior, i cant imagine where you have grown up.  I dont mean to put down the church and its works, but many people who are "born again christians" or really really into religion have serious problems.  Im not saying that religion causes it, but it is one way they can deal with whatever problems they have, and it sounds like this guy has many.  Find someone your own age and live life and worry about getting married later.|`|c1wCuGzpaa	Aww that is sooo sad. I dont even know what to say. About the whole getting married thing....I just dont know. I would continue to pray about that situation. I hope things work out for the both of you. Take care sweety.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	My friend - If i were standing there watching the whole charade - I would have handed him an oscar for his performance.    It was a PERFORMANCE, in order to guilt you out of your decision.  He deliberately played on your compassion and guilt in order to manipulate you.      By the way, I don't believe that story about his ex wife, her beating him up and leaving sounds a bit far fetched to me - especially after that hurrendous tantrum he threw at you.  If he's capable of this now - imagine how much worse it would be if you were married - geez.    Anyway, it's your choice what happens from here on in.  But whatever you choose to do, please use your head, and don't allow him to emotionally blackmail you into anything you feel is not right.  Listen to your gut too - 9 times out of 10 it is right.
7X82RNuiaa	hmm he does sound creepy. Just tell him exactly what you said, that you need a little privacy, and its hard getting used to him being there. Or if that doesn't work then just close the doors. lol.|`|dRWDV6Rlaa	tell your mom i guess|`|RqDgxhTHaa	that gives me creep too. try talking to ut mother about it. it's easier to talk to ur mom when u don't really know him. but if u must, then tell the truth. like, 'im really sorry to say this but ur scaring me out' and tell him why. be sure ur mother's around u cuz.. u don't know what will happen to u.|`|ssrLnvvWaa	make sure you have a lock on your bedroom door and tell your mom|`|UP8F6PDMaa	Close you door    Or in a stern way say stop doing that.|`|XiT8q49Daa	i had a stepdad before (they're divorce now) and he's kinda like yours sometimes. only mine a lot creepier. he would sneek up on my sister and tried to do stuff to her that i could not even imagine. i talked to my mom about it and since then i was asked to stay in her room with her. one time when i fell asleep, my maid woke me up crying because she saw my stepdad was trying to rape my sis. I freaked the hell out and called the poolice. it was drama that day.    the reason i shared this story with you is because i don't want you to be the same when you still have the chance to prevent it. find a lock for your door and try to have company or your friends with you when you're alone in the house, with him in it. please do....|`|uXeGsxSVaa	Maybe you should ask your mom to speak to him and just bypass the conversation with him|`|o1pXRFtUaa	ew disgusting! I would tell your mom about that and see what she has to say... yuck!|`|mvZTm2pjaa	WHOOOAHH THATS ******* WEIRD, i think he probably watches u sleeep, hesg onna try to mollest u or something, ur taking this all too calmly, go tell u rmom before he does something illegal to u.|`|C5Wlt3rGaa	You should just tell him that it scares you a little.  Your not used to him being there, so you don't realize its him at first.  And at night, you should close your door if you don't already and lock it.  That would help during the middle of the night.    And also,  TELL YOUR MOTHER!!!|`|Mdv5lv8haa	you dhould let your mom no....cuz almost anything you say as far as tellin him to stop being creepy is gonna make it seem like hes bein reepy....sonds kinda perverted to me though.....|`|xO0IjDpNaa	The only thing you could do is talk to your mom about it or just close and lock your door. and if that doesnt work tell him to give you some space.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Well... the first thing is make sure your body is covered... the ol' t-shirt and undies isn't an option any more.  Secondly, hit the hardware store and get a replacement doorknob with a keyed lock for your bedroom door, and wear the key around your neck. Get in the habit of locking yourself in before going to bed.    Talk to your mom. So what if having a step-daughter is a novel experience for him, he is invading your privacy and creeping you out... it make you feel threatened. Make her have a talk with him.    You need to get a little more forceful (but relatively polite) with him... asking him what he wants is a good way. Getting up and making the statement that you would like some privacy, and shutting your door is another one.|`|P4u9yOHKaa	he's thinking of "things" to do with u....TELL UR MOM SOON.!!!!!!!!!B4 something horrible happens.tell her what's he doing.|`|yngXCPjEaa	Maybe you should talk to your mom about it.|`|J8gcsIjnaa	close the door and lock it. no lock? buy one|`|JfumPukYaa	he does sound creepy...I would tell your mom.|`|uNd6OPCdaa	dunt get this the wrong way but i think he is tryin to do some sexual activity to you|`|BBws5hl7aa	look in the mirror...  are you hot? if yes thats the answer: he wants to hurt you sexually....  ugly yourself up!|`|mO5mwS0Uaa	Tell your mom.  LIke Oprah says " Go with your instincts".  If he gives you the creeps its for a reason.|`|bFnpUdikaa	talk to him and just say that u are glad that he is married to mom and if he could please give you a little privacy|`|mcymZfuAaa	I think you defiantly need to tell your mom. maybe try putting a PLEASE KNOCK sign on your door.|`|QGC16QlDaa	girl u r just like me i have a stepdad to and he gives me the creeps too!!!!|`|JQrGknfMaa	Talk to your mom about it and be open and honest about how he creeps you out.|`|eVPW1dwOaa	Get your mom involved and tell her how you feel. He is probably unaware that his actions creep you out, and since you've spoken to him already alone, you should tell you mom.|`|mK75BMqdaa	maybe hes a vampire lol just ask him can you give me some privacy? its not that hard but maybe i don't know i don't have one i don't even have a dad but it shouldn't be that hard good luck^^ p.s. dont let him bit you ;) lol|`|GSOLv83Waa	Talk to your mom about it first. If it doesn't stop, talk to them  both about it openly. If it still doesn't stop talk to another family member too so they know this is going on.|`|Nytn8HB8aa	You do NOT need to worry about offending him. Let that be the first thing I tell you.     An older man should never stare at you in a way that makes you uncomfortable. I don't care if he's your step father or any other male presence in your life. You've asked him to stop and he hasn't. That is not acceptable.     First, you need to tell somebody. If you're on good terms with your mother, tell her. Hell, show her this question you posted. Let her know that something is weird. If you don't want her to talk to your step dad about it, tell her that, too. But make sure you aren't the only one who knows he's creeping you out. I personally think you should tell her and have her address his behavior. If he feels like he's "caught" or being watched, he'll probably be less likely to do it. Though, it might put even more of a strain on your relationship.     If you can't tell your mom, tell a teacher you like, tell your best friend, your BFF's mom, an aunt, your brother, I don't care. Make sure somebody else knows.     I know it sounds kind of overboard, but I'd rather you take every precaution against a potential predator (and you don't have to get raped or groped for molestation to happen; it doesn't necessarily have to be a "serious" event) and be safe than stay silent and wish you hadn't.     Communication is the key. And if all else fails, just say, "Hey [name], would you mind knocking on my door next time you come into my room? And I'd prefer if you gave me a little more privacy around the house."    Simple as that.|`|qN92yLzMaa	I don't know if there is a nice way.      Have you talked about this with your Mom?  If no, it's a place to start, however a lot of women don't want to "see" this kind of thing, so if she won't deal with him, you need to tell him straight up that what he's doing is rude and in your eyes he looks like a lecherous creep.  But tell someone about his behavior if Mom won't deal with it.    And from now on - close your door and lock it when you're sleeping.  If you don't have a lock, put some (jingle) bells on the knob (only at bedtime so as not to give away that you're doing it).  That way if he tries to open the door while you're asleep it will hopefully wake you up.    Where is your biological Dad?  Can you talk with him about it?|`|n7pnvk18aa	His a pervert! a dude with night vision goggles.  Stay away from him as possible and do tell your mom!|`|qAvZlor0aa	hmm that is creepy. you should tell your mom how you feel|`|yiWQYTk6aa	If you're getting creeped out that badly talk to you're mom about. If you don't want to offend him maybe she can talk to him instead.|`|VTiyxgCtaa	if your pretty then that might tell you something. if thats not the case tell your mom how you feel about him if not they'll see you weak and keep doing it.
IYgTS1eiaa	i have the EXACT same problem.  I Love  Megan SO MUCH!!!!!!!!  I write songs about her, am currently writing a book about love, writing poetry that involves everyone dieng.   but when i talk to her i am so happy.  I am so depressed when i am not around her  and i am not when i am around her.  the simplist way to deal with it is...  1, tell them u like them.  2, then tell them u love then a few days later  3, tell people how u feeel  4, just do what your heart wants    that is what i am doing and i have went from crying 3 times a day during school, every night, even infront of my parents to about once or twise a day    Hope i helped and beleave me, it will get better eventually. and he might like you. megan didnt like me, she likes an older guy (we are 12). have a nice day and remenber, it will be good eventually :)|`|D4RDJmJzaa	you love him because obviously you love him. tell him how you feel...|`|h5JQBgtMaa	mmmhhmm. does he know you like him? mb you should just say something. you need to obtain him...them mb you'll stop being so obsessed. or...if its not possible to be his GF then find a fatal flaw in him, something that'll make you stop thinking about him. something that'll make you totally grossed out and disgusted by him.|`|C8wipA65aa	Find an incredible hobby that makes you very happy and go on a vacation ... if that does not work, tell him how you feel... and that should nip it in the bud, it usually does!|`|fHHeal1Vaa	yes, whenever you want me served to you on a plate, just let me know darling. you keep waiting. you waited for me to "take a first flight to you" when we just started communication, waited for me to "save you", "rescue all your family, my sister Caroline and all others", you waited for me "to check into your clinic" the moment I wrote the fu=-ck-off David mail to Caroline to get rid of your all nights attacks on me, you still wait for me "to express my true feelings", to "help you", you wait you wait you wait because my God you know you know for sure you know 100 percent that it will be all ok in the end "the good will prevail" and you just need to wait.......poor old man|`|9d7e30bbec8e3c07ebc66e53cac9fa13aa	thats how my ex was   (she asked me out and i went out with her trust me if he is around u he likes u and if u are hot enough u will get a yes no matter what i know its hard to ask a guy out but give it a shot go 4 it)  I find that very sweet and not emo i love ur style|`|hDAoKmjPaa	sounds like you are a little obsessive. try doing things and hanging out with people that dont involve him. or you can go a completly different route and try and ask him out that way you can have your love and you wont have to be so depressed..
EibGIpaKaa	You poor girl, I'm so sorry that you are going through this. Please know that kids don't cause divorce. A failed marriage does.   Tell your mother all that you want is for her to be your mother. Tell her you need her and want her in your life even if it's for short visits or phone calls. (this could be a start)    I'm sure you are angry that she left, tell her you are. Then tell her you want her in your life and that you know you will forgive her if she cares enough for you.     She is probably filled with shame and guilt for leaving you and your sister and it will be very hard for her to face you. It's much easier (sadly) for her to distance herself from you. That's probably why she has lost contact with you. It's just easier for her, but not for you.  I hope she sees how much her girls need her and that you can have a good relationship in time.  Good luck!|`|Q1MI6L96aa	A heart is drawn with "Love" written above and "Miss You" on the bottom...with a brief poem/free verse. Keep it simple and you will be able to express yourself much better.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	YOU DID NOTHING WRONG TO MAKE HER LEAVE!!!!!!  Get that idea out of your head!!!!   It was their marriage, her life that made her unhappy, NOT YOU!!!!  Children of divorced parents OFTEN FEEL GUILTY WHEN IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT!!!!    I'm very sorry you are so alone.  Write her what you feel.  Why did she leave?  Why don't you see her anymore?  Tell her you miss her and want to see her.  Tell her everything!!!  Maybe it will make a difference in her mind and get her to reconnect with you.|`|kK8JAMvUaa	Just get it all out in the letter.    Why'd you leave? I would like to see you more often..   and everything else. doesn't matter if it's well written or not. your mom will get an idea. cross your fingers and wait for a reply.|`|eVPW1dwOaa	You need to find another female mentor that isn't your mother. She is obviously having a hard time keeping in touch with you, and I am sorry to say, she is not making the best effort. How about a teacher you really like, or an aunt. Every girl definitely needs an older woman they can talk to, but your Mom doesn't seem to be the best option. Have you heard of the Big Brother/ Big Sister program? It's really fun, and it could be exactly what you need right now. Remember, you did nothing to make her leave, and none of this is your fault.|`|Qe8LE7DFaa	SORRY IT'S KINDA LONG BUT HELPFUL!LET ME KNOW IF IT WORK EMAIL ME BUT IT'S SURE TO WORK TRUST ME!  i hope this help you more than other people answers! first thing if you feel that you are the problem of your mother and father divorce it's not your fault you were to young to know what was happening. i pretty sure your mother love you and would love to see you but she might have problems going on in her head.  when you write your mother start off by greeting her asking how was her day, how is she doing things like that. then say mother i have been thinking about something and it really have been bothering me why dont' you come around any more? why you don't call me no more? how come you stay so distant from me? daddy accidentally told me about you and him and how you left and got an divorced. i love you both but i want you to tell me what happened and why you left, i want you to tell me the truth! i know back then i was to young to know but now i have the maturity to know. sister and daddy is always gone and i need someone to talk to. i have all these emotions built up inside of me and i want to express them to you my mother so please tell me what happened to you and my dad i promise i will love you the same way. and you have to make a promise to that you will be in my life when ever you get the chance to!
WKxuvTMIaa	i just emailed u... i can talk anytime.... please feel free to talk when u need to     lesley enns|`|KszocgnSaa	Lol I just emailed you a little bit ago. Im is faster, should have been using that.
q3FDAQ9Baa	If he's not living up to the first court decision, the courts are smart enough to see through his BS. He's hoping she'll back down.    He would have to find some wrong doings within the home. Abuse, sexual abuse, malnourished, drugs, over use of booze.  No roof over their heads, no shoes on their feet.  Things like that.|`|nZXJrAAjaa	Child Custody laws describe the responsibility of guardianship over a child. In cases of divorce where children are involved, a court must rule on a child custodial arrangement as one of the terms of the divorce. Divorcing parents are free to reach agreement on an acceptable custody arrangement, however, in the minority of cases where parents dispute some aspect of the custody arrangements, the court will examine the family, the child, and the qualities or misdemeanors of either parent, before delivering a legally binding judgment intended to put the well-being of the child first. It is usually far preferable to reach a settlement outside of court, putting less strain on affected children, and being cheaper for the parents to avoid litigation. So, according to the stated information above, the first you should do is to consult a lawyer which his expertise is about child custody tell him about the situation. It's the best thing to do as of now.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	Well first of all he would have to prove you guys to be unfit parents, which is very hard to do. And the judge usually favors the mom in this situation, especially since they are girls. The only way he may get them is an extremely good lawyer and lots of money! Also if the girls would rather live with their dad, If they are old enough to decide this that is.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	He has no case at all.  and if he can't even manage the child maintenance then he definitely has no case.  Keep a journal of all payments, received late or otherwise and log down all threats.  the trick is ammunition, and let your lawyer use it.
7Q2jzXRsaa	no as i am aware you cannot unless you win the case which is highly unlikely as your brother is married to this woman which means leagally she and the children if any will get it all im in the same pos at the mo nice speakin 2 u steven the deceased if im rite has 2 children who he adored and any one who wud like to take there dad away is discustin n pathetic he had his own family dnt eva try n take that away once a brilliant dad always a family man my dad wa my life i still cry 2 this day i love and miss my dad sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much no one will ever no he wasnt just my dad he was my best freind and no brother or little girlfreind will ever make legal paperwork change i hope to hear a reply to this all the best with the case xx|`|f3n2zXG2aa	If there were kids, it should be willed to the kids...you as guardian until they reach age.  The wife was in there with him financially, she has a right to be contesting this.  Even if she does not get the entire estate, she was there during the buildup of some of the estate.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Not sure, but most likely you have to fund your own cost until the case settles.  No one, mostly you, is allowed to touch the money until the court rules.  It is in your best interest to retain counsel as well.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	I'm sure you'd have to fund your own fight.  Because there is no for sure way of knowing what the fight would cost|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	Yes she is entitled and you will have to fund your own case.  why do you begrudge her, she was your brothers own choice for a wife at some point. and he chose not to divorce her.|`|ugRN86bYaa	You need a good UK barrister.|`|lvelp0CGaa	Do they have kids ? They were legally married so your wasting time and money but you already know this geez .|`|Dh5CUjmkaa	If you are not using a lawyer you need to. It depends upon the state you are in. I live in Iowa (US) and it is extremely hard to contest a will. They take it as the person's last wishes and you better have a really good reason to have it changed. In my state, the beneficiaries would use the estate's money because they are contesting the estate, not the person who is the executor of the estate. This is really something that you need to consult an attorney on.|`|dd0956c1828fcaa127d3d30ad7c643faaa	Your own source of money. Unless your disputes already settle by the court.
oaF2kaXAaa	Sometimes we gotta do things for our moms when they need us. 6 months will go by fast, she obviously needs your help for the time being. So, If I were you, I'd help her as much as I could. It is kind've selfish of you.... she did give birth to you. ;) Thats just my opinion. Best of luck.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	The problem with your mom, is your mom! She is being very selfish and placing materialism before your well being and mental health. You do what you need to do for you and in a loving, caring and grateful manner tell her you are moving out in 3-6 months or less. Really you shouldn't have to give her any notice and it should be okay. She has some deep seeded issues that only she can deal with. Don't take on her stuff, especially if she trys to make you feel guilty. You are an adult and although you appreciate what she did for you, you must live your life.Your mom sounds a bit unsettled, maybe it is time for her to make some serious life choices as well!|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You can't let her guilt you into or out of anything. If she can't afford the house, she needs to get it listed and sold, or have a local realtor rent it out and manage it so it will at least pay for itself. She can probably renegotiate or refinance the mortgage.    Pay your fair share of current expenses and save your money. Make sure you put enough savings away to fund an emergency fund to cover your living expenses in case you get laid off again.|`|nOmuccPnaa	Thats a tough situation since you went to her when you needed help and now that you are doing okay, she needs your help. If I was in your situation I would talk to her and come up with an appropriate and fair time for you to leave. That way she has time to figure things out and prepare, and you are helping her just like she helped you. I think you both have to compromise. We have to take care of ourselves, but we have to be there for our families too. Good luck!|`|Dh5CUjmkaa	She is feeling the empty nest. Do what you need to do to make your life happy and good. She will be mad at first, but she will get over it in time. Maybe you could find her a roommate to help her with expenses. She also needs to think about selling her house and permanently moving to the state where she is renting. Give her plenty of notice and don't just leave her without a way to cover all of the expenses. Maybe if she has a roommate that can help with the bills she will let you go without getting so upset. Some Mothers just get so attached to their children that when they leave they just can't bear it and try to keep or guilt their kids into staying. My Mother did very well when I left because she still had my younger sister, but when my sister left (she left in the middle of the night and did not tell anyone but me) she freaked and tried to get her to move back. You have to live your own life. When you have kids you will understand the empty nest syndrome.
JyWCPVfzaa	Don't worry, you soon forget about this. We all resent our parents from time to time, especially when we can't get what we want. They're probably very tight with money right now, so couldn't afford what you wanted. Think in the summer, if you get a job, you could get your own things.|`|FVDTXM68aa	At 15 you should still get an allowance, esp $15! You sound responsible! And you are a very busy girl! Getting a job at 15 is hard...I just don't understand why they have such a problem with an allowance! I'm 22, a senior in college, have a paid internship/job, and I still get an allowance from my parents each month ($200), on top of not having to pay for a car/expenses! I mean, you deserve an allowance! YOU'RE 15!!! I'm so sorry to hear that sweetie...I guess keep on doing what you're doing and maybe they will realize they were wrong.....I HOPE!!! Good Luck!! :)|`|AA12359831	15 dollars? and they wont give it to you? wow.  well just get better grades in school. works with my mom.|`|9dqG2ZSRaa	just take money out of your moms purse|`|CZwJJetyaa	I understand how you feel,and it sucks. But they are trying to teach you that money isn't easy to come by.    Ask in school if they have some work experience program.   Also ask your parents if they have anyone they know that needs an odd job to be done so you can make money. Who knows maybe your parents will "hire" you for something ;)
ulIBrNa9aa	I think you should go with the first guy, but then Again how do u fell is what it comes down to but then Again sorry the same guy could just want to stay friends, oh what am i saying you should go with the first dude he seems nice you will be fine as long as he does not start stocking you    p.s. i never knew what p.s. was     p.s.s. still dont know     p.s.s.s.

Good luck..xx|`|LeoazSyAaa	i have the same thing idk beacuse i dont know what they what to do but u just have to ask him out|`|fdSolQ0Aaa	I am honestly amazed at your lack of punctuation.    Although, it caused me to not understand what you were trying to say. :/|`|vM2gUcgLaa	men are very simple, and im going to assume that u are in the 13-15 year old range so if the boy is staring at u he likes you.  its that simple just don't be shy and talk to him|`|cdsfJ5YFaa	I believe that you should approach the guy you really like and tell him how you feel. But definitely don't talk to both! :)|`|P8U1auMmaa	I say ask the boy (the 1st one you mentioned) out. I'm a boy in gender and I don;t know much about this stuff about girls. But when you see an opertunity to see he is alone, ask him. He looks at you either he likes you or thinks your wierd. but don't worry, express your feelings. I'm sure he will understand.|`|5QxrQF7yaa	if the guy is staring at you he likes you or at least thinks your hot and what u got to do is go over and talk to him and flirt with him because he doesnt have the balls to talk to u. just ease drop on one of his conversations and butt in with a comment.|`|s9omDmHWaa	Well he(the first boy) definitely likes you and may be too shy to ask you out so if you feel serious about wanting to date him YOU should ask HIM out. As for the second boy I got kinda confused so I'm not sure sorry.
7U5qewIGaa	with the formula for love?|`|7I8gNo9Taa	just be like, i am so totally lost can you help me out??|`|Y6YGHsKjaa	Compliment them on their smartness. For example:    "Hey, you're smart. Can you help me with this problem?"    or    "Ugh. I can't figure out this equation. I'm not as smart as you, unfortunately, so can you help me?"    The second one might seem a little desperate for compliments. I would go for the first one.|`|B1TYaf9Uaa	i think thats the best way though becouse guys dont really care|`|hjvwMgKoaa	Be a little flirty and say "So your pretty good at this stuff.

s9omDmHWaa	If you see him other times then when you cuddle ^-^ you should see how he acts then and if he flirts with other girls then your in trouble. Also if he is a smooth talker like one of my ex's he could be tricking you and you could find out when it was too late so I'm not sure what to tell you Sorry.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Well, if it's working it's not corny. There's no way of knowing if I don't know the guy.|`|Gv6UW2p2aa	Just based off what you said, he sounds like a decent guy.|`|BIcLN41jaa	sorry but he is probably corny an playing you......that's what guys do|`|TtVk8S4aaa	i think he is nice|`|zdIQTA9Yaa	hard to tell if he takes it to fast hes a player but if he takes it slow does less touching then before you're golden|`|zhC1xcvcaa	so like a good guy who likes you
vgpuTBmSaa	it would be like this: in spite of concern about the woman in labor, the immediate risk to the newborn would require my attention. the woman would still have a chance to deliver and  be okay; the other situation had clear and present danger.not that childbirth is without risk, but car crashes are more often fatal.

Sometimes I question my normality with not having one and all, but then I just remind myself that I like my life and who I am and enjoy being a kid.

AA12198711	Not really.    You can not change others.    You have to accept what you can't change. Turn the other cheek and know you will be the best you can be.     Learn to forgive and forget. Don't hold grudges.     Let your husband be supportive of you and you him. Never put him in the middle.|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	I know what you mean so my advice stay away from the drama. Never get involved. Your live will be better for it.|`|aRodN6qKaa	Sadly when we marry someone we marry their family too, I had that with my in-laws, they made my life hell,before they ruin your marriage like my in-laws ruined mine, advise -avoid them as much as you can-do NOT go over as much with your husband-if they ask why you didn't show up have your hubby say she had other plans
6qsTmMQaaa	She could be placed in the orphanage if the uncle doesn't want to care for her. Usually, as far as I know, if you are orphaned, you go to the nearest family member unless they don't want to care for you.
qC6NfWJuaa	You live and you die...  You've only got one life to live.    What you do with your life... is completely up to you.|`|9qiLZp50aa	I think the meaning of life is to find your own meaning. To satisfy your own needs, and not try to live up to the standards of those around you. Make goals and dreams, and accomplish them. And maybe, to make a huge impact on someone else's life. :)|`|nrIglufeaa	the meaning of life has to do with how you look at the world and how the world looks at you.   we got put on the earth for a reason, right? so part of our journey here on earth is finding that purpose, finding why we are here, and how we in some little way, can make this world a better place.   we are here to find love, give love, and make love to keep the love flowing, without love life is pointless...    and the big meaning of life is to always strive for something thats not in your reach, keep pushing for something your passionate about. having hope that the sun will rise the next day, having hope that you will go to sleep and wake up the next morning.    what makes life so worthwhile is the little things, like a nice song on the radio, or a friend complimenting you. these things are the little gifts that we are blessed with and we have to recognize as something to treasure and love and care for
xFEuN9Vhaa	your priorities Right now is not to please those around you.  You make a decision based on the facts given above and then announce your decision to your family.  Your boyfriends family shouldn't even come into play with the decision making.  And if they want to insist on imposing their decision of which college you attend...simply look them in the eye and ask them how much money they plan on contributing to your college fund.  That will surely shut them up.    This is your choice.  Welcome to adulthood.

pQGUPITeaa	Yeah why not? That sounds fun.    Second questions:  Hahahahaha ... maybe!!!|`|uJ4lMFCpaa	I would suck a girl's brown, puckered poop pipe.|`|PBO836YBaa	I would help him, maybe one day i would need him to do the same. and as for the second question, don't deny it until you try it, right?|`|9LGInLsYaa	Yes to the first question... no to the second
Rzsudrzqaa	You shouldn't feel inferior. As long as she knows bisexuality doesn't mean she can have a free-for-all with anyone she wants. I think its great that the two of you can talk about the people you're attracted to. Its a good sign of your relationship. If she's trying to make you feel inferior thats one thing but if you two are simply open about your attractions.. don't worry and don't feel insecure. She's with YOU.. and not another woman.  Best of luck.|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	The fact that she is Bi shouldn't even matter, she could leave you for another man tomorrow! Most people who are BI, even though they may be attracted to one sex over the other, can still be faithful to whichever sex that person may be. This should have nothing to do with her being BI. You should be asking why are you insecure and trippin off something that hasn't even happened yet. Relax and enjoy the relationship for how ever long it lasts!|`|Y08YLysXaa	I would never be with somebody like that. Ladies... would you wanna be with a guy who constantly talked about how hot other girls are?? NO. So a man shouldn't have to deal with the same thing, whether she is into men or women, she should only be focussing on you! If you let her get away with it, she will just think she's being cute and sexy by going on about girls, when you should be putting your foot down and telling her that anything with girls is just as much unfaithful as with a guy.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	Examine your aims.  Why are you in a relationship where you have to share your partner.  It is so unlikely ever to really work for the both of you that I don't know why you are willing to put yourself through the pain.  Stop it now and find someone who really cares and wants you alone.  It's so much more satisfying.|`|AA10231844	Well, if she tells you that you satisfy her and make her happy (sexually and non-sexually), why don't you take her word for it?  Maybe you need to examine why you feel inferior.  Perhaps you should try thinking about good qualities you have or good things you do on a daily basis, or perhaps some counseling might help.    Good luck,  Dana (Marriage and Family Therapy Intern)
Z11jZXOmaa	tell me about it. I like this guy and he likes me too but he always talks anout other girls and shows me pictures of them. He probably tries to make me jealous but it makes me feel sooo bad about the way that i look to him. It makes me not want to move forward with him. You should tell her how you feel and i will tell him how i feel lol!|`|eGA9eCAiaa	I would really suggest therapy... or at least ask your parents. Either way, you should have an adult's say in this because it seems like an up and down kind of relationship. My opinion is, if she is kind of a "swinger" (meaning she goes back and forth A LOT) then talk it out with her. I hope it helps! :)
mc9pPxsnaa	I am sorry, and will be direct in this regard; you are dating the wrong person as you seem to be serious. If I were you, I would like to have a traditional type of relationship. However, its you to decide.    Good Luck!
iekgFLjuaa	Ok... in my opinion you deserve someone SO much better why stay with someone if they cheated on you? Plus she keeps denying it... and then fessing up saying she did.. How can you trust someone who doesn't tell the truth  ..|`|pAyl6M1faa	she's not only a cheat, but she's also a deceptive liar!  get rid of this girl and get someone who respects you enough to be honest with you.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Yes, man you got a hor as a girlfriend, no offense|`|Ri27AKdHaa	DUH!|`|8LzZvPwjaa	yes|`|F8Qwlvbjaa	most likely, now move on. you don't trust her and you are miserable.|`|UtwMxaPzaa	Yup. You got yourself a cheater and a liar.... I'd say, move on.|`|BoXghyRvaa	Wow what a manipulative girlfriend. I say dump the whore.|`|art3dSL3aa	eeewwwww  dump her!!!!   she cheated and lied|`|K2Et4Hyaaa	Yes ,your gf cheated its obivious and she didn"t cheat because of what you did cuz thats stupid she cheated because theirs something missing in your relationship and if i was you dump her *** man ..she doesn"t deserve a guy like you|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	Doesn't matter.  Leave her.  The fact that she is throwing it in your face just to hurt you is a cause for alarm.  If she didn't cheat, why would she do that?  If she did, why would she do that?  Either way, it sounds crazy.|`|NWpitkauaa	joey? is that you?|`|AA10185707	Sometimes you have to learn the hard way. Once a cheater always a cheater. Move on and don't look back|`|5bZ2sPO3aa	Yes. Unless you're willing to put up with this again and worry about what kind of std she might share with you and who and when she'll  do it with again, now would be a good time to stop investing any more time on her. I'm sorry she's done this to you because there really are some great girls out there. This girl has no respect for you or your relationship at all and will only tell you what she thinks you want to hear or what will cause the least amount of damage. Pick up your heart, your pride and your self respect and go find a girl who will treat you right.|`|ca83b6571e1307938cec4c3f9a53806aaa	definitely.  No girl would say they cheated just to shut the guy up.  she can't keep her story straight. sorry but she cheated on you.|`|uWjkYMQpaa	A cheater and a liar in one.. sorry man|`|hQloBIBPaa	Yeah I have to agree she definitley cheated!  But even if she didn't she is still a liar and who needs that?|`|d43pecIkaa	yes she lied and cheated but if she had other boy before yoll got together then no its your call what story do you believe|`|CKWABfYIaa	YA SHE CHEATN SO U SHOULD STOP WASTN UR TIME WIT HER AND FIND A GIRLFRIEND DAT WNT LIE 2 U|`|hd7aNTFXaa	sorry, but i'd get rid of this girl... shes lied to you regardless because she said she did and she didnt.... so she probably did because we dont say it to shut you up... so yeah sorry :[ but yeah looks like you should move on, sorry and hope this helps.  good luck :]|`|xg0jALAgaa	More often than not partners who respond the way she did have. Her back and forth a red flag should be waving before your eyes. If you must continue with her start communicating on the things both of you desire in your relationship. Because if they are not expressed cheating on either part will occur.
AA11108018	Do crazy things to together tell him how much you love him.  Take a walk enjoy the night air when your walking just out of the blue stop and kiss him|`|qAgF5R3Yaa	sounds like my relationship lol.  just try to find things to do together that you two enjoy that keeps him away from the computer.  cleaning and doing things around the house do them together that way you don't have to tell him to do it.  you may be bothering him at times but, he loves the attention.
kSlN7MjEaa	If this girl is beautiful that could be an opener for you. Many really good looking girls put guys off because the guys think they have no chance.  All girls like compliments   So you could go up to her and say "hey there how are you? you are so beautiful I feel drawn to you I had to talk to you  - whats your name?"...  My name is.....do you live round here etc etc.  its not that hard.  You have as much chance as anyone else - so go for it - straight away - dont think about it too much - just DO IT -( faint heart never won fair lady)|`|ralKIfoVaa	It's good to start off by being polite. A simple "Hello my name is ______ how are you?" can make the cut. As long as you're polite throughout the conversation, you're on the right track. Don't insult her or offend her, talk about what she likes. Make her laugh but don't be disgusting or obnoxious. Be mysterious and leave her wanting to know and talk more. Start off by getting to know each other then you can become serious.|`|iCI1rwdBaa	compliment her on something then just continue the conversation|`|Tu9iCOD6aa	just come at her with YOUR personality  dont be fake about it  and just like compliment her  or ask her a few small questions  jus to get the convo going  BUT dnt be all up in her business  (cuz then she'll think your crazy lol)|`|3ef2Kfafaa	You only have to say Hi!! and invited her a lollipop for ex.  then you ask about music if she answer quickly an with a smile you continue talking about that,if not ask about movies or sport.  If she doesn't go to the same school as u it easy ask about school...how is she going or which subject she likes more,.....  And a lot of things you know and like You have to see the way of the conversation and ask about it. Obviously u tell her that you have seen her sometimes,Beauty ayes or hair....|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Well ask questions where is she from when she was born how old what school you go.|`|oOEaudwvaa	start by talking about something she's wearing say it's your favorite color and just come off by saying hi|`|5FCiKNaGaa	hi whats up, then talk about stuff|`|BIcLN41jaa	you should start by saying hi of course then ask her how she is and if she seems into you and she is actually listening to what you have to say then ask her to go to a movie or something like that|`|eSDNSq4zaa	hey, whats up?, what did you do today?, how was your weekend?|`|zIISRkjMaa	you: eighty kilo penguin  her: what?  you: just trying to break the ice    yeah, its lame, but girls like laughing and i laugh like crazy everytime i hear it.|`|RRTTWtxOaa	compliment her...then let it flow throught the conversation|`|vCsSOmVOaa	just say hey im ______ and then say whats you're name or say hi|`|x51SQHxDaa	say hi and then say u look real pretty today that's sure to get her attention or look at her and make sure she makes eye contact too then she will come to you trust me that's how i got sucked in with my guy|`|nVfN8usNaa	Find a moment to pick up on a topic she might be discussing and just "happen" to overhear. Just make sure you KNOW what the topic's about lol  Figure out her idea of humor and appeal to it!  Girls love to laugh.|`|TtVk8S4aaa	just say hi what your doing something like that!! ;)|`|PmRbUgMoaa	Give her a compliment. Some boys think girls like when your rude and you think your funny, but most girls like sweet, caring guys who like you for your personality. =] Then, ask questions. It makes people feel important and noticed.|`|6ucVuo10aa	how about....hi i think you're really beautiful.........that diff a gud way to start it off
gqmtPx8gaa	Certainly looks like he's showing a lot of indicators of infidelity.     You need to sit down and decide what you want to do. If you want to try and work on the relationship then you two definately need to get marriage counseling. BUT if he's not ready to commit and stay committed then there is no use.     My gut, as a male? He's cheating- maybe not sexually but emotionally.|`|H2bpuDsKaa	I smell a rat.........|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Some men like to have a wife and a girl friend - at the same time.      I wouldn't trust them.    I've been married for 22 years and I would not think of dating (polite term) someone else while married.    My wife had been married for 8 years  - and during that time - her husband dated several other women.  This has left my wife very insecure.    For some men, I think the weight of being responsible for a family is more than they want to carry - so they seek out relationships where there are no kids "just the 2 of them".    Can - will - they eventually become more mature and grow out of this?  Not sure - most of the cases I have seen (I'm now 57) went on like this for years - until I lost touch with these couples.    As an example, my sister married a guy.  Found out later that he had been married twice before he married my sister.  He married her when he was 25.  Since then, he has gone thru 3 more wives.  The whole time he was married to my sister, we suspected he was dating a couple of women.  After he separated from my sister, he kept wanting to get back with her. We stayed in touch after he divorced my sister and was married to the next 2 wives.  Every time I was with him - he always talked about having sex with "other women".  I got tired of hearing it and stopped talking to him.|`|w0rWpxd1aa	i think they are gonna be less then 400 feet apart.|`|6aVtiTKiaa	He wants to go camping by himself to clear his head???    Go back and read what you wrote.  Think about what it would sound like if someone else wrote it.  You can figure this one out on your own.|`|jTsQkuhHaa	there are red flags allll over this story!  if he has nothing to hide - he wouldn't hide it.  he is trying nicely to tell you how he feels in hopes that you end it first - he is warning you.  get counseling, quick.  before it is too late!!|`|YoyGzi2Aaa	Do you really need a ton of bricks to fall on you to get what's going on? He's F'ing around on you. Bottom line, if he wasn't doing anything wrong with her, he wouldn't need to hide it. As far as him not being able to tell you what's wrong, that's BS, it's not that he can't it's that he DOESN'T WANT TO. What more signs do you need? He's telling you he hasn't been happy for over a year, he's talking to his ex again, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON??  Whether he's actually cheated on you with her, you won't know for sure unless you catch him or he tells you, but at this point, even if he hasn't physically cheated on you, he is straying to her.   Sit his a$$ down and have it out once and for all, whether he gets mad or not. You're giving him all the power right now. He gets "mad" to get out of talking to you. Don't let that fly.|`|hOUEIEmBaa	Well to be honest with you I believe he wants out of his marriage. I am not sure why, but I would guess with kids and the daily routine its not as fun anymore and it probably wasn't he was looking forward to and probably likes his freedom. As far as going camping I am would guess hes going to bang the ex, I would.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	Oh he is definetly up to something here. There is no reason that he should need a female friend to talk to....That's what you are for. And he definetly shouldn't need his twotiming exife as a "friend". They should have cut off ALL contact after the divorce and most certainly from the moment you came around.   If it was me I'd find a private investigator before the "camping" trip and get PROOF of what's going on. If I couldn't afford one...well I'd find SOMEBODY to do it! Catch him in the act...this is a golden opportunity to.|`|VNX7eSYJaa	The only head he wants to clear is the little one...inside of his ex.|`|NRWR0POFaa	You should just dump him. He probably is cheating on you. Is he really that great? If you were a man and you were talking about your woman and her-ex you would have dumper her in a sec.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	I think you need to quietly get a sitter and follow him camping. See if he get's a warm feeling when you catch him......|`|fb2d92b771dcd4d8b2d1dc3da6af3e05aa	if that feeling isnt there anymore, you can either throw away what you have and leave him and try with some other guy, or you can try to make it work.  You both seem to be having a trust issue, and that is one big sign that you have a big problem.  Dont stay together for the kids,if you cant actually try to make it work, take his child support money and move on.
Qe8LE7DFaa	SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ANSWERS ARE NOT GOOD, BUT IF THEY ARE BEING MEAN TO YOU ,YOU DONT BUY NOTHING FOR THEM! SINCE NOONE BELIEVE YOU TAKE IT IN YOUR OWN HANDS. WHEN THE PERSON COME TO PAY YOUR SISTER THE MONEY FOR BABYSITTING TELL THEM SHE SHOULD NOT GET PAID I BABYSIT EVERY AFTERNOON FOR YOU WHILE SHE LAID UP IN HER ROOM I'M GETTING TIRED OF BEING WALKED ON LIKE A MAT. I WORK HARD WITH THIS BABY AND I DESEVRE MY PAY SO PLEASE AND THANK YOU! THEN YO LITTLE SISTER AND YO BIG SISTER REVENGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU DO SOMETHING AND BLAME IT ON THEM AND SEE HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT TAKEING THE BLAME WHEN THEY HAVE TO WASH THE DISHES YOU TAKE THE CREDIT. THEN THEY WILL STOP THEN I BET YOU THATS HOW I GOT MY OLDER SISTER TO STOP IT>|`|isCTS30Kaa	While your sisters on myspace make a video on a cellphone or camera of her on there and when she doesnt flush the toilet do not do that just flush it yourself so she cant blame you when they are mean to you just be mean back i guess|`|rh12tX8Naa	You should set up a camera to prove that evidence 1 is true. That would be a good way to get your mom to trust you more.|`|R0M1WCmZaa	Ingored them and don't get them what they want no more!!! You are too nice and they like to blame you because they think you are heart soft. and don't do babysit, and let them do it themself and you no more to do for them no more|`|n7pnvk18aa	I know how you feel, your sisters are just too immature,  lucky that you are not! it'll change sooner or later once they reached pubirty(LoL) maybe 18...  Anyways your like malcom in the middle don't get up set. You'll be the one success in lif.on your work, love life, etc.  Then it's time for revenge and be the one to act immature when they asked for your help(ignore them) and bring all those stuffs that they did to you.  And tell them how does it feel now? I'm the one acting immature now.  Tell e'm no I won't help you cause your so mean to me back when we were kids.  LoL just a thought but I won't seriously do this to my sisters who really are pain in the *** but I'll make them suffer! just a little.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You need to quit being a convenient excuse.     When your sister is supposed to be sitting, you need to be at a friend's house or at some kind of extracurricular activity (that way it is supervised and you have witnesses).    Quit giving your sisters money or anything else. You need to turn the tables on them and ask them for money... at least until you have been paid back.  Put a keyed lock on your closet door to turn it into a safe, or find a good place to hide your cash... wear the key around your neck.     You can always come up with some nice stuff to pin on your two sisters... like leaving some dishes behind or something like that.|`|NgkkzBOEaa	I'd be pissed too.
5YFgZCEKaa	be polite    dont Speak too much or too less  have grace in movements  be a good listener|`|lZdidgwSaa	First of all, acquire a sophisticated vocabulary... nobody will be hanging on to you if you know only 80 words! So, read a lot of books; they'll supply you with all the adjectives and verbs you ever need.  Next, know which subjects to target at different people, for example, a girl will not want to discuss wrestling, or a nerd will not want to discuss sport. Keep advancing the topic.  Smile! Its shows that you have positive vibes and major confidence.  Keep eye contact. It shows confidence and shows that you know what you are talking about.   Present yourself, well in front of people; always be clean and tidy.  Use the basics: learn to say "please" and "thankyou".    That's all I can help you.. hope you'll find it useful!
H6gjOGnGaa	The trick is not to not get attached; the trick is to find the strength to be open and loving despite your past.    I know that sounds like a cop-out, but look at it the other way around: getting only partly attached causes a tremendous amount of pain in relationships and it is responsible for making many of these girls skittish in the first place.  Why follow a broken pattern?|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Sure, you can shut down, but then you won't have a very good relationship. Look you cannot have a relationship without taking risks, and relationships aren't just about sex, especially at your age.     Does it hurt to get dumped? Yeah. But it happens to everyone. Especially at your age. Are you seeing a pattern here?    Serious relationships, including sexual relationships are not for kids. It is a time to get to know people and make friendships and learn how to be in a serious relationship.    So slow down and have fun and stop looking for the big one until you are ready. Good luck.|`|3wICIryRaa	Try and spend about the same amount of time with your other friends, so if things do end, you'll still have time with your friends to forget about it.|`|TtVk8S4aaa	well you can tell her your feelings express yourself!!|`|nZ7pGQfFaa	Try and put your guard up... You have to do it before you find that person.  You have to tell yourself that you aren't going to fall hard for the person right away.  Take is SLOW, don't hang out everyday.  Try to keep your mind on something else when you aren't with her|`|pIkPHuWyaa	Don't allow this girl to become your whole life.  Enjoy being with her, but also enjoy being with your friends and doing things without her.  I loved this man for 3 years and he was my "everything".  Well, one day he decided he didn't want to be with me anymore.  I had nothing to fall back on because I did everything with him.  I learned the hard way to make sure to have my own life and enjoy it and be happy.  That way, being with someone else just adds to the happiness rather than becoming the reason for your happiness.|`|PmRbUgMoaa	No because if you get detached you will hurt yourself and your relationship. She might break up with you because your detached.|`|GNGw5MItaa	i don't really know how to word this in a way that makes sense to anyone but myself so if it's unhelpful sorry for wasting your time... basically, i've gone through the same thing... and with time i sort of learned tricks that helped... for example with my previous ex, after the breakup, i tried to hang out with my friends as much as possible so they would sort of fill the void that was created and that helped me to just basically forget all about the relationship until i was healed enough to think about it and learn from it... i don't know if this helped, i hope it did... good luck, hope it all works out good for you =D|`|Dlkc04u8aa	if she really likes you she wont break up wit you (unless some thing happens)
jqhvxWzGaa	omg, kick him.  tell him he should have thought of that 7 months ago, and you're not giving him another chance. do you really want to go through that again?|`|hDAoKmjPaa	ok if you think that he will hurt you then chances are you are right. he did it once whats to say hes not going to do it again. but he may be sincer and ready to give it another go after he realized what he lost. love is about taking risks. you never know he may not hurt you and if could be great. if you dont go for it you might regret it and wonder what if... but you really need to do what you feel is right. if you dont trust him then i would have to say no dont get back with him. you cant have a relationship with no trust.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	He will hurt you again.  Look at his track record, he doesn't care at all for your feelings.    Tell him not to contact you anymore.|`|8LzZvPwjaa	nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo|`|yhEDUN6qaa	It sounds like you already know that getting back with him would be a bad idea. Do you really want to be with someone who is so indifferent to your feelings?|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	Send him packing!      I say this with out reservation because some guys just don't have what it takes in the relationship department.  My guess is when the wind of a different direction comes by you will be own your own again.    I dated a guy over two years and he just up and left me stranded in a new state no friends and staying with family members who had very little regard for my plight.  Months later he returned and wanted to try again.  I took him back and even married him and within 4 years he was up and gone again.    The third time's the charm they say.  The next time he came back I thought, well we are older and maybe he will stay and work with me on this marriage.  Wrong!  He took off a few months ago.    Just offering a word to the wise.  Good luck!|`|k4dAtVazaa	ehhhh   give him a chance  if you like him then go for it      but if he cheats....run away.  once a cheater always a cheater!|`|tvOAeGAnaa	only if you have dumb written on your forehead! Your better then that, believe it! Hell no!|`|PmRbUgMoaa	No. You deserve better. Way better. No one deserves to be treated like that. Poor other girls who will or did (including you!) fall for him.|`|0jhK2oeZaa	There are many fish in the sea. Find another guy.  One "rule" I feel is very important. Never date an ex's friend or a friend's ex.|`|a0XhQBpaaa	Similar thing happened to me. Mine was a little worse though, I think. My ex broke up on the car ride down to meet my family for thanksgiving! Made it awkward and horrible. Now, 2 months later, she said she wanted to get back because she regretted doing it. I obviously, said no, because anyone that will do that kind of crap to you, really isn't worth your time. You can try being friends, but nothing more in my opinion.|`|Y5ruAxuFaa	if he tried to get with your best friend i wouldn't trust him. My Ex did the same thing and my friend wouldn't give him the time of day so then he decided he wanted me back and i took him back and he did it again.i don't know if I'm any help but i would move on and forget him.It will be hard but its better then being hurt over and over again|`|X4Owk0xTaa	So you want to give him ANOTHER chance after what he has shown you he is capable of doing? Do not get with him, I know it hurts and is very painful to accept but you need to look at the facts, not the fantasy, not the man you wish he could be. He was a coward to break up with you through text, and the nerve of the guy to even try his lover's best friend! That's so pathetic! You need to move on, just find some fun and happy things to do that will keep your mind pre-occupied of this asshole, because getting back with him will only give you emotional torture.|`|AA11595860	Once a dog always a dog... Remember that.|`|iMUV670uaa	if he hurt you once, he probably will do it again. i wouldn't trust him, or get back together with him. not to mention he tried to hook up with your best friend?! but hey, it's up to you.|`|AhtaOu9aaa	tell him youve forgiven him...but not forgotten...dont use his past as a judgement but as a guideline...let him know that this time around he has to respect you and your feelings...better yet any guy who hurts the girl he cares about does not deserve any girl|`|lekzdej2aa	I don't think you should because you guys will brake up again soon. i broke up with my ex after 7 months and like 2 months later went back out for like a week. it wasn't the same.   You do what you want but i wouldn't do that again.|`|dVrw5p6Waa	Don't! Especially if you are insecure. You will always remember what he did and the relationship will end. You can save your feelings if you want, which is what I recommend. But Garth Brooks said another way "You Could Have Missed the Pain, but You'd a Missed the Dance." There is no right answer, but there is no wrong answer either. Follow your heart, but keep a close eye on it, you don't want to lose it.
feedTbEvaa	If you are stupid and don't appreciate your family at all, you should run off with him.Just because he has a horrible life, it doesn't mean that he needs to make your life miserable as well.Your parents don't deserve this from you.Please think straight and reasonably for once in your life.Just because you don't "run away" with your boyfriend like he wants you to...doesn't mean that the two of you still can't see each other.    I seriously hope you grow up and develop some basic common sense right now, and actually analyze this situation before you go and hastily do something regrettably stupid.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	You will bring drama onto yourself and are getting involved in a family matter that does not concern you, boyfriend or not.|`|COmp4sIuaa	But do you have a happy family life? If you do, stay there.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	No.|`|IQq0wNqQaa	You should help by encouraging him to call his grandmother and have her come get him. You should not go with him. He can still call you and talk to you from her house. If you run away with him then you will just mess up your relationship with your family - and trust me, you don't want that. No boy is worth screwing up your relationship with your family for. I know it seems like you will be together forever; and even though you want to help - there's nothing you can really do besides listen and comfort your boyfriend.|`|sLmX4H3Caa	How far is his grandmother's?

You most likely will want to go back home and it will just cause more problems on both sides of the story. Maybe you could arrange him to stay with you.|`|08cd3305da694214bf0845fe4be3650baa	If his life is "horrible", then HE should go live with his grandmother.  I don't see why changing your living arrangement benefits either of you and it could be detrimental to YOU.  Be understanding, but stay in your current home.|`|4OxDLaJLaa	how old are you??  you shouldnt if you have a good  life, why start needed trouble with your family.

Love making does not only involve sexual pleasure but also a happier mood and a stronger relationship in the long term. In order to benefit from love making both partners should derive mutual satisfaction from the act which implies both partners should reach ultimate orgasm. You should know how and when to make love in the right way and form. Read on to find out how to make love the right way.    Set the mood- In order to make love the right way proper mood is very important. You simply can not satisfy your partner is he or she is in a negative or a bad mood. This is the major reason why some couples feel love making was absolutely awesome sometimes whereas other times it's just ordinary. Your and your partner's mood has a big role to play in love making. To keep the heavenly magic intact in love making always do it when you feel the situational moods are right.    Romance- Love making is all about romance and emotional attachment towards each other. Romance is extremely important to add that extra spice before you start taking your clothes off. Romance normally leads to an exceptionally better love making and you get more satisfaction each time you make love.    Use words- Words are a very important part of love making and should be used wisely. The pleasure from making love doubles when you tell your partners how much you love need or want him or her. Research has shown that couples which involve more feelings and emotions in love making are known to be happier in the long term.    Take it further- Continue the above mentioned steps and take the next step into foreplay. This is the final step of proper love making which leads to eventual orgasm. Oral stimulation doubles pleasure and you can make love for several hours.|`|hjjmcbbPaa	i call your mom and tell her ive got a bucket of wings then you know the rest lol jk|`|VMFftlQlaa	Make love?

Plastic, nails, hammer, drill, glue, and some string.|`|4l90fBqIaa	Are you serious?|`|77YJU6IYaa	Step  1  Find a willing and clean partner. Ideally, you and the partner will be in a serious, monogamous relationship. While casual sex could be fun, it can lead to painful or life-threatening sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unwanted pregnancy.  Step  2  Discuss the possibility of sexual relations with your partner. Find out their sexual history, and discuss if you are mature enough and emotionally ready to have sex. If you cant say I love you to the person, you are not ready to have sex.  Step  3  Purchase birth control and STD prevention. The female can choose from a variety of birth control methods, while the male should purchase condoms.  Step  4  Find the right moment. Making love is often a spontaneous event, and too much planning can ruin the mood. However, you want to be sure you are in a safe environment where no one will barge in on you.  Step  5  Slowly undress and begin foreplay. Foreplay is the kissing and touching that occurs before sex. While the male will want to jump right in to the sex, the female requires a bit of warming up. Think of the man as a microwave and the woman as a crockpot--they take different times to get to the same temperature.  Step  6  Lay horizontally on a bed. The man can be on top of the woman, his body in between her legs, and their genitals aligned. This is called the missionary position, and it is one of many different positions for making love.  Step  7  Insert the erect penis into the vagina. If the vagina is dry and it is hard to insert, use a few drops of lubricant.  Step  8  Engage in a rhythmic, tandem motion with your hips, carefully and slowly moving the penis in and out of the vagina. It may take a few minutes (or months) to get your rhythm together.  Step  9  As partners near climax, the rhythm will increase, as will the body heat and verbal declarations of love. Upon climax, the male will release sperm into the condom or vagina, and his penis will deflate.  Step  10  The male will roll off the partner. Hold each other, exchange your promises of love and enjoy the afterglow.|`|NfFXo1uFaa	Oh I start off romancing the stone.  Then I break it down and undress the layers.  Most women love for you to just take initiative to go down on your own.  And when you do don't come up till they are satisfied.  Then go right up to their face and kiss them long...deep and sensual.  Then check and see if Ol Monty Python is ready.  Then after that you go for your money.  Don't hold back neither.  They don't want you to.  They don't want you to waste their time when they let you get that satisfaction from them.  Ladies can I get a vote.  I answered it.|`|aquejQMAaa	simply kiz the person and then bang!! go!!|`|DDTzlcVCaa	there is no how to make love!  sorry but that would be something you will have to do on your own.

I'm speaking from an American point of view, not an English point of view. It is inappropriate to have any party in America that is seen as soliciting gifts. Therefore, you would have one event, being the "Jack and Jill" wedding shower. Not some fundraising affair. So tacky. Other cultures may consider that okay.|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	Oh gosh no, I saw pictures online of a couple having a wedding reception at some fast food joint. I think the shower can be done well, if you talk to the store's manager and see what they can do, it also depends on the size of the shower and the general humor of the guests. I think it can be fun if you done right.|`|A7JSg6BVaa	Many couples I know have done this...but we call the jack and jill a "stag & doe" or a "buck & doe." I really don't see a problem with it. The shower is for people who are invited to the wedding, and the other party is to help raise money to pay for the wedding. Anyone can come to that one.
Y08YLysXaa	It's not your fault if you're organised and she's not. She sounds really irresponsible and you shouldn't have to put your life and plans on hold because of her slow and lazy attitude. If you picked the same wedding date or like a day before, I would call you a b****, lol. I don't think you have done anything wrong. She's not the only person in the world, or the first person to ever get married. Most people get married and she needs to accept that hers isn't more special than yours.|`|JPpDWrDUaa	Sisters are always competitive even if your close. I say that she's probably just stressed out because she doesn't know how to get organized and not to mention her fiance is lazy. I absoulotly do not think that you should put your life on hold for your dis organized sister. She does not have the right to scream at you for jumping infront of her. Your probably one of those people who are organized daily so...this is what I would say to her " (her name), I am not trying to jump infront of your wedding or do anything you think I'm doing. I want you to have a nice wedding and all but you have not right or reason to be yelling at me. I would help you but I have my own wedding to plan here which you should of been doing for the last 8 months. I'm already helping you so...maybe you should just stop yelling at me and actting like this problem of yours is my fault". Say something like that in a mature calm way. I hope this helps and this is just my oppion|`|KOYZfaDkaa	No, don't put your life on hold. She "says" there's plans for her wedding in November, well then she gets that day in November, not the entire year or even month of November. By the time your wedding is said and done, hers will still be months out and it'll be a fresh new event. Ugh, she needs to grow up. So as long as your comfortable with a short engagement, go for it. Let her cool off, and if she doesn't then there's no reason she has to participate actively.    Oh and stop fixing up her house for pete's sake! It's nice of your family to help out, but she sounds like a user, and frankly you guys are enabling her by letting her guilt you guys around.|`|ba450548ec13ce7a3711c94421c92d4aaa	Well, look at it this way, you helped fix up her new home because you care about her and wanted her house to be nice. She repays you by having a fit over your wedding date? That's not right. She'll get over it. Ask her, do you want to get over this and be my MOH, or would you like to hold this grudge and ruin the memories we should have together, your call? That should wake her up. If she sticks to her grudge, than get a friend to be you MOH and don't budge on you decision, even after she gets over her issues. Plan your wedding as best as you can don't let her get in the way. Why should you have to deal with someone who puts her crap before everything and everyone else?|`|NuzNgXURaa	I'm so sorry this sounds so shitty! I would just tell my sis that my decision to go ahead with July was NOT intended to beat her to the punch-tell her that you just wanted to get it all going and that you had no idea that it would hurt her.  If you give her a genuine apology and your relationship is pretty good, she will get over this.  Tell her you hope she reconsiders the MOH thing.  I mean if its that important for her to go first than she should go for June!!!????|`|AA10440098	It can be really tough to deal with siblings getting married when you also want to get married. My own situation is a bit similar, and I can relate to both of you. The bottom line is that it feels horrible to feel that your own wedding may be overshadowed or that you're not getting married when you should.  The way my family and I are resolving a similar situation is by looking at every sibling and their partner separately and not comparing weddings. It's wonderful that she is getting married in November, and it's great that you want to get married this summer. Each of you has her own life and must plan her wedding accordingly. There is no rule that you two can't get married in the same year.   I strongly recommend that you speak to her. Listen to what she has to say, allow her to get angry, and assure her that your decision is not meant to hurt you, but rather is based on your and your fiance's personal needs and wants. You may also discover that her anger is based on faulty assumptions.  I recommend that you don't blame her for being lazy or disorganized. Stick to the issue at hand: weddings. Say that you hope to be a maid/matron of honor at her wedding and would be honored to have her be your bride's maid.   Hope it all works out, and remember (can trust me, i KNOW this can be difficult) that this really is a double joy and not a cause for sorrow! Congratulations to the both of you!|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	there's nothing you can do about her behavior. so you have to be the bigger one and just plan your day for when you want it and hope she calms down and enjoys it.  and make sure you enjoy it no matter what happens with her.    btw if she & her 'man' aren't going to fix up their house, they should live in it as is...i certainly wouldn't spend my time and bust my butt fixing up someone else's house just because they were too lazy.  i mean, good on you, but that will only give them the idea that everyone will do everything for them so why should they do it themselves?|`|AA10378447	No, you do not put your life on hold. Your sister is being a big crybaby. Tell her to build a freaking bridge and get over herself. She's ridiculous. Congratulations to you and stop letting her stress you.|`|7igxiGrAaa	She didn't set a date. It sucks for her that she was engaged first and you're getting married first but it was her own lack of ambition that put her into that situation.   You can't put your life on hold for other people.

You should go ahead with your own plans and leave her out of everything.     She seems to be a lazy girl with no future, don't let her ruin your life.|`|28WJwHf4aa	I think she has every right to be mad....but only to an extent.     Give her, her space right now to calm down. She should just blow off the steam, and then realize that in the end, it doesn't matter who gets married first. I'd think it'd be rather fun to bounce ideas off of each other and to help each other out.    If she stays mad and refuses to be in your wedding, then she's in the wrong and has a lot of growing up to do.    Best of luck and congrats!|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	you should sit down and talk with your sister! maybe even arrange a double wedding. I understand that your sister feels abliged to get married before you since she is the older one! You should just sit down with her and talk to her about it! Tell her that your fiancee is important too you and that you dont want to wait forever to tie the knot with your special someone. Maybe suggest to help her better plan her wedding? It couldnt really hurt to give it a try!|`|HKHCuRI8aa	you both need to grow up,more your sister i guess, why would you go in front of why not share the day.?? just remember you will always be a sister, guys aren't, she needs to be more like you and get off *** and work for it. she will fail wait and see, you will have to help her or save her, I bet you on this.|`|gBxY8Svpaa	I don't think you did anything wrong.  You shouldn't have to put your life on hold to wait for hers.  You shouldn't have to wait to marry the man you love because your sister is being lazy about it.|`|DqetlSB6aa	Honestly..Id tell your sister to suck it up and deal with it.  Tell her her failure to plan her wedding has lead to this conflict.  The way shes going she would have never set a date...and your would have been waiting in the wings for her to figure out when you were going to plan your wedding. Plan your wedding around you and your fiance and no one else.  Like you said, you sister is lazy...no doubt her wedding will suck then shell have something else to yell at you about.  I wouldn't worry about being her maid of honor.  You have more things to think about now anyway.|`|crxbob5jaa	Call her on the crap. Tell her you want to go with her to visit the venue she has scheduled for her wedding next November.   Force the issue. If she won't go, then go without her. Ask them if she has indeed booked her wedding. And they can probably tell you when it was booked.     If she's being honest, you might want to rethink your date. If she's not telling the truth, then don't worry about her.|`|fIRyCLcGaa	Sounds to me like she is just being stubborn and jealous. Congratulations on your engagement by the way. Sometimes older siblings feel like they have to be the first for everything first to get a car, have kids, first kiss, get married etc the list goes on.& when there young siblings pass them up it can present some issues. It will work out. Just let her cool off for a little.|`|z2zZCJDRaa	I think that she should just suck it up and be your maid of honor. It's your wedding and (hopefully) you'll only have the one. She can have her wedding later. I'm sure she'll be mad but she should still just suck it up. You're her sister.|`|Yh4YWdR1aa	Don't worry about your sister, just keep planning your wedding. She'll get over it. I would ask my best friend to be the maid of honor if she doesn't want to do it.|`|tvOAeGAnaa	If she had a date picked already then you are WRONG. however if she doesn't have a date picked already then you did the right thing. Little miss unorganized is not your problem all the time! You go ahead and do whatever makes you happy. Just pay no mind to those who are not supportive! Tell her to get off her buns and do something! She is just envious of your great quality of being responsible! Good Luck!|`|96MRGiheaa	It's your wedding and I think you should do what you wanna do. It's not your fault your sister is lazy and disorganized. I think you should talk to her and explain to her that she didn't plan her wedding and you did.|`|y0SCzMJiaa	YES SHE HAS A RIGHT TO BE MAD A WEDDING IS SUPPOSED THE PERFECT DAY|`|CNhFjXd9aa	wait... Did anyone  book anything for her yet and u took the date rather then her having it? But if she is being lazy and not bothering to plan her wedding, and u just got engaged and book things, She should be happy for you. If you are engaged at the same time, then great! If she now wants your wedding day then she's wrong! But you should NOT put your life on hold to see what she is going to do first! She has no right to be throwing a tantrum at you if she can't get her act together and you can!  I think you are right|`|zBy8X1jDaa	Wow woah :0    Thats very mean ;(    If you give her some space she will calm down for sometime    Don't interfere in her life that much or things will go bad    Cool down and have a great time!    By Lynette *o* :)|`|xim1uSzKaa	your sis is being imature  she has no right to be mad  she shud be happy 4 u  n be ur maid of honour  carry on with ur wedding  u deserve that happiness in your life  dun let sibling spoil it  it hurts  believe me  carry on wif ur plans  n have a happy married life|`|C8wipA65aa	It is your life, your wedding, and it is her house, so let her be responsible for it from now on, and make better use of your time and energy rather than pinpointing her faults and your differences... Apologive publicly and privately to your sister, and let her know that whomever she chooses to be her maid of honor is HER CHOICE, and you never wanted to make her feel badly or let down about wedding times and arrangements, and you both need to let down the anxieties and have fun with both weddings.  Be good to one another in spite of a sibling rivalry spat.  Go on with your plans if they work best for you and your fiance.  Congrats and blessings to both of you!
mFZeEm9paa	Having sex while on your period isn't nearly as bad as it sounds. My fiance and I do it every month, mainly because we can't wait the three days it lasts to have at each other. I am on the pill now, which does control the flow and it shortens the days, but don't let it ruin your vacation! Just make sure if you are in sheets that you lay down a towel first so that you don't stain anything. That was a lesson learned the hard way!|`|hzQ2aZz0aa	Isn't this the way it happens! Speak to your fiances, sometimes when you have sex you stop your period and it isn't gross at all and sometimes you stay the same, I don't believe there is anything wrong with it as long as you both agree|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	Ask your fiance what he thinks about it.  If it's gross for him, do special things for him and save your special moments for when you get back together.|`|eaQuLKbgaa	not if the mood strikes, baby!!!!|`|fb2d92b771dcd4d8b2d1dc3da6af3e05aa	guys dont care, just grab an old towel before you hit the bed, unless you want to ruin your sheets, or do it in the shower instead.|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	go for it!! Your best bet is to do it right after you have showered! or even take a skexy shower for 2 ;)|`|qAgF5R3Yaa	i have been with my girlfriend for 4 years now and I have never done it during that time.  Yes, I think it is gross, but in your situation talk to him to see if he is comfortable with it, go for it.  USE TOWELS LOL|`|r4vihoHIaa	Regardless of your period or not, you want to be with him before your separated and if he does too, GO FOR IT!!! It may lose intimacy if you have the lights on but if neither of you are grossed out do it. Shower or towels.|`|zQ0mUDBUaa	me and my husband have so its not gross t just depend if hes comfortable with it. not to sound sick but he's gone down on me when i had mine sooo yeah!|`|I5zi7mhzaa	I met a girl in a bar one night and she invited me back to her place. She warned me before hand she was on her menstrual cycle. I said that's OK, I'm on my Honda, I'll follow you home|`|6yM22fblaa	in my opinion yea , because it is your dying egg ya know . & it doesn't smell the best
1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	At fourteen, he's likely been curious about sex for some time now.  However, I think it's unlikely that he's checking you out.  Most boys aren't really turned on by their moms.  In fact, that's probably why he isn't concerned about being around you when you're naked; to him, your just mom, you don't have sexual properties.    Your son may be going through some other things that are causing him to suddenly want to be close to you.  Fourteen is a difficult age.  With dad in another country, you're the only parent and, since you didn't mention any siblings, I'm assuming that he doesn't have any brothers or sisters running around to spend quality time with either.    If it makes you uncomfortable, you could always get dressed in the bathroom and draw the curtains when you're taking a shower (should probably do that part anyway).|`|ScHW4842aa	Perhaps I am just a freak.   But at that age I never dreamed of looking at my father because I was curious.     Let him have free time on the internet.     and just to conclude - this question MUST be the work of a troll.|`|c816Ebkvaa	Of coure he's sexually curious at this age! His hormones are raging right now!    You just have to be assertive with him. When you want him to leave the room so you can have your privacy, don't take no for an answer. Make sure you lock the bathroom door so he can't peek at you in the shower. Don't walk around the house in a towel, it will just make him curious as to what's under that towel. make sure you're fully clothed at all times when you're around him. He shouldn't be seeing you naked at 14, that's way too old.    Other than that, you'll just have to let it pass. It's natural, and he'll get over it eventually.|`|4ssSgfYEaa	Lock your door when you aren't dressed!  Cover the bathroom window with a heavy towel!  Don't run around the house half dressed, or in see through clothes!    It is not normal for him to be seeing you naked at his age.  If her were 2 years old, that would be different.    Yes, at that age they are curious about sex.  He has probably already been curious for a couple of years.    If he keeps window peeping, he will be arrested and taken to Juvenile Jail!
igBds5Lhaa	give him time.  If you try to pressure him before hes ready he will crumble and fall apart and then you may lose your soul mate.  if things are really meant to be then don't worry about your age and how long its been, it will happen.|`|yGwda7wPaa	I think you should talk to him and tell him that you would like a commitment from him of marriage.  At least ask him about when he will be ready?  Don't push him into it, but be honest about how you feel, and see if you can get an honest reaction from him.  Good luck.|`|3652865bf75234629480db3292c40bc6aa	This is 2009, not 1959. Why don't you propose to him? Tell him what you told us and then ask him if he will marry you.|`|5r48jn7iaa	you never really know he is going to marry you until he says the words i do.|`|JGbSu74raa	Maybe he's waiting for a special time to surprise you or he can be saving up to buy you a ring. If you have already talked about marriage with him this is a good sign that he is ready to take the next step in your relationship ... just the waiting is sometimes that hard part but when he does propose it will be worth the wait. :)|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	He has let you know his intention, that one day you will be his wife, so why do you doubt him.  Do you not love him?  You are at the beginning of your relationship so there is no need for such excessive pressure.  Chill a little and concentrate on having a good time and all the reasons why you love him.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	good luck
fOYp0gGqaa	I just love free points.|`|Rzsudrzqaa	uhh.. exactly|`|1nk8WPrtaa	That's cool|`|WjxqhZG9aa	What are you talking about?  What do you not want to see?  You need to be more specific if you want help or advice.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	I think they are watching you for a reason.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	ok  u keep hiding  and let them keep watching|`|ab08ce8d0c96d3f3b3c871c338bb4351aa	absolutely. I couldn't agree more.    huh???WTF??|`|VBCPdcetaa	If I understand you correctly you like to watch your parents have sex?

I mean well.. if you like her.|`|nHi1mioBaa	yea she likes you :)|`|NBf5q2f5aa	she does def|`|hlXxuOOTaa	she sounds so into. go for it!|`|1GxMGmkqaa	i think she likes you and was was too shy to let you know just how much! she maybe wishy washy cos shes waiting on reactions/responses from you...|`|PIUAUgCaaa	She definitely likes you! Shes just trying to get your attention.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	Sounds to me like she does, but your best bet is to be direct and ask her.|`|lRemKlvOaa	what do you mean wishy washy??    well i would say ask her or maybe ask her out|`|rKsgGHKkaa	frm all that u just said it sounds lyk she likes u.  so y dnt u find out at this dance?  treat her how u would if u were on a date with her or sumthing. and mayb after the dance if u had a great time ask her out.    hope that helps!|`|UiWbfi3Raa	she likes you try kissing her|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Yeah I guess too but just ask things out to straightened things in your mind.|`|2vUOqAikaa	It would appear that she's into you. It would "appear".  Ask her to be sure. If she likes you then you've have found yourself a girlfriend. This is all on the assumption that you harbor romantic inclinations toward her.|`|08tdupUSaa	i think she does. :)|`|x51SQHxDaa	she probably does..go for it|`|bVsRXAapaa	yup she does. plain and simple.|`|kcM1FP6gaa	she likes u you have a very good chance with here good luck man|`|9a5xG7fraa	Yes she does|`|iEa3XJpNaa	I like you.  what else matters?  :)|`|sTGX3Puzaa	i do all that stuff to my friend David and i dont like him.....so i guess not|`|Pt9SRn6Jaa	dude she really likes you!  if you like her then do something you wouldnt have done otherwise like kissing her or hugging her to you when shes on your lap. if you like her then try getting your point across because she definitely likes you!|`|TtVk8S4aaa	i think for me she like you that isn't not normally|`|TrauHaubaa	sounds like she does. i dunno, sitting on your lap and feeding you doesnt really sound like a best friend kind of thing. lol i say ask her straight up if she likes you.  good luck|`|ChwJWjQSaa	if you need to, ask her. tell her how you feel. or just kiss her on the cheek. if she asks you why you didn't go for the lips, do so. and hug her.|`|RRTTWtxOaa	yes soooooooo obvious!|`|K3oLisRBaa	awww!!! of course she lyks you dats so sweet but the question is do u lyk her??|`|GQiMXAX3aa	i would say... yes.    there's a difference between best friends and crushing. best friends, you may do stuff together & you can hug, but i wouldn't sit on my best friends lap unless i wanted to send you a message that i'm into you. do you notice her being very "touchy" , like she'll touch your arm or your cheek? she's definitely into you. it's likely that she's just waiting for you to get the signal.|`|x6Tjg1AKaa	well it sounds like shes got a crush on you... its not really normal if you "best friend" sits on your lap ect.|`|KZ9ZE3yJaa	yeauh she totally likes you.|`|MjMkPi0yaa	Yes.|`|EwGTKxc4aa	she definitely does. those are only things girls who really care do, really.
rh12tX8Naa	talk to your mom about it.|`|hDAoKmjPaa	she tried to kill you? talk to your parents or a teacher or an adult you trust. lock your door at night and just try to stay away from your crazy sister. how did she try to kill you? ans what did you mom do or say when she walked in?|`|1a370a32d49eb577cd4ab9146d28bdd0aa	oh wow.  well, you cant avoid her if you live with her..  just try to stay outta the house as much as possible  and stay around your parents. be nice to her so u wont get in trouble|`|E6W5TRZKaa	Wow thats physco. She needs help! You should tell your mom how she treats you. Maybe get her help!      I'm so sorry.|`|5r48jn7iaa	kick her out of your life  if she calls don't answer  if she comes over don't open the door  if your going somewhere where you know she'll be go before she goes or after she leaves.|`|IkyVY3C0aa	go back and try too kill that *****|`|HWmRvunvaa	bake her an x-lax cake!!!|`|FPONPOlHaa	tell to f*ck off and push her|`|ej65ULT4aa	You seem have problem.Whenever you need help, it below will always help you solve dating problem.|`|66ZGO1w6aa	Avoiding her isn't going to fix the problem. You need effective ways with dealing with her, and that might mean having to figure out what makes her do things like that.|`|z5k0ZTt6aa	Wow, that's harsh.  She's got major issues and it's something you should talk to your mom about ASAP.
7CXVSa23aa	yeah i agree, that's weird.    although most moms/parents don't mean any harm and are only concerned about you, some have the tendency to overdo it. maybe she feels that you're hiding something from her and doesn't trust you enough, that's why.    i suggest you try talking to her to build stronger relationship with your mom. don't ever go against her as this could only worsen the situation. after some time, she could learn to trust you and won't have to threaten you to take off the door. :D|`|jYMlAN4Paa	Usually parents don't go this extreme unless you give them a reason to. She must have seen something you were doing, heard about something you were talking about or you went against the rules to the point she felt you needed more supervision. If you have no clue why she has gone to these lengths, then have a heart-to-heart talk with her. Don't throw around any attitude. Just be calm and ask why.|`|XAz6DGNJaa	thats weird.|`|wEcPi6Tvaa	she is physco talk to your dad|`|71RMmp2Kaa	what i think you should do, is sit down and talk to your mom, and tell her, that you think its time you need a little privacy.tell her you are growing up, and see how that workss. Good Luck! :)|`|TT6Nk0JNaa	I have one like this, but unfortunately I know no cure.  I would recommend not leaving anything interesting/private for her to find, either don't leave it in your room or be creative with hiding.  Really creative, like hiding it without making it look like its been hidden, because if she thinks you have anything to hide (or want to hide anything) she might get even worse.|`|EvvWL0PSaa	i think allison is right
Z11jZXOmaa	get him a teddy bear that says be my valentine.
lekzdej2aa	talk to him about it....    Listen to your heart! ?|`|SF5WnQFQaa	Who ever wins her wins her(talk to him about that)|`|V61O2fQraa	IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE BEST FOR YOU ALL TO TALK AND AGREE THAT NEITHER OF YOU GO AFTER HER, BUT YOU CAN ALSO SEE WHO LIKES HER THE MOST AND AGREE THAT ONE OF YOU WILL BACK OFF|`|EQ1Vs6AZaa	What you do is go after her and if your good then the girl will like you and not him. Then your friend will back off because he will see that she likes you and not him.
PTYHS1LDaa	If you can think of any ideas, you have to tell me!!! I can never think of what to get my mother...though, your ideas are great!  Try some perfume, or some shoes...maybe some clothes for the dog??!!..|`|RqDgxhTHaa	On my mom's birthday, i made a nice vase with clay. It's nice to make it. if ur thinking of real big one, than the basket sounds great. foreign films, im not sure wat u mean. go to a place where u could buy cool movies and ask the cashier or someone who could help ya. Ask them, they're a real helpers. but besure that ur mother likes those. :b|`|B3nqZw0Faa	I think you should get a GREAT picture  of the " dog "  lol. and blow it up and frame it for her.|`|mO5mwS0Uaa	How bout a portrait of her children.  Assuming  she has more than you.  Mom' s like pics of kids!
JyWCPVfzaa	First of all, your father shouldn't be hitting you like that. That is not the right way to raise a child. Where is your mother? And, if she's present, why doesn't she protect you? You need to speak to someone you can really trust. Fast.|`|eaQuLKbgaa	talk to ur mom, if that doesnt help then be straight out with ur dad and let him know that while 12 isnt an adult you still deserve a chance to choose wether or not you want to join a ball team. i dont know all the details of it but get a unlce or aunt to get involved who can help u talk to ur dad. its not fair that just cuz hes ur dad, he has to force u to do things or to spank u. i mean ur 12, your beyond that. dont be scared and talk to anther famly member, i dont see any other option, someone nneeds to step in to help.    good luck

Sex before or afterwards is optional, but personally I think adding sex is a bit too much.|`|clbngGJXaa	Well honestly you can't unless he already loves you, or ever will.  I mean if you're desperate for him to always have you on his mind, you're probably gonna have to have sex with him but that's not a way to go because he'll lose his respect for you, and that's like the worst thing ever. And no, he wont fall in love with you after that. But you will probably end up being the lust on his mind. I wouldn't want that.  I feel the same as you. I'd like to think he thinks about me, even if we don't really know each other...  Bleh. I still pray that he'll come my way someday. Maybe you should try that?  Kiss him on the cheek.

Have the body and the personality with a full smile.   Be flirtaous and make sure that you keep the right signals... a touch on the shoulder or fiddling with his hair.   But dont give into anything. Be the one that waits for marriage to do that... and always have your own opinion. Argue about music but don't fight.

Louis blues hockey game and then out for beer and hot wings and maybe a late night stroll under a full moon and taking in a favorite late night band at a pub.

aGcB3nUBaa	First off, make it a surprise!  That's what my fiance did, and he had a few of my closest friends in on it.   He had them plan a "girls day out" that ended with us going to the botanical gardens "on a whim", where he was waiting at the lake with a bottle of champagne. It was beyond perfect.  The big thing is, the place where he proposed has special meaning to us, and he wanted to get me there without suspecting.|`|UnuRaYbjaa	Well here are some really wierd ways to propose [made them up]  1. get some doves and propose. IF she says yes, have someone let the doves free  2. sice you are going to propose in October, go to a costume party, dress up like Frankinstin and your love as Frankistin's wife, and propose in front of the whole party. Once she says yes, dance with her to the Monster Mash.    This is all I have for you. Sorry! You can host the party and it would be super fun if you pick choice 2!|`|9jsmmCi3aa	I just got engaged on Christmas, which was great because I did not expect it. He said in order for me to find my present I had to find it and he gave me a card. I opened the card and it was a Thank You note saying something he was thankful for that I did for him, at the bottom, it had a clue of where to find the next card. The whole time I thought I was getting a present and when I got to the last clue, he was standing there with the ring and asked me. It isn't a great idea for October,unless her birthday is in that month, but maybe you can alter it to fit the occasion.|`|P48vHI66aa	hah a really great one i saw once was a girl i know was at a party with her boyfriend and he offered to go get them some drinks. he left her sitting at the table alone and got one of his friends to go up to her and ask her to dance. she said yes and then her boyfriend runs over there and tries to start a fight with the guy. she starts freaking out and he screams why are you dancing with my wife? his friend then says thats not your wife. and he hits his knee and says will you be my wife?    it was very cute. a complete surprise.       my fiance proposed in the pouring rain on a dock at my family reunion ;)      you just have to make it special    **note don't ever propose at the beach. girl i know had that happen and they were both so shaky they dropped the ring in the water. never to be found again|`|AA11620807	It obviously won't work for everybody but I got my dispatcher (I drive a big rig) and a buddy to set up a scenario.         When my fiancee was riding with me Brian (my boss) sent a load assignment to my truck.  Identical to a run ive done a hundred times, Meg was settling in for an uneventful week...... Getting to the shipper, i made up a pretense asking Meg to grab the paperwork. the clerk had a B.O.L. for "1each enagement ring". lol Her "WTF?" responce was cute.               I'd snuck into the building through a side door, and was standing behind her w/said ring.  getting her attention, she just gaped blankly in surprise for the second it took to realize what was going on.                  My words were: "as a friend and a love, you've always been the part of my world with light in it. I want you to be my wife because a single moment with you has more magic than most people experience in a lifetime. Will youi marry me?"       *****hope my story sparks some ideas for ya pardner!|`|IHNll9Yjaa	could take her to favorite baseball or basketball team's game and have 2 random people hold up a big banner during the 3rd ending stretch, 4th quarter, that says "____will you marry me?" then get down on one knee and ask her...or you you have a blimp, or the score board "----will you marry me?"        take her out on a "date" to her favorite restaurant and the place where you first met her, then give her a little speech about how much you love her, etc , get down on one knee and propose.      ask her on a holiday...... or your anniv....      take her to a theme park and propose to her at sunset on the Ferris wheel.        take her out on a "date" and take her dancing, then have her "go get a drink" and while shes doing that, ask the dj to play a song (slow and romantic) that describes the way you feel about her, or if you guys have a "song", or maybe one of her favorite slow romantic songs, etc...you get the hint....and while you're dancing with the song playing...(perferaby slow dancing) start telling her how much you love her, how much she means to you, etc...and then get down on one knee and say "_--------will you marry me?"|`|INybXKozaa	Well take something that is special between you two...  My friend and his (now) wife,  always went to the Books-a-million to read and have coffee.  One day he pointed out a ring in a magazine and told her to look at it,  when he gave her the book he tilted it so the ring slid into her hand,  and then he proposed to her,  when she said yes both of their families came out of the aisle.  It was special and she never expected it because it was something they always do together.      I also saw a guy propose on the field at a college football game. He said "Kayla" and then pointed to the stands..  All his friends held up a sign with a letter on it,  and it spelled out "Will You Marry Me"|`|28WJwHf4aa	My husband proposed to me on the beach, at 2am, in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.     He wasn't planning on proposing then. He had originally wanted to wait a couple more months until spring and then propose on a hot air balloon ride. He changed his mind as he figured out I would probably know where that was leading. :-)    Other ideas could be something with nature as the leaves (around here anyways) are typically at their peak during October and it's so beautiful out. Take a hike, pack a picnic, and propose over some champagne, overlooking a cliff, lake, etc.     Or you could go to an apple orchard, the kind where you can pick your own apples and cleverly pull an apple down (or pretend to have) that has the ring attached.    Just a couple ideas. If you can tie in something that you two like to do together...that'd work. Then she wouldn't be expecting it and would be surprised.
Ng0oiFvhaa	well i know how it really feels:(it feels like the world is over and u think that ur alone and it kills inside,so i really like to help u in ur issues....but now i found a lots of friends and...so if u want to have a friends just take a great look on them if they can understand u and care about u..just go and talk with them normally,and if they laughed on u just take it easy they will regret their fault,so just take it easy when they laugh on u...so hope that i helped u and gd luck..|`|BwNiS2Hmaa	Aww. Don't worry about it. Be yourself, and be confident. Don't let others put you down. If someone doesn't like you, its not the end of the world. School is so tiny compared to the rest of the world. You're going to meet lots of people in life. Some of them will be nice and some will be mean. Don't worry about the mean ones. They're just stupid, immature assholes who won't get very far in life.     Hope that helped. :)|`|AA12108398	well first of all don't try to be the stud. some girls go for that but most don't. if you're the jerk you say you are then you better clean up your act. im not being nice about this because if you want honesty that's what you'll get. go to skin id and take the acne quiz it'll help you out.|`|adCVnOVwaa	THX i herd darrin and i thought u were this darrin i now form mrs.Roseman class...but ahhh take the ear ring out get some pads for yo face and stuff get makeover get some classes for jerky ppl.lol|`|yRpS6mNbaa	look  those kids make fun of you bout your piercings  coz there jerks and dont got nothin else to do  what you got to focus on is that chick you like  find out what she likes and talk to her|`|BY6OSDSeaa	ok..thats why everyone hates you. you cant WANT to be that person, because if you do, youll be in your predicament. just change your atittude so that you just want to make friends that are guys and girls..but not girlfriends. then eventually you will get a girlfriend, but dont be focused on that. and maybe dont wear the earrings. and if you admit your a jerk, you cant be much of a jerk. just be yourself.|`|Zn05yFkfaa	look try to see what the popular kids wear then you dress like them....try to adapt to their way of life and you might wanna do something about that acne because it takes way more than laughter to catch a girls eye......you gotta have swagga!!
uGN7Lmg0aa	I have found it is often a mistake to project my own thoughts onto other people but it's possible your husband may be wrestling with the same issues.  I don't want to blame either of you for the current situation.    Offhand I'd say it sounds like you both need to make more time for just the two of you.  You don't have much time together to start with so it may need some real planning on both of your parts.  It's not extremely surprising that you're growing apart when you're not growing together.|`|pSpWOsiQaa	hahahah sucks|`|AA10248966	Go to marriage encounter. Plan twice a week to have alone sSpecialtime ttogether and daily to have 15 minutes alone.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	You're not damned if you don't ... not unless you change your attitude !    Why not make time at home more fun ?    It looks like you need to remind your husband why he loves you, and remind yourself why you love him.    All the fantastizing is the result of an idle bod pining for better times when you were young, wild and free. Thinking like that is ok as long you don't A) do it too much and end up dwelling there - which looks like you're heading straight for; and B) start acting on your thoughts.    I can tell you with zero hesitation that you will get out of your marriage what you put into it. I can also tell you that the people in life who are the happiest, are the ones who give of themselves and who find the time to do nice things for other people, whether they get anything in return or not.    When's the last time that you had a party at the door when dad got home from work with the little ones? When's the last time that you told him how happy you are to be his wife? When's the last time that you asked him what he wants for dinner, and then fixed it for him? Last time you rubbed his neck and shoulders just because? ... told him how much you appreciate everything he does for his loving wife and children? ... sent him a hot text message telling him what you're going to do to/for/with him tonight? ... hijacked his shower and washed his hair for him? ... told him what a wonderful husband he is?     When he comes home from work, greet him like you really miss him ! Bring the kids and have 30 second party after he puts down his stuff, and love him up "daddy's hooooome ! woo hoooo go get him !!! " You don't think that's gonna make his day? Just watch ...    You have drifted apart because you let it happen. You are partially responsible for how things are, but the best part about that is ... you can also fix it. We wimminfolk have all the power in a relationship, but we either don't recognize it, or we don't utilize it in the best possible way.    Look ... you have a man who loves you, a wonderful home, 2 healthy adorable children and money coming in! Seriously !! It ain't that bad !!    Best of luck !!    P.S. If you start focusing on your MARRIAGE, you won't have time to wish about what might have been or to be a ***** buddy with anyone but the hubs.  :D|`|EENUWAP7aa	No your not falling out of love...it's your husband that is falling out of  the relationship. This is natural...live with it because sooner or later he will get horny and tag one in the bed.|`|YeChwo70aa	you are craving romance! Plan a romantic night together!|`|Yh4YWdR1aa	You are probably lonely and not getting enough attention from your husband, so you start to think about the other guys that use to be in your life. I would have a talk with my man and see if maybe you 2 can do date nights to spice things up.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	Those are normal housewife fantasies.|`|h9L1AtMsaa	I think you are getting sick of being alone...I do the same things sometimes and then I always have to come back to reality that nothing like this would ever happen but my husband is far from perfect hes an ***!    Well if he wants to spend time with the kids thats understandable but he could of at least said can we wait till the babies go to bed and then like cuddle on the couch and watch a movie, or get a babysitter after they go to bed and get a late dinner and a movie offer somehting like this and see what he says, then you will really know whether he wants you still or not. Not saying that he doesnt want you just offer something along these lines and see what he says.|`|AABCy5mQaa	Your lonely mama. And your being neglected. Its completely natural to want to full fill your needs from someone else if your husband isn't doing it. If you were single I would say go ahead and leave the guy. But since you are married you should try your best to communicate with your husband about these problems and how you guys can try to fix it. At least try to make things better before you jump into another mans arms. If it doesnt work and he doesnt seem to care to change for you, then consider leaving or, uunfortunateas it may be, cheating. But only after exhausting all options. Good luck to you.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	You are mixed up.  What you need to do is sort out your own emotions before you make any catastrophic moves.  Can you get time away from the twins simply to think.  It sounds like that motherhood lark is not all its cracked up to be and in your emotional and worn out state your priorities have become confused.  What you are thinking is simply a fantasy,something akin to you still wanting to be thought of as desirable, even though you have 2 babies, stretch marks and a little extra fat.  Give your self time to recover from the shock of child birth, the enormous responsibility and the events that have changed your life forever.  If you had drifted apart for so long why did you ever contemplate a family.  Concentrate on the good things about your husband and why you have stuck with him for 14 years and don't do anything hasty.  I would suggest that he deserves more.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	I think I am going thru the same thing.    Have been married 22 years.  Retired about 5 years ago.  Then a couple of years later my wife retired.  I try to stay active in a variety of things but nothing is mentally interesting.  My wife want to do nothing but babysit grandchildren (3); spend money; and have me take care of her.    About 6 months ago, I started thinking about old girlfriends.  With the help of the Internet I have found where 2 are living - and they still are not married.  Have been considering how things might have been - if one of these relationships had worked out.    I think its happening cause you reach a point in life where you ask yourself "Is this as good as it will be?"; "Have I missed out on anything?" and  "Do I have 1 last chance to try something?"    My relationships with the 2 ex-girlfriends didn't work out back then.  Now older and hopefully wiser would there be more chance of success at this time?  Or am I remembering them as they were so many years ago, while seeing the problems of my wife and I having grown older (but so have the ex-girlfiends)?    What I have tried to do with my wife, is to pick a day of the week - and no kids - just the 2 of us go do things.  But all too often, she changes that day to a "lets baby--sit the grandchildren" day.    Part of this is, according to my wife - is that she had to work when her 2 kids were small so she missed a lot of school activities and spending time with the kids.  Now my wife has the time, if the parents of the grandchildren do not call us and ask that we baby-sit - my wife calls them and asks.  Every day.|`|TRt4tWGFaa	Well i'm on my fourth wife,,,every time it started out ,just about,  , like you are right now...Your thinking it,,you'll do it in a short time,,    start getting price's for a lawyer,,start singing dip to du dip Again today.|`|71RMmp2Kaa	well, what i think you should do its sit down when you two have time alone or together, and talk to him. and see how he feels. Good Luck To The Both of You! :)|`|bB8b7HXvaa	Well, I'm no marriage councilor, and I'm not married so there's not much I can say about this one.    But here's my position. When you got married to this man you're with you swore that you would stay with him until the ends of the Earth. There will be peaks and valleys along the way, and you must travel over and through all of them no matter what happens.    The only thing you can do as far as I know is seek professional help, somebody who knows exactly what to do in this kind of situation.    Another thing you need to consider is the fact that you're a mother, and that screwing up your marriage could seriously damage the life of your child.     Find a counselor, set up an appointment and talk to them about it.    I hope it all works out.|`|n91Wf2jeaa	Im not at all experienced with this situation, but if you don't love your husband your not helping anybody by being with him. & if you do talk with him and let him know that you need something more and see if you can work something out.|`|DfdK8lWRaa	Be open to what these feeling are telling you.  Some need you have is not being met.     However, just because you're having these feelings doesn't mean getting involved with someone else is a good idea at all.  These feelings are probably pointing to something that needs to be worked on in your marriage.    Good luck.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	There is a lack of communication that goes well beyond work schedules. If he is fine with an "open" marriage, then I guess you can do what you want. But if you are thinking about an extra marital affair without his knowledge...remember -  a secret is not a secret when more than one person knows. You should try to talk things out with him concerning your  (and his) feelings on where this marriage is failing before doing something that could make 14 years literally implode overnight.
AA11958375	Shop around for a good price, get lots of quotes and try to haggle.  Tell them you're on a budget and want a nice car but without the 'trimmings' (flowers, champagne etc) and will provide your own ribbons.  We got ours for 200 which is pretty good given that we were told no one would do it for under 400!!!    If in the UK check with your local taxi firms and see if they have a higher range car rather than your average taxi saloon car and can do you a good deal.    Or ask a mate with a nice car if they will act as chauffeur for the day.

We rented a car and it cost us about $70 bucks for the day.|`|28WJwHf4aa	If you're on a tight budget, I'd recommend renting a car for the day. This is what a few of my friends have done that were on a tight budget.    Or see if anyone in the family has, or knows someone who has, a vintage classic car that they wouldn't mind letting you ride off in.|`|Y08YLysXaa	Limos are too expensive, I don't like them anyway. The old fashioned cars like bentleys and jags tend to be cheaper. I'm having a black & white 1950 bentley and it's picking the groom up first, then me after, so that we only rent one car ad not waste money on two... it halves the price. The minimum rental time is usually 3 hours so if your wedding isn't far away, you can do that... then you can have the photos in front of the car at the wedding etc. If you have a very large bridal party or need transport from the place of the ceremony to the reception and it has to be in the special cars, then I guess just look for cheap deals to rent 2.|`|DqetlSB6aa	Rent from a rental car place.

Just get a car from one of the higher classes (business, or even "exclusive" or whatever they call it). These cars are nice and only around 100 dollars a day.

But it didn't end up to good. She was a good friend though, and she understood everything (even though she didnt agree with me =/).

And if you do end up going together, I say best of luck (:|`|AuthyG9Qaa	Yeah, it might be a good idea to chat with your best friend to see what the brother thinks of you.    On the other hand, the fact that this guy is your best friend's brother opens doors for you.

If you only knew what a mess you are about to make by going out with your best friends brother.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Talk to your best friend about it.|`|PmRbUgMoaa	First clarify it with your friend. Maybe she can give you tips on him. Don't change yourself to match his "type". How do you know he would never go for a girl like you?
Ir51Eb0Kaa	Wait for him to ask you for your number.|`|t4BpFdmdaa	He's a lunatic, why can't he just ask you out?|`|1GxMGmkqaa	sounds like he likes you.... :) and if you like him you would tell him if omeone gives you their number wouldnt you? guess that depends how often you see each other and if the numbers given you are importantto you. afterall, when you're with him do you think of those numbers?   if he has your number, does hecallyou?  sounds like you want something to happen? let hm know and see what he does.  personally i would tell him about the numbers. just because i do like him tht much and would feel more honest.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	maybe talk to him straight up about it or you there might be misunderstandings|`|YmgDYfbvaa	ask him out again. but make she he knows its an official date thing not just freinds.  he likes you obviously but is unsure how to make it official|`|AsNcyJZGaa	I'm going to assume that you're female.   And I know that most guys like a girl with moxy.    Just... grab his hand....  or kiss him...  or simply ask him out.     whatever you have the urge to do.     it'll seem scary as hell at first, but trust me, it WILL be worth it.|`|rJ3akTiVaa	I think he likes you ooooooo get one of your friends to dare you to ask him out.

VXyGwhdvaa	well. don't rely on what friends say, because a lot of times they say things that you want to hear. ask him in person or texting or im or something if he likes you, and if so move from there. be careful, though, because boys want in girls' pants more often than not. =]
HbayB338aa	4 get about her shes noy worth it|`|rurfFLDkaa	u shouldnt have told anyone u idiot|`|hDAoKmjPaa	you shouldnt of told anyone and dont tell anyone else. maybe she didnt want anyone to know since she is dating someone. or maybe she never even meant for it to happen and she regrets it. just let her cool off and then try to talk to her about it.|`|dqHt0moZaa	well if the kiss meant something to you should try and really talk to her about it but if it did't you should just forget about it.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Talk to her about it.|`|zdIQTA9Yaa	whoa she was probably drunk or she's lying to herself and her boyfriend because she doesn't like you like that and is more for the moment|`|kA1mYSOtaa	If she was still upright and coherent at the end of the night, she was likely not so drunk that she would not remember. The most likely scenario here is that she regrets it and is using the drunkenness/lack of memory as an excuse.    The question here is why is she pissed? Have you told others? Did her boyfriend find out about it or hear about it? Clearly, this girl is trying to cover it up for a reason; however, that reason is not important. The fact is that she was playing with your head - drunk or not - and is not truly interested or even respectful of you. I would suggest letting it go and moving on.|`|3sVc6Lptaa	just ignore it u were druunk
yPjw6lzYaa	keep up with what your doing, keep him posted on the child, but go after him for child support|`|zeTGmB3faa	Sorry, but this guy is a jerk. If you think about it he probably has many faults with commitments and responsibility but they didn't bother you to much at the time. Now he has a life long commitment and has decided to run.   I don't care if he is scared, that's too bad. He helped make a baby. Send him a picture if you wish, but also get an attorney to gain child support and full custody. Ask that his wages be assigned so that he check is sent to you promptly every month. I have no pity on men like this. You can do better and so can your child. If his parents are around they are probably ashamed of him.

I think "just let him get served and he can be a check daddy"|`|AA12108398	do not force the information. give him some space im sure he's just nervous and very confused.|`|oGoIxiQ0aa	the more u push the more he'll resist....just let it go however hard it might be and apply for child support as soon as the baby is born.   good luck|`|7NfQ6rI7aa	go talk to someone you trust! i thnk he just has pre baby gitters...let him know the updates if you can..but if he starts being an *** dont talk to him for a while... if you can talk to mom or someone you know will talk to you and help you get a gist of his feelings..to be quite honest he's just being selfishly pig headed come on HES not havin the baby!|`|WpJXnSH2aa	girl let his butt go, and as soon as she's born get child support|`|0dPEelS0aa	A woman becomes a mother to her child right away. A guy becomes a father in his eyes when he sees the baby. So send the picture when the baby is born but do fallow up on the support for your child,he was there too.Good Luck!|`|r4vihoHIaa	It depends on whether hes a boy or a man or maybe even a boy who could be a man. Sometimes its the guy losing interest because of how their girl looks/acts when pregnant, sometimes its because their scared about being a father. You need to know what his feelings are. So I'd say keep him updated (not daily though) and if he doesn't respond after the baby is born, then hes not ready to be a man or may never be. If it comes to that he might as well be a check daddy because that's all he'll be worth then. But even then maybe he'll grow up and want to be a part of the child's life. So try, as hard as it may be, to keep him involved until you've had enough.|`|fRv3hJ5raa	This is a heartbreaking situation.  It sounds like the father to be is scared and this is how he is showing it.  To be honest I'm not sure what you should do.  I see others have expressed their opinions and that's fine.  You should follow your heart.  My question is this:  Do you still love him and not just love him but in love with him?  Things need to be considered on both parties and it is not going to be easy for awhile.  Best of luck to you and if you need more advice from me go to my new yahoo group page called harmony is POSSIBLE!  my email is on there too. Once again, best of luck to you and your unborn baby.
7pFVHdssaa	When time permitted for you.  At least call and check on him once a week would be nice.
ejHQstBeaa	I miss her smile, looking in her eyes, I miss the way she would look at me and make me feel like nobody could ever make me feel.  I miss the smell of her hair when we would lay in bed, the warmth she gave.  I miss how she would yell at me when I was wrong, or when I wasn't paying attention.  I miss how she would complain when I asked for her to walk on my back because it wasn't good for me, I miss how she would do it anyway just to make me happy.I miss how she told me she loved me, and I miss how she LOVED me!  I miss evrything about her, mind body and soul.|`|xMyvEdOiaa	Just the feeling you get when you know they are there.|`|jaukRNb1aa	http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1254059 6dzz5z5...|`|0td65n04aa	His smell, his kiss in the morning before he goes to work, the warmth of his body in our bed next to me, his strong arms wrapped around me. In short everything.|`|G8Wsmbogaa	His love for me. His smell.  His kiss. His sense of humor...I could go on and on. And this is after more than 22 years of marriage.|`|JLAf5s6Iaa	My prison cell mate|`|WpJXnSH2aa	go to this link pls, funnnnyyyy        http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1271192 6dzz5z5...|`|49We7buoaa	I truly miss just him, our love, and everything about the way he makes me feel, me & my husband were separated tragically for 2 months, he was almost taken away from me forever as time goes on you miss him and everything about him, us, happiness all together!!!

Yeah, I'm a sap.|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	I miss the way he looks at me and in that deep voice says little things that get me all worked up.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	The way I feel around him.  I forget how comfortable and at home I am with him.  My friends and family are wonderful, but when I'm just at home, and it's just me and him, it feels like...a cocoon of comfort, happiness, and contentedness on a lever I can and will never feel anywhere else.|`|oc0pCUhyaa	the comfortable silence with no need to talk... just basking in their company|`|AsSMWbdyaa	Everything...the way he says I love you or holds me|`|vSJIorF7aa	Kissing and sleeping next to them.|`|0PHRkiomaa	All of him!|`|l0RVQn0Faa	Its just the presence, the smile, the chatting, the way he looks at me.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	The rhythm of his breath when sleeping.|`|363YPQ62aa	How comfortable i feel in his arms, how the feel of that makes everything ok.
5DJzp6bMaa	You cant Pick your family But You can tell them to Keep their opinions to themselves as they are Not all Perfect to everyone either.  Basicly ask them To show you some respect and Shut their Traps about him.|`|BE2vknbHaa	I had a similar situation. Explain to your family that it makes you feel bad when they bad mouth your spouse. If this doesn't stop them just take some time away from them. I know it sounds hard but they have to respect the person you are with and if your spouse makes  you happy they should leave it at that and be happy for you putting their feelings aside.|`|nT7eoF66aa	You're married. You and your husband are partners. Tell them until they can grow up, you won't be coming around anymore. It may take a few months or a couple of missed holidays and once they realize you're serious, they will hopefully grow up.
khUcAjgIaa	Yes.  God yes!  I'll bet you are sexy as Hell...!!!|`|jeHTjvbaaa	5'9 is cool but I have no idea what those sizes are =(|`|jYMlAN4Paa	Bust, waist, hip and how tall you are doesn't matter or tells anyone if you are sexy. Sexy is a state of mind. It's how you carry yourself, your confidence, mannerisms, etc. People find a billion different things sexy. So giving your measurements and height isn't going to tell anyone anything about you. If you want to be sexy, be confident and take care of yourself and do things that you enjoy doing....don't act in a certain way for anyone else.|`|CWkMRMwxaa	i would think alot of people find that attractive|`|DqzhHZnoaa	well in a song i heard,   the guy wanted a girl who was 36-24-42    and yur extremely close  so im guessing yes :)|`|lRemKlvOaa	it really depends on how you look. what you gave are just numbers and dont distinguish hot and ugly|`|EmWbvWEQaa	thats sexist and impossible. nobodys barbie with a 28 inch waist and a 37 inch boobs and 40 inch butts.|`|lqzmJlrRaa	Wow. I wish!|`|Okc9dlxmaa	well if her waist is 28 n her chest is 37 that means she got big boobs and a 40 ***?? DAAMn u want that hr glass shape, but yea i think that's sexy bt that's too tall for me bt i guess if U tall then she's perfect =)

ugvgt6rMaa	second Cousin.|`|IqoRBVUTaa	Ummm.......False?|`|YNPNfbf8aa	an aunt|`|HDxRtZmvaa	second cousin|`|NbdZoxxQaa	second cousins|`|cLkA2nihaa	Well, if the grandfather is your mothers father than it's your mothers cousin, if the grandfather is your fathers father, then its your fathers cousin,  or you could call them your second uncle.     Hope that helps .          By the way, to everyone that said second cousin, it'd only be second cousin is she said her grandfathers sisters GRANDson, but she only said son, so its not second cousin .
BY6OSDSeaa	your right that isnt typical    she sounds like a desperate-to-make-friends pushy person. and if it were possible i would kick her off the team. but its not, so if i were you i would talk to your close group of 6 or 7 friends and get things straight...agree that this girl is crazy and that none of you will believe a word she says. and just ignore her..shell probably still attempt stuff..you cant stop her, but dont let her lies get through to anybody.|`|6jh2ylTLaa	Leave her be, she is obviously a complete wierdo in search for more mates the wrong way. She needs to get a life. She obviously wants attention, and if you don't give her any, that will get right up her nose!!    These kinds of situations always always blow over in time, and in a couple of weeks/months, no one will care. If I were you, I'd let her get on with it!    xxxx|`|jAvK15bcaa	tell her to "bring it on, again"
eNA4LIyFaa	dont worry about calling his home phone! It should be weird, and dont let that reason alone detour you from going for someone that you like... phone and internet situations are always temporary, I'm sure after you start dating him you can talk him into making a facebook or myspace... or to get a cell? I dunno, then again, you didnt say how old you are, you sound pretty young... maybe too young to even be dating!|`|R7DKpBF3aa	tell him to get a screen name on AIM or something. or tell him to call your cell so you cant talkk, that way you ddont feel awkward calling him.|`|OFGV2Jj2aa	you could tell him to get a facebook or myspace, I used to think they were poinless but than alot of girls at school kept telling me to get a facebook, than a girl I kinda like told me to so I decited to get it and I really like it now.    about the cell phone.. how old are you? if child labor laws restrict him from getting a job he probobly cant get a cell phone because possibly he cant afford it. (like me)    call his home phone and set up a time to go hang out, wether its just walking around town, hanging at a park, or something.|`|nKyluejWaa	email. both of you should create a gmail account. they have chat & you don't need to download anything to chat. all you need to do is log into your email & the chat thing automatically opens. Its a good way to talk.|`|fRv3hJ5raa	Dear I need boy advice fast!    This is not an easy issue since the boy does not have a cell phone or a myspace.  However, does he have an email or even a computer?  Perhaps you could talk to him at school, eat lunch with him and all, and hint around about how to talk to him besides school.  Does that makes sense?  If he likes you, he'll ask you out.  I know that is cliche and you will most likely roll your eyes when you read this but if he likes you too be patient.  Talk to him at school and the two of you can figure out the rest.|`|6DNCqunDaa	You need to get over your fear and call him. Tell him what time you are going to call and tell him to answer if you are so scared. I used to be the same as him and my girlfriend would call my home phone without a problem.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	lol.. ask him to make himself a email account and chat w/ him or something... and whats wrong w/ calling him at home... most guys would be like... oh dont call me at home... chill... just ask him to create a facebook when u too are out and tell him that you want to have a easy communication option, im sure he'll understand. :)|`|hA6JDWsFaa	you sound young. make the most out of your youth and write letters to each other. :] it'd be cute and romantic.|`|lRemKlvOaa	email, try to hang with him a lot at school, or hang out after school|`|0NjU7Ps0aa	omg! you should definately call his house phone asap and ask him to hang out or something...like ask him to go with you to an ice cream place or something lol (probably not something as cheesy)    omg! good luck! i hope you guys go out soon! :)|`|0t7tleevaa	ask him if he wants to go someone[not on a school day],next time you see him.|`|5bZ2sPO3aa	What's wrong with calling his house and why is it weird?  You do know that people all over the world still use those old fashioned things in their homes called phones right? Give him your cell   and let him do the calling if calling his house freaks you out. Then you'll know how much he feels like talking to you.|`|bNxBFbxVaa	in person?
0PHRkiomaa	The children decide. My step children call me by my name... after all it is my name! I think the term "step" whatever is getting a little archaic. I mean, I will always look out for my partner's children like they are my own, but I'm not their mum.... They have a mum. I'm just another adult who watches over them and I love the fact that they call me by my nickname, because only my best friends do that.|`|rm1oLtNtaa	She is the stepmother... I have stepped into that role with 2 older children ( they were 16 and 20 at the time of the marriage).. they are now 21 & 26...  never tried to be their mother. Just try to be friends and get along.   It will not be easy.. my step kids and I do not see eye to eye on things and resent me for opening my husbands eyes (their father) to the way they treat him and use him...    Good Luck I hope this all works out.|`|aeb6a9eccc02ea073c914dc6ce0edcaaaa	step mother|`|MMnjWEM7aa	Yes, why wouldn't it be?  If it's because of age, then at what age does the rule change?|`|c1wCuGzpaa	yeppers|`|lvelp0CGaa	Guh , YES she is the step mother the only difference is if your an adult and you dont live with them or rely on them for financial support then she doesnt have to put up with childishness from the mother using you as a power pawn and she doesnt have to put up with back chatty little brats who dont care if their parent is happier with the new spouse or not .|`|BE2vknbHaa	Yes doesn't matter the age she is the stepmother.|`|1qa4dFVXaa	My parents divorced when I was 19. They both remarried, but I don't refer to either of them as a "step". I refer to them as my mom's husband, and my father's wife.|`|nT7eoF66aa	I refer to them as my "out-laws".....
EYLSyeajaa	that could be a hint that theres romantic potential..    or youre just very comfortable to be around. what does your gut say ? i think its the 1st one but maybe im just a hopeless romantic. but since im not he so likes you ;]    take a risk. tell him how you feel. if he says 'ditto', congratz you win a bf. if you get a 'just friends', you didnt loose anything & you can move on to someone else w.o all the mid-day thought on what-if. i think every girls been there at some point.    i, unlike the majority, i guess- tell the guy i like him. it just works better for me. i act on impulse anywho. cant help it.    text him if youre too freaked of rejection, call him so you dont have to make eye contact, tell him in person if you feel brave & want to analyze every bit of facial expression he makes. whatever just do it  !! haha ;]    he obviously likes you, is he a good enough guy to fin out whether there could be more ? if you think yes. take a deep breath & a risk. do this while its early in your friendship. later theres the whole 'but i dont want to mess us up as friends !' drama.     if he doesnt feel that way, after a short while, things go back to normal. its complicated if youve been friends for longer.    think about it. hes somehow drawn to you. interested. 'in ways i know no one else'. what does he say about his other firends ? theirs your other hint. is it as special ? any girls there ? check it out.    best of luck,  be brave ! happy relationships, etc. haha ;]    tis better to have loved & lost than to have never loved at all.    i like it. its remembered for a reason right ? i think so..|`|O1IwHvMtaa	You are obsessed.|`|RonpMv7eaa	send him some hints that you want him to ask you out.  use body language like play fix your hair  as soon as he sees you.|`|C7AtkIxkaa	Well i think he likes you if he talkes about you this part makes it i know you in ways,i know no one else that makes it well if you like him and he likes you you should get your flirt on thanks|`|DqzhHZnoaa	that's ....  a lot of big words.|`|AA11925968	Wait how old is he?|`|R7DKpBF3aa	flirtinggg. (:   aha.|`|8pGATK0Laa	ohh sounds like there might be something more. GOOD LUCK! ;)|`|z6SWHngRaa	It sure sounds like it. At least it sounds like he doesn't think your just a normal friend.|`|EGt1a4Byaa	Hmmmm  lemme think about this lol  its a 50/50 chance really   lol  anyway it could be both but probably if you spend more time with him you guys will probably be you know going out lol xp haha well good luck =}|`|6DNCqunDaa	That means he met you not to long ago but already likes you.|`|kSlN7MjEaa	This guy is interested in you  - I see this friendship developing for you but take it easy.  As you really like this kid I would take it real slow -  at the moment its seems a good friendship and this is how relationships are built - one step at a time.  It doesnt do to rush ahead at the moment he likes you a lot as a friend. It may stay like that but it may not.  Just wait and see.
7EheyuEwaa	i am weirded out that your english teacher is that involved that he tells your parents stuff that has nothing to do with ENGLISH unless you're making out in class.   i would request a transfer and dump JOSH.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	As a parent I would want my child to be honest with me.

CaKu7gbAaa	Marry him happily, your Father must have chosen the right person for you. I am sure you will lead a happy life because it will be full of your parent's blessings, love, care and concern and the biggest is their satisfaction.|`|20f48fd2f5814755e839599a99c717b3aa	You are an adult. You are free to live the life you choose. If your goal in life is to make your parents happy...then be prepared to spend your life unhappy. I don't know if there are cultural issues that come into play here, but it sounds like it.   Being a successful person means being a person who is happy with who they are, what they personally have accomplished. Not what anyone else thinks. We all want our parents to love us and be proud, but what they want is to control what you do. Who you become. That is not unconditional love. That is manipulation. Your brother felt the need to escape and unfortunately, got caught up in a situation that ended his life. That is terrible but it is not your job to make up for your brother's misfortune and mistakes. I feel for you. I think you need to experience the real world. You are leaving one prison for another and I want you to know that there is a huge world out there. A world full of opportunity and new people to meet and experiences to be had. You have missed out on that. You don't need to miss out on it any longer.   Your desire to keep your parents happy is making you unhappy. I wish you the absolute best but I also think it's time for you to break free from their control and live a life on your terms. It is not your job to keep your parents happy.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	I'm very sorry that you are put into a situation where you feel forced to marry someone you don't love.  I think you need to do what will make you happy.  I'm sure your parents would eventually get over you not being with this man. I'm also sure that they want you to be happy (isolating you wasn't the best way to do that but they may have been trying to protect you)  Find someone you truly love...you deserve that!|`|5TLGa3awaa	Considering that you were raised very isolated I would venture to guess that you are a bit naive.  Your parents need to realize that you are a legal adult and let you out of the house and experience life and you need to realize that you can't live to make your parents proud and happy.  You're supposed to live to make YOU happy.  I know your parents were very much affected by what happened with your brother but you are not your brother.  They're adults, they're smart, they need to realize this.  Don't marry someone to make someone else happy.  Go out and explore life and this world and find someone you want to marry because you LOVE them not because you think it will make your parent's grief go away.  If it's true that your parents only let you out of your room to get something to eat or use the bathroom I think that would be considered borderline abusive.  That's no way to live.  You need to have a serious talk with them and let them know that they can't control your life forever.  There is so much you need to learn about life and yourself before you commit yourself to someone.  Plus, this guy telling you that he wanted you without even knowing you sounds pretty creepy.  I'd say think long and hard about this.  I'm sorry you're in this situation.  Good luck.|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	You need to leave - now. Since you clearly have unobstructed access to the internet, contact the police through the internet if you need help getting away.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	I think you should move out, (If you are a "legal adult" and your parents should get out of the ice age. No offense, but just because they are lawyers, doesn't give them the right to treat you like an animal. There is no hard fact that you will turn out like your brother and they should, and YOU Should give yourself a chance to prove yourself. Don't worry about them being "Dissapointed"...you really shouldn't make that your only goal..good luck with your marriage, but I hate to say "I Told You So." You are letting your parents pull the strings..YOU ARE NOT A PUPPET.|`|76nTvO4iaa	What country do you live in?|`|CaPZrWVWaa	You are an adult?    get a job, save some money, MOVE OUT. Stay sober and try to take some community college classes.     You are just not some vigina that needs protecting that can be traded away.    Don't be so concerned about pleasing your parents. They should love you for who you are, and their love should guide you to succeed in life, not imprison you.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	I dont think you should spend your life worrying about making other people proud of you. I dont know where you are from but judging by your use of the word MUM, you may possibly be from England. I am not too keen on English culture, but the only thing I can tell you is that you should do in your life what makes you happy. If you dont like this guy, then I would not suggest marrying him. Being forced into marriage may cause you to become a bitter old hag some day.     Good luck with your decisions though.|`|yhkEyVXLaa	Well, I can see that you have made up your mind and that there really is no question here, just a follow up up to those who have already answered this with more clarification.  I understand that you want to make your parents happy, truly, but you are also the one to live with this decision.  They may say get married to him because they know that he is not like the girl your brother ran away to be with.  But do you really want to get married to him.  Because you are a grown adult you can make decisions for yourself.  So your parents will be disappointed here and there, but it is not the end of the world.      I don't think that your mom will ever get over your brothers death, because that was her only son and she probably loved him to the end of the world, just like the way she seems to love you by trying to, in a sense (and please don't take it the wrong way) control your life from grade school to now marriage.  You have to be able to make your own decisions and by marrying someone you don't love to try and make your mother happy seems like a dumb thing to do.  You can always compromise and say you will date him, but don't say you will get married to him.  You should make yourself happy, and I think that if you are happy, they will be too.  What happens if you don't like this guy and become miserable and sad because you feel like you can't get out of the marriage because your parents will be disappointed?  Do have any attraction what so ever to this guy?      Of course you know what's best for you, but for this type of thing you need to let go of your family like a family has to let their child go. (such as a family seeing their child move away on their own, your family needs to do that now with you)    I don't want to sound like I am telling you what to do, but I think you should marry for your happiness and for love, not out of fear of disappointing your family.  If you have grown up, went to school, got a career going for you, then I would say you have made your parents happy.  Now it's time to make yourself happy and begin living your own life.    Well, all in all, I wish you the best of luck in whatever it is you decide to do.|`|EQOnbP3Qaa	Omg hun don't do that to yourself!! You need to get out of your parents house if you are over 18 and see how the world really is. I understand you want your parents to be proud of you but they way they treat you trust me they never will act like they are! I was in a similar situation! You need to understand your mom will always be sad and upset about your brother you marrying this guy (you don't like) is not going to help anything!! And its just going to make your life more miserable then it already is!! Please don't do that to youself!
cLkA2nihaa	Don't make things right, give her the wake up call she deserves, obviously she isn't treating you right . Just say nice and loud, how you feel, tell her she treats you like... and that your not apologizing for anything, because really and truly, its all her fault, you can't let her win, or else it will go too far .    If she doesn't change, or realize that shes wrong, then dump her, you don't need her .|`|x51SQHxDaa	u dnt need to make things work she is just a *****|`|zLsA6IAPaa	you shouldnt have to say sorry for something that she has brought upon herself. I had a friend like this and she always tried to be better than me and treated me terribly, the best thing to do is stick to your friends accept you and treat you the right way. dont be mean to her because that would only be reducing yourself to her level, just stick to your guns and dont put up with any of her ****, shes not worth the attention.    i know its hard losing a friend, especially a best friend, but when someone treats you in a ad way, then maybe they were'nt the good friend u thought they were and therefore, their friendship isnt worth you being hurt...    good luck ok :) i hope everything sorts out ok without too many blow outs|`|SIAbrVZZaa	first of all, good for you for standing up for yourself. but you cant let this friend, who doesnt sound like she was a good one to begin with, rule you. it sounds like you dont need her at all. Try branching out and dont even worry about making things work, she is obviously not a good friend. surround yourself with people who make you feel good about yourself.    hope it helped girl, good luck (:|`|PmRbUgMoaa	Part of life is making new friends. friends may come and go.|`|7a3AkKVTaa	You're right, there is absolutely no reason for you to apologize for sticking up for yourself.  And, for someone that calls herself your beset friend, she shouldn't be treating you like that.    Are you happier now that you are more outspoken about your feelings?    If the answer is yes, then her opinion doesn't matter.     She will either accept the new you, or she won't. But that's on her if she doesn't because she is missing out on a good person.    Just do what makes you happy, and if other's can't accept it, then that's their problem.    You don't need people like that in your life anyway.
Dh5CUjmkaa	Do whatever makes your future husband and you happy. I took my husbands last name because it shortened my name. I would also think about your future children and what last name they would have. If yours is different, it confuses people. It also might confuse your kids when they are little too. It also is a little bit more traditional to take your husbands last name and some guys just would rather their wives take their last names. But whatever you choose, you are stuck with so make sure it is really what you wanted and not what you think is cool now.|`|KwNpyp3saa	It's not necessary to take your husbands name legally when you get married. I didn't. You can use it socially thought.
AA11607270	Sounds like your s/o does not appreciate you. I wonder if your chemistry is bad. Give her some time to cool off and try again in a few days. Surprise her with a gift that she does not expect.
lJ8SNaHEaa	Please don't feed me strait lines like this, they are just real difficult to resist! I will however, this one time only. So, No, I don't have a wife. When I was fifteen I came home from a date, with my dad still up, waiting for me, said goodnight, looked down and there was a rubber my boyfriend had just used on me, stuck to my shoe. It was the only time I was thank full pops was a drunk, not very observant......Oooops, I can not lie, I held that attitude for the next three years........|`|NSKimt1Qaa	Did this happen to you?

My uncle was in a hurry to get to work -he asked my aunt where his clean handkerchiefs were she said hanging on the line outside he grabbed what he thought was one (it was white, after all) stuffed it in his jacket pocket and went off to work.    Later he was in conference with some big wigs when one made mention of needing a handkerchief but left his at home...my uncle gave him his only....    ..it turned out to be a pair of my aunt's undies.    He came home furious and told her..when she made no comment he asked her 'don't you have anything to say?' She replied 'yeah, I hope they were one of my new pair, the old ones have holes'.......|`|XkJfs2l9aa	Hahahahaha!  Thats so funny!|`|8nGZV6ufaa	I'm am laughing too hard to even answer this one!!!!  WOW...I know I'm laughing, but I hope this is one you live down quickly if it truly happened...OMG...LOL!!!
QsbB6vkoaa	i think this is normal because obviously the divorce was harder for you than it was for her, but i think that the best way to straighten everything up, is to really talk to her and to offer to help more with you son, she'll probably enjoy having more time for her self. i think you are a great father and you should probably start moving on with your life, try to meet people, and try to take one whole week to yourself. if that doesn't work then you should probably consider counseling, it's also for the child's benefit.  and if she doesn't let you see your son, you can always share custody. i know this might be really hard for you but, i promise it will all get better, all divorces are hard.   although you shouldn't drink even if you are alone, that way you can think clearly of how you can fix this situation.  good luck!!|`|MVxFOI5naa	You are depressed and missing your son- go visit a therapist and get back on track -its very normal under the circumstances and you need to vent to a neutral party-good luck -it gets better!|`|jTsQkuhHaa	Offer her the money if you can take your son and move back to your town and get your old job back that pays more.  She is using your son as leverage for money..  So if she has the money you can have your son and everyone is happy.|`|Txr5PvXgaa	Take your  well-written letter and give it to a lawyer.  She's busy with other children so go ahead and  petition for sole custody of your child.  In the meantime, keep your pants zipped. ;)    Best of luck to you.|`|QkYRnTPIaa	Yes, it sounds like you are going through a bout of depression.  You are experiencing so much loss--the expectations of a happy marriage, not being able to see your son every day, less money for your security, losing the closeness of friends and family, etc. and this can be overwhelming.  Sometimes there is only so much we can take and then we crash.  You are doing all the right things but it will take time to heal the wounds and get yourself back on your feet.  Keep focused on your son and the relationship you have and will have because you are determined to be a significant person in his life.  Sometimes we have to sacrifice a lot when we believe we are doing the right thing and it's so nice to see that you love your son so much that you will risk it all.  He may not appreciate all you're doing for him now but he will as he gets older.  Hang in there.  Don't let your ex-wife's issues control your decisions and your emotions.  You'll get through this and it will draw you and your son even closer together.  Take care.|`|AqvEHHsTaa	sounds like you are in love with your child and that is wonderful.  Ask the ex is there anything that you can do for more visitation.  Or take it back to court.  Ask for anything more, even dual custody (she has a week, you have a week, etc.)  Since you live in the same town, it might be possible without too much upheaval on the child.  But before you do anything that drastic like dual custody, make sure that the child could handle it.  You might want to talk to a counselor or something for the child.  Additionally, you might want to get involved in a church or other community groups because you need to draw  out of your shell.  Go for walks, meet new people, etc.  You have to keep your mental edge to be able to be the best parent you can be.  Divorce is hard and it does something to you inside, no matter how easy the divorce was or how ugly it got.  It is a wound deep inside and it has to heal, bear with it and it will.  Good luck, God Bless|`|zyhbCGwpaa	Whether of not you choose to see a doctor, it seems like you are experiecing something very natural:  grief. Even though you are not mourning losing your ex-wife, you have lost the IDEA of an intact "happy" family. Your dreams and visions of how you would raise your child have been seriously changed. On top of it all you are living with many unknowns, and are unable to spend the time you want to spend with your beloved child.    Give yourself credit for being a dad that cares enough to be there for his child. You might benefit from a dad-advocacy group website that  could help you determine your rights. Either way, your love for your child WILL get through- you have to trust that. Take good care of yourself.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	You need to join some clubs. There is Parents Without Partners, gyms, churches, book clubs, take a class at the local community college. You need to fill up some time. Your spending to much time alone and your grieving over the loss of your marriage. Even though you are glad the divorce is over, it is like a death and you do need to grieve a little. Things will get better with time but you need to make a life for yourself and your son.
h6NqNzHAaa	Just do it for you niece. It's one morning you have to get up early. Otherwise you can disappoint her just so you don't inconvenience yourself. Or you can make up some ridiculous lie and hope she never finds out,
T3b4I4kXaa	You can't debate anything with a parent that has such a hard mindset. He is a snob and wants you to be a Barbie-doll.  You can just give him the precursory "yes, sir" or "uh-huh" as if you were agreeing with him, and sluff it all off. It just means that you have to get slick and do your best to NOT look like you are rebelling.    Arrange to have some extracurricular activities on your schedule when he's trying to stick you with your cousins.    Wear your hair its original color for a few months, then go darker. Chances are, he won't notice.|`|x2YuF1pxaa	Just ignore him and go on being yourself. He'll come around eventually.  My dad was similar.  Honestly, I told him exactly where to go.  When I moved out we became closer and he was more accepting of me because I proved that I would turn out okay.|`|Dh5CUjmkaa	I did not get along with my Dad when I was growing up. He expected perfection and would freak if I made a mistake. It should get better when you grow up and go out on your own. For now, if your Mom says it is ok for you to dye your hair, then dye your hair. Yeah he is going to be upset, but, it is just hair, it grows back. Let your Mother deal with him about your hair. As far as your friends, as long as you are not doing anything illegal, getting pregnant, or arrested, he should be pretty happy. Don't hang out with your cousins who make you feel uncomfortable, keep your friends. Live your life the best you can and realize that you just have to live in his house until you graduate from high school.|`|WV12FdQ9aa	your dad should love you now matter what, he may not like the way u act or who u r as a person but deep down he loves you... try sitting down and talking to him

K5BLCZPkaa	I think it really depends on who you ask. Older people would probably be more likely to say that going out is just like a date or something, and not that you are in a relationship, and dating is having a relationship. But a younger person may just say that they both mean having a relationship with someone.|`|PogMq7Pcaa	same thing just diff words|`|1GxMGmkqaa	could be classed as one and the same? but really youre only going out fi you date more than once or so... lotsa people go on dates butarent necessarily going out. i had a bf i used to go out with, have diner with but we were not an 'item'. so yeh, i think its up to the two people to get the defenition right in the first place or someone ends up Hurt!|`|AA11599430	it's basically the same thing|`|40qTdKuPaa	Going out is like going out to a movie, or going out to eat, Dating is like hey im dating whats her name! going out is hanging out, dating is being together as a couple ., Hope this helps      BEST ANSWER!!!|`|98cJg2pCaa	They are the same thing... depending on the context.    If your going out with somebody, you could be going out with them to the movies, a restaurant, shopping etc. Or, you could be dating them. It really depends on the context.    But judging by your question it is the same thing.|`|wFWytGlxaa	I'm just as confused as you are.|`|f461d86afd8051107a1ec0da06ed496caa	Some people use the phrase "going out" to mean that they are in a sort of committed relationship with another person.

Going out is like being together and would call each other. In dating, you might as well be with him. Going out means you can "cheat" on th person with other guys if you r not together.|`|kSlN7MjEaa	If you are dating it may be one off if you are going out it means you have been on a few dates.

MTwfByWVaa	Advertising yourself to the world isn't a great way to solve your problem. First of all... you know no one on this site, so how are you going to date them? Second of all, there is this one this called "date rape". That happens a lot with people that meet over the internet.  You sound like a desperate girl who won't open her mind to her surroundings. What you need to do is meet people. Young, old, short, tall, whatever! The more people you meet, the more people like you, and the better chance of you getting a boyfriend.|`|ronomgTIaa	why would you want to be an ex?

I have never had a gf or been on a date either. I saw my frineds in relationships and asked why can't I have that. But what started to happen is I began to chase the idea of the relationship instead of a strong connection. Like, I would ust want a girlfriend just to have a girlfriend to feel better. Lie I would see 13 year old guys with girlfriends and questioned if I was missing something at 16 years old which I am now.    Sometimes it is hard and I feel a bit sad, but if you wait to find that one special guy, it makes it all worth it.     I am sorry that this is really not an answer to your post, but I would advise to wait. It sometimes makes it tough, but if you wait for that one guy that you really have feelings for then the relationship will have so much more feeling and experience behind it.    I hope you find what you are looking for :)

lboU795iaa	My only suggestion is that for your kids' sake you keep the line of communication open. As they get older they will realize what a strong person you were in trying dealing with your ex's bs so that they could have a shot of having the relationship with him. On the other hand they will come to terms that their father was a piece and only respect you that much more for trying.    ****MILDRED SENT ME****|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Yes You are|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	Stop talking to him about anything. Tell him if he wants to see the kids, he can see them on Friday or whatever day you want and give him a time. If he does not show up, wait 15 minutes and then take the kids and leave. If he complains, tell him that you have other things to do besides sit and wait for him that if he wants to see the kids he must show up on time or you will not wait for him. Stop talking to him about anything else in his life. Unless it has to do with the kids you don't speak to him about anything. He will either get the message or he won't but just stick to your guns. Stop being a push over. The kids will get along fine without him. Lots of kids never see their father and sometimes it;'s just as well.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	You let him be in control. If he lives that close and calls to see them, tell them if he's not there in 5 minutes, all bets are off. Don't sit around and wait. And, from now on when he calls and wants to see them, give him time to get there and a few minutes to be late, then leave. Make him show up late a few times and not find you home. He'll get the hint. Don't be rude about it either. When he says "I came by and you weren't home" just say "Yeah, we waited for a while, but couldn't sit there all day."|`|Y08YLysXaa	Don't speak to him when he calls, stop giving him these options! You aren't an idiot as a person, you are obviously caring. But you're being an 'idiot' for letting him control your life. If he wants to see the kids, give him a limited amount of time. If he's not there in however long it takes to drive there, too bad. Never call him back or make the effort for him! He sounds like a total retard and the less you see/hear of him, the better. Get on with your life and AVOID HIM. File for child support and sole custody if you can. Stop wasting your time! Why are you so open to him after everything he has done to you? He is marriage-hopping and completely oblivious to real life. You're at home taking care of your kids, why would you give a crap what he has to say or what he wants to do? I wouldn't even speak to him, seriously! I would change my number and refuse to have anything to do with him. Who wants to think about their skeezy ex husband? Uuuhrhrurhrhgh!|`|MVxFOI5naa	First of all you waited-when planning things with him nail him down for a time-if he is 20 minutes late-make other plans-second-he was probably using you to make his current wife jealous- third he should be paying support through the state collection agency -if they are going to St Bart's its probably her $$ paying for it, and lastly you can ignore his calls and answer his messages when its convenient for YOU and you can call the shots-be more assertive-you are certainly smart enough to do so!|`|RrmO1xkuaa	It is a very unfortunate situation and I send you my sympathies. Does your ex actually pay any child support? If not, you should take him to court - so he stops vacationing like a bachelor on a tropical island..seriously. If you and the kids aren't his top priority then let the court make that jackass responsible.   If he isn't keen on seeing the kids , that means he is just a selfish jerk who doesn't care one bit about his own children. It is very said but also a fact that you need to accept. I know your kids want a relationship but If he is such a bad father it's probably for the better that he doesn't have much contact as he wouldn't really give them love or be a good role model.|`|Txr5PvXgaa	No, you're not an idiot, but then you're not the devoted mom you'd like to be. Get yourself legal help to make him pay up. Explain the circumstances to the judge. Vacationing without supporting your kids is unacceptable. You are strong to want to do it all yourself and at the same time give him the flexibility to see the kids. The disappointment for them when he doesn't show up must be heartbreaking. That has to stop. Find a local women's center and go ask a lawyer what steps to take to ensure the best financial for both you and your kids. Good luck!|`|xMdKVKTyaa	No, this is a difficult time and difficult choices have to be made so you need to show him some way that you have control too. Maybe when he wants to take the kids but you wanted them and it wasn't his required day you can say no and show him that he can't manipulate you don't ignore him completely but don't let him in your life way too much
HuL6bKNMaa	:( they don't sound like friends to me; I've been in that situation before several times, the first and second times I got up and left those jerks. The third time was because my friend was upset and taking it out on me, I stopped talking to her and a few years later we were cool. The next time was a phase my friend grew out of and we ended up being good friends months later.     I would highly recommend you pull this kid aside and say you don't appreciate it and you just want to be on good terms and have fun with your friends. Then if it comes down to it, ignore him and continue talking with your other friends. If you really feel the need, you could dish some harsh dirt on him and show that it's never fun to be made fun of; either way I wish you luck.|`|m4geUBLTaa	DONT let them get to you. hold your head up high, dont let them talk trash to or about you, stand up for yourself and make new friends. this too shall pass. feel free to contact me for more advice.|`|DU92j3H0aa	IDK|`|zhC1xcvcaa	they are ***** and insecure and need you to make them feel better ditch them and find some better people to hang around
65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	I know this is very hard for you, but you have to leave for you and your sons well being.  Certainly you will take him with you...?  But don't wait until you have saved money because in the meantime he may hurt you beyond your ability to heal properly.    Get on the phone to a women's hot line and move fast because he sounds volatile and could freak out on you at any time.  They will set you up and help you get on your feet.  You and son will be safe and you'll have precious time to reorganize while he has a chance to come to terms with himself and make a few decisions of his own.|`|wpi36XBAaa	Even if you want your marriage to survive, for now you MUST take the kids and move out, or make him do so. This is essential for your and the children's self preservation. What he was doing was, in no doubt, very abusive towards you, and your children witness this behavior in their lives. Get a protection order if you need to. Let him know  without any doubt that it is that serious, and that you will NOT accept this in your life.  Tell him that you and the children cannot be with him unless or until he gets help to deal with his anger issues. He has to know this is HIS responsibility, and that he needs to make a real effort to change this, and to start to do that as of now. Do not accept that he has any excuses for this behavior (he will have enough of his own) that is the path to self destruction. He has to get professional help to start with, and have an on-going relationship with a support group.   If he loves you he will take that path. If he doesn't love you enough to make the change, then his "love" should not be enough to hold you in this abusive relationship.|`|AA12225439	you need to get out. if you stay with this man he will hurt you and on top your son dint need to be around all the hate..|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	He thinks he's right because he's an abusive A hole .  Why are you worried he's mad at you?     HE should be worried you're mad at him.  Call his bluff and really leave and get ready to see a begging stalker with violent tendencies after you.|`|fb2d92b771dcd4d8b2d1dc3da6af3e05aa	women drive men crazy, and not always in a good way.  Id say this guy has a real problem though, shouting is one thing, physical violence is another.  You should probably just leave him,  if he is under stress then he may start drinking and then he could really hurt you, even if he doesnt mean it and is sorry afterwards thats not going to make it feel any better when your teeth are all over the kitchen floor.  There are plenty of guys out there who wont hit women, find one.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	OK STOP.    HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT HE IS NOT "TREATING" YOU BADLY.... and MAYBE YOU ARE ?BEHAVING? BADLY????    Because that's what happens all the time.    You said - "we were arguing".    STOP ARGUING.    And try this. Find out - if its YOUR problem and not his.    Try being absolutely quiet and peaceful for a day or two. Don' provoke him.. just say yes.... OK.... agree.... smile.... be quiet... and well behaved.... just for a couple of days.    If he continues to shout at you or become impatient you can calmly point out to him "For the last two days I have agreed with you and done nothing to challenge you - yet you are shouting at me".    FIND OUT IF IT IS -- YOU WHO ARE THE PROBLEM.    Most women don't want to admit they are annoying as hell. But women instigate and cause MOST of the domestic violence in the United States.    The only reason it "LOOKS" like the men do....  is because the men don't let women get away with it.  So the men look "bad".    You said you were arguing.   Don't start arguments.|`|x2YuF1pxaa	Once a man crosses that boundary and hurts a woman (throwing you) there's no going back. Leave. It will only get worse.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Until he realizes he is wrong, and there is no excuse for his behavior, he'll continue to do it. Do you want him to totally lose it and hurt or kill you, then your son will have to live with him forever? You need to ask him ONCE to go to counseling and tell them what he's done. If he refuses or makes any excuse, then get out before it's too late.|`|ce0f1a141ac23b2ab9ca11d5b5f3ddbdaa	I would not take physical abuse from him. If he has hurt you once, he will do it again. Men like this hardly ever change....it will only get worse.|`|jTsQkuhHaa	if you dont want to leave for your self, leave for your son.  you have obviously seen how it affects him.  do you want your husband to go after him next?!|`|ayBzdRK7aa	you need to leave IMMEDIATLY!! One day he'll snap and maybe it won't be at you..it'll be at your son. I don't care why he did it. Stress might cause you to yell at someone or say something you dont mean it doesn't completely transform you into an abusive person.  That's not okay.|`|Y08YLysXaa	Mine has thrown me when I have shouted at him or annoyed him a lot. Stupid things happen in fights.. but if you are honestly innocent, don't do him wrong and he just randomly freaks out and gets abusive, you should leave him.|`|dTaGzh6Haa	If my husband did this to me I'd leave immediately. It sounds like you still have some amount of self respect and that's good. But if you find yourself starting to cave just think of  your little boy. Think how scared he is. I wonder how long it might take before your husband starts throwing your son around.  You really don't want to find out the answer to that one now do you?  Your husband is abusing you and your son. You do realize this don't you? These situations very very rarely improve.  Please listen to the advice your family and the other folks on this forum are giving you.   I hear you making the excuse for your husband, saying he is stressed. Throwing ones wife around and terrorizing ones child is not the way to handle stress. Tolerate this and you'll be sorry.  This has ceased to be about love...not for you and certainly not for your husband. I don't care what he says or does to make it up to you, this is not a workable situation.  And by the way, he has a long, long way to go toward being a good dad...or husband.|`|bYoKSMNKaa	Run and run fast. U are directly quoting from the abused wife handbook. I already know u will go back cos u started this off with a disclaimer that he is a great provider and good dad. If u were really considering leaving or really concerned u wouldnt still think this about him. U go on to say that he is stressed. Im damn stressed and i dont pick anyone up and hurl them across the room! Its not ur fault, he is responsible for his own actions and should be a better role model for ur son, so now u need to be the role model and remove ur son and urself from this. Stay apart from him until he has been to counselling and then start to visit him and see how he goes. I would be leaving but try if u must return but please be super careful.|`|6aVtiTKiaa	Yes, start saving your money and leave.  Plan it well, make sure you don't end up having to come back, then you'll really be in trouble.  And in the meantime if he gets angry again do whatever you can to diffuse the situation.  Guys like that rarely stop once they start, and often it only gets worse.|`|oehnSntraa	Listen to your mum. Its time to go.|`|3CL2RTmFaa	Sweetie, first and foremost, that is just simply NOT acceptable. I think you should take your mom's advise, pack you and your son and get the hell out of there before it gets worse.|`|wk1RDK3raa	You hjave to know this isn't right and that you should not be with a man like this, let alone subject your child to seeing you be abused and treated like a doormat. Why are you concerned about whether or not his family told him this in unacceptable? You have to deal with it, not them. How old are you? Don't wait to save up money, you could die before that happens and that's only an excuse. There are plenty of battered women programs in america that can help you escape and get on your feet... And it appears you have family to turn to. STOP PLAYING VICTIM
uzmcXWSVaa	umm.  i'd try hinting around about it like "What would you do if one of your guy friends said he liked you as more then a friend?" and see how he acts then try to go from there.    GOOD LUCK!=]|`|wy7GYq8faa	is he gay ?|`|o1eNW0mIaa	Don't . Right when you met him you should have said , Hey I'm gay and like you , wanna be my friend . But no you lied . If he was gay he would have came on to you|`|cLkA2nihaa	Trust me, do NOT tell straights you like them, bad reactions, and you'll have a bad reputation, plus they'll get freaked out and avoid you forever. I haven't experienced this, but some of my gay friends I know got EXTREMELY disappointed when telling someone who isn't gay they like them. So unless he's also gay, just keep your mouth shut until you get over it.    But I'm just saying if he isn't gay, if he is go for it, what's there to lose ?|`|cov3zaiEaa	woww.. super interesting your question.. it could be superrrr harddd!!!    well.. i think you should talk about gays to your friend and ask him hat does he think... the you would know if tell him or not,.,,|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	act itout make it oveeyus

Let us know what you think.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I hope it will help your marriage.  Hubby and I have a very strong marriage and we went to see it.  We both had bad 1st marriages and some of the movie got to us because of the past marraige.    Will pray for you and your husband.|`|eXj6Ro5Raa	Not sure bc I haven't seen the movie. I heard it was good. If your husband goes into looking for inspiration perhaps but you know men they get bored when there's love and feelings involved. They like things being blown up, blood and weapons. Good luck|`|EENUWAP7aa	Fire Proof is not for evey marriage where one fails to attend to the other, but it kind of shows what can happen when one pursues and learns that there are more important things in life than a boat.|`|vSJIorF7aa	A movie is not going to make things better in a marriage. Time, working together and seeking counseling or a support group will help. You have reached the first step, realizing there is a problem, but don't depend on a movie!|`|AqvEHHsTaa	I have heard nothing but wonderful things about the movie.

Good luck and God Bless.|`|ce0f1a141ac23b2ab9ca11d5b5f3ddbdaa	I have saw the movie and it is wonderful! I have heard people say that it has helped their marraige, but you will still both have to work on it. It can't be a one way street. Good luck and enjoy the movie!!|`|fIxCRpVFaa	yea it will a lot i went and watched it at a church be4 it even came 2 movie theaters. if u get the love dare book after u c it, it mite change u, try it!    god bless    hope things go really well after this movie,    it inspired me and im a teenager!
4JGTC2MHaa	I went trough the exact same thing in high school. My ticket out of those toxic relationships were the new friends I had made. I knew the new friends weren't as immature as the old ones, so I could count on them (and I still can today).   What you should do is gradually spend less and less time with the "friends" who are making you feel bad about yourself and invest more time in positive relationships. The old friends will eventually get the hint. Even if they turn it into a big drama, they will realize that you've moved on and that you will no longer be their target. Once they see that they've lost their power over you, they will move on to a new target.|`|cLkA2nihaa	Ugh, be the door, not the doormat, you don't need confidence, just walk up to them, and tell them how you feel; You are NOT a doormat, and you do NOT take insults as if they are nothing, and you deserve BETTER than them, so just forget them all and stick to your new friends.    If you just CAN'T talk to them, just slowly start avoiding them, start hanging out with your other friends more little by little, then they'll think of it as less a big deal, rather than you just stop being their friends, they'll think you just ditched them or something, and you're going to have to talk no matter what.    I hope I helped . ;]|`|tBDVQlbjaa	well this happened to me  but my friend was rude and stopped giving me rides to school and ignored me like i didn't exist even though i sat next her to her in class  it was hell but i feel so relieved she did that  but i'm saying DO NOT do that to your friends  you will see like a complete *****  i think you should just start to break away if they say something that hurts your feelings say yeah that's not cool and walk away  if they ask you to hang out say no thanks i'm busy  if they are making fun of other people around say that's really not cool i don't like how you diss everyone all the time  eventually they will understand you've changed and you want to break away  i'm sure they wont' mind  they might ***** about you after and call you names and tell people things about you but show them it bothers you  that's currently what i'm doing now and it's driving my ex best friends mad  it's hilarious  i hope i helped a little bit  good luck!

11441890e5d4be569aa2cdd7b52211d7aa	Why did you break up in the first place? Maybe you and your ex did have something special, but don't forget that something caused you guys to break up. It would be difficult to pick up the pieces and start where you left off with your ex, and people just change. I'd stick with your current boyfriend and stick it out, it sounds like things are fine right now between you two.|`|HJEXk7Pmaa	dnt break up with him    leave the past and move on forward|`|mXMxsC6oaa	hmm wat i wud do was maybe stay where you are. remember what made you and your ex break up, realise that if he has done it before he can still do it again. so i wud say forget your ex coz just yea you can get what you had with him somewhere better.   now to your present boyfriend... do u smile when you get his texts? maybe it was just a summer fling but maybe you should just talk to him straight up about it. be like i have been talking to my ex a bit and he asked to meet up and i kinda want to is that okay with you? and yea just talk it out with him. what ever your answer is it will come to you. good luck.|`|PNLwOIOraa	Don't break up with him you will regret it most likely!|`|28o6Y7Ktaa	girl, don't let the ex get in your head. it's likely that he sees you with a new guy and it bothers him and he realizes what he's lost. you've moved on and you got yourself a new guy who you care about. obviously things didn't work out with you and your ex. so don't 2nd guess your feelings for a guy who is all of a sudden wanting back in. unless you have thought about it and realize you love your ex still, then just tell him to leave you alone. good luck!|`|UxbjvAaRaa	tell the ex that you have to have time to think before you make any serious desions, and you don't wanna pick one or the other. and to the summer camp guy, tell him that you need to think about some things, and you guys should take a break. but its def. not you. i just need times. We can still be more than friends."  all in all listen to your heart is the only thing that really tells you what is going on inside. make sure you do what you think is right.|`|AA11599430	DO NOT feel you have to drop the current boyfriend to go back to the ex to make you happy if your happy with the current one stay with him|`|fKuvMPCiaa	Why not spend some time being single until you find out what kind of guy you really want.

No sense on dragging this out any longer.|`|62UqLwbTaa	id say u shouldnt talk to ur current boyfriend for like a week or two and tell him why ur doing this so u can get ur thoughts straight and if u see that u miss him then u still like him but if u start to like ur ex more then i think its time to break up with ur current bf|`|mbprjCSiaa	just follow your heart, i know that is overused but you need to go with your gut feeling.    f.y.i. getting back together with an ex is bad news beacuse theres a reason your not together anymore unless it was a misunderstanding and most likley you will regret it.     hey, maybe even be single for a while|`|PPn9nqpxaa	ok, think about this... compare the relationship you had with your ex, both the good AND the bad, and see how it compares to the one you are in right now... make your decision off that, thinking of the pros and cons of both relationships... also, remember that your ex may not still want you... he may just be being friendly... if you realize this after you break up, you will end up alone with neither option... only you can make this decision, but good luck!|`|f6o0ufjxaa	talk to him tell him that ur a big girl and u can do some things for ur self and that once and a while i cool but every day isn't really working out for u|`|OWko9fZDaa	do what your heart tells you|`|Zf3mUGvYaa	I dont no|`|zlwbbr7saa	wait, it is the best thing to do.  ex may just want you back as a trophy or something.  the other guy clearly loves you|`|XdwUpp58aa	Well I am in a similarr situation and never let your past hinder your future.

You might act like their friends. If you think your ex is wanting you back, he is NOT. he just wants you to fail on the fututure BFs, so don't. Don't fall forex's charm, if u do, you will eventually breakup with BF and then your ex will leave you.|`|s0kTfSBBaa	think of the reason u broke up with him and enjoy the cute things yous boyfriend does for u, he could be a jerk and do nothing. all i can say is don't fake a reltionship it will backfire later on|`|Ak6SIDAaaa	how fast did you get into this new relationship? If it was pretty soon after your last then you probably didn't have long enough to heal from the last one. You need to remember why your last one ended. We tend to forget all the negative things about our old relationships and our exs after long periods of time.. and we just remember the good things.. which isn't a good thing... b/c most of the time if you get back together the same unresolved issues you both had before, come up and it ends even quicker then the last time. I'm not saying that will happen to you, but you really need to look at this from different perspectives. Try and take your self out of the situation by pretending a friend was asking you the same question, what would you tell the friend? hope this helps|`|rzHRFEvjaa	u need to explain urself to him. communication is key to a good relationship. wats the point of it if u cant tell him the truth anyway?|`|1W82FNH6aa	There was obviously a reason you broke up with the ex and otherwise u would still be together so probably wise not to go down that path again.  As for being reminded of "what you used to have", how about what you have now? You admitted that he is the sweetest and most caring person and so if he treats you well and you still have some sort of feeling for him then wouldn't it be best to be open and communicate with him? Talk to him about how you feel, what your thinking and how he feels and maybe you can work through this and come out good on the other end, if not its not the end of the world as they say!!    One more thing - i suggest this as i have only been married for 4 years but sometimes during our difficult times i try to look back at the reason i fell in love with my husband in the beginning to remind me again of why i love him so much (and i do love him dearly) and then i try talk to him about my issues, usually we work through it and things are good.  Hope this helps|`|CmDR4MOeaa	Well it seems like you have no idea of what you really want    First of all you said "i practically fell in love with him at ", don't use the word Love in such situations because obviously you do not  love him, you have feelings for him yes    About the ex boyfriend, you said it yourself "NO i dont like the ex, but i did love him" You dont like him, and you used to love him but if i was wrong and you still love him then this is another situation    About the guilty part, i think you should tell him then ask for a break, do not break up with him just a little break for him and you    Good Luck

Or he was a weirdo.|`|OFGV2Jj2aa	Im sorry to say it buddy, but the sign your born under doesnt mean a dang thing.    just something the scientists or watever made it up did because they were bored and wanted to hear some talk about dumb stuff.|`|SsvwdhsPaa	no one cares...about that stuff...  people arent defined by their sign. they have their own personality and it has nothing to do with what someone decided they should act like because they were born in a specific month.
m4geUBLTaa	im an expelled student, yes he can still graduate. ive been expelled for the remainder of my junior year. what happens is your friend will be "homebound" if he is expelled where a teacher comes to his home and drops off work he works on it then when the teacher comes back in a few days he gives it to her, if he doesnt get expelled then congrats to him and he'll graduate. he'll get to graduate either way
6aVtiTKiaa	Maybe you feel that she's getting something from that guy that she's not getting from you anymore.  There's more to marriage than just sex.  You may or may not be part of the problem.  Talk to her and see if she tells you what the problem is.  Maybe you could try taking her out, and being more attentive.|`|jTsQkuhHaa	I am not sure why she is so close to this other man but in all honesty - she needs to respect your feelings and back off! Or invite you along or to be part of the friendship...|`|3iNobwVraa	Here is the only thing I remember from what you wrote:  "I love her and do not will not live without her."    What is that?  A threat?  That sentence freaks me out and I don't like it.|`|wZVUL5nRaa	My friend I hate to break this to you she is cheating !!!    The question do you want to share your wife or move on? I moved on,no wife sharing in any form.|`|rm1oLtNtaa	Did your wife have this friend before you were married?   I would not  worry about this, talk with her and tell her how you feel.  Don't make the mistake and tell her not to see him or talk with him, that will drive a wall up.    I too am married and have a male friend that I talk with and see .. Not really "go out" .. but I help my friend with things (chores) .  My husband has a jealous streak and does make comments about my " bf " and is that your " bf " calling etc.....  I have not crossed the line , both my friend and i are married..    There has to be a trust bond between you and your wife....|`|HunSyQaSaa	Do you think she may be controlling you with her behavior.Could the both of you go for counseling?  It might be  helpful for someone to help you both sort this out. Life is too short to use up your energy on what ifs.Good luck.  Learn to love yourself and positive things will follow.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	You don't need to fix yourself.  You wife needs to fix herself!  You are rightfully upset because she is sharing things with this guy that she should be sharing with you.  She probably isn't cheating with him and it's perfectly fine to have male friends, but I think she has crossed the line by hanging out too often and going out all the time.  Too much is too much.    Stand your ground with her, and tell her how it makes you feel.  She should be considering your feelings as well.|`|MVxFOI5naa	I honestly think she spends too much time with him and if the shoe was on the other foot she would have a fit-try finding a gal pal and see what happens.|`|6QIpltVyaa	sorry to say this, but she doesn't respect you as a husband or your feelings...their is nothing wrong with you, she needs to back off from this guy and pay more attention to her family. She should also introduce the guy to you so maybe you can know him a bit better..I mean how would she like it if it was vice versa and when she;s around you you start to talk to a female friend of yours constantly?|`|onbwN4csaa	You thought of WHAT IF. has not happened.   Trust her.  Only think or do something about it .  When you know for sure.    Your living a what If.life.  Live in the what is world.
iCUstJdNaa	I think it seems you are definately getting more closer.  It sounds that you are pushing something more here.  You definately can start out as friends and end up as lovers it does happen.  Is this what you want if so ask him how he feels.  If you both feel the same go for it.  But if you dont want this back off.|`|wTYPomqQaa	I think you're pusing at something more here...|`|uI4WPwhsaa	girl...i think you're defs pushing at something more..    when a guy plays with your hair...it's a direct sign that he likes you..more than a friend...he wants get closer to you.    and if these kinds of things just began for you, then you are becoming closer...and your relationship has the potential to become something more.
UpGGXFvIaa	I don't know what it is about this situation, but is sounds so familiar. I know I have personally been there before, of course it was a good friend who had a girlfriend and lived in the dorms and his roomie heard us going at it all night on the bottom bunk.   Anyways, back to your situation. You have been friends for what, 3 1/2 years (just a guess) and if you have maintained a friendship for this long don't let it slip away. If you need to talk about it with her, then talk about it. You just need to make sure she knows there are boundaries and that in the end you are friends, nothing more and nothing less. Let her know you want her to be in your life, and don't be afraid to ask her where she thinks the two of you stand and where you may be heading. If she says dating, you need to tell her you aren't ready for that step with her and she needs reason(s). She is still in school and you are at home. You just got out of a 3 year relationship and aren't ready to move on. If she still wants to hook up and keep it as a very good friends with benefits, then you know you have a warm body to sleep next to every night you come back to visit. Just make sure that before you sleep next to that warm body you make some time for your old roommate from 2 years ago who loves you dearly.     Hope this helps.|`|DU92j3H0aa	think about the situation only you you know what to do|`|Lt2lktgFaa	finger her ;DD|`|2uLiyi0Paa	If you guys are good friends, just tell her what's on your mind.   It's all up to you, if you feel weird then it might make the atmosphere very strange... so just be yourself and talk to her...      I've done it before... and now its all fun memories.       good luck~~ :)|`|Lp9PLSbuaa	You can't.I've been there done that. Just laugh it off.
