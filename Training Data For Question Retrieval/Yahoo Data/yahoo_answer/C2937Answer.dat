FY5fccoZaa	I meet a guy that said he was fighting in Antarctica in World War I (that was about 95 years ago) and it was really cold, but now he is living in Texas and it's very warm, he says it has never been so warm in his life. I think he knows better because he is older than the guy you meet.|`|B8j7pA6baa	Yes I do, but I think it is a bit exaggerate in the Media.|`|6Gfz125Paa	It's GLOBAL warming.  It has nothing to do with the weather in any specific location.|`|SJbktLITaa	Yep isnt is sad....We might soon be experiencing polar shifts|`|GB4zo5r4aa	well the population in the north pole is very small so there's no pollution to make it wormer. but i dont think you'll get the answer from opinions|`|gERaZGZeaa	Hey, those record droughts aren't happening for no reason.    We may not feel the effects here in North America, but sh*t rolls downhill... which means they sure as hell are feeling the effects of our pollution in Africa.    Also, to the guy who said Alaska is cold right now.. well no Sh*t, it's WINTER in ALASKA.  There's a reason why it's called GLOBAL warming - it doesn't mean that ONLY North America is getting F'd, cause we're not - it's the people who have absolutely no control, like African villages, and the Ocean life, which is being destroyed by global warming.|`|4d39e7dd6b413fbd46444cffe2149c0baa	I believe there is global warming caused by air pollution is contributing to abnormal weather patterns that poses a risk on everyone.

I guess the MARTIANS need a CARBON TAX too.|`|k4DxnbMCaa	Well, there is a larger amount of extreme fluctuations in weather lately. The most urgent and apparent problem of global warming is that the polar ice caps are melting at an extremely quick rate. Glaciers are also melting really quickly. I went to western Canada over the summer and went atop a glacier. There were markers in the ground, which showed how much the glacier had receded each year. They really showed me how quickly the glacier is disappearing. There are many hints of global warming; you just need to look for them.|`|AA11264399	From the IPCC report of 2007:    Eleven of the last twelve years (19952006) rank among the 12 warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperature (since 1850).    New analyses of balloon-borne and satellite measurements of lower- and mid-tropospheric temperature show warming rates that are similar to those of the surface temperature record.    The average atmospheric water vapour content has increased since at least the 1980s over land and ocean as well as in the upper troposphere. The increase is broadly consistent with the extra water vapour that warmer air can hold.    Observations since 1961 show that the average temperature of the global ocean has increased to depths of at least 3000m and that the ocean has been absorbing more than 80% of the heat added to the climate system.  Such warming causes seawater to expand, contributing to sea level rise.    Mountain glaciers and snow cover have declined on average in both hemispheres. Widespread decreases in glaciers and ice caps have contributed to sea level rise.    Losses from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have very likely contributed to sea level rise over 1993 to 2003.  Flow speed has increased for some Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers, which drain ice from the interior of the ice sheets.    Global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8mm per year over 1961 to 2003. The rate was faster over 1993 to 2003: about 3.1mm per year.    At continental, regional and ocean basin scales, numerous long-term changes in climate have been observed. These include changes in arctic temperatures and ice, widespread changes in precipitation amounts, ocean salinity, wind patterns and aspects of extreme weather including droughts, heavy precipitation, heat waves and the intensity of tropical cyclones.    Average arctic temperatures increased at almost twice the global average rate in the past 100 years.    Satellite data since 1978 show that annual average arctic sea ice extent has shrunk by 2.7% per decade, with larger decreases in summer of 7.4% per decade.    Temperatures at the top of the permafrost layer have generally increased since the 1980s in the Arctic (by up to 3C).    Long-term trends from 1900 to 2005 have been observed in precipitation amount over many large regions.  Significantly increased precipitation has been observed in eastern parts of North and South America, northern Europe and northern and central Asia. Drying has been observed in the Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia.    Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by freshening of mid- and high latitude waters together with increased salinity in low latitude waters.    Mid-latitude westerly winds have strengthened in both hemispheres since the 1960s.    More intense and longer droughts have been observed over wider areas since the 1970s, particularly in the tropics and subtropics.    The frequency of heavy precipitation events has increased over most land areas, consistent with warming and observed increases of atmospheric water vapour.    Widespread changes in extreme temperatures have been observed over the last 50 years. Cold days, cold nights and frost have become less frequent, while hot days, hot nights and heat waves have become more frequent.    There is observational evidence for an increase in intense tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970, correlated with increases of tropical sea surface temperatures.    So there is plenty of evidence of climate change of various sorts, and warming in general.    Carbon dioxide is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. The global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm3 in 2005. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years (180 to 300 ppm) as determined from ice cores.    Increased carbon dioxide means increased retention of heat from solar radiation - this is simple physics.    Also the pH of the oceans is changing, very likely as a result of all the additional man-made CO2 it's absorbing, and this is causing severe damage to marine ecosystems.    Phenological records for the past 30 years in Europe indicate that spring events such as leaf unfolding have advanced by about six days, whilst autumn leaf colouring is delayed by nearly five days (Menzel et al., 1999). Conditions in Britain are changing even more rapidly, with spring arriving six days earlier each decade, and autumn being delayed by two days each decade, an extension of the growing season of 24 days since records began 30 years ago. The thermal growing season extended on average by 0.7 days per year between 1920 and 1960 and by 1.7 days per year between 1980 and 2000 - http://www.rhs.org.uk/news/climate_chang...

The hole is around the antarctic area- si that is why it is only (mainly) happening there. Global surface temperature increased 0.74  0.18 C (1.33  0.32 F) during the 100 years ending in 2005. So there isn't really any debate.|`|EKFyplGjaa	Climate change is happening-their is no doubt in my mind.  But to say we as a species are changing the nature of a PLANET is absurd. Yes, we are having a negative impact on the Earth in how we abuse our nonrenewable resources. However Climate Change is something that has been occuring for million-possibly billions of years. We are simply going through the cycle once again.|`|d72zw1nQaa	I don't believe in global warming - we only generate 1% of the pollution the rest is natural this is a time period when the earth goes through something we haven't discovered yet.|`|wsQ6G8OEaa	According to Al Gore I should be swimming at the pool in 70 degree weather but you know 30 and 70 arent that far apart.|`|qTnEI5dwaa	From a strictly science point of view, global warming is happening. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is getting caught in the atmosphere, the light from the sun comes and hits the earth in the form of infrared radiation (heat). This bounces back up into the atmosphere but is trapped by the carbon dioxide that is there from burning fossil fuels (coal, gas...). Therefore, the earth is slowly getting warmer as the CO2 in the atmosphere increases. This site has a pretty good chart http://www.planetperformance.org/global-...|`|ymmLi41Oaa	Yes I do believe it.  Have you bothered to do any REAL research?  Check out the glaciers melting sometime.  Your friends story really makes no sense.|`|4VnztrA2aa	I am a firm believer in global warming. You want to know why? Because: If you've seen the movie "The Day After Tomorrow, then you might know that it's based on the book "The Coming Global Superstorm" which contains actual facts, plus proof/evidence that the climate's going wild again. In the movie, there was a museum that had mammoths, with food still in their mouths and stomachs that were perfectly preserved because they were frozen instantly. In truth, there IS a museum in Russia where you can see these "grazing" mammoths. In order to preserve the food that was found, their stomach acid would have to freeze to stop the digestion process. Yet, the plant matter, after being analyzed, were determined to be flowers, which meant that the climate was VERY WARM in Siberia, where they were found. Some were found in Canada, too. And don't say, "maybe they migrated too far north," because the question is, why did scientists find plant matter that didn't fit the climate of the area where they died? What could have caused that? Hmm? A global superstorm that led to the last Ice Age, perhaps? And consider this: A large part of an ice shelf the size of Connecticut broke off the coast of Antarctica. (In the movie, the the broken glacier was only the size of Rhode Island). Plus, in 1998, spring temperatures in Moscow, Russia had reached a record of 32.1 degrees Celsius (89.7 degrees Farenheit). And Moscow is at nearly the same latitude as Juneau, Alaska!! Imagine Alaska having temperatures of almost 90 degrees! Sounds crazy, doesn't it? This could lead to another superstorm that, if it ignites in summer, massive flooding could result. If it happened in the winter, it could bring the dawn of a new ice age. There is proof that this has happened in the past, and the last one is believed to be caused by global warming due to methane, another greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide has the same effect today. It WILL happen again, for it is a cycle that has gone on for hundreds of millions of years, but we are speeding up the process by cutting down trees and then burning fossil fuels and release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which could have even more drastic effects. There is some evidence that there was a great global civilization that existed before ours. The fact that the Sphinx was built thousands of years before even the pyramids were proves it. And how do you explain Stonehenge? These structures were built long before the wheel was invented, much less modern technology that we have today. Could that civilization have been destroyed by the superstorm? Who knows? In any case, the things that happened in "The Day After Tomorrow" have either actually happened in recent years, or they're happening now. We've got to combat global warming, if at all possible. We must make efforts to find alternative sources of fuel and renewable energy. For more information on how you can help, read "The Coming Global Superstorm" and then watch the movie "The Day After Tomorrow," if you haven't seen it.

AsKWImpQaa	La Nina usually brings drier weather, and El Nino wetter weather to California and the southwest. We are currently in a La Nina. Forecasts are for the La Nina to continue at least into the spring of 2009, and possibly longer. I haven't seen any forecasts past that.    In the short term (over the next week) there are a series of storms that should move over California.    EDIT: Bravozulu, could you please provide a reference for your statement that El Ninos "...cause much greenhouse warming from the the increase in water vapor" ? I'm pretty sure that statement must rely on some pretty sophisticated climate modelling, since the distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere is critical for determining how much greenhouse warming comes from a specified amount of water vapor, and I would like to know which models you or the references you are quoting are using.     Your first statement is amusing, though, that no one knows the future. While technically true it's so vague as to not mean much.  For example, I will "predict the future" and say that the sun will rise tomorrow.  If you don't think I can predict that, I will give you very good odds (say 100,000 to 1) if you want to choose the side that doesn't believe I can predict that.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	No one knows the future.

It's forecast to return this year or next:    "Summary: the Southern Oscillation and increasing GHGs continue to be, respectively, the dominant factors affecting interannual and decadal temperature change. Solar irradiance has a non-negligible effect on global temperature [see, e.g., Reference 7, which empirically estimates a somewhat larger solar cycle effect than that estimated by others who have teased a solar effect out of data with different methods]. Given our expectation of the next El Nino beginning in 2009 or 2010, it still seems likely that a new global temperature record will be set within the next 1-2 years, despite the moderate negative effect of the reduced solar irradiance."  http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2...    Unfortunately the arrival of the short-term and reversible El Nino weather pattern will not change these predicted scenarios:    Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate and the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, noted that even the most optimistic climate models for the second half of this century suggest that 30 to 70 percent of the snowpack will disappear.

Look up their past reactions to environmental concerns. Greenpeace is much more "in your face" than WWF, which is more passive.
boZVHPfgaa	Hi Sid!    I guess you're doing a school project? Sorry to see that you're mostly just hearing from the conspiracy theory "global warming is a scam" crowd. We certainly live in a paranoid age. I'm guessing you won't get a good grade for regurgitating their nonsense, so here's an answer pulled straight out of wikipedia. I've included the link to the page at the end. Good luck!     Deforestation is ongoing and is shaping climate and geography.    Deforestation is a contributor to global warming, and is often cited as one of the major causes of the enhanced greenhouse effect. Tropical deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change deforestation, mainly in tropical areas, account for up to one-third of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Trees and other plants remove carbon (in the form of carbon dioxide) from the atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis and release it back into the atmosphere during normal respiration. Only when actively growing can a tree or forest remove carbon over an annual or longer timeframe. Both the decay and burning of wood releases much of this stored carbon back to the atmosphere. In order for forests to take up carbon, the wood must be harvested and turned into long-lived products and trees must be re-planted. Deforestation may cause carbon stores held in soil to be released. Forests are stores of carbon and can be either sinks or sources depending upon environmental circumstances. Mature forests alternate between being net sinks and net sources of carbon dioxide (see carbon dioxide sink and carbon cycle).    Reducing emissions from the tropical deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) in developing countries has emerged as new potential to complement ongoing climate policies. The idea consists in providing financial compensations for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from deforestation and forest degradation".    The worlds rain forests are widely believed by laymen to contribute a significant amount of world's oxygen although it is now accepted by scientists that rainforests contribute little net oxygen to the atmosphere and deforestation will have no effect whatsoever on atmospheric oxygen levels. However, the incineration and burning of forest plants in order to clear land releases tonnes of CO2 which contributes to global warming.    Forests are also able to extract carbon dioxide and pollutants from the air, thus contributing to biosphere stability.|`|fcc738a2832b685c939f31eb779b66a2aa	Deforestation is good for preventing or reducing global warming because in the north it makes the snow reflect more solar radiation back into space instead of being absorbed by trees and everywhere it clears out slowly growing plants to make room for fast growing plants which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  To seriously reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere it would be good to replace the rain forests (which recycle CO2 very efficiently) with plantations for growing switch grass which we could then haul out into the ocean and sink to the bottom or perhaps bury.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Because trees (and plants in general) absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.  Less carbon dioxide = less global warming.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	The carbon that was the forest is generally burned and makes CO2.  Much of the biomass is lost.  Water vapor is also greatly reduced.  I don't know about warming because the loss of water probably counteracts the increase in CO2.|`|zNB3tZXraa	Nothing. Every living thing, whether animal or plant, contains carbon. If you cut down a tree, disturb a dead tree in the woods, or simply turn over a field full of dead corn for the next planting, you are releasing co2. Every breathing human being does the same thing. None of this has any proven effect on global warming.|`|T7zdRWHgaa	Photosynthesis. Plants (trees included) takes in carbon and converts it to glucose. This glucose is stored in the plant as sugar and such, acting as food. That's why plants grow. If you destroy forests (deforestation) you eliminate the carbon absorbing process. At the same time, depending on what you do with the tree, the carbon stored in the tree will either get released back into the atmosphere or get released into the soil.|`|n6xqkPhXaa	Nothing at all.  Forestry regulations are strict and the old clear cutting method is no longer used and there is no deforestation any more.  In Canada for example, where most of North America's lumber comes from, for every tree cut an average of four saplings are planted.      Calling modern forestry 'destruction' is wrong.  It's anything but destructive.  In fact it's highly productive and extremely replenishing.  The exception to this is the Amazon forest, but the Brazilians have begun to clean up their act and enforce the rules.  Many ranchers and farmers who cleared land in the Amazon have been forced to reforest their land and move elsewhere.|`|SIWh4UCyaa	Old growth forest is always going to hold more co2 than plantation old growth is (depending on the trees) 200 to 500 years old i.e. the oldest trees are that old, the forest itself is usually much older, there is slow release from rotting trees. trees of this age hold tons of carbon  Plantations are grown for 15-20 years then cut down left over bits are burnt, lots of equipment is used to cut down and transport and process the timber co2 is released at each stage.  As not all old growth forests are turned into plantations but into farmland or towns or highways co2 absorption is further reduced.    On Davem point yes "Forestry regulations are strict" but they are also recent for most of the last 100 years there has been little regulation. The four saplings combined weight never get to half the weight of the original single tree that was cut down.  I know from the renovations I'm doing to my own 70 year old house the original wall timbers are much heavier and denser than wood I can buy now which is called hard wood.|`|zThIaO0Qaa	because plants and trees absorb carbon dioxide. People and other fuels we burn among other chemicals we use give off carbon dioxide. We had a balancing effect before but the less trees and plants we have to take in the CO2 the more we have going into the atmosphere. Hence, making our atmosphere thicker and trapping more heat from the sunlight
SYZQZGesaa	In general, all plant life absorbs CO2 from the air. The benefit is that carbon and carbon dioxide are removed and replaced with clean air. When fires occur, these materials are released back into the atmosphere and therefore bad. At the same time, their growth depletes the soil of nutrients. When they burn they replenish some of these nutrients and therefore it is good. The ideal situation is a balance or just enough new growth and just enough "death".
pnCOR1UVaa	It would be impossible to say. Green is such a generic term. Many people do things in an ecofriendly way without realizing it. Others have jumped on the bandwagon and are buying "green" products but are not helping the environment at all. You may have more luck looking for poll results for a question, like "Do you try to help the environment?" or "Are you trying to reduce your carbon footprint?"|`|SYZQZGesaa	Your question is not as simple as you may think. You can get figures for green cars for example but they are skewed. An electric car is considered green because it does not use gas - however - if all Americans drove electric cars, we would have to build 27000 new coal plants to power them. There are solar and wind powered homes and businesses, fuel cells and other concepts as well. If the report were true to form and wanted to report how many Americans are truly green, the answer would be less than 0.1%. If you want to use some numbers for where we are currently, read these articles.  http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/5475...  http://www.technewsworld.com/story/54852...|`|SP8wNcp8aa	exactly 7. don't let anyone else tell you otherwise cause their probably Nazi's|`|eJMOGeRraa	Try googling "Energy Saving Americans" or "Energy Concious Americans" for your answer.|`|AA12186217	"Gone green"? How exactly would you define that? If you define it, maybe we can help.

There is a possibility that the global warming is part of a much bigger picture than we have previously imagined -- we know that the poles have tipped or shifted before in history because of quick frozen mammoths found in our lifetime with fresh greens in their mouths. However I do believe that we humans are greatly contributing to the speeding up of whatever would be happening naturally. <br>  It is quite obvious from aerial photos, that great changes are happening to our glaciers and Arctic Circle. Check out the National Geographic sites on the web. If U would like a specific example here is one:  Where we live is being invaded by certain insects (the deer tick is one) that have never been here before in the history of the USA as far back as anyone can remember. Dog ticks have been here a long time, but NOT deer ticks. The winter is supposed to kill them off each season in a natural cycle of things. But guess what? The cycle has been broken. The deer ticks have appeared all winter long on our pets (dogs & cats) We have watched this very closely and groom the animals in question on a daily/weekly basis, so I know what I am seeing. <br>  U need to check more info out on the Internet and check with people who would know like vets and doctors. They will tell U trends have changed in subtle ways that are real. Global warming is real. All U have to do is open your eyes and mind.
VJNLkJT0aa	What a great idea for a high school club! The list of things you could do is endless, so  don't get too carried away or discouraged. Set some reasonable goals and a mission statement. The club can do awareness projects in the area with posters and recycling bins established for the schools, senior centers and other community spots that may not already have them. Follow a 'green' tip-of-the-month and promote awareness/work on that. Talk with your local government and other groups to find out what projects there may already be in place that could use your club support. Help or promote a hazardous material collection site/day to aid people in disposal of paint, batteries etc. Do a fund raiser to buy energy efficient bulbs or appliances for your local town hall or nursing home or such. OF COURSE you will be making a difference! Every bit adds up and ignoring the issue won't make it go away.  Follow school guidelines for starting a club, then put the word out in a fun positive way. Be patient as many will take a wait-n-see attitude, but once they see you making progress they will be lining up to help you!|`|irsxgCZyaa	Set up a school recycling program, pick up litter, hold a teach-in on Earth Day, lobby the school to buy from local food sources, wear organic cotton shirts, take educational field trips to learn more about sustainability, send letters to politicians, put out a school newsletter about environmental topics.<br>  <br>  And yes, it can make a difference. It's important to educate those around you about how to live sustainabile lifestyles!|`|5gmKjbAcaa	great idea!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  1. switch cafeteria trays ( if they are disposable) to biodegradable ones and to use BioBag trash bags<br>  2. create more awareness about recycling in your school (assemblies etc.)<br>  3. Encourage the school to switch to local foods when possible <br>  4. Compost!<br>  5. donate food to a shelter<br>  6. have a once-a-month green day around the school!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helped=)

They have pretty good range as hybrids and can be refueled quickly from a high power air compressor.<br>  <br>  See the link below for details.|`|uFQFRdczaa	Using an air tank instead of a battery would be a lot cheaper, it'll have the same range as most electrics and can be refueled just as fast as a gasoline car.  They're probably less efficient than electrics, but much cheaper and no environmental impact from batteries.  <br>  <br>  I think air-powered cars have a place in our future, but they're probably going to be restricted to places with lower speed limits, stricter emissions laws, and less available gasoline.  Also, they won't be any fun in really cold environments (no heat source to warm the cabin).|`|I38WF5aFaa	It takes a lot of electricity to run a compressor long enough to fill a tank with enough air to have any kind of range.   Small industrial air powered vehicles have their place but they will never be practical for highway use.|`|gz2JF00Saa	Umm... no, it is not realistic.|`|VWG9McHMaa	i guess. it would be awesome beacuse it would be better for the envirenment. i trhink anyone that has an idea for a car that has no gas shouldnt be scared to say it! we should try anything to make our envirenment/country better!|`|z4V9kdR8aa	No, it's pretty unrealistic.|`|0iQoSEelaa	Sure and costs a lot less than gas and better for the environment.|`|WewCtMpzaa	Yeap, but I would not want to be in a wreck in one of those, or even near one. The air tank is compressed to 7500 psi. I have seen the damage of air tanks at 150-200 psi. 7500 psi is just insane to be sitting on in an accident. It would be a massive explosion, if merely punctured.|`|npBCankMaa	a compressed air car gets its energy from burning coal, it has the largest carbon foot print of any car, even worse than race cars.<br>  <br>  How many out have looked at the exit temperatures from the air expander and understand the JT effect and temperatures.  Besides the air tank and expander, you have to burn some kind of fuel or have a HUGE radiator to rewarm the air between each stage in the expander.
