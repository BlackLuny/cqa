We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?”<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

X3TH21Mvaa	Interesting question! :)<br>  <br>  Well, for me it's not hard to "act" as a nerdy and shy person. Just relax firstly and then try to picture someone who is nerdy and shy that you feel like playing. I believe you can find quite a lot of them from almost any motion picture such as movie, etc. That person can actually be a good model.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't help, try working on your eyes. Put on some dull glasses, put on some freckles make-up. When a shy and nerdy person talks to someone else, he/she usually finds it very hard to look in others' eyes. Instead, that person may look down at the ground or their shoes etc... <br>  <br>  After that, try working on your gestures including walking... Your steps should be shorter and your head should be a lil downer than normal. Your shoulders and back shouldn't look so straight to indicate the defending gestures. <br>  <br>  If you want your protagonist to be more "lively", try working on your tone of voice which should be supposed to be small and abnormal (too fast or too slow). If you can stutter, that' d be totally effective! <br>  <br>  I will try to think of more suggestions for ya... <br>  <br>  Best lucks!<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|qtVCb9EKaa	I'm opposed to what Nellie said because of him/her telling you to imagine it yourself....an easier way to do it is to be the personnage, how does he feel when he gets bullied, how is it like to get bullied?

m6FPXCeuaa	Background<br>  Polyester is a synthetic fiber derived from coal, air, water, and petroleum. Developed in a 20th-century laboratory, polyester fibers are formed from a chemical reaction between an acid and alcohol. In this reaction, two or more molecules combine to make a large molecule whose structure repeats throughout its length. Polyester fibers can form very iong molecules that are very stable and strong.<br>  <br>  Polyester is used in the manufacture of many products, including clothing, home furnishings, industrial fabrics, computer and recording tapes, and electrical insulation. Polyester has several advantages over traditional fabrics such as cotton. It does not absorb moisture, but does absorb oil; this quality makes polyester the perfect fabric for the application of water-, soil-, and fire-resistant finishes. Its low absorbency also makes it naturally resistant to stains. Polyester clothing can be preshrunk in the finishing process, and thereafter the fabric resists shrinking and will not stretch out of shape. The fabric is easily dyeable, and not damaged by mildew. Textured polyester fibers are an effective, nonallergenic insulator, so the material is used for filling pillows, quilting, outerwear, and sleeping bags.<br>  <br>  History<br>  In 1926, United States-based E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. began research into very large molecules and synthetic fibers. This early research, headed by W.H. Carothers, centered on what became nylon, the first synthetic fiber. Soon after, in the years 1939-41, British research chemists took interest in the du Pont studies and conducted their own research in the laboratories of Calico Printers Association, Ltd. This work resulted in the creation of the polyester fiber known in England as Terylene.<br>  <br>  In 1946, du Pont purchased the right to produce this polyester fiber in the United States. The company conducted some further developmental work, and in 1951, began to market the fiber under the name Dacron. During the ensuing years, several companies became interested in polyester fibers and produced their own versions of the product for different uses. Today, there are two primary types of polyester, PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and PCDT (poly-1, 4-cyclohexylene-dimethylene terephthalate). PET, the more popular type, is applicable to a wider variety of uses. It is stronger than PCDT, though PCDT is more elastic and resilient. PCDT is suited to the heavier consumer uses, such as draperies and furniture coverings. PET can be used alone or blended with other fabrics to make clothing that is wrinkle and stain resistant and retains its shape.<br>  <br>  Raw Materials<br>  Polyester is a chemical term which can be broken into poly, meaning many, and ester, a basic organic chemical compound. The principle ingredient used in the manufacture of polyester is ethylene, which is derived from petroleum. In this process, ethylene is the polymer, the chemical building block of polyester, and the chemical process that produces the finished polyester is called polymerization.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The Manufacturing<br>  Process<br>  Polyester is manufactured by one of several methods. The one used depends on the form the finished polyester will take. The four basic forms are filament, staple, tow, and fiberfill. In the filament form, each individual strand of polyester fiber is continuous in length, producing smooth-surfaced fabrics. In staple form, filaments are cut to short, predetermined lengths. In this form polyester is easier to blend with other fibers. Tow is a form in which continuous filaments are drawn loosely together. Fiberfill is the voluminous form used in the manufacture of quilts, pillows, and outerwear. The two forms used most frequently are filament and staple.<br>  <br>  Manufacturing Filament Yarn<br>  Polymerization<br>  1 To form polyester, dimethyl terephthalate is first reacted with ethylene glycol in the presence of a catalyst at a temperature of 302-410°F (150-210°C). <br>  2 The resulting chemical, a monomer (single, non-repeating molecule) alcohol, is combined with terephthalic acid and raised to a temperature of 472°F (280°C). Newly-formed polyester, which is clear and molten, is extruded through a slot to form long ribbons. <br>  Drying<br>  3 After the polyester emerges from polymerization, the long molten ribbons are allowed to cool until they become brittle. The material is cut into tiny chips and completely dried to prevent irregularities in consistency. <br>  Melt spinning<br>  4 Polymer chips are melted at 500-518°F (260-270°C) to form a syrup-like solution. The solution is put in a metal container called a spinneret and forced through its tiny holes, which are usually round, but may be pentagonal or any other shape to produce special fibers. The number of holes in the spinneret determines the size of the yarn, as the emerging fibers are brought together to form a single strand. <br>  5 At the spinning stage, other chemicals may be added to the solution to make the resulting material flame retardant, antistatic, or easier to dye.|`|dO2VE9Vuaa	and this is in history why?|`|Fnp2MIycaa	It's not all that easy to give you simple instructions.<br>  It's not the same as natural fibres like wool or cotton.<br>  <br>  Polyesters are made from chemical substances found mainly in petroluem.<br>  <br>  Polyester is not just a textile. It is made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the same material used to make plastic drink bottles.<br>  <br>  To make polyester, ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate are mixed together. The chemical reaction results in bisterephthalate. This substance is heated to 270° Fahrenheit (132° Celsius), where it reacts again to form polyethylene terephthalate. Like many chemical reactions that result in polymers, the polyester making process results in unhealthy off gassing, and protection should be worn while making PET. After synthesizing the polymers, the manufacturer decides what to do with them. <br>  <br>  To make polyester fiber, an extruder is used to produce very fine threads of PET. Polyester clothing tends to be slippery and silky in feel, although it can cause skin irritation for some wearers. The polyester fibers used to make clothing can be knitted or woven, although most are knit, to maximize the flexibility of polyester. Some polyester is blended with other fabrics to provide more loft or stretch, or to minimize skin irritation.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	These might help, no guarantee as I haven't viewed them:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=grub32&view=videos" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=grub...</a>

FoMwdqJVaa	￡200 was an enormous amount of money - seems very strange such such a large sum was asked for and paid!  I would check that amount because it is way too high, perhaps this was the dowry that changed hands.<br>  <br>  With father's consent means that one of the parties to the marriage was underage, ie: under 21years old at the time of the marriage and they therefore required the consent of their father. (Age of Consent: From 1753 the age of consent to marry was 21, if you were under 21 then you had to have  parental permission.  Girls aged 12 and boys aged 14 could marry but they had to have parental permission! In 1929 the age of marriage was raised 16 for both girls & boys, but they still needed parental consent. In 1969 the age of consent to marry without parental permission was lowered to 18, which is still the law today.)<br>  <br>  A marriage by licence:<br>  Marriage licences were introduced in the fourteenth century, to allow the usual notice period under banns (3 weeks) to be waived, on payment of a fee and accompanied by a sworn declaration, that there was no legal impediment to the marriage. <br>  <br>  There were two kinds of marriage licences that could be issued: the usual was known as a common licence and named one or two parishes where the wedding could take place, within the jurisdiction of the person who issued the licence. The other was the special licence, which could only be granted by the Archbishop of Canterbury or his officials and allowed the marriage to take place in any church.<br>  <br>  There could be a number of reasons for a couple to obtain a licence: they might wish to marry quickly (and avoid the three weeks' delay by the calling of banns); they might wish to marry in a parish away from their home parish; or, because a licence required payment, they might choose to obtain one as a status symbol.<br>  <br>  To obtain a marriage licence, the couple or more usually the bridegroom, had to swear that there was no just cause or impediment why they should not marry. This was the marriage allegation. A bond was also lodged with the church authorities for a sum of money to be paid if it turned out that the marriage was contrary to Canon Law. The bishop kept the allegation and bond and issued the licence to the groom, who then gave it to the vicar of the church, where they were to get married. There was no obligation, for the vicar to keep the licence and many were simply destroyed. Hence, few historical examples of marriage licences, in England and Wales, survive. However, the allegations and bonds were usually retained and are an important source for English genealogy.<br>  <br>  Persons intending to be married usually had their banns read in church on three Sundays before the marriage. Those not wishing to be married by banns could obtain a licence from an appropriate (usually church) authority to marry at a place within its jurisdiction. Marriage by licence was often preferred because it was quicker, more convenient and/or more discreet, or because it was thought to confer social prestige.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Wow that is a good bit of money. Something like 22,000 today!! <br>  <br>  I would think that it would probably have to do with being underage. Maybe marrying someone of a different race or something similar that was frowned upon. Maybe to override an objection to the marriage?|`|bAp35x7uaa	I can't imagine it would have anything to do with being underage - prior to 1929 a girl could legally marry at age 12 and a boy at age 14 with parental consent (previously  people could be married at as early as seven years of age)<br>  <br>  It would more likely be to do with having to rush the wedding through without banns - when the act was passed, it required, under pain of nullity, that banns should be published according to the rubric, or a license obtained, and that, in either case, the marriage should be solemnized in church (except for Jews and Quakers); and that in the case of minors, marriage by license must be by the consent of parent or guardian.<br>  <br>  So they wouldn't have to pay if they were within those ages because the father's consent would be enough.<br>  <br>  So it sounds as though they didn't have time for banns - perhaps the girl was pregnant. and they had to buy a license.  Perhaps the ￡200 was given as a sweetener to rush the license through or to the church to marry them?|`|mzRSO802aa	Actually, this was the way things were done in 1790.  A marriage bond, license, return, and register are four different processes. In Colonial times, a couple wishing to be married went to the county clerk with proof of eligibility of marriage -- being of legal age and single status. This proof was "bonded," usually with a sum of money, and the bondsman was often a relative, not necessarily a parent, of the bride. The clerk issued a license, which was taken by the couple to their minister. After the marriage was performed, the minister sent a "return" to the clerk, signifying that the marriage had taken place, and the marriage was recorded or registered.|`|H2hmKyWKaa	there was probably some special circumstance which required a special licence probably to ensure a speedy marriage|`|gb1BGP8xaa	It could have been a special license, which allowed a quick marriage without the banns.

She went on to explain that concepts are the result of the integration of two or more percepts, by a means of metaphysical "measurement," which we then use to compare to other existents.<br>  <br>  This means your chair is a chair because we have "measured" it to be a chair, not because the form "chair" exists independently of the metaphysical measurement.

And in that you are willing to set everything you could imagine on fire, but for what reason, and for what objective purpose in view? What is it that you really want to know, what is it that you seek, if for instance, a chair were to turn into a table, a table into a sofa, and sofa into cat, and so on. The actual question is, why is chair a chair and not a table, or why anything is what it is and not just about anything else, the question that I try to answer in the following lines.<br>  <br>  But first of all, let me remind you that you could have asked, what is the meaning of this thing or that, of this chair or that? For if you have asked just that you might have found your answer each time you viewed something through a purpose of a need. You might have found that that this brand new chair is fit to grace the space of your living room, or that chair needs a bit of restoration, or that old rickety chair in fact is no longer a chair, as it no longer serves the good purpose of being a chair, it in fact is a piece of junk, good only for the pyre on bonfire night. <br>  <br>  We can find specific meanings of everything when we view things through the certainty of our purposes, as of our need, but when we go beyond the realistic sense of a human purpose, nothing remains definitive, or normally meaningful, then, anything can be anything, then a chair can indeed be a strange object causing much wonder and questioning in the mind; then we begin to questions not anything in particular but the reality itself, the reality of everything.<br>  <br>  It is said that chair as a work of craftsmanship that is twice removed from the reality: the reality of a chair being somewhere in the mind out of which an idea or a concept is born, and form that idea or concept the actual materialistic form of a chair. Then the idealistic reality of a chair is nothing but what is in the mind born out of our realistic needs, a chair in this sense is nothing but first and foremost an aid to our certain bodily posture, an extension to our physical form … then, if we question, what is a chair, we question the reality that nothing short of the reality of our own being.<br>  <br>  A chair is a chair, a table a table, just because you are you, nothing more and nothing less will serve that need of the question as an answer. You could try, but you’d only be imagining. Think carefully, as you could not knock a chair out of existence, or set it on fire and therefore do away with once and for all, for a chair that really is, is always inside your mind, as part of your imagination, and being. The thing that sits in your kitchen therefore is nothing but an extending part of your own reality embodied. <br>  <br>  The modern civilisation, the computer, the Internet, television, the care, what are they? They are all us, they were present as potentials within our mind even when we were dwelling in caves, and roaming in savannas for hunt. The deliverance from thought comes when we look around and find nothing but ourselves being reflected, as through a million-faceted mirror.|`|w93uualFaa	It's concept formation that gives you "chair" -<br>  <br>  According to Objectivism, concepts “represent classifications of observed existents according to their relationships to other observed existents.” (Ayn Rand, Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology; all further quotations in this section, unless otherwise identified, are from this work.) To form a concept, one mentally isolates a group of concretes (of distinct perceptual units), on the basis of observed similarities which distinguish them from all other known concretes (similarity is “the relationship between two or more existents which possess the same characteristic(s), but in different measure or degree”); then, by a process of omitting the particular measurements of these concretes, one integrates them into a single new mental unit: the concept, which subsumes all concretes of this kind (a potentially unlimited number). The integration is completed and retained by the selection of a perceptual symbol (a word) to designate it. “A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted.”<br>  <br>  Leonard Peikoff, “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,”<br>  Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, 131|`|UuGOHHG5aa	it would help to define chair and table  then see which definition applies t your chair .|`|bxlYleZkaa	If it really is a table then why is there a cushion on it and not a cloth?|`|7aK81hsbaa	semantics. what if you're in france?

ceBTTCPwaa	Try Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka if you want to impress your teacher/tutor: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamor...</a><br>  <br>  A recurring theme found in A Streetcar Named Desire is a constant conflict between reality and fantasy, actual and ideal. Blanche says "I don't want realism, I want magic." This recurring theme is read most strongly in Williams' characterization of Blanche DuBois and the physical tropes that she employs in her pursuit of what is magical and idealized: the paper lampshade she employs to cover the harsh white light bulb in the living room, her chronically deceptive recounting of her last years in Belle Reve, the misleading letters she presumes to write to Shep Huntleigh, and a pronounced tendency toward excess consumption of alcohol. As one critic writes, "Blanche spins a cocoon linguistically for protection." Blanche creates her own fantasy world through the characters she plays, such as the damsel, southern belle or school teacher. She wears her costumes creating a fa?ade to hide behind, concealing her secrets and attempting to reach her former glory, and illustrating her inability to relate to others in a "normal" sense.<br>  <br>  Notably, Blanche's deception of others and herself is not characterized by malicious intent, but rather a heart-broken and saddened retreat to a romantic time and happier moments before disaster struck her life (her previous loved one, the refined Allan Gray, committed suicide during a Varsouviana Polka, as a reaction to Blanche's revulsion when she discovered he was homosexual, after she accidentally encountered him having sex with another man).<br>  <br>  The contrast between Blanche and Stanley can be understood as reflecting a similar opposition: the 'fake', illusionary and self-deceptive woman, versus her sister's coarsely, brutally present and animalistic husband, simplistic and 'real' in his corporal presence.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/A_Streetcar_Name...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/snd/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/snd/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/streetcar/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/streetcar/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/Streetcar/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/Streetcar/inde...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?article_id=341" rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmStreetcar02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/desire" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/stretcr.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a>

AA11835015	come to russia. people here do all kinds of things americans don't. cook, knit, fix things themselves. grow a garden and can the food grown, redecorate their apartment, etc. often americans throw money at a problem, and let others DO something.<br>  if i can live in both countries six months at a time and we make at best $15000, you could live well on minimum wage. take people out of your pocket. cable?- get a life, not a tv. mobile phone? do you REALLY need one? in usa i get by on a prepaid. house over 1500 sq ft? give your paycheck to your electric company! macdonalds can eat $25 a week easily from you. you can cook (i can, 67c, anyway!!) a meal for about a dollar.  if each day at work you get a mackydoo's or a salad or a potato baked and it costs $6, that is $25 a week. 100 a month  1200 a year- a trip to europe! GET OTHER PEOPLES HANDS OUT OF YOUR POCKET!!! and live for YOU.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	I think the essentials of happiness, is all to do with how content in your own llife u feel.  Having a great loving partner, bit of wedge in your pocket, having a beautiful home, great family and friends as well as bein in a job you love, do all add up to happiness, but of course thats in my own opininon and experience! I have to be honest and say that at the mo in my job I have had to take a pay cut, without that extra cash it does make me feel kinda down as I cant do what I would like, that includes decorating my house which frustrates me when there's people who don't and don't wana work who get vouchers for paint to decorate their home, that usually includes people just coming out of prison. Wheres the fairness in this society? If the gov did more to help the likes of us hard working folk then I think Britain would be a much happier place altogether!!!|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	I think the key to happiness is believing that you have a purpose in life, that you're not just here by accident, wandering through life doing nothing and nobody is going to notice when you're gone. That would make anybody deeply unhappy. We need a reason to keep going, whether its to do something, love somebody, to be a parent, or some people seek meaning in religion. Which is kind of the same thing really as what your tutor was saying|`|ZNRYqss9aa	Anyone can make their own happiness and know that the 'crap jobs and long hours' don't seem the best things in the world but that is only because we know they are coming next. We can have fun doing something else, what ever we want.|`|FaNmIRmPaa	I think the point is to find a job which compliments your personality, for example- if you are a people person, a job in retail etc where you are constantly dealing with people would be a good idea. If you like getting your hands dirty and physical work, maybe a decorator or something.<br>  <br>  The thing is, find a job you can stand, make the most out of it (make friends, etc through it) and make time for yourself out of the workplace to do what you enjoy- like going out for meals, evenings in with friends/partners, going to the cinema, a hobby etc|`|zon13nY2aa	I would say that is pretty spot on!!<br>  <br>  I'm unhappy in my job but I have a holiday in May to look forward to, and when I get back I have a trip to London to look forward to, then there are other things to look forward to. Keeps the mind busy and positive!<br>  <br>  x<br>  <br>  Edit: :( Oh that sucks. Just tell yourself - your job is paying your wages and those wages can be spent on doing things that you DO enjoy - going on holiday, etc.<br>  <br>  If you're super unhappy in your job, put all your energy into finding a new career. Then that covers the 'something to do' as well. xx|`|qr16GzNnaa	Yes she may be right, but that may be what she classify as happiness.  You on the other hand is the only one that can make you happy. Happiness is not about a good job and looking forward to something.  Listen some people have horrible jobs, but still they are happy. some people have all the money in the world but yet they are not happy. Happiness doesn't lay in good jobs. People out there have pretty good jobs, but yet they are unhappy. Make your own happiness don't relay on a good jobs or something spectacular to look forward to.  Listen 75 % of the world is unhappy about their jobs. Did you know some of us only take the job because of the money and not because its something we love doing. Make your own happiness|`|s92cftVAaa	i think that happiness is about how you look at what you have or are... some people are happy although having a crap job; others are quite miserable working in good jobs. it is about what you have inside not what happens to you outside.|`|yULWldR4aa	i think thats a nice way of looking at things and yes long hours and that do suck, but do they also help us to appriciate our time off more? If we had more time off would we waste it?<br>  <br>  Does the 'crap jobs' put things in perspective?|`|zlQo7WMoaa	I think the first guy's answer was the best, and I agree with him.|`|bJtUNkmhaa	no, happiness is a fish and chips in a paper bag..|`|VdcKrxthaa	what do you think?|`|XadHhxOSaa	To be honest the only way you will be happy is through yourself, its not down to anyone else or anything. your happiness is decided upon the future and what you make of it.|`|ANmnjaYtaa	i think these are good things and with me its to study til i become a nurse to love my boy and too look forward til getting my life on track with a house and all and to make a family of my own.|`|pRITYx1Yaa	I also had a tutor once tell me that and I have thought about it and still can't find anything wrong with that idea.|`|bxlYleZkaa	No, happiness is a warm cat|`|AA11635601	That's very close - you need to having a sound loving relationship, yes, and you have to behave decently.  Something to do is probably right, but you can always make something to do.  What counts is that whatever you do, you do it well and decently.  Those two things, love and decency, are the two ingredients of happy.

XqrjFYgIaa	I've only read two of his books so far (Beyond Good and Evil and The Gay Science), so my understanding of his philosophy is somewhat limited. Regardless, I'm profoundly impacted by such ideas as "god is dead," "freethinker," "eternal recurrence," "abscondita historia," "star friendship," "brief habits," as well as his discussions on the origins of morality, religion, art, and science. In essence--everything!<br>  <br>  I also appreciate his ubermensch concept. If people could only realize that Nietzsche was an optimist, an idealist, they would think twice before calling him pessimist, nihilist, etc. He held himself up to the highest standard, and he sought kinship with others who similarly held themselves up to the highest standards. <br>  <br>  In short, all of Nietzsche was a major contribution to Western thought. The impact of his genius continues to ripple into current society, and I believe his philosophy will continue to have relevance for individuals yet to come.|`|AA10984198	His works were wide ranging.<br>  <br>  Possibly the concept of ubermensch had a big impact (11 million stuffed in gas chambers) but has fallen out of favour.<br>  <br>  Many people like his concept of will to power. This seems to be what gets people going now.<br>  <br>  The concept that man is God of his own destiny, and that while people like Camus surpassed him in thought, he was inspiration to many who came after him who looked for mans place in a godless world.|`|LwqM7EHVaa	He influenced Jim Morrison.. enough said..|`|AA11635601	His departure.|`|KTNqah9eaa	Was it he who said I am who I think I am?

NCm9cB7Zaa	well, i dont really know of artists, cos i work in fine art usually, and don't know many photographers. check photography magazines and that for examples and people to work from and gain ideas. national geographic is also great as their photography is of a really high quality. <br>  <br>  otherwise, do loads of examples for textiles, and also if you want to do scuba diving, does that mean you wanna make a diving suit or what? cos the material needed for that could be rather tricky to work with! <br>  <br>  for family, do some formal pictures, ie have the family all on the couch, not smiling, etc and then take some spontaneous shots, without them taking notice of you. just an idea.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
rvaXSVjcaa	Well, I must choose Tolkien since I adore the whole world of middle-earth but in all honesty its difficult to choose only one.<br>  <br>  In tied second place, almost on par with Tolkien, I name Greg Keyes and George RR Martin, both are brilliant fantasy [and scifi] writers.<br>  <br>  In tied third place will definintely be Robin Hobb and Kate Elliott.<br>  <br>  Ok, ok, I'll admit it, my favourite is really Terry Pratchett but since I see him more as a satirist that only use fantasy as a medium for his satire, I never include him in favourite fantasy lists.|`|AA11940871	I think JK Rowling is pretty kickass, but I also like Ursula LeGuin :)|`|iR3wIKNZaa	David Eddings<br>  Raymond E Feist<br>  Robert Jordan<br>  David Gemmel|`|weMhsZUNaa	J.K.

rvaXSVjcaa	My favourite books of all time. If you haven't read them, do so. Brilliantly written, great story, original characters and creatures, its a mythology all its own. If he lived in ancient times it would have started a new religion! LOL!<br>  <br>  Now yes, I know a lot of people found the book difficult, slow and even boring. Maybe these people preferred fast-paced action fantasy with the story being rather one-dimensional, or not. <br>  <br>  But the LotR is well worth the read. If you liked it and enjoy the history of Middle-earth, also indulge in the Silmarillion, Children of Hurin, Forgotten tales, etc. which are all about the whole history of middle-earth and its characters, a history you only glimpse in the Lord of the Rings books.<br>  <br>  It think it justly deserves to be named the most influential fiction story of the last 100 years.|`|tObI0whAaa	one of the greatest tales ever but make sure to read the book BEFORE you see the movie. hollywood and tolkein are at opposite ends of the engtertainment spectrum|`|oL9HDPveaa	I thought they were amazing. I loved all three and The Hobbit, too. I also thought the movies did the books justice in a beautiful way.|`|iR3wIKNZaa	Its a great story,but I liked The Hobbit more.|`|oalrUO4yaa	yes, it does take you a long time to read, and you may get a bit impatient, but its well worth it. lord of the rings is probably the most creative and well-thought-out book of all time.<br>  <br>  tolkien has so much creativity and originality that the books are incredible! some things are difficult to understand, but i did enjoy the books.<br>  <br>  i also must admit that the movies were good also. most movies are horrible compared to the books, but i thought the lord of the rings movie did the book justice. [:|`|0a6a6d56de1add33ec349672efbbaf5daa	It takes a lot of patience to read them, but they are beautiful times infinity. Often times poetic, it's the story of a world and turmoil and the heroes who are chosen to save it. Great read, worth it.<br>  <br>  Laheira, Frodo's Mt. Doom bit was so dramatic and perfectly tragic. I loved every bit of it, it's so touching... it does, after all, lead up to "the end of all things..." <3|`|knKVjOE6aa	Yeah it's great, Mind you I haven't finished the Return of the king yet had too many other books to read but it is a fantastic series highly recommended read.|`|bECsJtvDaa	Books were some of my favorite books ever! Movies are some of my favorite movies ever. Tolkien was a genius. (and Peter Jackson great too)|`|JBd3QeMNaa	They are very good but i got bored with the descripton.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	It is one of the greatest works of literature I've ever had the pleasure to read.

VufgMhI2aa	It's really dramatic because when the court is in session, Portia walks in, disguised as a young lawyer, with her lady-in-waiting, Nerissa, who is disguised as the lawyers assistant.<br>  They read the contract given by Shylock, and then Portia declares that Shylock's  demand for one pound of flesh from Antonio's body is completely valid, and that justice be served. Shylock praises Portia, saying that 'he' is a learned lawyer with wisdom much beyond 'his' years.<br>  Suddenly, Portia tells Shylock that he can take his pound of flesh, but if he sheds even one drop of blood, he will be executed, as the contract doesn't say anything about blood. The tables are turned, and Shylock asks for the principal amount, which he earlier denied. Portia points out that he denied this in the start and can't have it anymore. Moreover, he is convicted of conspiring to kill a Christian and all his property is seized. Shylock finally becomes the victim, and Antonio is saved

Good Luck xx|`|ji7WZvC1aa	Get hold of a book called "So You Want To Tread The Boards" which has stacks of great advice for you, plus extensive song lists.  You need to find a song which fits your voice, isn't overdone (no Wicked, Hairspray, Les Mis, Legally Blonde, Phantom etc etc), and isn't identified with one particular singer - eg "Over the Rainbow" will always be identified with Judy Garland, so if you sing it, you'll be compared (probably unfavourably!!) to her.  Ideally you want to try and find a song which the audition panel will recognise (so not totally obscure) but no-one else will be singing - and you definitely want a musical theatre song.  Avoid Sondheim as well - while he writes wonderful music, it's hideously difficult for the pianist and also relies on the pianist and singer being totally together, which is tricky when it's an accompanist you've never seen before!|`|UnE1cycJaa	over the rainbow :D

PARA DEFENSA DE LA CIUDAD Y SUS POBLADORES. PERO desde mis apuntes te cuento que:<br>    <br>    Introducción Histórica   <br>     <br>  La Alhambra, denominada así por sus muros de color rojizo (?qa'lat al-Hamra'?, Castillo Rojo), está situada en lo alto de la colina de al-Sabika, en la margen izquierda del río Darro, al este de la ciudad, frente a los barrios del Albaicín y de la Alcazaba.<br>  <br>  Su posición estratégica, desde la que se domina toda la ciudad y la vega granadina, hace pensar que existían construcciones anteriores a la llegada de los musulmanes. Su conjunto, completamente amurallado, posee una forma irregular limitado al norte por el valle del Darro, al sur por el de la al-Sabika, y al este por la Cuesta del Rey Chico, que a su vez la separan del Albaicín y del Generalife, situado en el cerro del Sol.<br>  <br>  Se tiene constancia por primera vez de ella en el siglo IX, cuando en 889 Sawwar ben Hamdun tuvo que refugiarse en la Alcazaba y repararla debido a las luchas civiles que azotaban por entonces al Califato cordobés, al que pertenecía Granada. Posteriormente, este recinto empezó a ensancharse y a poblarse, aunque no hasta lo que sería con posterioridad, ya que los primeros monarcas ziríes fijaron su residencia en lo que posteriormente sería el Albaicín.<br>   <br>  Escudo de los Alhamares <br>  <br>  A pesar de la incorporación del castillo de la Alhambra al recinto amurallado de la ciudad en el siglo XI, lo que la convirtió en una fortaleza militar desde la que se dominaba toda la ciudad, no sería hasta el siglo XIII con la llegada del primer monarca nazarí, Mohamed ben Al-Hamar (Mohamed I, 1238-1273) cuando se fijaría la residencia real en La Alhambra. Este hecho marcó el inicio de su época de mayor esplendor.<br>  <br>  Primero se reforzó la parte antigua de la Alcazaba, y se construyó la Torre de la Vela y del Homenaje, se subío agua del río Darro, se edificaron almacenes, depósitos y comenzó la construcción del palacio y del recinto amurallado que continuaron Mohamed II (1273-1302) y Mohamed III (1302-1309), al que también se le atribuyen un ba?o público y la Mezquita sobre la que se construyó la actual iglesia de Santa María.<br>  <br>  A Yúsuf I (1333-1353) y Mohamed V (1353-1391) les debemos la inmensa mayoría de las construcciones de la Alhambra que han llegado a nuestra época. Desde la reforma de la Alcazaba y los palacios, pasando por la ampliación del recinto amurallado, la Puerta de la Justicia, la ampliación y decoración de las torres, construcción de los Ba?os y el Cuarto de Comares, la Sala de la Barca, hasta el Patio de los Leones y sus dependencias anexas. De los reyes nazaríes posteriores no se conserva prácticamente nada.<br>  <br>  De la época de los Reyes Católicos hasta nuestros días podemos destacar la demolición de parte del conjunto arquitectónico por parte de Carlos V para construir el palacio que lleva su nombre, la construcción de las habitaciones del emperador y el Peinador de la Reina y el abandono de la conservación de la Alhambra a partir del siglo XVIII. Durante la dominación francesa fue volada parte de la fortaleza y hasta el siglo XIX no comenzó su reparación, restauración y conservación que se mantiene hasta la actualidad. Te doy otros apuntes porque sé que eligirás esta respuesta!!!<br>  <br>  El edificio<br>  <br>  Es el gran monumento de la arquitectura nazarí.

Bajo la dominación francesa sufrió graves da?os y hasta el siglo XIX no comenzaría su reparación y mantenimiento para conservarlo en buenas condiciones. <br>  <br>  En el a?o 1984 la Alhambra y el Generalife fueron declarados por la UNESCO Patrimonio de la Humanidad.<br>  <br>  La decoración<br>  <br>  La preocupación de los artistas fue cubrir cada espacio, llenarlo con profusas decoraciones. Las paredes estaban recubiertas de cerámicas o yeserías. <br>  <br>  Los temas decorativos de gran variedad: caligráficos, escritura cursiva o cúfica, poemas, atauriques o decoraciones vegetales, lacerías y redes de rombos. <br>  <br>  La columna de fuste muy fino con una base con una gran moldura cóncava, adornada con anillos en la parte superior. <br>  <br>  El capitel está dividido en dos cuerpos: el primero decorado muy sencillamente y, sobre él, un prisma con los ángulos de la base redondeados y decorados de ataurique. En cuanto a las bóvedas, destacan las de mocárabes compuestas por celdillas o alveolos superpuestos.<br>  <br>  Cuarto de Comares<br>  <br>  Su nombre se debe a sus vidrieras de colores (comaria). Es de la época de Yusuf I y es la zona más grandiosa de toda la Alhambra. Está formado por dos patios: uno más peque?o llamado del Mexuar, la Administración de Justicia y otro de grandes dimensiones llamado de la Alberca o de los Arrayanes que es el verdadero centro del palacio, con dos fuentes cuyas aguas crean un maravilloso efecto al reflejar en sus aguas el bello palacio. <br>  <br>  Al patio del Mexuar que tiene arquerías sólo en uno de sus frentes, se abre la gran portada del palacio, protegida por un alero de madera profusamente decorado. De sus dos puertas, una es de ingreso al patio desde el exterior y la otra de acceso desde aquel al patio de la Alberca. Al otro lado de este patio del Mexuar se levanta el oratorio con su peque?o mihrab en cuya puerta aparece el arco de herradura. <br>  <br>  Cuarto de los Leones<br>  <br>  Es de la época de Mohamed V y su patio, como aparece en los claustros cristianos, tiene pórticos en sus cuatro frentes. De los más estrechos se destaca un pabellón con una fuente en su interior que con sus múltiples columnillas realzan la belleza del conjunto. En el centro del patio se levanta la fuente de los leones, del siglo XIV. El patio es la representación del paraíso.<br>  <br>  Sala de los Abencerrajes <br>  <br>  Se abre al patio de los Leones. En ella fueron decapitados los miembros de esta familia. <br>  <br>  Puertas exteriores <br>  <br>  Las más destacadas son las de Yusuf I, llamada de la Justicia y la de Armas. La del Vino está dentro del actual recinto. <br>  <br>  Torres y jardines del Partal<br>  <br>  Era la zona de las viviendas de los criados del palacio. Encierra varias torres: de las Damas, Mihrab, de los Picos, de la Cautiva, de las Infantas.<br>                     MUCHA SUERTE, PARA TI Y LOS TUYOS!!

f2986b83c8bb87ba5ae96c4ebf250e51aa	In the 1640's, a proper Bostonian woman would have tended to domestic matters and fairly little else.<br>  <br>  They would have been expected to be quiet, submissive to men, and members of the Puritan church.<br>  <br>  Of course, all generalizations (including this one) are false, because in every age and in every society you will find people who refuse to fit into a set of preconceived roles, and such women as Anne Hutchinson and Mary Dyer are among them.<br>  <br>  Anne Hutchinson started out as a "good Puritan woman" by the ideas of her society.  She cared for the home and raised her children, and was a midwife.  All in all, a pillar of the community.<br>  <br>  She even began to hold meetings in her home for her neighbors--women only, of course--at which they would discuss the sermons preached the Sunday before.  So far, so good--this wasn't stepping out of her designated role.<br>  <br>  However, she ran afoul of the authorities by forming opinions of her own and expressing them in these meetings--I believe what got her in trouble was a rejection of the religious belief that babies are born in a state of sin.<br>  <br>  Mary Dyer was one of her friends who attended the meetings--she was later hanged for the "crime" of professing beliefs of the Society of Friends, better known as "Quakers."  <br>  <br>  Anne was banished from Boston and later died when Indians attacked her new homestead on Long Island.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	One way to answer this question would be to look up Anne Hutchison and Mary Dyer on wikipedia or the web. These two women got into trouble in the early Boston colony because they started to do things that were considered not appropriate for women. So any discussion of them will include what it is that they were or were not supposed to do!|`|AA11054637	Are you asking in terms of what a woman had to do labour wise? Or indeed their social status? I'm not an American but the question is still pertinent in terms of societal structure albeit in the 1640's or 1940's up to the present day. Even then, has the female role evolved since the 1640's in meaningful terms?

W8F9PboZaa	I have no proof of this but i absolutely think it was temporary. I think it was kind of like the polyjuice potion; wore off after an hour. I just looked up that chapter and it does say nothing. Fred and George were sent to the infirmary because when they crossed the line they grew bears. They had to get rid of them haha. <br>  <br>  And as for what year? Well it says the twins were extremely tired meaning they probably had not covered it as they were up all night working on it. So we can assume they hadn't covered it previously right? Probably 6th or 7th year. But you never know, the twins may not have done advanced potions (although I think it's probable)<br>  <br>  Hermione knows everything though. I mean she knew about polyjuice potion (taught 6th year) when she was 12.  <br>  <br>  On the hpwiki it says the effects are probably temporary. Although they don't site any sources.|`|AA10446546	As far as I know, the book gives no information about whether the effect of the potion was permanent or temporary.<br>  <br>  For the year the potion was taught, I think it's not going to be useful, the Weasley Twins are both genius though they may not look like that. It is very probable that the Weasley Twins knows advanced potion making, as many of their products are magical candies and stuffs.<br>  <br>  And for Hermione knowing it... well, she is Mrs. know-it-all after all...

(citation needed)<br>  <br>  When you say x = x, you just say X is X. But it does not remain X forever. The meaning of everything change. X might be 5 in here but 0.5 in space.

md0FQSxBaa	To love unconditionally is just that. We need to love without expecting anything in return.<br>  <br>  With that said, we all should have people in our lives that we know without a doubt returns the same kind of love we give.... ex. by staying besides us through the bad times, too. You just need to determine who those people are in your lives and they should always include your parents... it's not too much to ask of them.|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Expecting others to return your love in kind places a "cost" on your love. You hold them hostage to your love, as though they owed you in return what you willingly give them with no strings attached--except you have strings attached.<br>  The old saying, "If you love someone, set them free" only means that you do not impose those strings. Your feelings toward a person is not a blank check on their emotions--they don't owe you a thing for what you freely give. And if it is not free, then you don't deserve a thing in return.<br>  <br>  Note: Giving it freely does not mean that you do not attach certain standards. You can't love the people killed by Charles Manson's "family" and love Manson and his family, too. Love is a response to the values you see in other people, but if they don't see the value in you, it may be a heartbreaker but still, they don't owe you a thing.|`|s6VUquLUaa	ya u r right <br>  "Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. Love does not demand its own way. Love is not irritable, and it does not keep record of when it has been wronged. It is never glad about injustice but rejoices when truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance. Love will last forever".<br>  "Love means to have strong feelings for someone that can be close friends, family or even someone in a romantic relationship. Love is a strong feeling that represents affection toward someone dear to you heart".|`|GUVl3KiYaa	well how do you feel about them not loving you? If you feel you hate this character flaw in them, then you must not truly love them, but like their other traits. therm loving you back is not a directive, it's a type of personality.|`|R6Rjtv0saa	bcoz we r humans, simple :D<br>  <br>  true luv isnt all abt slefless, yes being slefless is a part of true luv.<br>  but it hard to liv alone without d person we luv in hard times...|`|O312XoP9aa	Hi..<br>  <br>   To be frank  , in today's materialistic world  the word Selfless  has lost its sheen  and people are very selfish . so i guess you understand what i try to mean<br>  <br>  cheers|`|aMys1VWzaa	love is not a thing but it is a feeling|`|ctwFzYL7aa	We do that to ensure whether the person whom we love likes us or not|`|KXiwLOtOaa	Yes I believe it does. The reason we have these expectations is because we also love ourselves. While having these expectations does not say anything great about our own capacity for love they are not all bad. After all to love without any expectation a selfish abusive person would essentially enable them to continue to be so and even entrench unhealthy behavior that cannot possibly benefit them. So the best relationship would seem to me to be one where people give and receive on a somewhat equal basis. That said however, some people are not as emotionally wealthy as others and obviously some allowance must be made for their capacity.|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	There is NO such thing! whats love???? just an emotion that changes with seratonium levels in the brain!|`|mq6y0DDjaa	EXPECTATION---remove this word from the dictionary and our life will be that much more beautiful bcos expectation is the root cause of all problems.<br>  true love doesnt expect anything in return.<br>  i remember that old hindi song "sukh ke sab saathi dukh mein na koi"aur jo  dukh mein saath de wohi sacha saathi hai.|`|8379c575798db3493c5c0194efc05e70aa	Expectation of a response or return can be merely instinctive and as such by itself it need not undermine the love........ what however would certainly undermine the love is if it changes due to any shortfall or disappointment opposite the expectations.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	If true love is selfless. Then why people get angry when they discovered that their lover have more than one lover ?<br>  <br>  Love is selfish. You expect your lover to love you and you alone.|`|1nO6J8B2aa	i think love is not a thing its a feeling
AA11894640	Don't I???<br>  <br>  I most certainly did!

That's most traumatic!<br>  <br>  I really wished for an undo button (more for a rewind button actually)...with all my heart!|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	When we all become robots.<br>  <br>  You made my day.  LMAO|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Many times.|`|R26OBoW7aa	Well, that essentially means going back to a previous state in relation to time. This undo idea is clearly akin to the time machine concept by which some people dream to move the time backwards. This is an area over which many learned people have put forward their views and ideas.<br>  Those who think life will be useless, dangerous,bleak and would impair human learning process might consider the fact that with out a undo button does the human race desist from committing blunders and mistakes by learning from past experience ?<br>  It can only be said hypothetically that if we had an undo button the sum total of our existence would have been altogether a different story !<br>  The day undo is possible all laws of the universe has to be rewritten.|`|8379c575798db3493c5c0194efc05e70aa	The 'undo' button would rob life of all seriousness. Life will become a joke!!<br>  <br>  Well, for all we know, life is perhaps no serious matter after all, but the reason we can consummate it with such eagerness and enthusiasm is because we do take it seriously.|`|Sjq1Ke5faa	sometimes ..no ...its more like all the time ...but then iuguess thats why our life's in our hands ...it just isn't another opertaing system ...its not perfect but we still enjoy it ....and wat if we undid something that actually taught us lot about how 2 avoid things that have 2 be ...so i guess whoever made our system must've thought for quite some time over the "softwares" that need 2 be installed in us !!!|`|qr16GzNnaa	I guess I once wish so, until I got older and I realised I should not feel sorry for the mistakes I made in my life because it sharped me in the person I am today. We all must have a past  whether good or bad in order to have a present or a future. I have learnt from my mistakes so does some.  Life can not only be filled with do goodiers, can you imagine how boring that would be? If you believe in God ask him for forgiveness and try not to make the same mistakes.|`|z4LHiZ6taa	Oh My Gosh it's like we like share the same brain. I think i've been playing Sims too much, cuz i really wish we have undo button, so we can do something incredibly stupid (by accident or just for fun) and undo it and everything will be normal. Then we can take giant risks and not be afraid of what will happen.|`|AA10984198	interesting, but it would rob us of character....we are the sum total of our actions.<br>  <br>  But yeah, when you are falling out of an open window, I would go with ctrl+z.<br>  <br>  Maybe a failed interview...try again<br>  <br>  but each step is actually progress on the path|`|aIzKbpQGaa	yeah i do wish<br>  magar aise bhi bindaas hai.. after all <br>  experience cannot be obtained with undo's|`|459MOxHfaa	We wouldn't learn anything if we didn't have to face the consequences for our actions.

Most of us would not undo a moment, they would keep playing. This passing life is a beauty in its own. Sometimes we make bad choices, and come to know how good that proved later.... But of course, if you lost someone you loved|`|SxVM7MqSaa	i never thot of an undo button..<br>  <br>  i thot of a pause button .. so like wen situation arent rite.. u can be in ur paused sat .. n when everything's okk u can get back normally...<br>   having a on off swith wudnt be bad too...lol !!|`|nLFa8YQMaa	That would definitely be very convenient.|`|IuH76cQTaa	then life will never be life anymore.
AA11635601	I think you nailed the answer yourself.  How can you be happy at your job without quitting and getting a job that makes you happy?.  Right!  Who says you have to solve this problem without quitting your job and changing jobs?  Maybe that will be what it takes.<br>  <br>  Anyway, don't rule it out.  Otherwise it's like saying how can I become good at tennis without jplaying and practicing tennis - <br>  <br>  But you can't "make your own happiness" anyway, at least not directly.  You can arrange your life in a manner that will cause happiness, but we can't do it just by force of mind or something.  It takes a strong, loving relaitonship, and decency in our own behavior.  And, of course, freedom from oppressive things, such as maybe your job or being in prison, etc.  Chronic pain.  <br>  <br>  Might be time for a job change - of course with today's economy it might be time to grit your teeth and hang tough for a while until things get more normal and more jobs become available.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Maybe if u did quit your job u would be happier tho, maybe it is your job thats bringin you down???<br>  I was depressed last year, took me years to realize, but do you know who was making me like this?

I work in an office job, full time, I hate it, there's no job satisfaction, I sit on my own pondering over how crappy everything is, I look forward to lunchtime then hometime then the weekend and this continues every week!<br>  <br>  I don't know what I want to do but I know I don't want to do this! Yet I have to stay because I have bills and things to pay for and responsibilities.<br>  <br>  Last week I started a course with the Open University in psychology which has always interested me and I wish I had studied it at Uni when I had the chance! It's not going to let me change my career overnight but it gives me light at the end of the tunnel and gives me something to think about, and something to do when work is so dull!<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are reeeally depressed about your job. You NEED to find something else. Even if the money is slightly less, or it's not your *ideal* job, or there is the occasional weekend shift, at least it means you can leave your present job and there is a chance of being happier.<br>  <br>  I really hope things work out. x|`|bxlYleZkaa	I make a fresh pot of tea, sit down in my garden, talk to it and to my cats.
AA11041425	Actually, it sounds completely okay to me.|`|sh1VoStgaa	yeah, that is what I would say to the line previous. I actually think person 1 sounds kinda odd.

oTSB5BITaa	In my opinion, John Steinbeck is the greatest American novelist. His style is often compared to several of his contemporaries, such as Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Someone said Upton Sinclair.

Living hand to mouth in London's East End, the unnamed mother's life is shattered when her policeman husband (part of a bomb disposal unit) and four-year-old son are killed in the stadium stands. Complicating matters: our narrator witnesses the event on TV, while in the throes of passion with her lover, journalist Jasper Black. The full story of that day comes out piecemeal, among rants and ruminations, complete with the widow's shell-shocked sifting of the stadium's human carnage. London goes on high terror alert; the narrator downs Valium and gin and clutches her son's stuffed rabbit. After a suicide attempt, she finds solace with married police superintendent Terrence Butcher and in volunteer work. When the bomb scares escalate, actions by Jasper and his girlfriend Petra become the widow's undoing. The whole is nicely done, as the protagonist's headlong sentences mimic intelligent illiteracy with accuracy"|`|3ZSsBYtnaa	Good luck.

Su genialidad radicó en la interpretación de la naturaleza, que en fin de cuentas estuvo allí. Einstein dio un salto hacia un mundo desconocido.

Eventually it'll get stronger.<br>  <br>  I derive peace of mind by seeing that there is a complex and acknowledging it. I see my behaviours as ways of reacting to the complex I've created myself. We all have our own complex that we're living within, so peace of mind and happiness can come from fulfilling your self-created hero complex in which you thrive. Eg. one person's complex says that owning a car is an achievement; another person's complex says only owning a nice car is an achievement.

Write them down in your little black book.<br>  <br>  >>Discuss with your friends about each other's skills and talents, and identify what is yours. <br>  <br>  >>Take weekly walks to observe Nature -- parks, forest, beach, hill tops -- and see what your thoughts/feelings are. Jot them down instantly before they fade away.<br>  <br>  >>Attend free talks/seminars by visiting yogis, Buddhist masters, etc.<br>  <br>  These should be your first few steps towards possible Enlightenment within a few years.  You will feel more focused and confident in the months to come. Sure some sacrifices would have to be made -- such as no alcohol, drugs or partying or attachment to materialism -- but this approach will ensure progress on your path.  Best of luck!|`|xGI9z01Maa	Wisdom is gained by experience and age either your own or others.  (read some Biographies.) <br>  <br>  Peace is gained we you choose to make sure that your world is right.  That you have done all that you can to make yourself happy and learn to live with the things that you have done and left go of the things that others have done to you.  <br>  <br>  Clarity and peace of mind is gained only when you learn to tell yourself the truth about who and what you are.<br>  <br>  Intuition is over rated.

The fun job would be great but does that pay your rent.  Or can you find something in the middle?

Just in case it isn't, use the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key<br>  Short Version<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?”<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

NpIWGtPkaa	I think you can build up that passion gradually by immersing yourself more and more in Flamenco, When you become more familiar  you will find it easier to express your feelings in Flamenco. I′m not a Flamenco dancer but as a Flamenco guitar student I think it′s vital for both dancer and guitarist to have that passion. <br>  <br>  You have that passion inside you if you listen to flamenco and sometimes you feel your heart beats faster, sometimes it skips a few beats. You have that passion when you listen to Flamenco and you feel you wanna dance , sometimes you wanna stand up and shout Ole! If you can feel "Duende" that magical moment in Flamenco that might bring tears in your eyes or might make you feel like the happiest person in the world.  <br>  If you feel like that sometimes then you have the passion already, you must just cultivate it and guide it. <br>  <br>  One can go on for ages talking about what that passion really is and where it comes from... But it's truely beyond words.|`|TUiT6uhpaa	No

wQxgnHfMaa	It is generally accepted that an American music school is "better" than the European schools.  This is mainly due to the fact that classical music is NOT an American artform.  Because it is not an American artform, American music schools have to teach all schoolings of music from each country.<br>  <br>  The best example to see this is in operatic singers.  Notable American singers are trained in all languages.  It is a standard practice for a 19 year old college voice major to have already sung in 3 language mastering 4 before leaving undergraduate.  European singers generally sing in their native tongue without regard to singing in other languages.  For example, you will only find one recording of Luciano Pavarotti singing in French (he's Italian).<br>  <br>  As a musician trained in an American school, you will become very VERY well-rounded and versatile.  While you won't necessarily master all of Schubert's lieder as if you would in Austria or Germany, you will have an upper hand because you can perform all types of music in all different styles.|`|Cpp1LddVaa	There are good schools in all of  the  above and as an undergraduate, you will get little or no access to the faculty that make them famous.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, where you go is less important than how much time and effort you expend all alone and by yourself building up your skills and knowledge.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to begin with  places close to home and work your way outward, talking to people and looking at programs to see if they meet your needs.  Chemistry comes in 3 varieties: good, bad or not there at all.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes.

ceBTTCPwaa	Othello, the Moor of Venice is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in approximately 1603, and based on the Italian short story "Un Capitano Moro" (A Moorish Captain) by Cinthio (a disciple of Boccaccio) first published in 1565. The work revolves around four central characters: Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army; his wife Desdemona; his lieutenant, Cassio; and his trusted ensign Iago. Because of its varied themes — racism, love, jealousy and betrayal — Othello remains relevant to the present day and is often performed in professional and community theatres alike. The play has also been the basis for numerous operatic, film and literary adaptations.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Othello" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Othello</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/oth/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/oth/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/othello/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ot...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-138.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/othello/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/othello/index....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?article_id=337" rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmOthello02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/othello/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/othello.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/Free_Booknotes/Othello/othello.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/F...</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	2.3 Iago gets Cassio drunk, watches him get into a brawl, and then tells Othello all about it.

dXADvTdDaa	If it is required reading, usually there will be summaries online. If you are studying the book, read a brief plot synapses before you start the book. This way if you find the book a bit dry, you will at least understand totally what is going on. <br>  <br>  Next, if you can, write in the book. Just grab a highlighter of your favorite pen and mark up the book. Put in your thoughts, connections to outside events, and connections to different parts of the book.<br>  <br>  If you are studying the book for English class keep a list of literary devices in the book and make sure that you begin to recognize them and note them the first or second time you read it so that you don't have to comb through the book every time you need to find them.<br>  <br>  Also, I'm sure you know this but location is everything. Find a comfortable (upright) location. Don't lay down ever if you are reading something you aren't in love with, you will fall asleep or want to give up. Go to a park, the library, or a coffee house if you can, usually easy environments to focus at. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your reading.|`|1vfockYEaa	You know I used to hate reading except for romance novels. However, after reading Harry Potter I liked reading a lot. I found what kind of books a like. Harry Potter, Sherlock Holmes, Lords of the Rings, etc... Do you like adventures? They keep you reading.<br>  <br>  Make time for reading. Try to be curious about the book you will read. If there is a movie you want to watch that is based on a book, read the book first. That is what I did with Harry Potter. I watch the movies because I am a fan of the book but I enjoy the book more.|`|AA11975543	I am scientific person and I hate reading unless mathematics,physics, chemistry , biology ,.... and Quran kareem is the most lovely reading to my heart because I feeling with happyness , satifaction ,and superiority over any thing from divels. I want to obologise and say sorry to you because I cann't give useful answer for your question.|`|Q4MqzxX7aa	Practice. Don't read something that doesn't interest you or that is too difficult it will only make reading more of a chore than a pleasure.<br>  <br>  The moe you read the better you will get. Just start reading thing like you are reading your taste will change with age.|`|6kD5euncaa	Books are portals into the abstract and fantastic , and all the while somehow we're emotionally omnipresent through the story just like in real life . Amazing isn't it !

Try books of different genres that sound at least slightly interesting to you. <br>  <br>  Here are some recommendations: <br>  <br>  Maximum Ride series (some romance)<br>  Pendragon (some romance)|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Dear minz, practice reading is the best advice I can offer. And read what you enjoy. There is nothing wrong with that. Every book you read will lead to other books which will lead to other books. One of these days without realizing it, you will just grow tired of what you always read and move on to something else.<br>  <br>  One example is Tale of Two Cities by Dickens. This would not be like Twilight but it is one of the most tragic and romantic love stories of all time. So is Great Expectations by Dickens.<br>  <br>  And there is no law that says you can't go on reading what you like. I think you will graduate from Twilight because you seem to want to, but say Meyer comes out with another trilogy. You know I really started out with Stephen King and finally his books just ceased to interest me, but I read one recently called Dreamcatcher which was like the old King. I read it and really enjoyed it. I think King is a good writer, not just a horror writer, and I enjoy him. If you enjoy Meyer you should read her. But in time without you realizing it your tastes will change and one book will lead to another, an author will lead to another etc.

be41d7db52515f484bafe88d6e575aadaa	Here are your answers, but you should really read these books.  It was great fun to read, much better fun than reading the answers.<br>  <br>  Bella won't move because she is in love with Edward, and does not want anything more in her life than to be with him.  Her mom lives in Florida, but she just got re-married, and Bella doesn't want to get in the way.  Her dad lives in vampire town, and there don't seem to be too many other relatives for a teenager to live with.  Bella won't move away even if she could, because she loves Edward and would die for him.  So, no moving.<br>  <br>  Bella knows that she is an attractive dish for Edward.  Meaning he would drink her blood in a second if he loses self control.  But she also knows that he loves her and will try really hard not to kill her.   Yes, he loves her, but he has an almost irresistible urge to drink her blood.  Gross.<br>  <br>  Her dad has no idea that her BF is a vampire, for sure through the Twilight book.  (You have to read all the books to find out more; it's interesting.)<br>  <br>  Bella knows that Edward is a vampire, after about 1/4 of the way through the book.<br>  <br>  Now, go read it.  It's a fast read, and you won't regret it.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	You are at the upper end of the target audience. 14 is really a bit too old for happily-ever-after books. Reading it wouldn't hurt you - but if you are used to reading books for age 14 and up you'll probably be pretty disappointed.<br>  <br>  Now for your questions:<br>  <br>  if there are so many vampiers in that area and they all want to kill her.....so why dose she not just move.<br>  <br>  Because then the plot wouldn't work. (This is a repeated theme through the book for why things happen. There's no reason except that the author wanted them to happen.)<br>  <br>  does bella know that edward wants to kill her??<br>  <br>  Yup. He tells her so repeatedly.<br>  <br>  she is in love right?does edward love her too?if so then why does he want to kill her.<br>  <br>  It adds wangst to the plot. "Forbidden love!" the fangirls cry.<br>  <br>  does her father know that her daughter's BF is a vampire?he lets the vampire have her?<br>  <br>  I think he finds out eventually. Of course he lets him have her - everyone gets everything they want. It's a happily-ever-after story.<br>  <br>  does bella know that edward is a vampire?<br>  <br>  Yup.|`|AA10414775	edward dosent want to kill her, he wants to keep a distance because he likes the scent of her blood....<br>  <br>  they are both in love...<br>  <br>  bella's father doesnt know that edward is a vampire...<br>  <br>  bella does know that edward is a vampire...|`|sEMVoJccaa	no Edward doesn't want to kill Bella he is trying to protect her. she loves him and he does love her, Bella does figure out that Edward is a vampire. not sure if her dad knows anything about Edward's family at all. Bella does learn more about Edward's family and where he was born though|`|C5XOLsf6aa	Um no, Edward does not wish to kill her.<br>  And there isn't really a place she could live besides Forks.<br>  Yes, she is in love and he returns it.<br>  No, Charlie her father is not aware that Edward is infact a vampire, and Bella does. That's a huge part of the story.|`|AA11895897	First.. how do you even know all this if you havent read the book?<br>  Anyway... Edward and his family are "vegitarian" vapires, they only feed off of animals. Bella's blood smells so good to Edward that he wants to eat her and yes she knows that hes a vampire. They fall in love though and thro spending time together Edward numbs the erge to drink her blood.  The reason why he wants to protect her is because shes really accident prone and because he loves her of course. The reason why Bella doesnt move is because shes in love with edward... duh!  Her father doesnt get the hint that Edward is a vampire until the 4th book  and yes he does let her go at the end. Edward and bella get married and right before Bella gets vamped, she gets prego and that process is intresting you should read the books. <br>  <br>  Also.... There are werewolves in this book... more vamps... crazy vamps... atempted suicides... chases... and crazy supernatural powers... Stephenine Meyers did a great job with this series of books... and even though you think your too "mature" to read these books... they are good.|`|OMYd6p3gaa	he liked the smell of her blood. So he was tempted to get a taste, but he hasnt killed a human in a long time. <br>  Edwards special talent is that he can read minds, but for some reason he cant read Bellas, so he becomes her friend in an attempt to read hers, but he is unsucessfull. <br>  The only vampires that LIVE in the area are Edwards family, most of them can control themselves, but Edward's brother, Jasper, has the hardest time. <br>  These vampires are "vegetarians" which means that they only drink animal blood, but they are tempted by Bella's blood because it smells so good to them. They are good vampires who do not hurt any human beings.<br>  They are both in love with eachother. Edward doesnt want to kill her, he is just tempted to get a taste of her. <br>  Bella asks if he is a vampire, he confirms. <br>  Her father does not know Edward is a vampire, he knows there is something odd in the 4th book, but he never 100% knows for sure. <br>  <br>  I hope this clarifys things for you!|`|aJ7vLOrpaa	Oh my gosh, this is just stupid. The book is for ANYONE who wants to read it, ' mature ' [ as you say you your self are. ] & ' immature.' But honestly, if you your self are so ' mature ' then get over yourself and read the book. It s a very good book, i guess your just one of those people that deliberately go against the flow. Geeze. <br>  <br>  First of all, Bella is in L O V E with Edward so she doesn't want to move, plus she has no where else to go she feels. Bella KNOWS that Edward want to kill her because he tells her in the book. Edward is in love with her too, its pretty obvious and he loves her more than anything and everything in the world combined BUT her blood is the most tempting, its like his brand of heroin [ and you would understand the quote if you wern't so stubborn and read the book. ] but, Edward is a 'vegetarian' vampire and only drink the blood of animals, like his family, plus he Loves her so he restrains from drinking her blood because of that. Charlie CAN'T know because he'd alret the authorities e.t.c and they would be chansed away when they aren't doing anything wrong, they don't even drink from humans. OF COURSE BELLA KNOWSS ! READ THE BOOK FOR GODS SAKE !|`|cGRVB6N9aa	Okay, well there's been 3 books since the first book "Twilight". Your question seems to be based upon the first book only, which leads me to believe you don't know of the existence of the others? In the fist book, yes Edward does want to Kill Bella. He finds her smell irresistible. He holds back however and then develops a thing for her, later on falling in love with her. He reveals to Bella that he is a vampire and she accepts him as he is. He resists the urge to kill her on a daily basis. Bella doesn't want to move away from Forks as that is is where it is bearable for the Cullen family to live as it's raining on most days. The more cloudy the place they live in is, the more they're able to be outside in public. Her dad at first does not know that she is dating a vampire but in the last book her friend Jacob reveals to him that something strange is going on with Bella and her dad chooses to not know the details. Hope this helps :)|`|cbWfIKaYaa	Edward is VERY attracted to the scent of Bella's blood and because he is a vampire he does have that instinct to kill her, but does not because he does love her. Bella knows he is a vampire and doesn't leave because she loves Edward. Her dad does not know Edward and his family are vampires, or else I'm sure he would get her the heck out of there.<br>  <br>  I thought these books would be immature as well, but I read them and I am 21. I did enjoy them and know many people who are older than me who enjoyed the series very much. There are places you can read it online for free. I think if you read it you would understand it much more easily. You don't have to be so mature all the time, you are only 14 and have YEARS of time to act like an adult, be a teenager while you can.

854xeaRvaa	Wordsworth is a romantic poet, pantheistic, the son of nature and his poetry has a very transcendental tendency and sincere pathos, descriptive mostly. he was sensitive, introspective, was the dear friend to another brilliant poet called coleridge , the french revolution influenced him tremendously and had one affair with a french woman and fathered a child out of wedlock , unlike the rather wild life of his friend, he had a higher sense of morality. was influenced a lot by milton, shakespeare, Goethe, david Hartley and off course Coleridge who took him under his wing. <br>  <br>  the controversies where as keats said the tendency of ''egotistical sublime'' that's a self absorption in oneself and divinizing every impulse of his nature.<br>  <br>  well , wikipedia is an obvious one, spark notes is helpful in the analysis of some of his major works like the Prelude, lines written few miles above Westminster abbey and ode to immortality. i guess the best poem is the one the beginns with i heard a thousand blended notes and the world is too much with us.
bjNgMocPaa	Are you talking about the First Fleet?<br>  <br>  Yes, they do teach us about the First Fleet in school.<br>  They tell us that the Europeans were convicts and were sent here to build colonies, because the jail systems in England were overcrowded.

Many of the 'convicts' were convicted of 'crimes' that wouldn't even get you a fine these days, and many of the criminals were political 'agitators' from Ireland and Scotland. What's more, many of the convicts became free men, and lived prosperous, successful lives and created the British colony which became Australia. <br>  <br>  As for the notion that Australians are racist, I believe the vast majority are not. There's racism in every country, but Australia's modern population is built around migration, and was one of the first countries to really embrace multiculturalism (whether it worked or not is another matter!).

Own them all and have reread them thrice now. JK Rowling gave us something new, fresh and original with lots of humour, thrills and chills and some genuine pathos. Rowling was also quite spot on in the way she described Harry's [and others] journey from innocent childhood to strong young adult [well on the verge of it really].<br>  Yes, there was a LOT of hype, both good and bad, over the books but they deserved it. Of course there were a few errors, no book is perfect and some few things p*ssed me off, but still well worth the read for anyone, old or young.<br>  Hope she can do something completely new but wonder if she'll ever be able to "recreate" something like the HP series.

Life, a fullfilling one, can benefit from an ebb & flow of both.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	I know that some ideas can be difficult to accurately capture in words. But from what I gather, you are looking at striving to create a physical self (i.e. striving for gain - materialistically, financially, etc.) vs. doing nothing except just being and becoming internally content. <br>  <br>  I feel in life there must be a balance. For example, you cannot live entirely in your head without striving for something or you will die - i.e. if you don't do what you need to in order to have food (grow and harvest or work for money and buy it), you will die! <br>  <br>  I think we all must strive, in some shape or form, in this life. But you don't always have to strive for self-gain. You can also strive to help others - doing acts that are selfless and done simply for the benefit of others. Also, if you find true peace and never strive to share it with anyone, than does it just live and die with you? Perhaps strive to engage, discuss with, support and teach others and help them find peace, greater meaning, etc. as well.<br>  <br>  I think that as a human being, we all must strive in some way. It does not have to be for material, financial, or any selfish gain, but even the most enlightened ones strived to help others, to teach and discuss, and share their knowledge.|`|f95837e2c58a8931580191a2a6bfe0d2aa	Not striving for or to be anything, you first become nothing, and when you accept becoming nothing, THEN you are everything.|`|J9AvKefwaa	no one has to strive for anything and no one has to be anything or everything, all you need to be is you and just BE. life is about being, that is all.|`|AA11736322	Of every event in our life it is only for a moment that we can say that it is; after that we must say for ever that it was.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...no, the individual continues to be confused...<br>  ...dreams, goals are imaginary until one takes action...<br>  ...to excel requires commitment, research, learning, practice, and experience...<br>  ...to accomplish ones goal...<br>  ...stay focus...|`|A01w1dHqaa	You are already everything.

There are no words for some things. Eastern philosophy approaches these concepts with phrases that seem like paradoxes, but they are not so much paradoxes as a way of pointing to a higher meaning as converging lines on a horizon express distance in a two dimensional framework.

The purpose of our being, in my view, for instance, is to live, to be truly happy and successful, something that we constantly seek, and strive for in life being our selves. But without striving to be anything, or being anything in particular, we would indeed be aiming for being everything, just about anything, or nothing at all, depending upon the stronger purposes of other beings around us that find their utility in us. <br>  <br>  The concept I see has a ring of passive mysticism about it, as a desire for total submission to reach a state of unison with all that exists, a state of oneness with being, with I fear has a real risk of losing oneself within the grand totality of being, purposeless.<br>  <br>  I think the best way to be everything is in learning to be our self, for if we know just one thing well enough in the world, then by the same principle we could know everything. Instead of being everything, and thereupon knowing nothing, I for instance, would rather strive to be myself and know something at least. I still do not seem to answer the question fully, because I think if I did, the answer would eliminate the need of the question, as then it will become the question in its own right, just as the question would have become the answer.|`|bdttDnlwaa	I agree and I love reading you.

RjeIQybPaa	Well, I don't think you are wrong. The reward could be anything, my drive/motivation is my curiosity for new things, so my reward would be to see new places and experience new things. I think you are very right in your statement, I don't see how you think you are wrong.<br>  For evey person it would be different, but it's the same principal.|`|ccU0SigRaa	I can't refute this claim, but I do not think that this is the best phrasing. I'd contend to say that "we act in an effort to receive a reaction", it removes the connotations attached to reward and motivation. I agree with you however, we only act in ways that we will receive a reaction. <br>  <br>  E.G. you ask someone a question (act), you receive an answer (reaction). You do what your parents ask (act), you receive praise (reaction), or at worst a neutral reaction. Should you start to act and receive no reactions from anything, then there is no motivation to act in the first place.<br>  <br>  "there are many many acts of selflessness that are not rewarded and even if they are afterwards it doesn't take away the motivation of the act." - I have to disagree with this claim. No act is without selfishness, if you save someones life you feel like you have done a good deed to that person, that is the reward. If you give someone food if they are starving on the street, again you receive a "moral reward" a reaffirming that you are doing "good" things and you are a good person.<br>  <br>  "So does all good stem from evil or just in your mind? Why does a flower bloom when there's nothing to gain but seed? Why does food taste good what does it have to gain from being eaten?" - again I must contend to this statement. You are referring to objects that simply exist, the question is with regards to motivation and reward. A plant doesn't choose to grow, its structure demands it and forces it. I think the question is with regards only to beings with consciousness. The "reward" for a plant to grow is to continue its existence (plants were given a response because they are at least, a living thing, food is not at the time of consumption [in most cases]).<br>  <br>  "Its actually backwards... leading psychologist now believe that 100% of our actions are based on the fear of dying, and the fear of dying alone!

ceBTTCPwaa	One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (Russian: Один день Ивана Денисовича Odin den' Ivana Denisovicha) is a novel written by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, first published in November 1962 in the Soviet literary magazine Novy Mir (New World). The story is set in a Soviet labour camp in the 1950s, and describes a single day of an ordinary prisoner, Ivan Denisovich Shukhov. Its publication was an extraordinary event in Soviet literary history—never before had an account of "Stalinist repression" been openly distributed. The editor of Novy Mir, Aleksandr Tvardovsky, wrote a short introduction for the issue, titled "Instead of a Foreword," to prepare the journal's readers for what they were about to experience.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/One_Day_in_the_Life_of_Ivan_Denisovich" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/One_Day_in_the_L...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/ivan/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/ivan/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/denisovich/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/denisovich...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-135.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmIvan02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/denisovich/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a>

AjqO1aJgaa	I've watched Star Wars. I didn't see any more similarities with Eragon than you get with any other standard fantasy novel. You need to be aware of the difference between things sharing a genre and things copying one another. Star Wars and Eragon share a genre. It's the same basic story as things like Princess Diaries - is that a ripoff of Star Wars too? "Boy/girl discovers they have an important destiny" wasn't invented by Star Wars by any means.<br>  <br>  That said, I never got all the way through Eragon - I found it pretty much deathly dull.|`|QlB3VXWraa	I never got the impression the Eragon was similar to Star Wars but I wouldn't be surprised. But everybody borrows ideas. Star Wars borrowed heavily from Dune. The desert planet, spice smugglers, the evil empire were all ripped off from Dune. The military priesthood of the Jedi was modeled off the Bene Gesserit.<br>  <br>  But I like Star Wars anyhow and I liked the first two episodes of Eragon.

qrkaEMe2aa	The Harry Potter series certainly encompasses a much broader world than The Twilight Saga does and therefore has a wider subject matter. It deals with an entire world of magic, whereas Twilight is more focused on the love story between Bella and Edward, rather than the lives of the vampires. <br>  In my opinion, the Harry Potter books are far superior to the Twilight books in many aspects. They're more complex, better written and, on the whole, a lot more interesting. Whilst Twilight is good enough for the teenage market, the love story isn't very realistic and very ott. Harry Potter, on the other hand, is an attractive read for both children and adults who enjoy imaginative works. I doubt you'll be disappointed.|`|byCrVwh0aa	I've read both books and i can understand why people would find harry potter childish but keep in mind that it is a series following a person from childhood, through his teenage years and into adulthood.

Yes they are essentially children's books and therefore there will obviously be child like incidents and moments in the book, but it all works together to give you a proper grasp of the characters,  if you do decide to read the series it is exactly this element that helps you "grow up" with the characters. Rowling is also an excellent writer, if you read the books you'll notice this by the subtle hints she leaves in the earlier books about things to follow.<br>  <br>  In Comparison with Twilight, I preferred Harry Potter. I thought the concept of Twilight was very good but Meyer lacked the raw writing talent to make it brilliant and her characters lacked depth.<br>  <br>  I'll suggest you read Harry Potter and make up your own mind without being influenced by your friends' opinions of the books, if after the first book you don't like it, you can always find something else to read, just keep in mind that as the books progress the characters get older and so does Rowling's target audience.|`|e4067f6bd29072f4b98c388ae450ba75aa	I have read both series several times and I'm 42.  They are both great.  I think it all boils down to imagination.

y8bFwXZEaa	Rainbow is right. Theresa is right about time, not about space.<br>  <br>  Time is our conscious method of relating our consciousness to cause and effect, and motion. Space exists because two entities with metaphysically equal measurements cannot occupy the same place within existence--there must be "space" between them.<br>  <br>  "Space" however, does not exist outside of the physical boundaries of the universe. When all matter was a huge mass that would eventually blow up in the "big bang," there was no space outside of that huge mass. Outside of what "exists," nothing exists, not even nothingness.<br>  <br>  That is hard to understand until you have given it some thought, and then some people never understand it. But before "time" there was no life to have consciousness of movement; before "space" there was a huge mass and all "space" was inside of it, just as all space is now inside of what that huge mass became.<br>  <br>  There never was a time when "nothingness" existed in reified form. That is an impossiblity.<br>  <br>  "Existence is a self-sufficient primary. It is not a product of a supernatural dimension, or of anything else. There is nothing antecedent to existence, nothing apart from it—and no alternative to it. Existence exists—and only existence exists. Its existence and its nature are irreducible and unalterable.<br>  <br>   Leonard Peikoff “The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy,”<br>  Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, 148<br>  <a href="http://www.aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/existence.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/ex...</a>|`|XuUMXQ8Naa	You think because from your experience and that which you have been told that things have a beginning, middle and end.<br>  However, why should that be?<br>   Also, why should it be in that order?<br>  Perhaps the random chemical and minerals which made up the Big Bang may have always just been here and even when the universe is gone, they may  always just be here.<br>  For no reason!<br>  I think it will probably look a bit black and twinkly!|`|vAdtlZDpaa	Space and time are both relative illusions, neither of which really exist except in your perspective, so the question is irrelavant. <br>  <br>  Ancient religions (hinduism, for one) teach that the universerse has always existed, beginning with the big bank, expanding, and then after eons contracting, and shrinking back into a tiny dot from which it explodes again into another universe, much like the cycle of life here on here on Earth.|`|ukASnhn5aa	To tell the truth: NOBODY knows<br>  <br>  The big bang theory only attempts to explain the universe AFTER the explosion<br>  <br>  Quote:''Surrounding that small piece''<br>  Outside the universe, there is no space, no time, nothing NOTHING<br>  The start and end of this universe we will never know for sure|`|hyB0OQFjaa	GOD!|`|VdcKrxthaa	not sure

eY3SWMdqaa	Dang...I wish I would remember. My mom teaches the book! But, she is an enlgish professor and always tells me that every story does not have to have a moral. It can have a theme, or just be for pure entertainment. Sometimes readers can pick out morals on their own that the author did not intend on plotting. See what I am saying? So, if you are looking for a moral for a class you are taking or something along those lines, than ask yourself this...what did you learn from the story? THAT is the moral my dear!|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	The Great Gatsby is the ONLY book I have EVER read, that doesn't contain a moral.  None of the characters have morals, no revelation occurs.  Everyone just lays around, keeping secrets from their friends, cousins, and wives, and then some people die, other people continue lying around, even though they could have stopped some truly horrible events... and that's the end.<br>  <br>  If I had to make up a moral for THAT story though, I guess it would be: <br>  <br>  "Don't covet what you can't have"  Or: <br>  <br>  "Not all that glitters is gold".

AA12343309	Yes, Pakistan was part of India.  When the British started to pull out of India, a civil war broke out between Hindus and Muslims.   A peace was brokered by creating Pakistan, West Pakistan on the far western border of India and East Pakistan on the far eastern border of India.<br>  Millions of people pulled up roots and moved to either a Hindu part or the Muslim part.  West and East Pakistan was one country with the capital in West Pakistan.  The people of East Pakistan, who were separated from West Pakistan by thousands of miles, felt it was  to their advantage to break off and start their own nation. That is how Bangladesh came into existence.  It had formerly been East Pakistan.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_o...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Pakistan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Pakist...</a><br>  <br>  I heard someone who has his own news program on a cable outlet refer to a Pakistani as an Arab.  A lot of people do not understand that not all Muslims are Arabs and not all Arabs are Muslim.<br>  There are still some few Muslims in India and some few Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh.|`|tCOrcOK0aa	they are teh same|`|xZiYJBKZaa	I am not sure about this because I am not of Pakisitani or Indian descent. If somebody's parents and grandparents are from India, but they live in Pakistan, then they are probably ethnically Indian but their nationality is Pakistani. However, it would probably depend if their Indian relatives are from the north or south part of India. If they are from the north, they might look light because they are farther away from the equator or the sun. They also might be because a lot of Northern Indians have British in them.

AA10648704	Many different things were wrapped within his bandages, for one.  There would have been different jewels, golden scarabs, and other artifacts which were supposed to bring him safely into the afterlife.  He was actually buried with more than one death mask--the one you normally see, plus a less ornate one.  He was also buried in several sarcophagi, which nested one inside the other like Russian dolls.  Along with what was in the sarcophagus itself, there were huge amounts of treasure buried with him, including walking canes, a chariot, furniture, statues, containers of precious oils, anything he could possibly want or need in the afterlife.  Even his two stillborn children were buried with him.  When it was discovered in the 1920's it was the only undisturbed tomb that had been found.  There have since been a few, including the tomb of the golden mummies, but none have contained the type of riches that Tutankhammun had.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Actually in the sarcophagus, not the tomb itself?

xGI9z01Maa	Destiny is the lie that we are told when someone wants to control us.  <br>  <br>  Was it Queen Elizabeth's II destiny to be Queen?  It might have been her birth right to be Queen but she could have given it up like her Uncle Edward VIII did when he wished to marry Wallis Simpson.  She would have turn down the crown.  She has been a good Queen over all since 1952 but she did not have to be a good Queen.  <br>  <br>  Therefore, I don't believe in destiny so much as having chooses and making them which changes our life.  Even the little chooses between a Big Mac or a Salad.  One Big Mac might not hurt you, but the choose to go to MacDonald's instead of the salad with add calories to your daily count and if you add enough calories, then you will get fat.  Or if you have to across the street to get that Big Mac instead of staying on the other side of the street where you could have gotten that salad and you get hit by a car that puts you in a wheel chair, do you blame yourself for wanting a Big Mac or the person driving the car?  But it was a choose that changed your life not destiny.|`|fngNzTXQaa	you cant change it but if u think u know what is going to happen then maybe u r wrong ur life may take an unexpected turn which could change ur life to they way u always wanted to so don't give up if thing aren't going ur way cause if u think u have hit rock bottom then there is noewhere to go but up so wat ever u do dont give up on ur self!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|JpfBoRggaa	only if you become conscious. otherwise, you are a machine. a machine you are born, a machine you will die.<br>  or, as jesus said, dust RETURNS to dust.|`|bS5wpKvOaa	There is no destiny to change, unless your mind is made up.|`|uYtV3WrPaa	Our fate is inevitable.|`|bZA3TntMaa	Of course not.|`|7bcQ9Xemaa	i don't think so but we can change what we do on our way there|`|aOy01jFEaa	I think destiny is defined as a man's purpose of existence. Although it maybe conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual.<br>  It is yet still changeable by choice.<br>  Unlike fate whereas it never leaves us not a choice to make. For it is known as inevitable too.<br>  <br>  Therefore, yes destiny can possibly shift  (or change) by the choices or judgements we may make.|`|AA12079397	We can change our destiny by bringing new spirits to us. While we are inviting the new we must be very careful with the old.|`|2PDBxlYDaa	Yes. When you are born you have no choice over your parents and the country and city that you were born into. That is why some believe in fate. I call it randomness, fortunately as you get older you realize that although you came into this world through serendipity there is a lot that you can do to forge your own destiny through your actions.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Good or bad we make our own destiny...whether you follow a faith or not doesn't matter, man has free will, so destiny as preordained does not exist IMO,|`|500d6fc36eb98b82443dc02f01ab5214aa	I agree with the beautiful flower girl jeannie!<br>  <br>  Although we have free will we can be influence, or guided by those whom know what's best for us from those on the other side as well.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I don't think so.

Fnp2MIycaa	No the trenches were far from comfortable.<br>  Apart from being shot and killed the problems were -<br>  <br>  Rats in their millions infested trenches. Gorging themselves on human remains (grotesquely disfiguring them by eating their eyes and liver) they could grow to the size of a cat. A single rat couple could produce up to 900 offspring in a year, spreading infection and contaminating food.<br>  <br>  Lice were a never-ending problem, breeding in the seams of filthy clothing and causing men to itch unceasingly. Lice caused Trench Fever, a particularly painful disease that began suddenly with severe pain followed by high fever.  Recovery - away from the trenches - took up to twelve weeks. <br>  <br>  Frogs by the score were found in shell holes covered in water; they were also found in the base of trenches.  Slugs and horned beetles crowded the sides of the trench.<br>  <br>  Trench Foot was another medical condition peculiar to trench life.  It was a fungal infection of the feet caused by cold, wet and unsanitary trench conditions.  It could turn gangrenous and result in amputation. <br>  <br>  The appalling reek given off by numerous conflicting sources.<br>  Rotting carcases lay around in their thousands.  For example, approximately 200,000 men were killed on the Somme battlefields, many of which lay in shallow graves. <br>  <br>  Overflowing latrines would similarly give off a most offensive stench.<br>  <br>  Men who had not been afforded the luxury of a bath in weeks or months would offer the pervading odour of dried sweat.  The feet were generally accepted to give off the worst odour.<br>  <br>  Trenches would also smell of creosol or chloride of lime, used to stave off the constant threat of disease and infection.<br>  <br>  Add to this the smell of cordite, the lingering odour of poison gas, rotting sandbags, stagnant mud, cigarette smoke and cooking food.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	It was different for each side.<br>  The Germans built deep, underground concrete bunkers, called Stollen for the troops to use when they were not on duty or fighting; they were particularly useful for waiting out Allied artillery bombardments. They had proper beds and ventilation,so were relatively dry and comfortable<br>   The British and French, on the other hand, lived in the basic trenches dug in the mud. These filled with water when it rained, and men just slept where they were..Even officers only had recesses scraped out from the side of the trenches to sleep in. So, for the Allies, it was very uncomfortable.<br>   Second and third line trenches, being under enemy fire less and not in the front line, were wider and deeper and therefore more comfortable, but only reserve troops occupied these..|`|nfUomw3caa	Hell, No! Mud when it rained, dirt when it didn't, rats, dead bodies, no toilets, snipers trying to kill you if they got a glimpse of your helmet.

Dose that sound like good fun, and comfortable.<br>  <br>  Although some suicide bombers might think that's comfortable.

zN6CJ3tzaa	My best advice: go to a drag or cabaret club and talk to some of the performers. Be honest with them and tell them what you're interested in doing. Many of them will give you tips and tricks. <br>  <br>  In college, I had a drag queen for a roommate. Honestly, she was the like the mother I never had. Noting like waking up in the morning to the sound of Barbara Streisand singing "Pretty Women", with a 300 pound bald man in half-drag and wearing a floral caftan, lipsyncing with a spatula as his microphone. <br>  <br>  Even though I'm a girl, he took me under his proverbial wing and taught me how best to work with what I had and enhance it. Makeup, clothes, hair -- the works. Being a big girl in drag, he truly knew how to make himself look good and helped me out a great deal.<br>  <br>  Just like they said in To Wong Foo -- "Nothing this pretty could be real..." It's true. Men that dress in drag have to work hard to look as good as they do, and there are tons of women that could use a few lessons from them -- myself included!<br>  <br>  I just thought of another idea -- watch RuPaul's Drag Race show! It is really incredible to see the transformation of some of the performers like Nina Flowers, Ongina, Bebe Zahara Benet, Rebecca Glasscock -- <a href="http://www.logoonline.com/shows/dyn/rupauls_drag_race/videos.jhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.logoonline.com/shows/dyn/rupa...</a><br>  Trust me, it's incredible!!! They are absolutely fabulous!<br>  <br>  In your position and for what you'd like to do -- make a big ol' drag queen your very best friend!! Cross dressers tend to just look like men in women's clothing. A drag queen would be able to offer and teach you the best outcome.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I wish you all the best!
pjcjWBGpaa	The British Empire as it existed in the late 1800's and early 1900's does not exist anymore. As the old Empire went on, more problems arose with it and it turned out to be more of an economic burden than asset, so over a period of a few decades, territories were granted independence, as well as because of the rise of nationalism in these territories. It is more a commonwealth now, though countries with our Head of State (the Queen) are self-governed, such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada. We currently have a few carribbean islands, such as the Cayman Islands, the Falklands, the British Virgin Islands, etc., but it is nowhere near an Empire anymore since free trade operates between all countries in and outside the Commonwealth.|`|J3QrxrYhaa	It doesn't exist now.

y8bFwXZEaa	He is considered, along with Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and Averroes ( ibn Rushd in the Middle East), to be one of the major figures of medieval thought and was at the centre of the major intellectual and political controversies of the fourteenth century. (WikiP)<br>  <br>  Historically, Ockham has been cast as the outstanding opponent of Thomas Aquinas (1224-1274): Aquinas perfected the great “medieval synthesis” of faith and reason and was canonized by the Catholic Church; Ockham destroyed the synthesis and was condemned by the Catholic Church. Although it is true that Aquinas and Ockham disagreed on most issues, Aquinas had many other critics, and Ockham did not criticize Aquinas any more than he did others. It is fair enough, however, to say that Ockham was a major force of change at the end of the Middle Ages. He was a courageous man with an uncommonly sharp mind. His philosophy was radical in his day and continues to provide insight into current philosophical debates.<br>  <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/o/ockham.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.iep.utm.edu/o/ockham.htm</a><br>  <br>  "Ockhamism" is currently applied by neoscholastic writers as a blanket designation for a great variety of late mediaeval and early modern attitudes such as are destructive of the metaphysical principles of Thomism, even though they may not be directly traceible to Ockham's own writings. <br>  <a href="http://www.ditext.com/runes/o.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ditext.com/runes/o.html</a>
mzNLfY4Caa	Okay I am pretty sure you have this in the Philippines. You have two options. If you feel comfortable enough, you can use Acrylic paints. They are very fast drying and since it is a polymer it dries up - plastic like. Another option you have is fabric paint. I don't know what the texture is but I would stick with acrylic paint. The fabric glue will only stay permanently if you actually glue it on fabric. The glue is only for fibers, but if you glue it on to a leathery plastic surface, I doubt it would stay on for long. My suggestion is Acrylic paint, some popular brands are liquitex. <br>  <br>  Look up art stores in your area and any art store will carry acrylic. <br>  <br>  =] Have fun painting!!|`|f03976a153802da6a244397db068fdeaaa	oil paints....
1vfockYEaa	It is a great book. One of my favorite books by Austen. You will be introduced to the late 18th century and the early 19th century. You will take a look at how women thought and behaved then. What is the perfect man and marriage are to them. You will enjoy the development of Mr.Darcy's character. You will be shocked at the naivete and shallowness of some of the characters. <br>  <br>  Some thinks that the classics are boring. This one will never leave you bored. I read it over five times, each time took me only a day!|`|KCpGsN2faa	It's one of my favorite books. The movie with Keira Knightley isn't too shabby, but the book is definitely better.

lUsLBUXRaa	If nothing ever comes of this script, then you do not have to pay any kind of royalties for the songs. If you are planning of pursuing this further than the writing stage, there are many other things you need to worry about:<br>  <br>  1. Are you going to try to sell your script or just make it yourself? If you are going to try selling it, do not copyright it (that scream amateur). Contact an agent who handles screenplays. <br>  <br>  2. If you are filming it yourself, you will need to license the songs. This can be pricey--notice how independent movies generally have lesser known songs in the soundtrack? Their budget does not allow more.<br>  <br>  3. If you do by chance sell your script and a studio decides to move forward with production, realize that you will have little to no control over what songs are put in the movie. The music supervisor will do that regardless of what songs you mention in your script.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: What stops agents from stealing your idea? Well, first, agents are incredibly busy people; even if they think your idea is worthy of stealing, they will not have to time to do it. Second, they see a lot of material-I know everyone thinks theirs is the script that is worthy of stealing, but it is not. Even if it is amazing, any agent worth their salt will ask you to be their client, not try to steal your work. <br>  <br>  Intellectual property laws will cover your work. Don't worry about it. Just make sure you research any agents you are looking to submit to; as long as they have a good track record you know you are working with a legitimate person. <br>  <br>  If you copyright your work and an agent does decide to take you on, it will make the acquisitions process much more difficult.<br>  <br>  (One last bit: you cannot copyright an idea anyway, only exact words. So copyrighting your script will not stop people from stealing the idea IF they really wanted to.)|`|qThmcR1Aaa	You would have to pay to license the music. Look up the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for more information, but for starters, you'd want to contact the publisher of the music in question and make sure you can even get permission to use it. Some artists simply refuse to let their music be used.<br>  <br>  It's "copyright," btw.<br>  <br>  Good luck ...|`|cBltTxPyaa	Thanks for posting this, I never knew it, but apparently I have the same issue. <br>  <br>  My movie completely centers around music.. so I guess I'll have to drop all the song names I put in and just focus on the story.<br>  <br>  Because after all, that's whats gonna grab a reader - a great story.  :)
renZ4mvWaa	If your main character is in school, maybe there could be "fact posters" up around the building featuring people who have made a difference in the world.

Also, I am not a fan of poems that rhyme because it always seems forced, especially simple rhymes like this. This poem is very cliche. What makes it different from every other "love" poem? You used words like sad, but so what? Why not dig deeper, if there is a deeper. I have heard a million poems like this, mourning over a loved one. If you want your poem to be good make it different.

xv0ovZ63aa	Aw, first poem! Congrats~<br>  <br>  It's a thoughtful poem that obviously marks your experiences with friends. Poetry, once written, should not be altered because of 'grammatical mistakes' or stuff like that. I believe that makes it mechanical. What you wrote is your heart. No one can change that (as cheesy as my last statement sounds, keep the poem you have)... It's nice how you allude to a friend in the last line after describing friends. It's a signature mark. You obviously regret losing a friend and it shows.<br>  <br>  Please continue writing. It's a wonderful ability and you'll flourish with time!!<br>  And as far as submitting it in, go ahead! People are bound to relate to you.

79YQAbSRaa	Historical fiction authors vary on their need for accuracy, so it might not be the best way to gather facts.<br>  <br>  There's been a lot of historical fiction that led me to read a number of non-fiction books on the same subject.  So I'd say it's a great way to create interest.<br>  <br>  Reading older literature can also give you a feel for a certain period.  Mark Twain and Jules Verne can give you an insiders look at the late 19th century, while Jane Austen can provide perspective on the late 18th and early 19th centuries.|`|AA11564934	In a general sense it can be.  But you have to be careful in separating fact from fiction which seems easy, but can be quite difficult if you aren't also reading non-fiction.<br>  <br>  It's like historical movies,  they often do things strictly to entertain like have a love interest that may never have existed, etc...|`|hQ95u9OLaa	CM, i assume you mean historical fiction, maybe along the lines of Lincoln by Gore Vidal or Tale of Two Cities by Dickens. If so, yes, you can learn about history from good historical fiction. But you should check on events in the book that the author presents. Are they accurate? An author's task is to tell a story not report history. I love historical fiction but I know it's not history. Having said that, you can check books, journals, the internet for confirmation; anything will give you the true story and then these books will lead to different books and pretty soon you are learning about history by having started with literature.<br>  <br>  Movies are the same way: really good examples are 1997's Elizabeth with Cate Blanchett which seemed really historically accurate to me. I wanted to know more about Geoffrey Rush's character Walsingham. Well the movie got some of it right but made some really glaring errors about that historical figure. But I learned something about him by seeing the movie first.<br>  <br>  Lawrence of Arabia is another good example. The movie compresses events and characters to tell the story but it is still a good jumping-off point to begin a study about the Arab revolt against the Turks during WWI.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	It depends on the author.  James Michener is (in)famous for doing his homework.  He researches his subjects so thoroughly that reading something like "Hawaii" is like reading it's History.  The same with John Jakes and Gore Vidal.  Reading their novels about America gives a much better picture of American life in the time frames that they describe.|`|bY149rq5aa	Yea; sure it is! It'll give you a better understanding about what historic figures from whatever time period were trying to say.. So definitely!|`|pbw7chpyaa	It is an easier way. Always keep in mind though, literature tells you more about the period a book was written, than the one it was written about.

They are not some sort of robot; they are a human too and cleaning up your table helps someone else during their day. <br>  <br>  What is so bad about helping someone else out? Many are too selfish to do this; if it doesn't somehow benefit themself they won't do it, and will come up with a reason why. <br>  <br>  Yah, there are employees there getting paid minimum wage to keep the restaurant going, but these employees are human just like the rest of us, and not one patron is any better than any person working their, no matter what they might think. <br>  <br>  A little act of selfless kindness for the benefit of someone other than yourself can go a long way.|`|AA10729675	It is a custom more than anything else.

y8bFwXZEaa	The sum of the parts is greater than the whole. This translates into the metaphysics that consciousness is a product of the brain; but the mind is a product of one's useful will of consciousness.<br>  <br>  Of course the brain is something we "have" and "own," and without it could not function. But determinism which says we are our brains is faulty thinking, because while science is correct in saying that emotions and thoughts can be broken down into the chemicals and the snyapses, they still must be controlled by the will, which even determinsts admit exist.<br>  <br>  They don't admit "free" will and "soul" because they hate the metaphysics. But if you could find a way to manipulate those synapses and chemicals in any way you wanted to from outside a man's brain, you still could not override his "free" will to think that you were a Pavlovian monster.|`|N4nYw5B8aa	This is a great question. I once read a philosophical question of the same nature that may help put things in perspective:<br>  <br>  "Am I a Body, or am I a rider riding a horse named Body?"<br>  <br>  The way I see it, we ARE our brain. Our brain controls our body and we make decisions about our body with our brain. The way we interpret our surroundings and decide what is dangerous and what isn't depends solely on our brain and what it has interpreted and diagnosed in the past. Think about people that are medically diagnosed as brain-dead. Do they have any capabilities whatsoever? No, they do not. Our body relies 100% on our brain. Our brain dictates our feelings (brain chemicals such as dopamine, seratonin, endorphins, etc.) and sends out signals for our body to react to anything and everything. Ever feel sweaty when you're nervous? That's the brain telling the body that you are in a fearful situation and to take caution. The list goes on and on.|`|idMdZYQ6aa	Well, i personally believe the brain is where our conscience "is". and research has shown we can "transport" that to another "body" - see the link below.<br>  <br>  So in this sense, it's our body we "have", the brain is us, the body is our transport mechanism. Then again, there are the genes which "owns" us again (see Richard Dawkins, "The Selfish Gene" (title is anything but ideal, he's NOT suggesting our genes are what we understand by the word "selfish")|`|AA11564934	We use language like "this is my brain" as opposed to pointing to an organ and saying "this is me" because that is just awkward.

Check out old James Taylor (e.g. "Blossom" from the "Sweet Baby James" album) to see how this chord can be used in "chorale" type harmonic sequences.<br>  <br>  (2) Why do your versions conflict? Like piano, guitar offers several options for playing the same chord.  All that is required is that it contain the G B D of the G triad and that the bottom note is a B.<br>  <br>  One other poster has provided the easiest "open" position, but get out there and explore the other possibilities.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes.
kPNnfjNSaa	That saying really refers more to the knowledge of certain situations rather than knowledge in general. <br>  <br>  However, in you're ignorant of something, it could come back to hurt you later on.

ae282ad4a748f8c85406e4649235ff16aa	The Allied Powers, USA, UK & France had each a sector of West Berlin, the USSR had East Berlin. There was no wall in 1945 when the war ended. The people of the east began to migrate to the west when they saw reconstruction and rehabilitation went at a faster pace in the west. There was also the issue of rape, used by the USSR as a weapon of mass fear when invading Germany. Thousands of German females were raped by troops of the USSR and had abortions. The USSR tried to get the Western Allies out in 1947 and blocked all road routes and rail links from West German into Berlin. The Western part of Germany was separated from the Eastern part by the IGB (Inner German Border). The western allies made an air bridge and flew supplies into West Berlin over a number of months. This was the start of the Cold War. Throughout the Cold War Britain's Military Intelligence battled the Eastern Bloc countries, those under Soviet domination, and the USSR. Vienna was a favourite Spy City and featured in several movies and TV series. It was about subverting the government of the East and West Germany and gaining military intelligence. Numerous West German politicians erroneously recruited 'east german' agents as secretaries etc, not knowing their secrets were going to Moscow. Greville Wynn was a famous spy for Britain caught by the Soviets. Some say he sold 'doctored' plans of Concorde to the Soviets. They built the plane, the plans were wrong, the plane crashed. There was also the infamous Portland Spy Ring where secret submarine detection documents were stolen, copied and sent to USSR. Portland in Dorset, was the centre for the UK's Underwater Detection units and developments. The Berlin Wall was erected to stop the mass igration of easterners the the West to get a better life.|`|70779fc8be56b4fef53f1f0089247dd7aa	okay first sorry to waste space but are you looking for the cold war involving the uk or two different subjects?<br>  but in short the uk followed the american lead, its military presence was mostly in its sector in germany, which is the north i believe

gQEtEtLQaa	I saw 'Phantom of the Opera' in London and it was just amazing.  I love the story and I love the music - it's definitely my favourite musical and I love the movie version as well, Gerard Butler was brilliant as the Phantom.  I love the lush opera house setting and the Masquerade Ball is one of my favourite scenes, the costumes are beautiful and the masquerade masks are brilliant.  My favourite scene in the movie is when Christine is walking through the cemetery with all the fog and the fantastic gothic statues and mausoleums. <br>  <br>  I'd like to see 'Wicked' too - it's had brilliant reviews and I like the idea of seeing the story of Oz from the Wicked Witch's point of view.|`|jDFVWRLDaa	I've seen Legally Blonde: The Musical and The Lion King on Broadway.

But right now, my favorite musical is Rent. My favorite right before it was Wicked. It is a great musical, but right now I think Rent is better. Rent is very inspirational. It is about 7 (soon to be 8) friends who live in a  Tenement city. Their landlord, Benny, is about to evict them. After Tom comes back from Rehab, he meets Angel. They fall in love. Roger, Mark, and Tom are roommates. Mark was recently dumped by Maureen. Maureen is now with a lawyer named Joanne. Roger's girlfriend recently died and he is getting over it. Then he meets Mimi, a dancer at a strip club. They fall in love. The thing is, Mark, Roger, Tom, Angel, and Mimi all have AIDS. They have to live the rest of their lives knowing that they will die soon. <br>  <br>  Not only the plot, but the music is GREAT! It is a rock opera. It holds the famous song "Seasons of Love." I'm sad that it closed in September after 12 years of performances. They are on their final national tour with a lot of the original cast! I get to see it in March!!!|`|tiUh1lMaaa	Wicked is incredible, and if you get the chance you should definitely go.<br>  <br>  My absolute favorite is Spring Awakening, but I also love Rent and Fame.<br>  <br>  As a person of Irish decent and also as an Irish Dancer, I understand I'm biased.

ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>|`|8MaRk2AZaa	it is introduced by scout looking back to the time when jem broke his arm.

For example:<br>  <br>  When he declared himself dictator of the Roman Republic, Julius Caesar was bound to be assassinated. <br>  This argument gives no logical grounds to conclude Caesar's assassination was the only possible outcome, or even the most likely outcome of the circumstances. Simply asserting this is committing the fallacy of retrospective determinism. This type of fallacy is often used as a build-up to a hasty generalization: because something happened in given circumstances, it was not only bound to happen, but will in fact always happen given those circumstances. For example:<br>  <br>  Caesar was assassinated when he declared himself dictator. Sic semper tyrannis: this goes to show that all dictators will eventually be assassinated. <br>  This not only does not follow on logical grounds, but is false: a dictator may be murdered by a political rival, killed in a war with a foreign power, or simply die by accident or natural causes. Discounting these possibilities, it still does not follow that any dictator, if they lived long enough, would be assassinated because Caesar was assassinated. While the conclusion is correct, the premise is faulty. Caesar's assassination does not predict the inevitable assassination of all other dictators.|`|W4GXLw0naa	<a href="http://realinall.cname.at" rel="nofollow">http://realinall.cname.at</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|dhq9cKOeaa	Because as we all know...

d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	Unfortunately, slavery still exists in many forms to this day. Many of the new forms of slavery involve forms of indentured servitude.<br>  <br>  Many Chinese seeking a new life in the west will barter their work for being smuggled into a western country. On arrival, they're forced to work off their debt -- sometimes forever -- they never pay it off.<br>  <br>  Many of the women end up in forced prostitution or other occupations. The men end up being sold out to other people looking for menial, back breaking labourers.<br>  <br>  In many places in the Middle East, immigrants from the sub-continent are brought over to serve as housekeepers and are virtually imprisoned by their "employers." They have no money, no rights; and their fates are entirely in the hands of people who often abuse them.<br>  <br>  Make no mistake, slavery is alive and well. And of course, this doesn't even address the larger issue of "Wage Slave" who migrate from the countryside in search of jobs, are employed by large companies and forced to live in sub-standard company housing and subsist on pennies a day.<br>  <br>  It will be with us for a long time I fear.|`|JAZnQJPHaa	Capitalism makes slaves of people, in that we are coerced to participate, indeed it is illegal not to participate (try not paying taxes!).<br>  You can never actually own land or rights to it in the capitalist system, you still have to pay compulsory council rates. In Australia, voting is even compulsory by law. Virtually every facet of human life under capitalism is governed by laws or regulated, from the choices of food I eat, to what time I have to work, to even how large a family I can have, what I can do on my own property, what material posessions I can own etc etc. Absolutely everything appears to be under some form of legislation that robs the individual or community of choice. The FREEDOM of choice is regulated by government and law. So I am free, as far as I am not incarcerated in a prison, yet my freedom is so limited in my own country. It's like having Freedom of speech, so long as no-one disaggrees with what you say. Its illusionary. lack of freedom for me is a form of slavery.|`|W5h7UfZmaa	It affects us all take main land china,the sweat shops workers in their factories ,they are owned by the factories and we buy there goods .My daughter visited one of these factories and goods sell for nothing and sell over here  for 100 dollars for a t shirt who gets the money us, western middle man we are all guilty|`|xtwW1Ixsaa	Anyone living via month to month paycheck is relatively a slave<br>  which is probably most - some even live week to week.<br>  <br>  I think slavery is a relative term in many ways.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	Sometimes I feel like a modern-day slave to the corporations of this world, bound by the almighty dollar and forced to work at least 40 hours per week during the best parts of my life.<br>  <br>  I made the choices to take on the debt, I did. But, it seems to be the way of things in our society. For the basic style of life, a home is required. Rather you rent or have a mortgage, it must be paid every month. And to earn the proper education for a job to pay these bills, I had to get a college degree, with loans that also bind me for years to come. <br>  <br>  Then there is a credit agency who monitors all of my financial habits, and provides them at the drop of a hat to any corporation, which will not only affect my credit obtaining abilities but also my job prospects, etc, as some companies do credit checks for employment. <br>  <br>  Some of the lucky few who were born into money or somehow worked their way up to making amounts that pay off the basic needs such as shelter, food, and transportation, etc. may not feel this way.<br>  <br>  But for the vast majority of us, to play and survive in this game we need to receive a steady stream of income, giving the best portions of our days up to a corporation in order to earn $$$ to make it work.|`|AA11564934	um.. by existing.  there are many countries where actual slavery exists.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Humankind is still pretty much enslaved by the twin delusions of separateness and dichotomy. Intellectually, we know that we are mutually dependent, and that night is not the opposite of day, anymore than one man's evil is everyone's evil. Yet, the love for simple answers and the input from the eyes override knowledge. Cruelty and war are the results of this enslavement. The best technique to overcome these powerful delusions is to consistently use the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key<br>  Short Version<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?”<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

She proposed to me. We married within 8 months.  She died young.<br>  <br>  I had known her best friend for 20 years, never had a thought.<br>  <br>  My daughter asked her to ask me out.  She proposed to me. We married in about a year.  She died young.<br>  No jokes please.  I had enough of those.<br>  <br>  I dated my ex for 3 years.  She was younger than I. I did not consider marriage.   She professed her love and proposed to me.<br>  <br>  It was really over in 3-4 months.  I lasted 14 months.<br>  <br>  The first two were from similar backgrounds.  Hard working parents, moral, honest, loving.  Religious to an extent but we both held a strong faith.  We had the same education.  We liked to dance very much.<br>  We liked to travel, and did.<br>  <br>  My ex...too young but flattered me.  And in the back of my mind, I thought that she would not die before me.   I felt some love, and then fell head over heels.<br>  <br>  Same education, similar hard working parents, but, somewhat a dysfunctional family.<br>  While dating for 3 years we enjoyed many of the same activities.<br>  Except dancing.  Should have been my first clue, huh?<br>  I believed her every word.  My mistake.<br>  She was in bad financial straights.  Debts and IRS.  I corrected all that.<br>  We had no financial problems.  She had anything she wanted.<br>  <br>  I financed her realtor school.  She had her freedom to come and go.<br>  <br>  Mostly go.<br>  <br>  I left 6 years ago.  Still love her but my trust is in shreds.  She remarried and he beat her up./ divorced.<br>   She has some regrets, but I just can't go back.

He must allow you the freedom to be anything you can and want to be.

d0f5RJ8Jaa	i like the first poster's suggestion.<br>  <br>  here's another idea -- <br>  may be your son can do a pantomime [if that's permitted] depicting how the electronic media [tv & net] can play up emotions globally -- one specific example is when the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) was to be operationalized in Oct 2008 -- how instead of educating the public/laypersons, majority of the media played up the doomsday scenario/fear. and the irony was that it had to do with science !<br>  <br>  this is just one example. media has become so powerful today that is can mobilize emotions [both positive & negative] worldwide almost instantaneously. <br>  <br>  another example could be the election of US Pres - Obama --- the role of media & mediapersons, the hype & hoopla, .....<br>  <br>  he can do a pantomime of either a positive or a negative impact or just a mixture .... or choose something 'controversial' such as the holocaust, US invasion of Iraq, ...<br>  <br>  hope this inspires even better ideas<br>  all the very best|`|GeyFdO5jaa	<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=drama%2C+films&ei=UTF-8&fr=hp-pvdt">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=drama%2...</a>|`|UDEBAveDaa	i am a drama student and we are doing a unit on nightmares and we have to choose our fear mine being kidnappers and create a storyline from that. this way you are showing your personality therfore getting a higher grade. also a good pointer to your son is to have a mixture of abstract and realisum scene to make it more interesting and appealing to the audience<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  good luck :)|`|5ffJdB98aa	oh you are in the same problem as i was facing!!<br>  I was in a music school.<br>  If you need professional dissertation help I can suggest you good dissertation writing website at which you can order a high quality custom dissertation on any topic.

bY149rq5aa	I liked it a lot! You've got a great lead, and a great second paragraph.. However, Maybe you could possibly mix up a few of the others, to make a few come before another and all that? Maybe you could make your paragraphs more longer? And actually, I think starting off your story with; <br>  <br>  'The land of Onajetta was overrun with Gorgs these days, they stormed about the land, lighting fires to the towns, and killing the villagers without a second thought. It had been so ever since Malena had taken the throne.' <br>  <br>  would be REALLY good! Maybe make the first chapter kind of violent and from your main character's perspective? You shouldn't tell everything at once; gradually add it to your story as you go. Here's what I would do;<br>  <br>  First chapter; - Violence. Disturbance. The main character has to get away from somewhere, runs away? <br>  <br>  Second chapter; - Aftermath of the violence. What the character is thinking. What they're planning to do..<br>  <br>  Third chapter; - NOW you can explain a bit more, more of the history.. more about the gorgs, the main character's life..<br>  <br>  Forth chapter; - You're ready to do whatever the heck you want, and get your story going! ;]<br>  <br>  Also, a tip; Rather make your paragraphs longer, instead of having like 10 on one page, and leave EVERY chapter hanging. Use really intense sentances, like;<br>  <br>  "I knew I was wrong."<br>  <br>  "I was about to find out the truth."<br>  <br>  "I froze. What I saw was not what I was expecting."<br>  <br>  "There he was. Dead."<br>  <br>  "My time was up. It was now or never."<br>  <br>  You know? Really intense stuff, because it makes the reader [whether they realize it or not] having the need to find out what happens in the next chapter, so they'll just devour everything up until the end, when they'll say.. "Wow, that was a great book." One of the reasons people say those things is because of things like cliff hangers and really short, stiff yet detailed and feelingful sentances.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Looks like you've got some great ideas!|`|eG0Rhqv3aa	WOW!!! nice story, it kept me hooked nice job :) keep up the good work!!!!!|`|ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	The plot of your tale seems to move well, but a reader might be confused about what men you are making reference to. Perhaps identify which is the first man, the second man, and so forth, so the reader can better identify them.<br>  <br>  Most important, your primary weakness is the correct use of punctuation--especially by not using a comma at the end of dialogue, followed by a tag line. Another instance is failing to set apart the word 'well' with a comma from the rest of the sentence. In example:<br>  <br>  "Well, what do you think about this?," he said with a tone of sarcasm. (Please note the additional comma after the question mark and before the ending quotation mark because the tag line consists of more than the usual "he said, she said."<br>  <br>  I suggest going back through what you've written and focus on correct punctuation to better set the dialogue apart. Also, try to avoid placing adverbs (words ending with -ly) in your tags.<br>  <br>  I encourage you to continue to hone the craft of writing in any genre you choose. Gather reference material to refer to while you write and edit--always mindful that much editing is required. <br>  <br>  Consider getting the booklet, "The Elements of Style" by Strunk and White. It is an invaluable aid for professional and amateur writers alike.

My personal favorite of all fantasy novels.

You WILL need more than 1 printer, maybe 3 if your busy. You will also want more than 1 memory card for the more than 1 camera too, because to NOT have a back up camera would be ludicrous. You will want x-tra batteries for the cameras and maybe a spare lens or two as well. <br>  <br>  Will the printers be stand alone and have card slots in them or will they be hooked to computers..? Laptops for each printer..? or stand alone printers..? Which printing program if using computers. If stand alone printers, which ones have "print packages" built in you want and can use..? These are just SOME of the questions.<br>  <br>  Do you see $$$$ piling up yet..? A heck of an investment for a once a year deal..<br>  <br>  Lighting..? Hot lights or flashes..? How many..? 2, 3..?

Transportation, helpers to print as you shoot. Liability insurance in case someone trips on all these cords running around. Get the picture yet..?<br>  <br>  Oh, and don't forget the forms, papers to be filled out by the customers, a cash register and a way to take plastic as a form of payment. Model releases..? You WILL need to have some previous work showing to promote your ability, right..? To do this you will need permission from past shoots.

This simply tells me, and everyone, that you do not know what you are doing. I think you should take some college classes of your own in photography, and read a few books. I do not think you are ready to take people's pictures to last a life time, no offense of course.<br>  <br>  You need a camera, a SLR of course, because no one goes to a studio, and gets photographed with a point and shoot camera. I would say that the Canon 5d is a great studio camera. I do not own one, but i held one in my hand, and i read many, many great things about it. It's on the expensive side but you're talking business here. <br>  <br>  You need lighting ( umbrellas, softboxes, etc ), which is extremely expensive, some kits are around five hundred dollars, but they are not the best.

ceBTTCPwaa	Hamlet is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1599 and 1601. The play, set in Denmark, recounts how Prince Hamlet exacts revenge on his uncle Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's father, the King, and then taken the throne and married Hamlet's mother. The play vividly charts the course of real and feigned madness—from overwhelming grief to seething rage—and explores themes of treachery, revenge, incest, and moral corruption.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ha..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ha...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/hamlet/index.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/hamlet/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/H..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/H...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/hamlet2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/hamlet2.html</a>|`|MCJAYZeZaa	The line comes from act 1, scene 3, line 84. <br>  Polonius is telling Laertes to never lie to himself and always be honest with himself, because if he does that then he would always be honest to others too as a direct result. <br>  "And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man."|`|zMDAklBTaa	A unifying theme of Hamlet is "To thine ownself be true" (1,3,78). Of all the main characters, Hamlet is the only one who finally is true to himself. Consequently, of all the main characters, Hamlet is the only one who avoids self-slaughter. <br>  <br>  Even Horatio is taught by Denmark to "drink deep" (1,2,175) and so tries to drink the last drops of poison from the cup. But Hamlet saves Horatio so that he can tell Hamlet's story and teach us all not to drink from the cup of self-slaughter (5,2,346). <br>  <br>  Fortinbras Sr. and Fortinbras Jr. value land more than they value themselves. Fortinbras Sr "did forfeit his life" fighting for land (1,1,91). Fortinbras Jr goes to war, "exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune, death, and danger dare, even for an eggshell" (4,4,51), "a little patch of ground that hath no profit in it but the name" (4,4,18), that is "not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain" (4,4,65). <br>  <br>  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, willing spokes to the king's nave (2,2,30;3,3,15), are deliverers of their own death warrant (5,2,44-59). <br>  <br>  Polonius is a busybody, minding everybody's business but his own. Thus he was killed by a sword-thrust meant for somebody else. (3,4,33) <br>  <br>  Laertes subverts his own life so totally and unthinkingly to filial duty that he is willing to go to hell to revenge his father's death (4,5,131). Although he is satisfied in nature with Hamlet’s repentance, he continues the fatal duel until by some elder masters [Claudius] he has a voice and precedence of peace. Thus he is fighthing not for himself but for a cause borrowed from Claudius. <br>  <br>  When Laertes allied himself with Claudius he dulled the edge of his husbandry. Then, in the subsequent duel with Hamlet, Laertes first wounded Hamlet with his poison-tipped sword, then accidently exchanged swords with Hamlet and was fatally poisoned with his own sword. Thus he was a borrower and lender of swords, and was killed by a lent sword while fighting for a borrowed cause. [We shall see later that Laertes symbolized Christopher Marlowe and that "go far with little" is a paraphrase of Marlowe’s "infinite riches in a little room." (The Jew of Malta,] <br>  <br>  Gertrude cannot separate her too two solid flesh (this "solidity and compound mass",3,4,49) from the doomed flesh of Claudius. Her soul is grappled to his "with hoops of steel" (1,3,63) - wedding bands. So she drinks poison, extending her union into hell (5,2,331). <br>  <br>  Ophelia lets her brother keep the key to her memory. She "does not understand herself so well as it behooves" Polonius's daughter, and so she lets her father tell her what to think (1,3,105). When she falls into the water, she makes no attempt to save herself because her true self has already been lost. She dies by falling into a mirror image of her father in the "glassy stream" <br>  <br>  Both Claudius and Hamlet Sr are unable to separate themselves from their land. So they slaughter their own souls, dooming themselves to be dragged down into hell by their possessions. Hamlet Sr is "doom'd...to walk the night" (1,5,10) to "walk in death" for "extorted treasure in the womb of earth" (1,1,140). Claudius could save his soul by sincerely repenting, but he cannot repent because he won't give up his kingdom and he cannot "be pardon'd and retain the offense" (3,3,56), he finally drinks a poison "tempered by himself" (5,2,332). <br>  <br>  In the end, Hamlet recovers his true self in time to save his soul, although not his life. <br>  <br>  - Ray Eston Smith Jr

0LgpcOBDaa	If you don't try something you will never know or learn.<br>  <br>  The clone tool if used right can be a powerful editing tool. I use it a LOT to get rid of things in my photos. Sometimes, because of the nature of some of my shooting, I don't have the ability to 100% pick my backgrounds so there may be telephone poles, wires or 1 of a 1,000 different things seen in the background.<br>  <br>  I pick parts of the image and clone it over what is not wanted, and then to make the image look smoother I run a blend or smoothing tool over these areas, or sometimes over the whole image to make it look all the same again..<br>  <br>  The size of the object isn't the issue here (footprints) but your ability to learn what your program can do for you and use it to it's full potential is. You have to spend hours a week playing with it and read the manuals or built in help files your program has. <br>  <br>  As once said, take it out and play with it. Often...<br>  <br>  Bob - Tucson|`|uPVnqbE8aa	Lensman2 is absolutely correct.  <br>  I use the cloning tool a great deal and even for things it's not intended for.  It's a great tool.<br>  But, make sure you do all your editing work, including cloning, with the image file in TIFF, "not" JPEG.  If you do it in JPEG the quality will deteriorate every single time you save it.  In TIFF it will not.  If your image is in JPEG already, convert it to TIFF before editing, then back to JPEG when you're finished.

One layer of film consists of gelatin which does "go off" with age, but take the films to your local photography outlet, inform them of what you have and that you would just like the films processed.

j9kImiohaa	The answer is in your details. America defeated Spain, one of the oldest superpowers of Europe (granted, it was on the decline, the win was still significant). With the annexation of the Phillipines, America entered the colonial scene. All of the other strong countries of the world had colonies under their command, and now the US did, too. The Panama canal was another assertion of US power in the Americas, because it was an important route for international trade.

KGOVQIKAaa	Yep! I just did this show. Hopefully, this is the part you want (it's a lot to type):<br>  <br>  MOON: Ah! The final piece of the jigsaw! I think I am now in a position to reveal the mystery. This man [the corpse] was, of course, McCoy, the Canadian who, as we heard, meeting Gascoyne in the street and being solicited for sixpence for a toffee apple, smacked him across the ear, with the cry, "How's that for a grudge to harbour, you sniffling little workshy!" all those years ago. Gascoyne bided his time, but in due course tracked McCoy down to this house, having, on the way, met, in the neighborhood, a simple ambitious girl from the provinces. He was charming, persuasive - told her, I have no doubt, that she would go straight to the top - and she, flattered by his sophistication, taken in by his promises to see her all right on the night, gave in to his simple desires. Perhaps she loved him. We shall never know. But in the very hour of her promised triumph, his eye fell on another - yes, I refer to Lady Cynthia Muldoon. From the moment he caught sight of her there was no other woman for him - he was in her spell, willing to sacrifice anything, even you, Felicity Cunningham. It was only today - unexpectedly finding him here - that you learned the truth. There was a bitter argument which ended with your promise to kill him - a promise that you carried out in this very room at your first opportunity! And I must warn you that anything you say --<br>  <br>  (I hope that helps and I hope I didn't make too many typing errors.)

The book starts with George at age 16 getting caught by the police for leaving numerous hotel rooms across the country without paying. It follows on with George as a divinity student at Halle University. There George acts like no other divinity student; he gambles, steals and drinks. He ends up in a Bible Study and after a few days becomes a Christian. George continues on with college all on his own without any help from his father. He watches as God supplies all his need at just the right time. God begins to call George to the mission field. George then becomes a pastor in Teignmoth, there he met and married Mary Groves. George and Mary lead a simple life with very few accessories. God then lead them to do missions work in Bristol. Once George and Mary moved, they started a Breakfast Club in Bristol. For the Breakfast Club they invited everyone in the neighborhood to come to their house for breakfast where Mary feed them and George would lead the devotions. They had the house stuffed in the morning with people even sitting on the floor. Through a five-year-old orphan girl George felt the call to work among the orphans in Bristol, which were of great number. The book follows on with all George and Mary's preparations for finding a spot and opening the orphanage. The orphanage grows into five houses in town, with a waiting list growing every day. But this orphanage was different then any other orphanage in Europe, the orphans that came, came free of charge. Never were the orphans required to pay anything. George would not ask for money from anyone but God. God never failed to provide meals for the children, and at just the right time. The orphanage grew so much that to have so many children in town just didn't work. So the orphanage moved out of town were there was plenty of room for the orphans. The book continues on for the rest of George's life where he continues to do work among the orphans until the day he dies."<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bristol-1805-1898-Hendrickson-Classic-Biographies/dp/1598562525/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235484744&sr=1-3" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Bristol-1805-1898-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-George-Muller/dp/0883681595/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235484744&sr=1-4" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Geor...</a>

DB0LYUGTaa	1. Reading is an active mental process - Unlike TV, books make you to use your brain. By reading, you think more and become smarter.<br>  <br>  2. It is a fundamental skill builder - Every good course on the planet has a matching book to go with it. Why? Because books help clarify difficult subjects. Books provide information that goes deeper than just classroom discussion.<br>  <br>  3. Improves your vocabulary - Remember in elementary school when you learned how to infer the meaning of one word by reading the context of the other words in the sentence? You get the same benefit from book reading. While reading books, especially challenging ones, you will find yourself exposed to many new words you wouldn’t be otherwise.<br>  <br>  4. Improves memory - Many studies show if you don’t use your memory, you lose it. Crossword puzzles are an example of a word game that staves off Alzheimer’s. Reading, although not a game, helps you stretch your memory muscles in a similar way. Reading requires remembering details, facts and figures and in literature, plot lines, themes and characters.<br>  <br>  5. Learn anywhere - Books are portable. You can take them almost anywhere. As such, you can learn almost anywhere too.<br>  <br>  6. Improves creativity - by reading more books and exposing yourself to new and more complete information, you will also be able to come up with more creative ideas. As a personal example, I read many, many books on IT Networking. So often, when IT Admins are stumped with a problem, I can come up with a creative (smack your head simple) solution that isn’t written anywhere. But the reason I can do that is because I have read so many books on the subject, I can combine lessons from all of them into new solutions.<br>  <br>  7. Books are inexpensive entertainment - What’s the average price of a movie ticket these days? $8 - $10? You can buy a paperback for that price and be entertained for many hours more. If you have a used bookstore nearby, you can get them even cheaper.<br>  <br>  8. Decreases mistakes - Although I would never suggest putting off an important goal because you fear making mistakes, it is still important to sharpen the saw (link to A.L. post). When you gather the deep and wide wisdom that books can provide, you are less apt to make mistakes.<br>  <br>  9. You’ll discover surprises - As you read more books as a source of information, you’ll learn stuff you weren’t looking for. I’ve read many great quotes on life and love by reading books on marketing. I’ve learned facts about biology from reading about chemistry. Heck, I’ve picked up some facts about history while reading about programming. Since so many subjects intertwine it’s almost impossible not to learn something other than the book’s subject.|`|y8DLyE5raa	Maybe you SHOULD read more, it helps with spelling and grammar.|`|EcgO4dlnaa	Yeah it is good for you. It helps with vocabulary and grammer. Of course it would be good for more people to read but it does get ungodly boring.

A01w1dHqaa	Emotions of pain explain nothing. There is no truth in them. They are distorted glimpses of what true life is according to the distorted thoughts we carry. The only true emotion is that of love, joy. All else is based on perverted perception of life. Through this lens Hamlet is seeing the world. Purpose and identity becomes lost when truth is denied. And when purpose is gone life has no meaning, no reason to be.<br>  <br>  If you relate to the distorted emotions with fear, sadness or anger, you will fall into the same morass. Only through enthusiasm for life can you see life in its true state of beauty.<br>  <br>  Shakespeare has truth spread through out his plays.

gGZz2EGyaa	Uprising started 23 October and went on until 10 November 1956<br>  <br>  On 4 November, a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. Hungarian resistance continued until 10 November. Over 2,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet troops were killed in the conflict, and 200,000 Hungarians fled as refugees. Mass arrests and denunciations continued for months thereafter. By January 1957, the new Soviet-installed government had suppressed all public opposition. <br>  <br>  I have given you a web site which has a lot of information on the uprising and will be able to help you any questions that you may have.

w22UkzCNaa	It could certainly be taken as such.  I am, however, of the opinion that the metaphor would be secondary to the main warning against terrestrial government control.  <br>  <br>  As in - primarily, watch how much power you surrender to your government and pay attention to what they're telling you.<br>  <br>  Secondarily, if you want to dig a little deeper, don't follow anything, religion included, without questions.

c06f9e62b2e3de70492245a069ccbf6aaa	I found this for you,<br>  Surname: Keith<br>  This is a famous Scottish surname, whose blood it is claimed, "runs in every noble Scottish family", may be of German origin. According to ancient mythology, in the11th century a party of Germans (Anglo-Saxons?) landed on the east coast of Scotland, and assisted the native population in defeating the Danes. The Germans were apparently known as the "Catti tribe", and they were lead by one Robert. As a result of their success they were granted lands in East Lothian, where for many centuries they were prominent land holders. There seems no reason why this should not be true, although whether the Catti were granted lands freely, or simply took them by the power of the sword, is a mute point. What is beyond arguement is that the Keith's have never had the prefix "Mac", and this is often used as an argument that the name is not of Scottish or Gaelic origins. However neither have the Clan Douglas, and you canot get much more Scottish than them.Early examples of the surname recording include Bernard de Keth, who witnessed a charter in Kelso in the year 1201, and Sir George Keith, described as being (quote) "the Great Marischal of Scotland in 1315, and leader of the Scots's cavalry at Bannockburn". He was killed at the battle of Durham in 1346. Andrew Keth, the 4th Earl Marischal, was a hostage for the release by the English of King James 1st in 1425, whilst George Keith (1693 - 1778) was the 10th Earl Marischal, but was exiled from Scotland for being a Jacobite. <br>  Hope this helps.|`|M0GoGVHXaa	It is of Scottish and Gaelic origin, and its meaning is "woodland, forest"|`|0HAn67yZaa	keith Name Meaning and History<br>  Scottish: habitational name from the lands of Keith in East Lothian. In the 17th century numerous bearers of this name settled in Ulster. <br>  German: nickname from Middle High German kit ‘sprout’, ‘offspring’.
lPxVt2XYaa	It wasn't - the Western Front was over 200 miles long, the front extended from the coast in Belgium all the way to the Swiss border.  The French held the southern sector, roughly from Compiegne on the River Oise - not far from the town of Albert, near the Somme - to Switzerland, the British, Canadians, Australians, Portuguese etc. the coast to Compiegne - about 70 miles.<br>  <a href="http://www.worldwar1.com/maps/wfsp1916.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldwar1.com/maps/wfsp1916.j...</a>|`|AA11304025	Because the opposing sides were at stalemate with both defensive positions being too hard to overcome.<br>  But there was plenty of fightng on the Eastern Front|`|gEW3bOJeaa	Basically because trench warfare was introduced. World War I was a different war because of all the technological advances made by the different sides. Automatic rifles, cannons, machine guns, U-boats, tanks and whatnot made the "old-fashioned" style of fighting where the two groups of soldiers would stand in formations shooting at each other rather difficult.|`|70779fc8be56b4fef53f1f0089247dd7aa	because of the location, it was easlily accessable by both sides.  and that was where the german army made its advances early in the war, so obviously you want your army where the enemy is.

ozWi3TJlaa	Manic Depression is now called Bipolar Disorder.  You might want to refer to it in that way as it's been called that for a long time.  <br>  <br>  I had really high, highs with lots of energy, speaking really fast, cleaning frenzies and would go several days without sleep.  Then I would "crash," unable to even get out of bed and unwilling to even talk to anyone.  I was aware of what was going on around me, but actively chose non-participation.  Occasionally, I had suicidal thoughts but never acted upon them because I always knew I'd swing back the other way eventually.  <br>  <br>  It's different for everybody, but that was my experience.  Thankfully I was able to get help, both psychologically and pharmacologically.  Now, I am pretty much on an even keel all the time.|`|AgrVuahYaa	My son's best friend suffered with the illness.  He was either full out or dead stop...no in between.  When he was up, he was full of energy, excited about everything, "the sky's the limit" type of thing.  But when he was down, he would just sit.  He wasn't asleep but he may as well have been.  He didn't talk unless he had to, he was just quiet--not depressed or blue--just extremely quiet.  He hardly moved.  And he could be one way one minute, and completely different the next.  No cutting.  Just put your character in everyday situations but demonstrate the mood shifts.

WseLyvSpaa	Altruism: UNSELFISH regard for or devotion to the welfare of others <br>  <br>  What you have said is fine if you leave out the word altruism.  We are helpful and act communally for much of our time...becasue it benefits us all to do so.  Helping your family members is called kin selection.  It is a behavior predicted by natural selection.  Altruism is helping others when it has zero beneficial effect for you.  If you get any benefit out of it, including a direct sense of satisfaction, then it is NOT altruism.  <br>  <br>  Arguably, you can have some tit-for-tat altrusism, where people help each other in order to build good faith so that they can be helped maybe at some later date.  if they never need the help, but become permanent helpers, then you can argue that that is altruism.  By the way, many serious scientists say that altruism does not even exist.  It is controversial.|`|5oBYGB5Vaa	I must concur w/ "Xaxorm". Altruism was a poor choice of words.

oalrUO4yaa	i really like Ella and Katrin also for the names.<br>  i think they go well with Hans.<br>  <br>  for a childhood adventure, maybe they went fishing or something and the girl couldn't swim? she fell in and Hans had to save her? or possibly they find like an old shack of something that they turn into their secret club and they make up tons of adventures that they could go on?<br>  <br>  another idea is that instead of Hans changing his mind, the Nazis could have threatened his family so he and his brothers have to go to fight. but maybe they're not allowed to tell the reason? so the girl thinks he's betraying her.<br>  <br>  this could be why they never said good-bye to one another.<br>  <br>  maybe the girl enlists as a nurse in the war after she receives Hans's letter to try and find him. this could possibly be where she sees him shot or his company killed?<br>  <br>  you could also turn it into a sort of love thing where she finds him on the battlefield and he's dying. she could be crying and he tells her that he loved her, etc. etc.<br>  <br>  well, i think your story sounds great and you should keep writing!<br>  hope i helped!<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArI397iK2y1RPxisx4HHNMfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223054228AAcYEIy">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|i4g8dHWXaa	I really like the name Ada, it just sounds really like it should be back then.. Hope I helped.|`|PicEC6W4aa	Personally, I like the names Katja and Ella. I think you should make town adventures like him and her playing tricks on the nazis. Liberating their friends from harsh injunctions by their parents or the nazis. Taking advantage of both sides without any reality of the seriousness of whats going on. I really am not great with the timeline you're going for so I'm just giving you ideas not knowing if their historically accurate. Maybe finding a cave and getting trapped their by nazi fire. I think him joining the nazi regime would be a great idea. I'm guessing you're going to use some symbolism and that'd be great. Maybe have some kind of momento that makes them remember who each of them were after they got seperated. Maybe she thinks hans is dead at one point in the story. thats all I got for now. Hope I helped.|`|eG0Rhqv3aa	hmmmmm..... not a bad plot, I personally like happy endings, but that would be good; The two never liked each other at the beginning, but they wound up in the classes as partners, they strat liking each other, leading up to a kiss, leading to really likeing each other, then, hans goes off to war or something, and he and his brothers are killed, making for a tragic ending, that could work. :)<br>  For the adventures, you could have them in the woods, they could get lost, someome could trip and almost fall off a very high cliff or they camp out and a bear finds them something, or something like that.<br>  For the name, how about Ada :)<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!!! :) good luck!!|`|IIa4efh5aa	Personally, I like the name Lena.<br>  <br>  It sounds like a great story -- although you could add to the conflict by having one of the two's appearance not so perfectly Aryan -- maybe dark enough to be mistaken for a Jew?<br>  <br>  The German schools must have been horrible.

To me it fits best with Hans.<br>   About your story plot...I like the first part of your plot, but the second one is bothering me a little bit. You could make it so that after they've become friends, they have to evade the nazi's together. I don't know =) plots have never been my strong point. The ending you have is really sad, but a lot of people like those kinds of books (not me, though), so you'd be alright there.<br>   Sorry I couldn't be of any use.<br>    <br>  Have a good rest of the day!
IuH76cQTaa	there's another question that always comes before that:<br>  <br>  "Does the concept of time exist?"<br>  <br>  <br>  If the answer to that is yes, then so do the 'past' and 'future' exist. Because otherwise, can we say that the concept of time exists if there is only the so-called 'present'?|`|5f4dc74999ea35948406cdb06fea9334aa	Only the past and the future exist. <br>  The present is your perception of  "now", and gives your conscience a pallet to remember events that have occured, and anticipate events to come.<br>  Imagine a number line from negative infinity to infinity. The present is at zero. It is immeasurable. This is how space and time become intertwined. <br>  Example:The actual physical location(s) in space that you occupied while you slept yesterday, still exist. And the actual location(s) in space that you will occupy while you sleep tomorrow, exist (and have always existed).|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	Only the present exists, this should be obvious. Time is a measurement of change in the present. The past existed when it was now, but that was then, this is later. Similarly, tomorrow never comes. <br>  How could the past exist? If it did it would be present and not past. Only what is now exists, we can predict the future by extrapolating the patterns of the present or examine the past as it falls away from now like the wake of a boat. <br>  It is not possible to see the past either by looking far into space, since you see it now. When you see lightning and later hear thunder, the thunder is not coming from the past, it exists now, when heard, though the event that caused it may be in the past. Similarly the light or other electromagnetic radiation from past events reaches us in the present, it may be caused by events that were far in the past, but it can only be percieved now.|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Intuition has nothing to do with it: metaphysics has everything to do with it.<br>  The past exists only as memory, including material memory such as fossils; the future exists only for those there to see it, at which time it immediately becomes the past.|`|5akAfzB3aa	None of them exist<br>  The present is only a momentary lapse in judgment of now, happening a moment ago, which will again happen in a moments time.<br>  <br>  The past is a memory, the future is a distant memory, now was then.|`|GlteTTauaa	If you could shoot away for a few light years in a Warp Drive ship and look back at the Earth, you would see yourself a few years ago.

For example, the king of Wales had the boar, and this nondescript little king in northern England carried a bear (Artos) on his flag.  Funny thing about that king--recent documents released by the Vatican show he was called to Rome to help protect them, but he died in a little French town called Avalon.

The quick answer is "no", you cannot actually determine the outcomes in your life. That said, you do have the ability to deal with whatever comes your way, good or bad, in whichever way you choose. That power is yours! Of course, you probably have a better chance at having positive things happen in your life if you are optimistic and do things to help make yourself happy, such as staying healthy, having at least one close, trusting relationship in which you can confide your true feelings, and having an honest relationship with yourself. The latter may sound corny, but it is the most important "relationship" you'll ever have. You always have to be true to yourself, otherwise everything else in your life is just noise that you let yourself be susceptible to.

gkoOThQAaa	It's foolish if someone really thinks he's not afraid of death. Everyone fears death in a way or another. Some because they feel they haven't accomplished enough. Others because they fear they won't go to heaven because of what they did in their lives.<br>  <br>  And no it's not meaningless to cultivate the spiritual greatness we're living. All religions advise you to be good to all people so people would benefit. I am a non-radical religious person, I know that even if religion didn't exist, you should treat everybody in a good manner so everybody should live better. Imagine if everyone was mean to each other, how would they feel? how many wars will outbreak? What kind of society would we be living in? You'd live everyday cheating, lying, killing for your food, there will be no order no system. You'll be afraid to get out of your house, to let your kids play outside.

YmXvERLtaa	General rule of thumb..<br>  Books are ALWAYS better than their film counterparts.<br>  <br>  I prefer the book as it gives more insight into Bella's feeling, it's written in first person, so theres a lot more detail that will never be captured in the film.<br>  Also, it explains things that are left out in the film:<br>  It explains Jaspers power<br>  Where Alice came from<br>  <br>  And various other minor details that just make it a lot more well rounded.<br>  <br>  I suggest you give the book a go. It's not very hard to read, and shouldn't take very long.<br>  That way, you'll have your own opinion and can then decide for yourself whether you want to read the sequels or not.<br>  <br>  :)|`|eG0Rhqv3aa	books are always better than the movie, they include more details, like what the character is thinking, something the movies don't include, I've been reading the books so far, and they're great!!! =)))))....... the second book, New Moon, Edward leaves Bella for a while but they get back together soooooo.... *shrugs* still good :)|`|KCpGsN2faa	YES.

Plus through reading the book you can understand all the hidden things in the movie.  It will also help you i think if you later want to watch the second movie.<br>  You may aswell try the book now that youve seen the movie.|`|tRNtFNHLaa	The Twilight books are better then the movie.|`|RKJtRaGXaa	The movie was awful...the book was awsome|`|AA11310817	I reluctantly watched the movie too, about three weeks ago, and ended up getting all the books a few days later, and reading them all in 12 days<br>  I can't guarantee you'll like all of them, but I HAD to know how it ended... For me, the 3rd book was the most forgettable.<br>  I liked book 2, but some hate it cause Edward is missing from most of the book.

d9MjpkK4aa	Wohlgemuth is a German name. You can find it everywhere in the country. There is no significant center of its spreading aside from urban areas. It's an antiquated word, simply meaning "happy"or "in a good temper".<br>  <a href="http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/wohlgemuth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.verwandt.de/karten/absolut/wo...</a> <br>  Well, Aryans have never settled in Europe, we find them for example in Iran.

YEfW3vI0aa	Here is what I found for you:<br>  <br>  <br>  There are a lot of conflicts in this book, but the main type of conflict is man vs. circumstances. The conflict is between Percy and the fact that the greek gods are alive. The story starts with a school trip to the museum. Soon percy discoveres that his Latin teacher is a slave for the greek gods and after some time he realized that his best friend was also one of the slaves of the greek gods then he got to know the he, himself was one of the slaves of the gods. At first he couldnt believe the fact but he believed when he defeated the minons which the lord of the dead had sent to him. Unfortunately the minon had killed his mother in the fight. He was quite abhorrent after the fight was over. Then he was taken to the god of wine and he was cured.

It is written that when He come, <br>  <br>  Matthew 24:36<br>  <br>  No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,[a] but only the Father. 37As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 38For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; 39and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 40Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. 41Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.<br>  <br>   42"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. 43But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. 44So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.<br>  <br>  So we would not know when is the last day.

bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Mansfield Park has the dubious distinction of being disliked by more of Jane Austen's fans than any of her other novels, even to the point of spawning "Fanny Wars" in internet discussion forums. Its themes are very different from those of her other books, which can generally be simplified into one sentence, or even one phrase: Sense and Sensibility is about balancing emotions and thought, Pride and Prejudice is about judging others too quickly, Emma is about growing into adulthood, and Persuasion is about second chances. <br>  <br>  The theme of Mansfield Park, on the other hand, can not be so easily described. Is it about ordination? Is it an allegory on Regency England? Is it about slavery? Is it about the education of children? Is it about the difference between appearances and reality? Is it about the results of breaking with society's morés? Any, or all of those themes can, and have been applied to Mansfield Park.<br>  <br>  The major problem for most of the novel's detractors is the lead character, Fanny Price. She is shy, timid, lacking in self-confidence, physically weak, and seemingly—to some, annoyingly—always right. Austen's own mother called her "insipid", and many have used the word "priggish". She is certainly not like the lively and witty Elizabeth Bennet of Pride and Prejudice. But Mansfield Park also has many supporters, whose admiration and loyalty can be attributed to the depth and complexity of the themes in the book and to the main character—a young woman who is unlike most heroines found in literature.<br>  More at:<br>  <a href="http://www.austen.com/mans/" rel="nofollow">http://www.austen.com/mans/</a>|`|ceBTTCPwaa	Fanny Price is the heroine in Jane Austen's 1814 novel Mansfield Park.

7CHt3IE1aa	Believe me, you're not alone- I get paid to write and I still think a lot of my stuff ain't that great.<br>  <br>  First up, feel free to write what you want- if you like writing poetry, then by all means stick at it. If, however, you feel a burning need to write prose, then concentrate on that.<br>  <br>  I usually try and come up with a killer opening sentance, one that is so good that it forces the reader to pay attention. For example, the opening sentance for one of my novels is 'I was going to kill him.' The opening sentance for my current project is 'It was the end of the world as we knew it.'<br>  <br>  Most importantly, learn to edit your work. Don't repeat words unless you have to, and make sure that you don't use three words when one will do it. Very few writers can create something worth reading without at least one edit.<br>  <br>  Do you ever read your work aloud? I make my poor wife listen to stuff and tell me what she thinks. If you can't bear to have an audience, then wait until there is nobody home and then read it aloud; by turning your written work into spoken words, you will find things that you didn't spot on your first edit.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to spend a lot of time writing- I probably spend about 25 hours a week at my lap-top. This feels like a lot- I have a baby son and a full time job as well- but I don't really feel like it's a sacrifice- I love writing and even when it's not going especially well, I still consider it a better use of my time than an eight-hour session playing Call Of Duty.<br>  <br>  Maybe set yourself little challanges- try writing a story only using dialogue, or write a descriptive paragraph without using pronouns- sometimes these challanges are silly, and sometimes you find yourself being more creative than you though possible. Read other peoples work and see how they express themselves.<br>  <br>  Lasty, learn about the process- buy books about writing, and try some of the writing magazines- I get Writers News and have learned a lot from it- I wouldn't have got my publishing deal without it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|jOljnsulaa	Poems are fine but generally, they're just writing down what comes into your head.<br>  <br>  Writing a story, even a short one is much harder.

g92UnU5eaa	I don't think second person can ever really work in a full-length novel.<br>  <br>  It works very well for those choose-your-own adventure books, where the description is all of setting and action, and I have seen a few short stories written in second that have worked well. <br>  <br>  The problem is, if you stick with it for too long the reader starts to have problems identifying with the character. ('Actually, that's not what I'd do', 'that's not how I'd react', etc.) And if you start getting into emotional realms (which a novel must, to keep its reader attentive for that long) you make these problems even worse ('that's not how I feel!').<br>  <br>  Overall, it makes for an alienating read, which can have a dramatic effect if used in the right circumstances but in the long term (for a long story) can very easily put people off.|`|XKhNw221aa	no, I never can write when need be.

It's awkward, and it definitely takes getting used to, as a reader and as a writer, because of the directness of it.

AA10570173	Hi. I don't know about your particular school system (I'm in the US, are you in England?), but with dragonflies and butterflies, you have all sorts of possibilities. I don't know what the basic requirements are (could you describe the details of your product/project requirements?), but there would be all sorts of ways to approach this. Start by researching the subject, go to the library and get books on butterflies and insects; start with good photos for reference. Do sketches. Decide what kinds of textiles might best reflect the structures of the wings, or the colors.<br>  <br>  Some butterfly wings are transparent. Some have very bold patterns, bright colors. Others (especially some of the tropical species) have very shimmery colors, that shift when you see them from different angles. What textiles could you use to represent this?<br>  <br>  That's just a few ideas, I hope I at least gave you something to start with. Good luck. =)
1TPGdaXJaa	Just because God may not seem to exist as defined through the strict, manmade religion of one like Catholicism does not mean that a God does not exist at all. Maybe that is where some of your struggle comes from. <br>  <br>  The thing about science is, although our scientific system may lead some to believe that we exist randomly for no reason, accepting this as fact is ignorant in the literal sense. Science organizes and tries to explain things, based on other things that we can organize and quantify within the realm of human understanding. However, the realm encompassed within human understanding within this universe is just a scratch on the surface - and because of that, to think that our science can answer all of the questions about life is, simply put, ignorant and arrogant. <br>  <br>  There is so much more to this life, and what we are is indescribable. Back up a level from all of the confines of firm belief, whether it be from strict religion or strict science, and question it all for yourself. Find out who you are, what rings true with you, and pursue in this life what you feel has heart and beauty.  "You" already know how you feel and what you believe, you just need to learn to remove yourself from preconceived notions of others and clearly listen to yourself. There is so much going on, right now, that is beyond the realms of any strict belief, so pursue exploration of your ideas.|`|noJ4WeDGaa	you are the only one keeping yourself where you are, not god.

KADDz1EPaa	Life was simple: hunger, disease, unemployment ...<br>  <br>  by the fustigador|`|NYU37jfGaa	Well, if the woman was single she would most likely be working for a living, and if she was poor and married she might also be carrying on working.  Domestic service was still a big employer of women after the war, and a great many women were working as maids, cooks, housekeepers, children's nannies etc.  A lot of women worked in factories, and lot were employed in shops.  A great many worked in offices, as typists, secretaries, etc.  a lot of women worked as telephonists. Teaching and nursing were two occupations that employed very large numbers of women.  There were some women doctors, and a few women lawyers, but it cost money to train for these occupations, so they are not occupations where you would be likely to find a poor woman.<br>  <br>  If a woman was a housewife she would have a harder time keepin gher house clean as London was very dirty in those days with the smuts from factory chimneys etc.  She might have a coal fire, which also caused a lot of dirt.  Central heating was a luxury at this time, and only rich people would have it.  There might be an outdoor toilet.  A lot of houses, especially of poor people, would not have bathrooms, and they might have to make do with a tin bathtub in front of the fire.  it would be hard work heating the water and filling it, and then emptying it afterwards.<br>  <br>  Anyone who could afford it in those days employed servants, but a poor woman would have to do her own housework, perhaps with the help of her daughters if she had any.<br>  <br>  She would do her shopping in small local shops, or she might go to a department store for some things, there were no supermarkets in those days.  A lot of the things we take for granted nowadays were not available in shops then.  Most ordinary shops for instance did not have things that we expect to find everywhere now, like pasta and rice and olive oil and sundried tomatoes and curry paste etc.  These kind of things would only be available in specialist shops somewhere like Soho, which had a large number of foreign residents.  And a lot of the exotic fruits and vegetables we are used to seeing in greengrocers would not be available in those days.  Some fruits that are cheap now, like oranges, bananas etc, would have been quite expensive in those days.<br>  <br>  There wasn't much fast food in those days, no Macdonalds or KFC or Chinese takeaways, but there would be a fish and chip shop, and pie shops were also popular.  When you bought fish and chips, they would be wrapped in newspaper and the print might come off on the fish (they were still doing this when I was young in the 70s).<br>  <br>  People didn't have credit cards in those days, but sometimes people were allowed to run up bills at certain shops, if the shopkeepers thought they were trustworthy.  But poor people usually dreaded getting into debt.  A popular alternative to credit was the pawn shop, where you could take just about anything you had, and the pawnbroker would give yo some money for it.  Then you could get it back when you had enough money to pay for it (the amount he hd given you plus a bit extra).  You could pawn just about anything that he thought he could sell, when my father was very hard up as a young man in the 1930s he once pawned his mattress!<br>  <br>  A poor woman would enjoy walking round the big department stores like Selfridges and Bourne and Hollingsworth etc, even if she couldn't afford to buy anything she would just look. If she had the money, she would enjoy going to the cinema, which was becoming very popular at that time.  And she would enjoy going dancing, there were dance halls in London where you could go and dance to a band.

Genealogy is tracing your background. By the time you get to your grandparents alone (using the maiden name for the woman, which is standard), you have 4 different names and only one is the name you carry. Since each grandparent is unique, the number of surnames doubles by the next generation. You hopefully can see immediately.. that a last name is just a tag, and not your background. <br>  Besides (and yes, we see it happen).. suppose that you research your actual ancestors (not just the names).. and get back to gr grandpa, and discover that he was adopted?

Both teens are also dealing with difficult family situations. Miah's father has left his mother for another woman, and Ellie is trying to fight through her feelings about her mother, who twice abandoned her family for extended periods. The teenagers must also deal with the subtle and not-so-subtle bigotry that they are subject to as a mixed-race couple. Miah and Ellie go about working through their problems, both individually and together, and their relationship continues to blossom, giving readers a shared sense of contentment. Thus, the tragic climax will leave them stunned. Woodson's lyrical narrative tells the story through alternating voices, Ellie's in the first person and Miah's in the third. This fine author once again shows her gift for penning a novel that will ring true with young adults as it makes subtle comments on social situations."|`|uth8Ztbdaa	Sounds like the plot from Liberty Heights...but that was a movie.|`|umUiScliaa	Is the book lizzie bright and the buckministers boy

The island was surrounded by deep water, making it a navigable and defensible strategic point. However, the island was swampy, isolated, offered limited space and was plagued by mosquitoes and brackish tidal river water unsuitable for drinking.

Replacing aircraft was, relatively, easy, replacing aircrew was not. <br>  <br>  Morale-wise it cannot be overstated how important this victory was to the British public after the debacle in France and the Dunkirk evacuation.

b9wICW1Paa	I'll assume you are referring to Europeans of the 16th - 18th centuries.  Dietary options probably didn't change much for centuries in the kingdoms of Europe - particularly for the commoners.<br>  <br>  Most would probably eat whatever was available and within their financial means and time constraints.  Grains such as rye, oats, barley, and wheat were staples throughout Europe.  Legumes such as lentils, peas, and navy beans were probably a regular part of the diet as well.  <br>  <br>  Meat of all kinds was always sought after.  Fish, lamb, pork, beef, wild game, goose, duck, chicken, and many more were on the menu.  People of these times did not generally have the same aversion to offal (organ meats) that we see in many modern countries like the United States.  Most did not have the luxury of choosing the finest cuts of meat.  Blood and organs were frequently used in puddings and sausages for a hearty meal.  <br>  <br>  Commoners, particularly in the rural areas, likely incorporated a great deal of foraged food into their diets.  Wild mushrooms, fruits, and plants of all kinds were sought out by any able bodied person.  Wild game such as squirrel, pigeon/dove, geese, fish, and others were likely taken, provided the noble on whose lands the people lived did not outlaw such practices.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Pardon the intrusion, but I just had to say, "If it ain't baroque, don't fix it!"<br>  <br>  Sorry.<br>  <br>  And now, back to your program...|`|zEoRcL91aa	Sausages washed down with beer like today.

Its a technical question but Buddha was born in a province of India which is part of Nepal today|`|m6FPXCeuaa	Buddha was born around 565 B.C. in Lumbini in modern day Nepal. His name 'Siddhattha Gautama,' means 'descendant of Gotama whose aims are achieved/who is efficacious in achieving aims', he later became the Buddha (literally Enlightened One or Awakened One). He is also commonly known as 'Shakyamuni' or 'Sakyamuni' (lit. "The sage of the Shakya clan") and as the Tathagata (lit. "thus come" or "thus gone"). Gautama was a contemporary of Mahavira.
qDSvOOwBaa	My teenage years didn't begin until the very end of the 60's counterculture movement. I remember that it helped shy kids like myself find a way to be more social. You must understand that we teens then had-school-work-family and that was it. There was really nothing else to do except--cars and girls. The music and it's ability to blend different groups such as studious and shy like myself and outgoing and rebellious into a common theme--We Want More. We all wanted something else and the radio was where we got it.<br>  This might be an important point. As we all went in separate direction-some like myself into history and writing others into the political rebellious movement still others into business and the armed forces.

DiRI58buaa	The story of the ring is shortly this, You find a ring that makes you invisible.  How would you act then?<br>  <br>  Glaucon says that if you were to find such a ring, you should steal and rape and do what ever you can get away with.  Why not? he says.  After all, you  could never be caught.  So Glaucon is saying that your life would be better for YOU(not for the world, or anyone else) if you could be unjust and not suffer the consequences that usually come with it.<br>  <br>  So in the real world, Glaucon would have you just appear to be just and fair while behaving just as you would with the ring.  That way people will be less likely to notice your unjust acts and you will reap the benefits of just actions(admiration, trust, maybe power) and unjust actions(more money, more power, etc).  So look like a saint to the public and actually be the biggest bastard.

jA1nfMeyaa	I took it as another social commentary on the human condition.  Pretty much your basic dystopian novel.  The epidemic blindness was a clever way of showing the potential for violence and disorder as well as compassion and rationality that we human beings are capable of.
AA12181796	Cons:<br>  <br>  - It's poorly-written. Most of the book is cliched purple prose. Several words are used too much and/or completely incorrectly. Meyer's handle on grammar is non-existent, and the plot holes are so wide that you can pick at something on practically every page.<br>  <br>  - There's no actual plot. It's Bella and Edward staring at each other and arguing about who is more important to who, despite the fact that they barely know each other and their relationship is so superficial that it wouldn't exist if he wasn't attractive and she didn't smell delicious. And then there's a bit of contrived action tacked on, that lasts about fifty pages. Fifty pages, out of over four-hundred.<br>  <br>  - It's hard to decide who is more irritating, Bella or Edward. They're both kill-it-dead Mary Sues. Bella is whiny and bitchy and stupid and boring. Edward is arrogant and condescending and abusive and a stalker. None of these flaws are ever acknowledged; we're supposed to find them both wonderful and special. As previously mentioned, though, Meyer is such a crap writer that she hasn't even the skill to show them being wonderful and special, and settles instead for just telling us they are, which really doesn't work.<br>  <br>  - It teaches that Edward, the abusive stalker, is perfect and romantic, and that girls should act like Bella, the insipid doormat. It teaches that the most important thing is looks. It teaches that without your boyfriend, you're nothing. Those are extremely unhealthy ideals to put out, and worse, people are taking them on board.<br>  <br>  <br>  The pros:<br>  <br>  - The covers are pretty.<br>  <br>  <br>  That's all.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	For people who have nothing to compare to, the book seems great. <br>  But for more mature readers who want quality, this book just does not deliver. The characters are shallow, the plot is boring, and not believable. Experienced readers expect much more from an author than to kill time. We want depth, we want to be moved.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Because it's so poorly written. There are no plot complications (it keeps looking like there are going to be, but they all just get out of the way at the last minute), and Bella gets everything she wants. Plus there's no reason whatsoever for Edward and Bella to even like each other. They have nothing in common. Relationships aren't like this. It's like Cinderella for twelve year olds.|`|0fuF2sHbaa	It's a good story, and an easy read but it's very badly written (the film is even worse, the acting was terrible) and there are even typos in the 3rd book. <br>  <br>  Oh, and Stephanie thinks wolves 'purr' to show contentment (somewhere in the second/third book, I think) . I don't know if she's ever had a dog or not, but when a canine "purrs" it's not a good thing. <br>  <br>  The film was too rushed, too slow at the beginning, fast at the end. it didn't really make sense either, I think only people who read the books understood it properly. <br>  <br>  Pros to the book - Easy to read so suitable for young audiences, quite a gripping story (because it's so easy to read, you don't need to think about it too much and there's a lot of action), original twist on a traditional plot line.<br>  <br>  Cons - Badly written and badly edited. A lot of people find how it went from no sex to a lot of sex a con and a but corny. Only a couple of the books were interesting. Making people think everybody should love the beautiful rich people isn't really a good example for young children. <br>  <br>  Pros to the film - Really good if you're a Twilight fan, some scenes are good.. Um. Nice sound track.<br>  <br>  Cons - Acting, lighting, directing, scripts, some of the actors. Nothing exciting, just so so. I don't think anybody would like it if the books hadn't been such a big hit.|`|RjyNInW6aa	I think it was well written but it was to gushy and romantic. I mean seriously who wants to read a book where she likes then she doesn't then she does an so on.<br>  <br>  Come on it wasn't that bad. Teens would read it easily because of the "bad plot".|`|3WCXGRaGaa	Ive read Twilight, and i just hate it because of people personaliy ideas that Twilight is the best book ever made (not ever Twilight fan. as you can tell from the qustions if there are any other books like Twilight out there) But I dont hate Twilight, i just am not reading it anymore because i got caught up in my own books that make me feel more like me, and the story is told diffenenly. I do love books that are written in first person. But my taste is more Sad and really depressing or have good sex scences like Crank or Burned has by Ellen Hopkines. I dont like Twilight for one reasone well i guess you could say a few. One because it seems to be so much better then other books now, its not better you just like it better hten others doesnt mean everyone is going to agree with you, and the clothing line i mean, if the book is that good, then you shouldnt have something to by to make it more money. like Stuff by Duff that went down in about one year after it was show where i lived, a small city stop being in love with hairly(sp?) a good book is made by the writting not the product line. and the number of annoying Question on here also bugs people's ideas about the book, i mean im probably guno get thumbs down for these but you have still 1000 qustions about "Term Edward!! or Team Jaocb!" on here and its just sad or 1000 qustions about "midnight sun" -sighs- but the books are "good" But not everyone going to agree because everyone has there own taste. some people like horror like SK some people like funny books, or books like the Sisterhood of the traviliing pants. or anything else the books are really up to them.... you cant bug someone into liking your books and compareing them to other books also annoyes people to hell. i'll make it clear TWILIGHT AND HARRY POTTER ARE NOT THE ******* SAME! Twilight and harry potter arent because one: Twilight a love story, Harry potter a action! there no goosh love storys, only a tiny hint, but not like full blow like Twilight "Oh harry i want you so bad" Type of stuff in it. and also Twilight and Romeo and Julite arent the same, because one Romeo adn Julite is a Play! a fricking play, a play a book, same? no. another reason Romeo and Julite both dye.... as bad as it sounds they both do. they both kill themselfs after romeo came ot vists julites grave. Edward and bella almost do when bella goes cliff jumpping or something but instand she hits her head and edward finds out later and he thinks she killed herself so he does, but she comes and stops him, (that would have been a fine ending btw) so ya, its not the same... and I think people where saying ink heart was the same, ya no... they can read people out of books, thats not the same! so ya...<br>  <br>  and most peopel criticize the book because all bella sounds like a whinny little girl, i mean okay your with "Mr. hottie" of the school, Yet you have more time to compare about your life then be with a guy that cares about you? oh and you get depressed after he tells you, you guys cant have sex. like i mean in the book he explaines to her taht htey cant have sex because he well kill her, yet she keeps pushing it.. i mean im a teenage girl im 17 i was depressed, but i was also raped and my dad used to beat me, i have more happness then her flat personaly does. Thats one of the reasons why people also hate her books becuase SM makes girls sound depressed & honry and nothing makes us happy, and where never happy. like i know she got it from a dream, once again that well be pointed out, but most of us TEENAGED girls dont stay depressed, and i dont know i cant remember the book but im pretty sure she wanted to go there, her mom offer to take her. so ya. she has no reason to seem like her mom and new husbon wanted her away so they could do bad stuff all the time. she pick to go!  SO ya thats another reason why. and people are pissed off at her idea of vampires, Spakly and they dont kill people, or drink human blood. there are shows taht where on t.v. before that had a guy and he went ot blood banks and got blood from there... and ya|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Anyone who thinks it's great just hasn't had much exposure to real literature. If you had, the answer would be self-explanatory.<br>  <br>  -- It's very poorly written. Meyer's prose is repetitive and clumsy. Telling us page after page after page how Edward is the most beautiful, most perfect Adonis of a man does not move the story along. (How a pasty-skinned vampire is so "hot," though, is beyond me.) A good editor would have probably cut these books in half.<br>  <br>  -- The characters are badly developed. Bella is a cardboard cutout. She's what literary critics call a Mary Sue -- a character that exists mainly as a vehicle for wish fulfillment, usually as a way for the author to insert himself or herself into the story. The fact that her character is so empty is what allows young readers to so easily step into the role and "identify" with Bella, because what young girl hasn't felt awkward and not pretty, and who among them wouldn't die for some "perfect" man to fawn over them and tell them how wonderful they are? But it doesn't make for a good character -- it just feeds the reader's narcissism.<br>  <br>  -- The storyline is not believable. Stop and think about it for a minute -- a 100-year-old vampire falls madly in love with a plain, clumsy 17-year-old girl who, by her own admission, is nothing special? And why -- because her blood smells yummy? I have nothing against fantasy stories, but you have to come up with a good reason for the protagonists to fall in love.<br>  <br>  -- Speaking of which, one of the greatest failings of this series is that it gives impressionable young girls a very skewed concept of what love is. What Bella and Edward have is not an idealized, perfect love. It's more characterized by control and obsession. Edward isn't the perfect boyfriend -- he's a stalker.<br>  <br>  -- And the whole thing sets feminism back about 50 years ... because what lesson does Meyer keep driving home, except that a woman is nothing without a man to make her whole and complete? Bella is a weak Damsel In Distress who can't do anything without Edward to swoop in and save her every time she trips over a crack in the sidewalk. Honestly, I find the characterization insulting, even as a man. Young girls deserve a much better female role model than this.<br>  <br>  None of it would bother me so much, if young girls weren't becoming so completely obsessed over the series. A lot of them want this to be their reality, but it's a very unhealthy example to follow.|`|7CHt3IE1aa	I haven't read Twilight, so God knows I'm probably stepping into a minefield . . .<br>  <br>  From what I'm told, it isn't an especially well-written book, but I also understand that it is a novel that is aimed at teenagers, whose literary tastes and expectations are usually not as sophisticated as older people. It's like Harry Potter.; J.K. Rowling's target audience are kids, and yet for some reason her work is reviewed by the same people who are reviewing the shortlist for the Booker Prize.<br>  <br>  I'm a big fan of choice- there's plenty of room for 'serious' books where grammer, structure and characterisation are the most important things, but a lot of people are bored by this- I take my writing seriously, but I find most of the 'good' books to be extremely boring; I like crime stories with lots of violence, so a story about posh people having dinner parties is always going to bore the socks off me no matter how well-written it is.<br>  <br>  I think that we also tend to forget that both Meyer and Rowling have inspired a generation of younger readers. Publishing may be a shrinking market, but they have both done a great deal to popularise fiction among a younger audience, and I feel like the industry owes them both a great deal.<br>  <br>  Please don't think that I'm being opatronising; I'm not trying to imply that teenagers are dumb. If you like Twilight, then don't let anybody spoil it for you.

He elminated the aristocracy, and stopped the reign of terror.<br>  <br>  He convinced them that the French Empire should spread throughout Europe, to destroy enemies of the state that would restore the Bourbons to power. (which England actually did, following Napoleon's defeat).<br>  <br>  So, the Napoleonic Codes actually were welcomed, or at least tolerated as a small price for restoring France as a world power, and bringing about more "rights" to the lower classes.<br>  Because Napoleon ended Feudalism and the power of the Catholic church (anti-clericism), the poor would follow him anywhere.  He was their national hero.<br>  <br>  The French Code included many modern changes, that were adopted by Europe, including the metric system.<br>  From Wikipedia:<br>  > it is considered the first successful codification  and strongly influenced the law of many other countries. The Code, with its stress on clearly written and accessible law, was a major step in establishing the rule of law. Historians have called it "one of the few documents which have influenced the whole world."<<|`|AA11323310	The Napoleonic Code is still in place today in France. There may have been a few amendments as France has modernised - but in essence they still exist.|`|LcfcxG3Jaa	They all liked the chocolate and vanilla, but barely did they touch the strawberry ice cream.

It could mean that you are describing a loss love or loved one or even a loss of a child . Although it is sad it is also beautiful  so keep on writing. Hope this helps  Take care Knell 22|`|328bHxFkaa	i think its very emotional, and understanding .<br>  hmmm. by the way i saw your poem <br>  on a lot of Q's|`|HkXYGAOdaa	Wow!  Wonderfully expressive.  10/10|`|UU2hTE0aaa	Quite good.<br>  <br>  "Love ain't just blind, it's also lame"  explains it all.
NYU37jfGaa	Th eplague struck very quickly, and people usually died very quickly.  children would have died in large numbers, being more vulnerable to infection.  then, as now, people were concerned to save their children.  In his diary Samuel Pepys wrote about seeing a naked child being passed out of the window of a house:<br>  <br>  "It was the child of a citizen in Gracious Street, a saddler, who had buried all the rest of his children of the plague, he and his wife being now shut up indesair of escaping, did desire only to save the life of this little child; and so prevailed to have it received stark naked into the arms of a friend, who brought it, having put it into new fresh clothes, to Greenwich, where, upon hearing the story, we did agree it should bepermitted to be received and kept in the town."<br>  <br>  The village of Eyam in Derbyshire was affected by the plague when someone recieved a parcel of clothing from London, and the infection spread.  The villagers bravely decided to isolate themselves to prevent the disease spreading to other parishes.  260 people died, including many children.  One woman, a farmer called Elizabeth Hancock, lost her husband and all six of her children.<br>  <br>  It is doubtful whether 'ring o roses' actually had anything to do with the plague.  The version of the song that we are familiar with apparently dates from the 18th century, some time after the plague.  Earlier versions of the song are quite different.|`|VdhdleBTaa	well people used Posies , flowers to put in front of their faces because the stench of dead bodies...was so overwelming...bodies had to wait to be buried...kids got desensitized to the Black Plague...they made up the nusery rhyme when they were playing...because so many of them were dying...it was a fact of life...ashes ashes we all fall down..applies to cremation.|`|K1HGtB3maa	They died.
WhUV9k6Jaa	Take it for what it is.  It's pop lit.  The good news is you know it's not for you and don't have to pick up another of his books.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	His proof reader is the pits. He even missed the fact that if you go into a main line station in Paris, close to the Stock Exchange and the Opera, you do not emerge from the same station into an 'industrial, immigrant area' - presumably Gare du Nord.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Why does everything have to always be in superlatives these days?<br>  <br>  He's not a great writer, but "most annoying ever" is a little harsh. At least a decent movie came out of "The da Vinci Code," but yeah, the writing leaves much to be desired.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Because he's writing about stuff that we have no way of knowing is true or not. I don't think he should be messing around with questions about whether Jesus married Mary Magdalene. I'm perfectly at home wondering if that could have happened, but for Brown to be making millions of dollars from it seems sacrilegious.|`|cwzH7DVvaa	Maybe because he can't write.<br>  I know, I have some major issues with the style. It's really crude and not a pleasure to read at all. There's no beauty, no art in it at all. Euurk.|`|uth8Ztbdaa	The only thing that annoys me about Dan Brown is how long it's taking him to publish The Solomon Key.|`|EBHHCP86aa	He has half an idea, clouds it in plausible explantions, most of them wide of the mark and dresses them up as a thriller.<br>  Annoying, as the Knights Templar and The Holy Grail have fascinating histories to them, but Dan Brown only took a touch of the most sensational bit and jazzed it up.<br>  IMO, the film was poor and saved only by the cast.|`|35353489b00fc04be077d15848483f0aaa	I agree with the questioner except substitute "boring" for "annoying"  His writing style is also trite and hackneyed but, as one answerer has indicated, you select an author whose books match your own preferences; Dan Brown doesn't fit my particular preferences.  But, as his worldwide sales indicate, thousands would not agree.|`|RrB51Mq4aa	I think half of it comes down to professional jealousy for the way a book that wasn't beautifully written had been screamed over by the millions of people who grabbed it at the airport at the start of a vacation. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed it. The sour grapes come from far better writers that probably can't understand why their work which in their minds is a far better and well critiqued hasn't put 200 million in their bank accounts. The other half is from the people that just jump on the bandwagon.|`|x4xaqrpCaa	Well, In this case<br>  Thats your thoughts..I have no write to change your thoughts babe. Dan Brown isnt annoying. Maybe he just thinks that is an interesting topic to talk about. Its his writting style. <br>  <br>  Example: Your writting style could be about wicca or something and someone else thinks its dumb. Oh well, Then, your just going to have to deal with that|`|N8cAwzxzaa	Dan Brown isn't annoying, he write page turners, he just not very good under scrutiny.<br>  I mean, the man described the wind over some catacombs as sounding like 'someone blowing over the top of a bottle'... it was supposed to be atmospheric.|`|aQNtoCYsaa	He's not.<br>  And you have a choice.<br>  To read or not to read.<br>  No one is forcing you to read his books.|`|9Pbm8e0Oaa	You obviously haven't read Terry Pratchett, he'll make you think Dan Brown is a fabulous writer. It's all a matter of personal preference though.<br>  <br>  G.W.K
bdfk2d49aa	English: Language most spoken where I live.<br>  French: To understand the other stuff written on my toothpaste and coffee creamer, eh.<br>  Latin: Same reason as yours. That sounds familiar, by the way. Though I'm kinda lost as to where you got that...<br>  <br>  - Silly JC|`|gP11453Waa	1.  The language of peace, love and understanding.  That one could foster a bit of hope for the world and this viral thing we call mankind.<br>  <br>  2.  The one language we have all adopted and learned fluently--and passionately--for with just one language for all, we might actually communicate before we annihilate. <br>  <br>  3.  The language of the Earth, of Nature, of all that is around us so that we can attune ourselves and be a good part of all that we call Environment.<br>  <br>  <br>  Okay, real world time.  I guess the three would be (subject to change):<br>  <br>  1.  English, if only because it is so widely spoken and because so much of the world's commerce (not just the money kind of commerce) is keyed to that language.<br>  <br>  2.  Chinese, again because it is spoken by so many people and because I love the sound of spoken Chinese and the look of it when written.<br>  <br>  3.  Various Native American languages would be on this list, and here I name them as one although they vary considerable.  I'd like to be able to communicate with the elders who remain and with those who continue the languages.  This would include some of the less-used languages such as Biloxi.<br>  <br>  Good question.  You get a star!|`|zJ8ZpZZIaa	Interesting question. Of course, I would choose English because it is quite possibly the most fundamental language; Spanish, because the tremendous number of hispanic immigrants to the U.S. (In about 10-15 years, if not sooner, I wouldn't be surprised if Spanish would be the second national language); and various oriental languages, because I have somewhat of a fascination with Asian culture.|`|123cb0f60a65c8151ec27e589a993e7faa	i would like to know "objective metaphysics" ( E.g. the quasi-math formulae like O ~ C, and the rest!)<br>  <br>   Standard math( so that i could follow and perhaps re-new Godel's famous proof, that arithmetic/math is Incomplete(prooved,thus it will always be "incomplete"/incomplete !!!)<br>  <br>   And last but not least,some old-english-logic words; for not only are these words "beautiful"(!) but also because of their relevance to the real and new,meaning of a reasoned sentence!|`|GQyWlbKfaa	Well, mine would be English coz most the world speaks it, Mandarin coz my mum's chinese and Spanish coz i have been to Colombia and Spain and really love the language.|`|sb0ldGYwaa	Probably English, Chinese, and Spanish since most of the world can communicate in at least one of these languages or a slight variant.|`|AA10729675	Sanskrit, Greek, and English.  Not because English is spoken in the USA, but because English is a really subtle language.|`|IGbNlvRnaa	English (basic language), Mandarin (my ethnicity) and German(lots of philosophers are German, and it would be cool to read their books in German)!  : )
rDb9ZLyfaa	They went to synagogues and told the rabbis to give him the list of Jews at the temple.<br>  <br>  In Germany itself, from 1933 onwards, a large section of the population had to prove that it was NOT Jewish. For most purposes one had to produce certificates of baptism for oneself, one's parents and grandparents, all showing infant baptism. All over Germany, priests and pastors got letters asking for certificates of baptism and it is to their shame that the churches obliged! <br>  <br>  If someone was under suspicion he/she had to deliver the "ariernachweis" which traced the pedigree back three generations. In WWII there were some (mostly White Russian) "physiognomes" who claimed they could detect ashkenazim (eastern Jews) facial features, so they would denounce them to the Nazis. The latter I've read about in connection with southern France.|`|c10c4f4e1377a11a019382d90637eb90aa	In part, they abused the open system of religious registration which the Germans have always used (and still do) for paying for Churches. A local tax is paid for the upkeep of churches and one can opt for it to go to the Lutheran or Catholic churches. Germany has never been a secular country like France. Upon German unification, the system was put in place to unify the formerly predominantly Lutheran or Catholic states. In the former Soviet Union and parts of Eastern Europe invaded by the Nazis, Jewishness was seen as an ethnicity. Soviet citizens, for example, carried ID cards with the mention Russian, Kazakh, Jewish, Latvian etc.|`|eh8JpNCJaa	It wasn't hard to find out.<br>  Jews had there own Jewish family names, (like Cohen Levi)<br>  And even if they changed there names there grand fathers and great grandfathers had Jewish names.<br>  So even if you were a Christian but had a Jewish grandfather, you would, you know...<br>  <br>  and i bet they had many more ways to find who is jewish... and i bet many people who were not really jewish, were included as jews|`|V7jycPqdaa	Many ways,like being told by informers,also the jewish leaders gave the nazis lists of their own people.With the men by their circumcised penis.A lot of them gave themselves up as they thought they were going to work in other countries.|`|70779fc8be56b4fef53f1f0089247dd7aa	well people above the nazi had to find who was jewish in order to order them to put stars on thier shirts. and secondly they stole the book in the synaguges  that shows all the members of that particular area|`|TV47lmZ3aa	they were quite cunning in that they formed a census and ordered people to put their faith down too, unaware of what would later happen|`|a1gSZzoyaa	they had yellow stars on their coats. Plus they had mostly brown hair and brown eyes...usually|`|Twvbu4fxaa	they asked everybody to remove their clothes...and then...it was all clear!!!|`|EBqFpZbjaa	In Germany, Jews were listed as such at time of birth, thus it was very easy for the Nazis to know who was Jewish.  In addition, the Nazis ordered all Jews to wear the Yellow Star of King David, which singled them out as they went about.<br>  <br>  In Holland there were no lists of Jews as such, but the Nazis got around this by simply asking the entire population to register and at time of registering they were asked about their ancestry.  Thus, anyone Jewish had to put this down on the paper etc.|`|7fGgQ88Qaa	They made all Jews wear stars. <br>  Also most jews back then looked from the same origin,<br>  for the most part, they didn't know. <br>  But it was a cruel thing, and they didn't really care about killing the innocent.|`|DBVJ7AIMaa	Apart from the obvious yellow star they wore, male Jews were all circumcised, which made it very difficult to pass for a Christian if they tried to hide.<br>  The Nazis also had a very 'scientific' way of determining who was Jewish. They measured their heads, ears and especially noses! If you had a long nose you were Jewish.<br>  You also had to provide a background relating to parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. <br>  As most Jew lived in a Jewish area it eas easier for them to be identified, especially when they had local people telling them who was Jewish.|`|UuQAPHJtaa	They actually passed laws, the Nuremberg law, which classified race within Nazi Germany similar to the discredited pseudoscience of Eugenics.<br>  <br>  Someone with 3 Jewish grandparents was classified as a 'full' Jew, someone with two Jewish grandparents was classified as a Mischling, a crossbreed, of "mixed blood".<br>  <br>  The Laws were instigated to 'protect German blood' but in effect they where used to classify who was a Jew and who was not.<br>  <br>  Reinhard Hydrich, the architect of the final solution, was dogged throughout his Nazi career with rumours of having a Jewish grandparent, which would not have sent him to the death camps, but would have stopped his membership of the SS.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Generally, the onus was on a person suspected of being Jewish to prove that he/she WASN'T Jewish.<br>  <br>  There were lots of ways they used to determine if someone was a Jew or not:<br>  <br>  1) Facial features. Nazi pseudo-scientists used things like nose size and shape to determine Jewishness.<br>  2) Family history.<br>  3) Synagogue attendance.<br>  4) Circumcised penis (for males). In Europe, only Jews (and now Muslims) practice circumcision.<br>  <br>  And so on...|`|AA11304025	jewish men have the penis mutilated as babies.<br>  This is called circumcision

But, it has won the booker of the bookers, so you might check it out if you are interested.<br>  <br>  Vikram seth's books are also good. But they are very huge.<br>  <br>  Then there is a bitish writer, " William Dalrymple". He has written a lot of facinating books, but he is a historian, and his books are often about history, but its Indian history and not boring. He wrote a love story, "The last mughal"(about love between a muslim princess in pudah and a british officer, very interesting) and lots of other books about mughals. They are nice..<br>  <br>  'The hungry tide' by Amitav Ghosh<br>  <br>  'India: From Midnight to Millennium' by Shashi Tharoor<br>  <br>  Most of Inidan books are acedemic. Even in fiction.

'Chicken soup's' cllection is also very good.<br>  <br>  The above Indian books are almost all about serious issues or history though they are fun, except chetan bhagat,which is pure fun.<br>   <br>  Three are also original fiction and fanfction websites on internet.

NmzWCCdLaa	Brilliant, very descriptive. I can picture all of this happening. Remember to open the next paragraph with confusion or disoriantation like "through my bleary eyes... " or something along those lines when you next write as that person.<br>  <br>  This is the sort of thing that is usefull in demonstating decription in text. I want to hear the rest of your story!|`|xAYR7eevaa	You have few mistakes and it's hard to understand what's going on.

rV1uAtt3aa	Maybe.  <br>  <br>  If you love to write, then you should through yourself into it up to your neck.  Writing isn't about being successful or great; it's about pleasing yourself.  If you keep at it, you'll get really good.  There's a lot to learn, though.  Even the best writers learn to be better all their lives.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of great books on writing.  One is _Beginnings, Middles and Ends_.  Go to the local library or book store and start reading them.<br>  <br>  Also, read a lot in the genre you wish to write in.  You'll absorb a lot just by doing that.<br>  <br>  Finally, take classes and join writing groups (there are some on the Internet, but the best are in person.)  Check out your local library bulletin board or visit some of your local bookstores and ask them if they know of any groups.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|y8DLyE5raa	I definitely think you have potential, you show great detail.

AA10255553	They want their music to be appreciated by a wider international audience, so English it is.|`|qq5nceCXaa	They don't, some do songs in Norwegian especially during their earlier phases<br>  <br>  There is a common tendency for bands to sing in English and that's not just limited to black metal.  A lot of that comes from the root of such music, especially rock, metal, rap and so on.  Kids grow up listening to songs written in English and that's their image of how it should be.<br>  <br>  Of course many groups also want a wider public and as there's only 4.5 million people in Norway singing p? norsk can be career limiting.|`|ipbntijlaa	im an american and i live in france, and ive noted that all the bands here that are serious sing in english, because they know that quite frankly, its much easier to get famous that way
ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	I have no answer for your gizmo question, but have you ever considered the idea of playing an acoustic guitar and creating a recognizable song from it? A guitarist doesn't have to have stomp boxes and big amplifiers to become expert at the instrument.<br>  <br>  Most young players think that the amplifier with all its distortions and chorus affects make the guitarist when, in reality, it is making music without such impediments. I have played electric guitar during my professional years for the required amplification for the gatherings, but continue to enjoy the simplistic, yet arduous music-making on an acoustic.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	See if you can get a Tech 21 Sans Amp GT2 off of e-bay.|`|0vfX40Qxaa	You might want to try a multi effects pedal,  it will give you a wide variety of sounds, effects and features like tuners, amp and cabinet modeling, and even drum machines, plus they are often programmable .  There are many good ones in your price range.<br>  check some out here;<br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/navigation/guitar-multi-effects?N=100001+338523+7" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/navig...</a><br>  <br>  If you can go to a music shop and try some of them out.|`|rFmBtm3eaa	On a budget around $100 you can't go wrong with a ZOOM G2G. Man they rock. Start with a distortion pedal first because it will make a HUGE impact on your sound and you can use it to drive the wah when you get one. You won't be sorry.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah and after reading some of the comments here I have to say, don't let anyone tell you what kind of music you should play, ever.|`|Cpp1LddVaa	First of all, I doubt if $100 will get you anything useful unless you get lucky on e-bay or something.<br>  <br>  To give yourself more flexibility, you might want to look into some kind of pedal and "stomp box" combination.<br>  <br>  Is there a good music store close to you? If so, it would make sense to visit, spend some time with people who work there  and try out different options to see what meets your needs best.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes.|`|87086c6cad9ce7af4604e2d63d888e5aaa	Well, this is going to be a bit complicated. Honestly, when it comes to music, I've always been a purist - if you can't get the tone you want out of your amp, then you need a new amp. Pedals are nice and all, and it really is awesome being able to control the tone via a foot board, but many good modern amps have that capability. Every time you run your signal through an additional foot board, it weakens the signal, and even though you can boost it with (guess what) a signal booster, the fact is that the more you do that, the more digital it becomes, and the less nuances you can coax from the sound.<br>  <br>  If you can wait a while, I suggest saving up more money and getting a Vox AC30. I play in a progressive rock band called de la Rosa (www.myspace.com/delarosacollective ), and the tones I'm required to get out my amp range from massive feedback to subtle jazzy reverb. If you can wait, definitely get this. Used by Brian May of Queen and often the members of Mars Volta/De Facto, so you can't go wrong with that.<br>  <br>  If you absolutely need a pedal NOW and can't wait, you have choices. Reverb is nice, but again, most standard amps should have this. Wah is cool, but pretty useless unless you've mastered their use, which could take forever, and at this stage in your guitar education, it's pretty pointless to muddy the signal.<br>  <br>  So you're in the market mostly for distortion. Good pedals to use are:<br>  <br>  The Standard "Grunge/Metal" Pedal, The Boss DS-1. The sound is prevalent in artists like Satriani and Muse, and was in fact the pedal used to record Smells Like Teen Spirit. <br>  <br>  As far as something much heavier, I'd go for the Rocktron Zombie Rectified Distortion Pedal. It's stereo, which is useless with just one amp, but really, the distortion just...is unbeatable for the genre. Great for metal and thrash, Marilyn Manson/Deicide stuff.<br>  <br>  My favorite though is really ironic, seeing as how I love "grunge" music, yet despise the term. The DigiTech Grunge Distortion Pedal is really a unique pedal in that it has really one tone, but multiple colorations of it. What I mean is that it has one sound, but a million ways to get to it, from screaming highs to chuggified lows. Really my favorite.<br>  <br>  Go to musiciansfriend.com, they have a ton of pedals and samples of them in action for you to decide. Good luck from a long time guitarist!

Meggie couldn't have said if it was gray or very fair.  ...
