Unless you have surveyed every house in the US and differentiated between those who received a couple of swats on a clothed bottom from those who were literally beaten and are bruised?      (For the record, I'm not a spanking parent, but I do see the difference between a spanking and abusive hitting.)

My son's pancreas is failing and it's been suggested that I start to lactate and provide for him. he isn't making what it take to digest fats. I'm told that breast milk has more easily digested fats and the enzymes he is missing. He is also lacking antibodies. Also, he is adopted, but we are the same blood type. I will do what ever it takes to give him the best chance at life.      Any suggestions?      BTW, I won't nurse him, just pump and use a sippy cup.

He fusses when I pick him up to change his diaper.(kicking his feet and crying)  If you tell him he can't have something he cries. It seems to be getting a little worse. Is he just testing his limits? And if so how do I respond to the little fits? My husband says to pop him on the top of his hand and put him in his room till he stops. But when he gets in his room he will scream bloody murder. His temper is really showing and I don't want to teach him the wrong thing. I want to teach him to control his anger the right way.Not make it worse. He knows what I am saying he is a very smart boy.  Just hope you guys have some advise for me. Thanks everyone.

20090227044156AAS72xd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Faint positive pregnancy tests don't always mean your preg.?	i spent two weeks trying to figure out if my missing period meant i was pregnant. i took 6 pee test before i was able to make it to my doc to get a solid answer. the first was a faint pos, the rest were all neg. people keept saying even a faint positve is a poitive and means your pregnant. i know people here are not medical staff, but in all fairness i thought someone should say that if you get a faint pos and a bunch of negs, the faint pos could be a faulty test. i'm not saying that all faint positives mean nothing, just that it can't be trusted and that another test or doc should be consulted.      i'm not pregnant, and i didn't have an early misscarrage. just got a faulty test and a late period. - a faint pos isn't a solid answer, it's an inconclusive answer.       -hoping this helps anyone who needs to hear it.

My partner and I are healthy and very active. We recently decided that we were gonna TTC.  For the past year or so he's always used the pull out method and I've NEVER gotten pregnant so for a while I though that something could be wrong with me. So, I went to the doc and had ultrasounds done and everything was normal. My cycles are irregular so it's hard for me to tell when i'm ovulating. I did some investigating online and it said my most fertile day was this weekend, but other websites say my most fertile day was yesterday. I'm not sure it's all confusing.       This weekend though, i had some discharge so i'm sure that I was ovulating then.       We had sex    Friday-pulled out   Saturday (3 times he pulled out twice)   Sunday (pulled out)   Monday (came inside me)   Wednesday (pulled out)      he says he's just used to pulling out!!      what are my chances of being pregnant? is there something i'm doing wrong? I'm taking prenatal vitamins and i'm trying to stay super healthy.   I'm not on ANY type of BC.      LAST PERIOD: Feb. 7-12 Jan 26th Dec. 23rd.

I am all for the Joseph now and was for the Samuel but now I dont want to have to go through the " big sam lil sam" just like "big shane lil shane". The names that I like for boys are few.

20090227051104AAIUBsr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 5 week old is throwing up large amounts with no other symptoms. Is this normal?	My son just turned 5 weeks yesterday and for the past week or so he has been throwing up large amount of his formula. When he does this it tends to shoot out of his mouth and can go as far as a foot away from where he is sitting/laying. He has no other symptoms and is a very happy, content baby. He never cries unless he is hungry (he doesn't even cry when he throws up). He is also still wetting about 6 diapers a day and usually has one good bowel movement a day. I switched him to the Similac sensitive formula a couple of weeks ago because he had gas. The gas has subsided but the vomiting has only increased. Is a newborn throwing up in large quantities like that normal if they have no other symptoms and are totally content the rest of the time? Any input would be appreciated. Thanks!

My boyfriend and I had unprotected sex the 14th and 15th. My last period was the 28th of October and my cycles are about 30 days long. Yesterday and today I have felt sick and I have small twingy cramps on and off and when I last went to the bathroom I had a lot of yellowish/white discharge. It's quite a bit. No smell, no itch so I know it's probably not an infection. Did anyone get this in early pregnancy? I have a son, but I can't remember it I was pregnant about 2 years ago lol. I remember with my son I never bled at all, and I havent had any spotting and I usually don't have so much discharge before my period it just kinda comes whenever pretty much full on and my cramps are 10x's worse with a period, these are just an uncomfortable feeling which started last night, no matter what I did I couldnt get comfortable. Thanks for any help anyone can give!

When I found out I was pregnant I was excited, my boyfriend of 5 months was shocked at first (because of our financial situation and the fact we just signed a lease for a small bachelors apt) but was excited after, but all of our friends and his family except his parents thought i did it to trap him into staying with me, when he was the one who chose not to wear a condom and knew i wasn't on the pill. needless to say we're happy with our son and we don't care about their opinions but do ppl really think this......I don't think you can trap someone into staying with you, if they didn't want to be with you a baby woudn't keep them there, i think if they wanted the baby they'd arrange some kind of custody arrangement.....

For some reason it became a girl's name too, then when Paris Hilton became so well known it became only known to be a girl's name.      It's actually a Greek name and many stories hold paris as a boy. Like the Trojan Prince Paris, and Count Paris from Romeo and Juliet. Plus a romantic city, which in my opinion should still be a boy's only name.      Check it out, only one little boy in Babynames' pictures has the name Paris.  http://babynames.com/name/PARIS          ***I'm NOT naming my child this, boy or girl.

I lost 4 of them last month alone. I have had some morning sickness to the point where I cant eat at night (which in theory would make you lose weight bc im not eating before bed) and I also eat more fruits with this baby. I have also started walking a 30 minute mile(maybe 3 times a week), so nothing too major. I have hypoglycemia and not my dr is telling me to eat candy bars and junk food as much as I can. Im really not sure thats good advice either. im kinda overweight anyways (im 5'2, 148lbs) so I think the weight loss is because i am trying to be healthier (not diet bc trust me i eat on the hour, but usually fruits and such). so I guess what I'm saying is am I doing the right thing or should I go on a junk food binge like my dr says (i kinda think hes and idiot and am going to a new dr this month)

20090227054749AA6aWFN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is this normal or is it bordering abusive?	my mother sometimes since i was young has outbursts. not severe ones but she gets very mad. ill post a link to a video clip from a show where a father does a similar thing to his son.      posted this yesterday too, but im looking for any advice i can get. this post has more information      i am 16 now but the first time i remember this happening was when i was 9 or 10. i remember being slapped when i was 5 but i was probably being an ungrateful brat. she would also give me bad looks and i was extremely afraid. when she is mad she goes into my room and takes everything off my desk and out of my closet and throws it on the floor and tells me to clean it up. she has also gotten right in my face while i was sitting down and pinched the outside of my thighs until it bruised (but they were extremely small). i don't remember many events from my childhood so i can not say of the frequency of those events but there was a lot of arguing in my family, sometimes my mother wouldn't speak to me for days as a child. i would also need to comfort her when she was upset when i was younger which i don't mind but it was very nerve wrecking. not comforting for normal things but because i would be mad at her for for example forgetting to do something or calling me a name and i′d get mad and she would say I KNOW EVERYONE HATES ME in an annoyed rude tone and from a young age i would always have to say no its not your fault i love you and stuff like that.      also, she denies many things happened, even though there is clear proof?!      when my sister was anorexic at the age of 14 sh emade her get down to her underwear and take pictures of her while yelling at her      i also feel extremely guilty because my siblngs have worse stories and im the youngest and i dont know why i had a different childhood      sometimes she is extremely happy though just for no reason smiling and acting like shes on weed or somethign and everythings great but that can be ruined within a few minutes      doing the same exact thing can have completely different reaactions       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtbtGvBVc...       anyway, here's the video clip, it starts at 1:30.      thanks to anyone that responds.

20090227060656AAHTQ9X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I be pregnant or not?	I just began birth control this past month. I had a pregnancy test right before beginning the pills., but lately I have been experiencing things that have led me to believe I may be pregnant.  My husband and I haven't been having protected sex, the first few weeks of birth control we did, but not lately.  For about a week now I have been getting these awful stomach aches and back pains that make me feel like I'm going to throw up.  My boobs have become larger, and the left one hurts quite frequently.  I was having my period when I began the birth control, and that lasted up until like 3 days ago. The blood was spotting type toward the end.  I have felt really tired and weak.  Usually I am a big exerciser, but lately, my legs and back hurt so much, I hardly do any.  Last night I had flu-like symptoms where my back and stomach hurt really bad, I felt sick to my stomach, and I had a fever.  I eat a lot, but I have been eating a lot more lately. Also, when I have to pee, I have to pee! I run in the house and if I don't make it to the toilet in time, I just about go.  Do you think I could be pregnant even though I began this birth control?

20090227060551AAWS92I	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	34 weeks with painful pregnancy?	Since I was between 27 and 28 weeks, I've been having pelvic pain. I blew it off as round ligament pain from hormones, but each week it got progressively worse. My hips click and pop and it's worse if I get up from sitting or laying down. Waking up in the morning or in the middle of the night is when it is the worst. This is my third pregnancy and I never experienced this with my other two. The pain feels like a FRACTURE on top of round ligament pain. I can't open my legs very wide and walking is a task that I don't enjoy doing anymore, even if it's to get up and change a diaper. I had a OB appt. yesterday and I got the fresh out of school OB that gave me an attitude, told me to get a belly band to "stop the baby falling out of my vagina feeling", and left the room. I don't feel like the baby is "falling out", it's my pelvic area that is in SEVERE pain. The good experienced OB's are usually booked so I end up getting what is left. I strongly feel like I have SPD and she obviously doesn't believe in diagnosing that or she thinks I'm just another patient complaining of pregnancy aches and pains. This REALLY hurts, I don't know what to do. 34 weeks along and struggling!

Do you think that it is fair some people get stick for not breastfeeding, when sometimes they just CANT..!!       What are your views on this, please elaborate, i'm curious as to what others think?

20090304082639AAIBeK2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents, if you happened to win the lotttery...?	What is the first thing you would do? Would you jump for joy, pass out, or have an internal combustion? Seriously what would you do with your winnings? Would you set up trust funds for the children? Create something (like a business) in their honor? Buy real estate and keep it in their names? Indulge in every little fantasy you've ever had and get the kids endless amount of things. What would you honestly do?       I'll answer since I asked. My very first thing would be to get down on my knees and pray, and thank God over and over. Let's see if the amount was around $200 million (stemming from what hit last night), I would set up trust funds for the children maybe about $10 or $20 million a piece. Even though my parents are on my $hit list I would give them about $10 million to let them do whatever. Same as my sister and her husband. My husband and I would buy a nice home (nothing to lavish) to live comfortably in (we would stay in NJ). Trade the cars we have now for newer ones. I would invest in 3 business ideas I have and I guess put everything else up for savings. So what would you do?

I don't want offend all the Charlottes. But people must know that I made a question about the name Jamie for a female and many rude british people told that this name was only for a male, they also said that is an ugly name, some said a poop name... insulting all the female Jamie's around the world and especially british Jamie's. I supposed these people are very conservative and adore old fashioned british names like Charlotte ( that has the "manly" nickmane Charlie). Why these people reclaimed respect for names like Charlotte and despise female names like Jamie because they aren't very popular in U.K. ( some of these people that insulted Jamie are now reclaimed respect for Charlotte). I don't want to be disrespectful to anyone but I think these rude people must also meditate about their facts.   Sorry, I DON'T want to harm the feelings of any Charlotte but people can give their opinion about a name without being so aggressive.   What do you think? Please, don't be rude!!

20090106050446AAjSM7J	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	About 4 1/2 to 5 weeks pregnant and noticed extremely tiny grayish tisse or discharge?	I went to my OB/GYN yesterday for my first prenatal visit.  I had a pap smear and blood drawn including the hct quantitative test.  I am asked to return in 2 weeks for an Ultrasound.  Came home and still had my usual small light pinkish discharge.  I asked my doctor and he told me that it could be the result of a blood vessel near the cervix area.  As the uterus presses on it can cause it burst causing that slight pinkish discharge.  What scares me now is that I notice for the first time a very very very small grayish looking tissue when I wiped yesterday.  I am a bit alarmed because I have been reading a lot about miscarriages and it says that grayish or pinkish tissue is related to miscarriage. Eventhough I have no severe cramping or bleeding(bright red) Anyone has had that experience.  Please share.  I would gladly appreciate it.

She said that she's glad to be moving because she wants a fresh start but that she'll really miss me. Chances are pretty likely that I will never see her again because she is moving to a different country and then in July I'm also moving to a different country, so we will be on opposite sides of the world. I've moved so many times before. I have a hard time fitting in and getting used to people and then just as I start making really good friends one of us moves and I feel like it's really straining on my emotions. Of course the obvious answer is "all you can do is keep in touch" which I guess is true, but I feel like crying right now. I try to "keep in touch" with all of my friends but we all know that eventual fades and obviously nothing is the same. I'm sorry to be such a downer, but it's true. I don't know what I'm going to do, especially for these next couple of months because I really don't have that many friends at school. I don't know what my question is, I just want to feel better and I'm really hurt. Anything advice that could make me feel better?

Hallo ihr lieben,      da mein Schatz nun vor 4 Tagen gelandet ist und ich am selben Tag wieder zuhause war, stehe ich nun vor einem Problem!      Der kleine Racker bekommt Milchnahrung , er trinkt teilweise schon 70 -80 ml pro Mahlzeit , natürlich ist das zu viel für das B?uchlein , aber er hat vorher nicht das Gefühl satt zu sein und leidet dementsprechend wenn man ihn nicht so viel trinken l?sst!   Das Problem ist aber das sein Magen diese Mengen noch nicht vertr?gt und er natürlich dann wieder spuckt , dann klar wieder gleich hungrig , so geht das den ganzen Tag ,-)   ausser Nachts , da schl?ft er von 2:00 - 8:00 durch!      Wie bekomme ich seine Gier blo? in den Griff , es ist ja nicht Sinn der Sache das er dann wieder alles ausspuckt , weil er so "überfüllt" ist!   Gebe ich ihm weniger weint er und sucht wie verrückt, hat das S?ttigungsgefühl noch nicht erreicht!   Es ist zum verzweifeln.      Kennt das jemand ?   Habt ihr dieses Problem l?sen k?nnen?

Me & my husband are planning for a cruise vacation for 10days in march. we will be flying to Miami from NY. We have 14month toddler and my husband does not want to take him along.

I'm only 18 (and don't plan on having kids anytime soon) but throughout my life I've always known I want to have children. Family is very important to me and I can't wait to one day make one of my own.       So how many children are you planning on having and why did you choose this number? How many girls/boys do you want? Would you want multiples? I sometimes try to think of the way I want my children to be and what values I want them to have. How are you planning on raising them? Any special way?      I think that from my standpoint now (it could change in the years to come) I want a big family- minimum 3, maximum 5-ish, I would say. I would love a big family very much, with a home that is always busy with something going on :)

He has "girlfriend" who also just turned 12. So the day before his birthday she asked me if I could take her to the mall and buy him something. I said ok, cause I have my driver's permit. We were at a store where they sell guy's clothing items and she picked  out a pair of shoes for him that were $10 more than she could afford. So offered to help her pitch in. While I was paying for the shoes, she said she needed to go to the bathroom and I said meet me in the car. So after I buy the shoes and go to the parking lot she was kissing another guy on my car. I yelled at her and said that she had to tell my brother. She never did. It's been three days now and she acts like everything is fine and when I bring it up she says I'll tell him tomorrow. I don't want my brother to be hurt but he has to know. Should I wait for her or should I tell him myself

On Saturday June 28, I started being queasy in the morning and just didn't eat until early afternoon. (Me and BF had a falling out which caused me tons of anxiety-I hadn't eaten for two days or so so just thought My stomach wasn't used to food. again yet). Well for the past 3 days I have been not hungry but queasy in the AM-haven't eaten anything at those times-but today I ate probably half of one scrambled egg and started slightly dry heaving after, same with when I drank just ginger ale.        I had a period from June 20-25th and had just a little bit of brownish blood (spotting?) coming out yesterday and today.  Used a tampon thinking maybe another period was coming but  it wasn't even enough to even soak the end of the tampon.        I took a e.p.t. pee test yesterday and it came up negative, but the real question is when would one actually show positive if I was pg? When could a blood test?

My nephew is just over 6 weeks old and has a bowel movement 8 to 12 times a day and has at least one blow out a day. His poop is really runny almost like diarrhea. They have changed his formula several times, but nothing helps. Right now he's on similac alimentum. He cries alot, but not enough to be considered colic. The doctor said he's over 10 pounds now, but he's not getting any bigger. Has any one else experienced this with alimentum?       I have a question about his tongue also. He has a really thick tongue. Is that normal?
20090304080453AAm9AkF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Teenage pregnancy, help?	My girlfriend and I were messing around and now we're not sure if she's pregnant or not.  If the worst were to happen and she is then she does plan to keep it, last night we discussed it and she said definitely not to a morning after pill and I agree.  Both of us are 18 and she is in college while I am still in high school.  So what do you think?   Well what happened was that we did not actually have sex.  I put myself in and she was willing, she is a virgin and I am not, but I got it half way in and stopped.  This happened for about three days in a row and we did proceed to mess around in the meantime.  The way that we think that she might’ve gotten pregnant was when we were messing around and I came on her, she was on top and I thought it all got on my chest but she told me that it all got on her but not directly in, maybe if anything just on.  Could she have that way?  I know that the probability is slight but both of us are really freaking out.  She’s sick and not feeling well at all, and now my mom knows and it’s only been five days so of course we can’t test yet.   Please I need some help with this, anything will be appreciated.

20090304091041AADCGBr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Am I pregnant?  I am 34 days since my last period with a normal 26-28 day cycle.?	I had my last period on Jan 30th.  I normally have a 26-28 day cycle so I was due for my period the end of Feb but still haven't gotten it.  I don't think I really have pregnancy symptoms.  However, lately I have had a lot of gas, slight pressure on my lower abdomen, and maybe peeing more (but I don't know because at the same time I drink a lot of fluids)..  Yesterday when I wiped, 2 different times during the day, I had a little bit of light brown with clearish discharge.  This morning when I 1st went and almost all of the day yesterday besides the 2 times there was nothing when I wiped.  But when I went again this morning I had a little bit of brownish discharge again.        I have not taken a pregnancy test because my husband and I have been trying to get pregnant since August and I don't want to see another negative test.        What are your honest opinions?      Thanks!

20090304085230AAji9p3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What's the magic number of kids?? Or is there one? 10 points!!!?	Hubby and I have been talking a good deal lately about kids and we are discussing what is the magic number we need to aim for. I believe that God blesses you with what you can handle and I will gladly acceot however many he blesses me with. But my mind being a logical one I have to weigh every senario. Tell me what you think about my theories of baby numbers...      1- not really an option for us since we come from big families and I don't want a spoiled brat. Not that all "only child" kids end up that way I just don't want my kid to be like me for the first 10 years of my life.   2- Good number since each parent can handle one but I want a big family. However I will be perfectly happy with two.   3- Someone gets left out. I see this all the time with my younger siblings. 4,6,and 10. The 6 year old doesn't get the same attention the other two did as babies or even now! I spoil him but its not the same. I don't want one of my kids to be left out by the other 2.    4- I feel that this is the perfect number for us. And hubby is excited about this number but he is aiming more towards 2 or 3. I feel like 4 is good becasue everyone will have someone to play with. I do worry about getting lost in the mix and not having enough Mommy Daddy time one-on-one but like I said I want that big family.       Hubby and I have come to an agreeance about the 2...if it's 2 boys then we try for a girl or vice versa, if its 2 girls then we try for a boy. We need boys though with my husband being a former college athlete and I'm somewhat athletic, we need our boys.       What do you think? What is the magic number to you?       10 points to the best logical answer!
