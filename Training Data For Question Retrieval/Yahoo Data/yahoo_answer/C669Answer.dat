1HTRWrawaa	Because I have years experience in that subject. Come on, ask me something. Lol<br>  <br>  Oh that's right you do all the time. How many questions have you e-mailed me this week? 7? 8? More then that? We really should stop meeting like this. You are a married man. Lol|`|PeMpDAbraa	Because this is an interesting topic with alot less little kids around.

You just have to keep finding things that you both enjoy doing together, and keep trying new things to keep things exciting.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	Mine with my girlfriend is getting that way now and we R trying to do things like we did when we started going out.<br>  Good Luck
RO6VZeA7aa	If you are thinking suicide you need to know....nothing in this world is worth committing suicide. Espesially a man! I am married to the best man ever. But, I was in the same situation as you (minus the child). I was in a bad 7 year relationship. The last two years I felt sad, suicidal etc...I didn't know what to do. Finally one day I woke up at 5 in the morning and said I'm threw, when I get home from work I want you out.<br>  <br>  When I got home he was still there. I kicked him out. It was hard and for 6 or so months I kept having to get rid of him...he wouldn't leave me alone...my life isn't even near the same as it was then. I am not even the same person. I found someone (when I wasn't looking) that has just turned my life upside down. <br>  <br>  When I was with my ex I didn't make any good desisions...i put on weight, i smoked cigaretts, drank and some times I did drugs..all because I was so unhappy while i was with him. <br>  <br>  Now, I look back and I am so shocked I even stayed with him or was affraid to leave him. The best thing I think I did was move out of state. <br>  <br>  Which I know you legally cannot do because of the child. But yes you can legally seperate. He can not do anything. I don%|`|0q7Wiiliaa	you can put up a restraining order against him, because of his abuse mentally  yes you can call police about it, you have all the right and its not a hard process|`|Cpwedckvaa	You can ask him...but cannot force him to go and he cannot take the baby any more than you can....ask him to leave and contact a lawyer to see what your rights are where you live|`|vGFfdep5aa	if you seriously want to leave the first thing you should do is find some support! let a close family member or friend know what you plan on doing tonight that way if things get out of control you can call somebody to help you. If your husband decides that he does not want to leave or is not leaving without the baby then you should leave and take your baby to a family members or close friends house until you get your feet back on the ground. Legally whoever possess the baby at the time of separation has custody until a trial so do not worry about that as long as you keep the baby with you. If your husband has ever gotten physical with you, you should leave before he comes home and file for a peace/protective order at your local courthouse. Suicide is not a solution for your problems and it is a very selfish act. If you are mimerable with him imagine how miserable your baby will be growing up without a mother.....find some help in someone close to you. Hope all goes well.|`|xEuvSwrZaa	You can ask him to leave. The baby thing is different thought because it is his child as well. You can call the police if he does take the baby without your consent. It is still kidnapping. If you have never told him how you feel about how he treats you he will not know what he is doing wrong. However asking him to leave immediately may be a good thing. If you are being physically abused you need to call the police. When you do ask him to leave don't just say I want  you out of my house. This could start unnecessary violence or arguments. Think of all the reasons you want him to leave and tell him. If you can't say the words to him write them down and ask him to read it and then leave. You have to think about what is best for your child. Do you want him in your child's life? Is he a good father? You can still ask him to leave if those are factors. Just remember that he is the father. I hope my answer has helped and that you figure this out.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	Sarah, whatever you do, don't tell him this while being alone with him and the baby. Legally, if the mortgage is under both of your names, you don't have the right. The law is the law. If you feel angry or fear towards him, it's better if you leave and that's to it.<br>  <br>  Edit: If the property is under your name, then you might as well ask him to leave. Ask a friend to be there with you.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Your suicide thoughts don't make you sound like the most responsible parent right now. Do you have family you can call?<br>  <br>  You can ask him to leave, but if he doesn't, then you're living with a man you just asked to get out. You can't MAKE him leave. You might want to take some time to think this through a little better.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	Sarah, you need someone on the phone or there with you to talk to. Yes, it is legal to ask someone to leave. They won't like it and a fight might get started but there is nothing illegal about it. If you are feeling that bad, you need some support. Call a family member.|`|egpVC6uMaa	You can ask him to leave...doesn't mean he will and unless he is abusive, you have no right to kick him out of his own house and deny him time with his child. Of course, you can leave...<br>  <br>  File for a divorce, cut your loses and split custody. <br>  Good Luck.|`|53a74743d23e11adcec737c47684f9f0aa	You can ask, but I doubt you can legally make him leave.<br>  <br>  He'd also be an idiot to leave, from a legal standpoint.|`|AXyxxy6Xaa	You can ask him to leave and tell him how you been feeling....but for safety reasons you should tell a friend or family member that you trust about what you are going to do and have them take care of the baby while you do this. the baby should not see this or be apart of it. You need to tell him how you have been feeling and if he dosen't leave you should call the police, I don't think they will do much but since everything is in your name you have that legal right. So do it it's not fair to or your child that this man has made your life miserable. Good luck and I hope he leaves with peace.|`|jkXDhtsQaa	I guess the answer is YES -- you can always kick him out of the house.  HOWEVER---<br>  <br>  I don't know how miserable you are for the past years being his wife.  It's cruel to put the man out of the house without prior knowledge.  <br>  <br>  Also, If he saw this message -- he could take it against you and take your baby away.  How coudl you think about suicide if you have a baby to take care?  <br>  <br>  Have you try to work out the differences or talk to him about your difficulty in the relationship?  Regardless of what happened, you have to think about the baby and be prepare to face a long long time fighting in court.  <br>  <br>  As you kicked him out -- he could get upset and try to make it extremely difficult for you in court and maybe with custody battle.  I think the best way is to talk rationally with each other about all the issues.  If you must decide to split up - at least try to do it in peace.  Good luck to you.|`|eSkNDqLKaa	If you ask most attorneys they'd tell you to stay put so that you don't have to leave your home, but if he refuses to leave (can't make him), then you have to decide how bad you want out and gather your things along with those things that you want for your baby and get out!  Thinking of suicide is a selfish act.  Honestly, if you wanted to kill yourself, you'd be leaving your child with dad anyways!|`|ljiIgYFoaa	Legally yes you can ask him to leave. As the father of the child he has rights. It would become a custody issue. Don't think about suicide, its the easy way out, think about that adorable child you have to live for. You are the role model, and what kind of example would you set? good luck|`|hY6zcQozaa	Yes you have the right to kick him out, especially if he's been abusive to you, I would suggest changing your locks too if ur going to leave his stuff outside, and if he starts banging on the door, call the police. If he's been abusive get a restraining order from family court.|`|ky82orBzaa	you can ask him to leave but he doesn't have to tell him how you feel and then maybe he will take that into consideration  good luck|`|iPFUJXvpaa	yes ask him to leave ,let him know that he is causing to much conflict in the marriage and if he loves his family.|`|ZaC5udNBaa	I'm so sorry that you feel like you are in such a desperate situation.  <br>  <br>  My first thought when I read this is that you might be experience postpartum depression.  This would account for your suicidal thoughts and your "can't take it anymore" feelings.  If you truly do feel suicidal, you should talk to your husband and your doctor.<br>  <br>  Getting past that, without really knowing your situation I can't tell you what sort of legal rights you have.  If your husband is abusing you (physical or mental), or endangering your child (drinking, drugs, anger issues, etc) than you absolutely have every legal right to kick his butt to the curb and change the locks.  <br>  <br>  If he is not abusing you or endangering you, than, unfortunately you will not have legal rights to your child.  In fact, due to your suicidal thoughts, he would have every right to take the child away from YOU.  Just because you are the Mom, you do not automatically get custody of your child in the event of a divorce.<br>  <br>  All of that being said, I think you should talk to your husband about what is going on and possibly seek counseling.  You are MARRIED, that's for better or for worse.  You should try to work out the issues that you're having with him, rather than just giving in and throwing in the towel.<br>  <br>  Obviously, I don't know your situation.  I don't know what he's doing or what you mean when you say he's horrible to you.  But I do know that my parents absolutely hated each other on more than one occasion, but they stuck with it; and today they have been married for almost 40 years.     <br>  <br>  In any case, good luck with your situation and I really hope that it works out for you!|`|pVBH6iCYaa	bad idea.  (asking him to leave)<br>  and i have a comment or two on that suicide thing, but last one i spoke out how i really felt,  i got that account 'suspended'. <br>  <br>  do the proper channels of divorce.   <br>  divorce papers, and have him removed legally out of your house with police presence. <br>  <br>  for now,  go find a relatives house or friend's  to stay with for a while, and do not tell him where you're at.
JdOhkCPAaa	no definitely not going far enough . According to my brother the best way to get a MIL to leave immediately is to have a rat problem . 1day before your MIL arrives go to the local pet store Buy 1 brown rat . When you get home make it look as dirty as possible . Dont feed it . When your mother in law arrives tell your servant to draw her a bath - tell your servant to put some peanut oil in the bath -explain to your MIL how scientists are claiming it rejuvenates the skin - after the bath when your MIL climbs into bed have the rat waiting deep under covers . The peanut oil will atttract the rat to your MIL's toes and take a nibble - This results in your MIL leaving even if you try and convince her to stay with things like " you just got here the exterminator says he will be back next week to finish the job its just he has never seen a problem this big before ."<br>  My brother has done this during each one of his 6 marriages and it has never failed .|`|oQ2Rn2hpaa	As ever, Sir B', you are soul-searching where no need exists. <br>  If anything I'd say you're spoiling the old boot - no wonder she's out stayed her welcome. There is a new invention available for when your mother-in-law visits next: <br>  The "Acme Eject-o-Bed". <br>  Set it to go off at 5 o'clock sharp and the daffy old trout will be launched vigorously from her slumbers. Switch propulsion levels to 'max' and - providing the preset trajectory is true - this marvellous contraption will catapult your pesky MIL all the way back to her own natural habitat.  <br>  Bon chance!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	As she's still there, apparently your klaxon isn't loud enough (or early enough).<br>  <br>  Try 130Db at four thirty AM.|`|6U9b2t4raa	Thats not bad at all.  I make the exception to let my kids use the "SUPER SOAKER 2000"  water rifle in the house when my mother in law is visiting.   I give the $5 to the first one to get water up her nose.<br>  <br>    I mean she wets the bed anyway, so there is no real problem with water on the sheets.
WUwIk3Fgaa	Yes, but only if you handed over your tip money to me every night when you got home. Oh yeah, and feel free to get it somewhere else because I don't think I will have enough time or energy left for having sex with you after I'm done shopping and getting my hair and nails done and spending all of your money.|`|2G8lOPN8aa	It depends---do you have a good personality?  Are you intelligent and educated?  Are you trustworthy and family-oriented?  Are we compatible?  I certainly wouldn't judge you on your occupation--but the fact that you have a buff body and make good money is not enough information for me to go on one whether I'd find you marriage material or not.|`|rvBZPIv4aa	I would but only for the money. I would probably have other boyfriends though... at night while you were off stripping.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	No. My husband is sexier than a chip and dale dancer, so yes I'am really attracted to his body.

Even with therapy if one person has their mind made up then therapy is only a quick fix that won’t last. I suggest sitting down and finding out where each of you stand. Divorce is something that I have thought about myself but haven’t followed through because the problems weren’t really that terrible. I notice from my divorce friends and family the problem is that one person changes with time while the stays stuck in the past (Mrs. Doubt fire syndrome I call it). it’s never good on the kids or the finances. Good luck|`|3p1MgZu0aa	Do you really wany your marriage to be saved? well what is your situation? do you guys show respect for one another? do you ever make her coffee or just do nice things for her? well, i know this sounds kinda funny but you should watch fireproof the movie its about this one guy (kirk cameron) saving his marriage and he's a firefighter, which means he works A LOT!!!! and when he's off of work he's on the computer looking up  boats or watching porn well you just have to watch it buddy........|`|Gt8o7ICLaa	Trust me man, women are tragically unfunny.

WUwIk3Fgaa	Yes, I find humor is always beneficial to have in any situation.

4713a7c1b906526b10a8a0d692819231aa	I'll give you a very important tip, this should be a man's secret but I'll do it for you: when a man says this sentence, "this is a guy thing", he's trying to make believe something that's not true. Almost sure there's another girl in the patch. Open you eyes, I did it myself several times in the past. But let tell you something else, from the botton of my heart: your b/f is just using you as an object, why don't you react? Asking you to abort, not responsible for his acts. You're feeling depressed, for years and the reason is very clear, this guy is not for you, find you someone who's going to respect and love you for real, as a man. Try to know your coworker better,  He can be the angel you're needing to give you freedon and happiness.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	If you are going with a group of friends, then yes.  If one on one, then it is not okay.|`|CRvdmFwCaa	Well, I think if you're questioning it... you should ask your b/f.... cause you don't want word getting back to him that "I SAW HER WITH ANOTHER GUY", and it coming to a total shock to him.  That's what I would do with mine.  If he acts upset  that you want to hang out with some other "guy friend" I would explain to him how you feel.... Left out and neglected.  Tell him you'd much rather spend time with him... but if he is choosing hanging out with his buddies over being with you... then you feel you should be out doing something too... Not hanging out by the phone waiting for him to call when he is ready to hang out with you.  I can understand a boyfriend being jealous of you hanging out with another guy...  So if you choose to do it... I'd make sure you are 100% nothing is going to happen... Or you might as well kiss you relationship Good Bye.  Part of being a couple is communication.  So... May the Communication Gods be with you!   Who knows though... You may end up liking your Co-Worker... he obviously enjoy's spending more time with you then your b/f does!...  And if not... at least he sounds like good friend to have.  SO.... GOOD LUCK and may the RELATIONSHIP gods be with you!|`|BRXyowHOaa	You're going to make your boyfriend upset and this guy likes you and will want to go out with you more and more and not as a friend.  I'm not a big fan of workplace relationships so I think that might not be a good idea.  If there will be other women there go and leave when they leave.

JpBEBEFXaa	Yes and yes<br>  Just guessing that your boss is over 18 years of age he is in major trouble.Its called sexual harassment and you do not have to put up with it. I am confused you say there is a manager and has some authority over this person if you and your friends are having problems with this guy tell your manager and do not hesitate to report this person to the law you are minors and he has no right to do the things you claim he is doing regardless of what your manager tells you.If you do not want this guy in your space tell him and don't be afraid to tell him to back off if that doesn't work report this to your manager and then to the law.<br>  One more thing I just guessing you young ladies have fathers or other adult males who care about you I would make a point of having them talk to this guy if he doesn't get the point he needs to know that there are people who care about you and his actions will not be tolerated period.You really need to address this as Mr. weirdo might decide that if you wont give him what he wants he will take it from you and attack you when you least expect it. Don't let this happen if he knows there are people who know what hes doing and that there are people who care about you chances are he will back off. He has some issues don't try to understand this guy his motivation is clear, if your not interested you all need to make that known. Expecting that taking this guy to court to sue him is out of the question you will only anger him and increase the possibility that sicko will try something.If you want to sue someone sue the manager or the company for harassment and for putting your life in danger by having this guy in there employ. The chances of you getting a large settlement if you sue is not very likely and it will cost money to bring the case to trial and the attorney will take a large portion of what ever money that is collected. If you want to make money taking people to court to sue get a good education and become a Lawyer...<br>  Also you might consider taking a class on self defense better still learn a martial art you will be more confident and you can learn how to put a guy like this on his knees to beg for mercy.|`|JdIr5jf1aa	Of course, tottally he can get into a hole lot of trouble to d fact that he could even get fired and charged with sexual harrasment to minors coz u guys r under 18 years of age and my advice to u is dat u shuld stand up for urself and don't let any stupid mentally retarded guy make u feel insecure........ ohhhhhh u can get alot of money but i'm not sure d exact amount but just go ahead girl...this is a very important issue........i think u should go doesn't matter the cost........xoxoxo|`|MUEsS8tYaa	You can get him into a lot of trouble. You are all under 18, which will make it worse for him, and if you all testify, well, I doubt you can lose.

Actually...it already is since you're all under 18.<br>  <br>  You can sue him, if you want. But I'm not sure how much money you can get. I just know that it's a very serious offense that could even get him fired...or counseled depending on the manager/companies policy.|`|KQjhOdsIaa	NO, you deserve it|`|AA11923501	You told your manager.That should be enough.Forget about getting money,wont happen.If he persists he will get fired.If that is you in the avatar I can see the temptation.

X4Y4zKtPaa	Well you might be a natural at flirting, and so people may see you flirting with your guy friends and assume you are dating. Do you smile, look at them a lot? That might be why.<br>  Alternatively, if you're pretty, people tend to assume you get the guys. And some people just unconsciously attract men, so like even if you're just friends, guys may look at you like they like you.<br>  <br>  The best thing would be to just ignore it, and if someone says something to you about "the date," just laugh it off and act like it's not really a big deal (hence, that it's not). If you don't care, then neither will anyone else.|`|PlEb9YH6aa	they are just idiots who have no life and to tell you the truth i believe that it is because you are so shy and seeing you actually talk to someone, let alone a male would put anyone to shock thinking that you might like him because most girls who like a guy would go into their discomfort zoon and try to talk to them; so seeing you getting out of Your quite routine must have shock them. so just ignore them and walk as if there idiots who refuse to see the truth.

I also sometimes feel like hes not listening to me. the last time we talked it seemed like he really didnt read what I said on IM because he had an irrelevant response. it made me cry. Im tired of him making me upset. I just cant take it anymore.<br>  <br>  <br>  my father used to be way worse (to me and my mom) when my mom & him were together. he hasnt really changed because he still doesnt think too fondly of my mom but he pays more attention to me than he used to and he sometimes keeps his comments to himself when it comes to my mom. <br>  <br>  your mom really needs to see how he is. you need to prove to her that hes bad news. if she saw, I dont see how she would tolerate that kind of behavior.<br>  if youre really getting abused then you should tell the police if you cant get your mom to see how he is|`|GTKXq7A1aa	He is controlling but talk to him about this.<br>  Parents tend to be like this when they have a teenage daughter|`|X3GjiecGaa	i know its tough having a strict dad im sure he wants the best he just doesnt know how to go about things (((or maybe he just wanted a boy)))?? <br>  <br>  maybe u should sit down and try to talk to him about it rather then your mom obviously he treats her fine so shes bhlinded to how hes treating you...if he shows no interest and acts like he doesnt care or if you ALREADY tried tot talk to him, maybe  when ur at school you can talk to a ounselor and have ur adad come in and maybe they can throw him in some parenting classes. <br>  <br>  Try tog o out with ur friends or stay after school maybe just try to have a more active life and stay away from him if this contiunes that way ur barley home.<br>  <br>  and if that man so ever lays one finger on you do not hesitate to call the cops because that one finnger can lead to his hands around ur throat. good luck|`|aQ1FzL7maa	no|`|fF4lfNaHaa	u should tell a guidance counselor or a teacher at school|`|AA10336148	i have to agree with Katie.

Those are horrible options.  There are more colors than blonde and brunette, omigosh if i only had to choose from blonde or brunette, my options would go way down clubbing anywhere!  Umm, skinny or tall really does not make a difference to a guy.  Really, guys do not care about heigth, unless u are less than 3.5ft tall or taller than 8ft. tall.  If normal does not mean fat, and skinny is skinny, then normal is better than skinny b/c you can do more with your body.  If a girl is normal and wants to be skinny, then she is doing it to look skinnier than other girls, not to impress guys.  Hott is prettier than beautiful.  If anyone is out clubbing, they want hot, beautiful is a lesser word or used in a diff setting.  I would be more impressed with my friend saying i just danced with this hot *** girl, than this beautiful *** girl.|`|4NWDTqYIaa	Me personally I am more attracted to a brunette short/tall don't matter height wise, normal good to me skinny is not a big factor a big factor would have to be personality and confidence.|`|QPATe1OUaa	the hottest one fo sho. if you r fat and sad looking you arent gettin any action|`|ZJCoUMijaa	the ones not wearing underwear
c91sWmqHaa	Plenty of guys go to prom stag (without a date).  That's the whole thing behind corsages.  The accepted rule is that if a girl isn't wearing a corsage, a guy can ask her to dance.  If a girl is wearing one, she's taken.  To answer the second part: yeah, guys will go up to girls and ask them to dance, but that's a pretty nerve-wracking experience.

My husband was a really mature and respectful guy and thats why I fell for him, and I was a really mature 16 yr old.

c91sWmqHaa	Okay, first thing's first: it's pretty rare for a girl who doesn't even know you exist to want to go "out" with you.  It might be easier to approach things from a "I'd like to spend time with you" perspective than a "go out with me" perspective.<br>  <br>  Introduce yourself, get to know her a bit.  Ask if she's free to hang out sometime.  If she says yes, she'll give you her cell number (or something), and you'll take it from there.  If she says she's really busy, let it drop.<br>  <br>  I can't stress that enough.  If she doesn't show an interest in spending time with you (and, yes, being "busy" is a lack of interest), don't continue to hound her.|`|3zvWVo3Uaa	there are a few simple steps...<br>  1. walk up to her<br>  2. say "hi"<br>  3. ask for her cell #<br>  4. call her and talk<br>  5. hang out sometime|`|MTKC2lpxaa	start a convo about her weekend, get her number, text, go out, get married!

7LOpJW3zaa	Giggle - show a sense of humour. It makes the conversation seem brighter and less awkward as you can both have a laugh :)<br>  Touch occasionally - just the occasional very soft punch on his arm or something. Normally after some sort of joke I do that so it seems natural:p<br>  Body language - don't stand with your arms folded or legs crossed(if standing) cause they're barriers you create and it makes it seem like you are nervous and are uneasy. Stand with ur hands by your side and feet apart. Also stand fairly close to him :p<br>  Suggest things - twist his words a bit so they come out dirtier than intended (or dirty when it wasn't meant to be at all) of course this should only be done if you're sure he's interested in you. <br>  Pull back - don't just chase, take a step back literally and if he's interested he should take a step forward. If he says something like 'you're a ***** :p' pretend to be all upset and he hopefully should comfort you and come closer to you:p<br>  Insult playfully - Say thing's like 'you're so horrible!' with a smile on your face, like the humour thing it lightens things up<br>  Good luck :)|`|r8VvBxM6aa	Be comfortable and be yourself.

8ZPchcEgaa	Odds are they are jealous. Why talk about someone they hardly know, unless they feel threatened? All you can do is ignore them and eventually try to change your dorm room. Just be thankful your not on their level. Don't you feel sorry for people with such pathetic lives they have to talk about everybody? Pathetic. And hey, they're jealous, look at it as flattery.
3NoQuoWuaa	Your  boyfriend of 7 years values his friends company over yours. When did he get the idea he could go to his friends house and not check in with you. Your 7 year relationship is starting to get shaky. The foundation of trust, respect and communication is starting to crumble,Distrust has entered the picture. If he doesn't want you to know what he is doing then you need to get out of this relationship as it will only get worse.r|`|17v9Y30Uaa	Talk to him about it. Tell him what is happening, what you think might be happening, but try not to jump on the what your thoughts are. He might take it badly if it is wrong, and that he is not cheating and what he said was the truth. If you don't bring it up, you might regret it, and you might have to carry around the worry with you all the time. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|tcCGRQSbaa	sugar ,,you are the adult in the relationship,,and he will not get much better,,you will feed him and bathe him and dress him so the 2 of you can be seen in public,,,together ,, best of luck with your new full time job|`|68CpnNplaa	tell him to answer the damn phone once in a while its obvious he's lying and he's losing your trust and your patience|`|LWFD3XVaaa	Well he knows your calling him.

s4zxGI4naa	easy. don't come with him f his in a bad crowd then; approach him if his with a fewer people or if his on his own. A guy like a gal if they found it "qualified" for themselves. It's not not just one text then a guy will like immediately. You have to impress him|`|S270Qyedaa	come to northern ireland and ull no all about 'bad crowds'|`|lmtusbb7aa	He wont just fancy you like that. Some times it takes time. If he hangs out in a bad croud why would you go there? <br>  But f.e you'll regret it if you dont approach him so just go for it! x|`|lDuImhg2aa	hmmmmmmmm
rEUI5sVvaa	Honestly, You could be right about the whole "He controls her" thing, a lot of girls get with a guy and they settle, thinking they can't do any better, so they do whatever they have to, to stay with that guy. If he thought she was fat, she would lose weight, if he mentioned she looked like a bum and needed to dress sexier, she would do it. That's my best outlook on it seeing as how I don't know your friend. People and especially men for girls with low self esteem have a controlling factor in a relationship, I've known girls that would go out on the corner and be prostitutes if their man told them too. With the aggression when you question her, she probably is doing what she thinks is right and feels like you guys are attacking her. With the whole confronting her issue, I would let it ride for a while and then approach it slowly. Be nonchalant about it, either way she'll still probably feel attacked. It's a Lose-Lose situation. I hope this helps. =)|`|RDgyb7W8aa	She has low self esteem and her boyfriend is not helping her by calling her fat.  By doing that she most likely is starving herself to please him and that reflects on the paleness of skin.  When a person is hungry they get aggravated quickly.  The other symptoms are related also to her boyfriend pushing her on. It sounds like he wants to control her dress, interest in sex, cleanliness and other.

Going to the movies with a guy can be quixotic, I know! And this will sound awfully cliche, but you just have to relax and be yourself. If a guy can't like you for who you are then whose to say what might happen down the road. Bringing up flirtatious and silly experiences (not with other guys, preferably) will help set the mood.<br>  Also spontaneous touching, like brushing a piece of dust off his arm or pulling a fuzzy thing out of his hair (if there isn't any, Fake It!), will send the message that your comfortable with physical contact.<br>  All in all, making this a fun experience for the both of you is the first priority. So veer away from sad stories or other stories that will depress the glow that most likely radiating off of you =].<br>  <br>  Have Fun!<br>  -Jenna|`|cf61851ec33503b4ce6edb44b843b22aaa	Casual wear is great unless you are a star at the oscar's where you have to wear a long gown (from macy's, jcpenny's, kohls, target, ross, kmart, etc).<br>  Buy some soda and popcorn or chips. No ice cream, pop rocks, noodle soups.<br>  Have a seat, relax, be yourself enjoy watching the movie show. At boring scenes have some relevant conversation.<br>  Do like the majority moviegoers do which is to watch and understand and reflect on the move presentation. <br>  Treat the movie house like a cinema house and not like a lover's lane or a stage show. Be considerate to the other movie goers.<br>  No video recorders, cell phone calls and loud ringers or tone. Limit cellular phone texting to vibration mode.<br>  Have a nice time.|`|1lCVZ4kAaa	I prefer it if a chick I'm going to the movies for the first time with doesn't go over the top, its a bit intimidating. At the same time, don't wear trackies and a hoodie cause it makes chicks look like station-pigs. Maybe just some jeans and a nice shirt if its your thing. Otherwise stick with a nice casual skirt.|`|h4zEahdMaa	first off wear fish nets and 5 inch shoes. that'll get his attention. next, you stand on the corner to show him that you know how to bring in the money. he'll like to see a girl who can support her self with a healthy job.|`|FjqJs7gMaa	It depends, do you want to put out so soon?

Maybe the way they pronounce a certain word or the way they wear their how now and again. Keep thinkin about it and it will really start to annoy you. After a while you'll soon realise that the guy aint all that. Well I hope that works, I've never tried to do it to fall out of love but I've done it a few times (not on purpose) and started to dislike people. <br>  =]
RpIdwgzJaa	Go for it. The guy will understand. Just make sure after you kiss him, and I can not stress this enough, DO NOT MAKE ANY 'FORWARD MOVES' ON HIM. Most guys can't contain themselves - despite my better judgment, I've fallen in the trap as well. If you kiss him, don't make it sexual or forward. Try to make it light, easy, and full of compassion, rather than the 'hot and horny' that easy girls go for. Guys respect girls who respect themselves. Don't go too far, but show him that you really care. I trust that you'll know how to do that when the time comes.<br>  Besides, he probably wants to kiss you too, but wants to wait until you're ready if you told him to take it slow. The choice is yours.|`|AA11908398	I don't think your easy if you kiss him, but if you did other things then you might come across easy.|`|YHcyuka3aa	You don't kiss some one for the sake of kissing. You kiss someone because you think you like them. There is no law that says you have to do anything. If the time is right then perhaps kissing would be ok but you do know the difference in JUST a kiss and kissing someone in a way that leads them on don't you? Decide how you want to evening to go and just go from there.|`|AA12157752	You are impatient, but wait. Because it would be all worth it. <br>  <br>  Kissing the girl first is a manly thing for the guy to do. and he'll feel satisfied more if you let him do that.<br>  <br>  To hint for a kiss, talk comfortably with him until there's nothing more to say (don't force this, because if it is not a natural inclination towards this point, he'll think you guys aren't meant to be). Then, when there's a point of long comfortable silence, stare lovingly into his eyes,smile, look at his lips, move an inch towards him, stop where you are and he'll get the hint!|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	I dont think it would make you easy, if you slept with him it would be a different story.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306154348AA6IiN6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a> <br>  answer anyone?|`|m2eHPeciaa	i think its okay to kiss him. but ur giving him mixed signals. b/c kissing leads to touching then u know what... so i would have to say no, dont kiss him.|`|JEdP02Oeaa	i think it'd be okay to kiss him.

BbT3DCHvaa	Just try talking to the girls in your classes and see if that goes anywhere or you work out in the gym right?  Well, most girls there aren't interested into the drinking lifestyle and are more into the active type you seek.  Just try striking up some conversations with them.  Good luck!|`|GPphlImbaa	dude..there are girls at university's . start a conversation.|`|LxfqUaaIaa	Check out your uni sports clubs or start hanging out at the park or something. That way if you see a girl that catches your eye, she's probably going to be the type you're looking for. <br>  <br>  In any case, make friends with people with the same interests as you. Friends of friends= potential girlfriends. Lots of girls like to live a simple life too. Take the pressure of and good luck :)

sDwN4XuIaa	Ok, Here is what I tell my niece and she is 16.  You can not control a teenager all the time.  I tell her this.<br>  <br>  If you think you are ready to have sex then you have thought about everything that goes with it.  There is no right or wrong age, that is unless you are a child and its forced on you.  We are naturaly curious, and that is okay.  You want to know what its like, who at that age doesnt.  <br>  <br>  Here is when you know you are ready to have sex.  <br>  1.  You know how to put a condom on a guy, they dont always want to do it them selves.<br>  2.  You are not scared of having a child, as even condoms are not full proof.  Having sex means you think you are ready for this responsability and you can handle it.  That you are able to support a child and so is he.<br>  3.  You understand what an STD is and what it can do to you.  Those things can be pretty gross and cause some serious problems later, and once agian condoms dont save you.<br>  4.  You think you can handle being an adult.  If you can make the adult decision to have sex then you can handle everything that comes with it.  You can handle being left, because I am sorry at your age, its most likely he wont stay with you.<br>  5.  You understand that once you truly find the one you will be with for ever that if you have given that up to someone else, you dont get it back.  There is no way to get your viriginity back.<br>  6.  You can handle the emotional part of having sex.  There is alot to sex no matter who you are, girls either get hard to it because they have bene hurt so many times and they ignore those painful feelings and emotions, or you end up depressed after wards and it wasnt what you thought it would be.<br>  7. PAIN!!!!  You are ready for that pain of being broken for the first time, and I mean broken in...  It doesnt feel good, I wont lie...  It feels like you are being ripped apart from the inside.  But if you are adult enough to handle the pain then you are adult enough to do it..<br>  <br>  There are a couple more that I tell my niece.  I keep my lines of communication open.  Now if you are asking do we think you are old enough, then no.  I dont think personaly that number age you are old enough, but people mature at different levels.  Just make sure you are not becoming a statistic sweety.  Majke sure it is something you really want to do before oyu do it...  I felt sick to my tummy the first time I did and I still remember that at the age of 25......  If I could take back my first from who I gave it to, I would|`|fe1b76b6a20dce1bd151bf45adbc8d6daa	well, in the uk the legal age for sex is 16. but you need to decide for YOURSELF when it is the right time. yes people around you may be having sex but thats THEM, it doesnt make them any better than you for jumping in bed with a guy sooner than you do. you sound like a smart girl and your boyfriend sounds great.

But by the time my year turned 16, most had already had sex. <br>  <br>  I think the way to know is if you don't have any doubts. You do have doubts, so I think you should wait, even if it isn't for long. It won't hurt to wait but if you do it before you're ready, it will. <br>  <br>  Wait until you have no doubts, then, go for it!!! <br>  :P|`|68CpnNplaa	ur thinkin this stuff WAY too soon. youll have plenty of chances, give it away too early it could turn into a rumor. youre getting a ton of pressure from ur surroundings. no offense but u definitely dont sound ready emotionally. it doesnt matter if you will be protected (well it does, but thts not the point im making lol), if ur not ready, its a train wreck waiting to happen.

EZ5mwUF3aa	Lord have mercy... You need help! And yes your boyfriend should now if this is his baby and he should get tested for STD's.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	You do have problems. Yes, tell him. He needs to know it isn't his. Stop doing drugs for the baby's sake and give it up for adoption.|`|ec2bd412405fc32c1451cf07731a6e42aa	Getting raped is obviously not your choice, but getting high and doing drugs is. He will still love you if you tell him you were raped. It was not your fault for that. He will probably be hugely turned off that you do drugs. Be upfront, though. If he helps you stop drugs and still accepts everything about you, then you know he loves you. Warning: He MAY dump you if he finds out that you do drugs! That is typically a turn off.|`|OS6ApyOFaa	you still do drugs even now when your pregnant=? umm, you shuld tell him to take a paternity test because if you don't and he cares for the baby thinking its is, it could get legal, real bad. <br>  <br>  Lots of luck,  really, try to get sober (I know its easier said than done) but it's the best for your baby and for you too.|`|S41nRFKKaa	Tell him.<br>  Hell, better he finds out now so he can decide if he wants to break up with your ****** up *** now or later.<br>  <br>  As for you, seek some help. Stop doing your drugs, and maybe you won't get yourself in any more stupid situations.|`|0fc2ad2f54c939749f02f202ed8efb98aa	"lols" !?!?!?!?!<br>  That is NOT something to laugh at!<br>  I find this "question" hard to believe if you're laughing at a situation like this.|`|BAoTINvkaa	Of course. If he cares about you he'll try and help you through it.
xoXkHOVsaa	I think she wants to break things off with you.  School will be ending soon and you both will move on to different things.  You were never official, so she has no real commitment to you.  You should talk to her.  Tell her how you feel and discuss your future together.  If she wants to just be friends, respect her decision.|`|c91sWmqHaa	It depends on what you're aiming for.  It seems like the best friend with benefits thing has run its course, and you're faced with the options either of going full out relationship, or just being friends.  It sounds like she wants reassurance that you actually like her, rather than just liking the "benefits".<br>  <br>  Be there for her any ways you can, and do everything within your power to keep from seeming like you're trying to angle things toward physical intimacy.
mfcVhbYhaa	Yea, I guess we are both going for it although I know that deep in your hearts you need to talk honestly and know a little more facts about each others.<br>  I believe you both like each others so much but your are just listening to yourselves and that's why you both feel hurt.<br>  The subject is "hi sweety" although I could quote "Wtf is that?", "you let you guys friends put their arms around your waist", "It hurts so much", and "I'm tired Alicia". I guess you both need to have a little adult conversation and to discuss these stuff quietly because you guys don't want to end up broken-hearted and overall, think that the other meant that to be for his friend.<br>  <br>  "You don't push someone away you supposedly love! Wtf is that? Then you let you guys friends put their arms around your waist and just let them walk with you"....It's obvious that he is jealous.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)
QZpvVJkPaa	Your friend was giving you a compliment. Say Thank You ! Don't over analyze the situation. I'm sure she did not mean anything negative unless she was a psycho and in that case you need a different friend. <br>  Keep experimenting with your look and trust your friend, but more importantly, trust your own Intuition. Confidence makes even the ugliest person attractive to other people.
NQwljNOoaa	It is ok to tell people how you feel about them, but be prepared to move on if they do not share your feelings.  Some day, you will find the right person for you when you least expect it.  You should maybe get the person's phone number and then you can talk to them privately with no one listening who may make fun and just tell the person how you feel.  If they don't share your feelings, just tell them that you appreciate their honesty and then ask them if they would keep your conversation just between the two of you.  If they don't, then be glad you aren't friends with them because they aren't friend material if they can't keep a confidence.|`|RBF7b58vaa	if hes not bi or gay, hun, i'd keep it to yourself. at least in front of a lot of people. dont flirt, that might freak him. but maybe if you guys are alone sometime, i think you should tell him your feelings for you.....im sorry if you get your heart broken.|`|DLTT0Svjaa	aww baby,<br>  how you get gay at 13????<br>  i am too, and i must admit that if a boy in my class said he was bi, i would be in shock. and teens these days do make fun(sad truth). it depends of if the guy can keep secrets...|`|68CpnNplaa	omg if hes not bi/gay do not say a word that is like against the unwritten code as stupid as that is just please god dont say anything!

m8QfHC7uaa	You should'nt even be talking to this guy, or having anything to do with him. Start over and rebuild your reputation. He will have no control of this.  Start fresh, move to a new relm of friends. This won't last long. It's only words. Be the bigger person. Life is so worth living to the fullest, and you control it, no one else can!|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Deny it, it's your word against his..it's not like he has you on tape or a voice recorder.|`|v398Qalyaa	i understand your concern, but the only way to loosen this 'hold' over you is to call his bluff, be strong and tell him to do his worst, you really don't care, because while you are showing you are afraid in front of him, the more he is in control|`|3qv5t4mJaa	Well, he's not a friend anymore is he?<br>  Cut him out and don't associate with him.<br>  Stay away from him and sooner or later he'll get the message.<br>  If he tells people s**t about you then you'll just have to ride it out.<br>  It'll calm down eventually.<br>  Life's like that.<br>  Just avoid him, and if you can't, be cool. 'Cos you the man. He can't really hurt you. Not in the long run. Tomorrows another day.|`|wvPwc4PGaa	I have/ had a friend just like that. I just decided to cut him out of my life all together<br>  <br>  You don't need people like that around you.|`|VlTWo3nlaa	punch him right in the face. If u don't wanna do that il come and do it! Good Luck dude.
b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Confused is exactly what he wants you to be here. Theres no justified reason for what hes doing here other than to control you so you become what he wants you to. If he wont talk to you then dont talk to him. Men get just as curious as women when things dont go as planned and he will contact you. Be patient and give him his space and enjoy your time alone too. Good luck|`|YHcyuka3aa	If you file for divorce he will have to listen to the Judge. Tell him that he either grows up and communicates or you dissolve it in a court room.|`|NIn62JuPaa	Who wouldn't be confused, is he old enough to be going midlife crazy? Is he from a broken home? Have you felt the loss of the connection between eachother? Get some support from church or a group. Remember to love yourself first, do something for yu that makes you happy and ot let it include him. get your nails done, change your hairstyle and change the idea in your head that you need him to make you happy!
AA11199456	Is there any way you can contact her? Let her know that it's cold to cut off contact with no explanation. It's one thing to be angry but to give no explanation is inconsiderate and leaves the other person wondering forever.|`|UYRIJ7ETaa	well you can't do anything you just have to wait it out.
Vv465eJMaa	One of the tragedies D of being male is that we never know what we truly feel about someone until it is too late or the moment has passed.So a lot of males don't know at the time,and find out when it is over or passed.<br>  We need to learn to appreciate things in the present,but we do not think like that|`|3vQv23Ohaa	YES BUT I TELL THEM  why keep it from them then it is up to that person what they wish to do|`|GBr7TphLaa	Yes|`|733da09d0cb9e9d0f08ae79290ca1491aa	i suppose  i have...|`|Xl88AmV4aa	sigh yes. well idk im only 13 lol but i feel like im in love right now and i don't know if he likes me so idk if i should tell him. i might cause don't you like, regret it if you don't tell them? haha ok.<br>  -Skye:)|`|UQ8aC4l6aa	Yes, and i've told him several times, but he thinks it's cos we're friends, but am not going to tell him because friendship is more important, boyfriends come and go but friends stay with you forever!|`|vNXBZbZyaa	So many times girl. I don't know why, maybe fear of being rejected.|`|fLMc72q4aa	Yes.  I kept quiet because the guy was one of my best friends.|`|X6gz0qKLaa	yes... i just had to wait and be sure that he felt the same way. i told him first, though|`|6mpfxYwmaa	yep.. :/|`|3kpnzv5vaa	yep.

BbcBTIrUaa	This is AWESOME!!!!<br>  I always love situations like this,<br>  because they give me a good RUSH!!!<br>  So HAVE FUN!!!<br>  <br>  but really,<br>  what I do is, I dont think about it.<br>  If you spend your time thinking about it,<br>  it will only make yhou more scared.<br>  <br>  so DO NOT think about what you are going to say.<br>  because the question should be casual and simple anyways.<br>  DO NOT think about how everything is going to turn out.<br>  because it will make you even more nercous and maybe even<br>  find a reason to not do it.<br>  <br>  When the time comes tomorrow, it gets even harder.<br>  but just take a deep breathe and REALIZE that what you are doing<br>  is a normal thing that everyone does, you are not breaking the law,<br>  you are not going to jail if you get caught, and you are not going to<br>  be judged.  Everybody does this, and this guys interest is your business so DO IT BECAUSE IT IS BUSINESS.  <br>  <br>  I really admire you for doing this by the way, all the girls I hang out with<br>  say that the guy should always do the asking because girls get nervous, and Im like, OMG DUDE YOU THINK I DONT GET NERVOUS?<br>  <br>  Anyways, another thing I do, if I feel like backing out at the last <br>  moment is... I reflect on my imminent failure. I tell myself that I will<br>  really regret such an uneventful evening from the result of cowardice.<br>  and that giving up is NOT what I want.  And that the result of my failure<br>  will hurt more then the effort I have to put into this.  So I either poke my finger with a needle or I get it shoved into my eye.<br>  <br>  If by the end you are still struggling, one clever thing you can do<br>  is TRICK yourself into doing it somehow.  I cant tell you how<br>  because I will have to know more about the situation and the environment and details.  <br>  <br>  So that is how you try to overcome it.<br>  But you could always take the easy road<br>  and just tell a friend to ask him.|`|uhKBBQ9raa	wow, you're brave.<br>  I wouldn't do it, cause maybe he is not interested on me, and that's why he hasn't told me anything. You can just try to make a move on him or something, if he doesn't do anything, there's your answer.<br>  Trust me, it would be MUCH better than ask. Cause you would know if it's a yes, you can wait for a kiss :), but if it's a no, wow... it's hard to handle rejection.
FdixIDR1aa	Either call him, or text him that the answer is too complicated and he needs to call you.|`|AA10287830	Don't pretend.  Just tell him you would rather talk on the phone than to text.|`|yFSv9sfgaa	I have to tell people sometimes that I can't really answer a question well enough via text. Let him know, then it's his choice if he wants to call or whatever. He might just be nervous.|`|A7biMvrTaa	just text him back sayin if you wanna know call me and we can discuss it,...he'll call|`|gRXy66dOaa	just tell him<br>  he will understand*|`|m2eHPeciaa	jus say "sometimes i want to hear ur voice" thats all. i dont think its wrong, but over texting can be annoying, i know what u mean.
meroRGRgaa	first of all you are absolutley gorgeous.... and isn't your "boyfriend" holding her a little too close/tight to be comfortable??? youre too pretty for him if you ask me... and if I were seeing the picture for the first time i would think that they were a couple the way he has both arms wrapped around her. yuck shes ugly. screw both of them girl you could find someone way better than that!!!|`|0ocU0LJ0aa	So yes i read the article and I know that, i would've been angry as well and probably would've done the same.But yes there's a BUT...if you would've never overheard her say anything about her crush on him would you feel this way towards her?It is not her fault. He's obviously a great guy and you see that but he loves you and you only if there's no sign he is moving the other way then don't put too much emphasis on it. Because you may push him away.And let me tell you as an orphan don't resort to thinking of that ....if you want a little comfort dont look to the world for it. Look to your Father in Heaven you are never alone. He is always with you.He loves you more than you know and he wants to come into your life and mend your broken heart, he knows what you've been through and what you will go through...just think about it whats the worse thing that could come out of it. It can even better your relationship with your boyfriend. I'm not sure what your beliefs are or if you have any but my job as a child to my Father is to let his words be known to everyone. Dont worry girl you will be ok.|`|BDJXuflzaa	I just wanted to add that this situation would make me jealous as well, that sounds like something i would do if I came out and saw this girl on his lap for the picture.  It really seems like he's good to you and I would believe him when he tells you he has no feelings for this girl I am sure she just went ahead and got on his lap for the pic.  I would definitely tell him that it bothers you deeply if he gave her a tattoo, that could be very personal and give them too much time to get to know one another, the money he would receive is not WORTH all the trouble it could cause later.|`|ge4PpV25aa	Hiya,<br>  First off can I just say how stunning you look in your photo, you have a really beautiful face!! Its natural to feel jealous even when there isnt anything going on, it shows you love your partner a lot, however you can't let your jealousy or in fact someone else make you so upset you breeak down. This partner of yours came after you which shows that he is worried about your welfare and happiness, a clear sign of his love for you. I think if I was in the same situation I would feel a bit funny about my partner doing her tatoo, just say to him it makes you feel uncomfortable and I am sure he will respect that and keep away from the girl abit more :) xxx|`|joOM8U63aa	You're a very attractive woman and have nothing to be jealous of physical wise, however we all know "beauty is in the eye of the beholder".  I'd be extremely PISSED and not hurt over a woman sitting on my bf's lap! First off my bf (whom I've been with a little over 4yrs) would NEVER in a billion years allow any other woman on his lap like this.  In fact if there was a woman who behaved this way toward him, he wouldn't dare talk to her at all PERIOD! I think you need to buck up and tell your bf that you're not going to tolerate this bs! Yeah I know it might seem petty to some people, or an insecurity, etc..etc..In my opinion this is all about respect and why should SHE respect you if your bf clearly isn't.  Make this clear to him and if it happens again I'd question being with this kind of guy who doesn't care enough about your feelings to tell this girl "hey stop it, this bothers my gf!"   Sounds to me like you're very in love with this guy, and he is your everything...Quick tip...NEVER make someone you're everything because once they leave you will be left with nothing.  (emotionally that is)|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	Please, please, please don't allow your insecurities from the past (which are very valid and real) to interfere with the love you have found now.  You are worthy of his love and he knows it.  If he wanted to be with someone else he would be, but he obviously has chosen you.  Nothing makes a man run faster than a jealous, insecure woman.  Do what you have to do to get over these feelings, even if it means talking to a professional. Until you do, no relationship you ever have will be entirely stable.  Good luck and btw...you are much prettier than she is!|`|eKxPSMolaa	wow you are so much prettier than her! you look like Drew Barrymore, and she looks scary ! she's just jealous so shes trying to steal your man. tell him how you feel and he should understand!|`|3b6e1dec9119c4f762d2c636b495d3feaa	that is quite normal.  some women are here for one reason and that is to try and take your man.  being a tattoo artist, your husband should be immune to flirts.   you may just be in a tender moment in life.  it will probably pass.<br>  God bless|`|874EAxkfaa	I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD WASTE TIME THINKING.<br>  ENJOY your life,you have a good smile|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Competition and jealousy here. A little competition is really good for a relationship but jealousy isnt good but not the worst thing. This is where trust comes into play. He doesnt sound like hes interested in anyone but you so you really have no reason to worry here, but get used to the fact that this tuff will and does happen but its all for fun and nothing else.|`|chZFmJOPaa	Trust me honey, you are gorgeous beyond belief... if he was stupid enough to go for her when he has you.... oh lord that boy needs help! <br>  <br>  This is a problem for a lot of people. She really needs to back off. I would talk to him about this and tell him how it makes you feel. Thats not cool either way if they are just friends or not. <br>  <br>  He needs to tell her whats up... if he seems shady about it...then it might be time to consider finding someone who will put the effort to keeping you around.<br>  Good luck sweetie.|`|MpewkyElaa	Sorry but they all look like a bunch of life long loadies. Rather it's her or another he is the one that is not husband matieral and thus the uncomfortableness. You should not settle. You are special even if you were not adopted. Dont fall into dRiNkInG  your life away.|`|KP8OzOI0aa	Well it bother you because the fact that you might lose him and you really love him. Have faith in him if he Truly loves you he would never cheat on you. Also Love always conquer. Chin up and Put a smile on your face and realize that he will love you and be there for you.|`|Yd1la6mLaa	Ugly.|`|wJ0iLG0raa	nah girl i would freak the hell out if a women was all up on my man like that!<br>  <br>  no wonder u were so upset!<br>  <br>  kick her ***!<br>  <br>  i would --_--<br>  <br>  but then again , im black lol  ^_^<br>  <br>  tell her to stay the hell away from your man ><|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	You are way prettier then her.  Don't worry.  You could have been like "so, what the hell are you doing on my man's knee"?  State your territory girl.|`|9BsyKN9haa	i can understand how you feel, but if you honestly trust him and know he wont cheat then you really need to trust him. If you keep questioning him he will think you don't trust him and he will eventually get pretty upset. NOW if you don't trust him that's a different thing all together. As for the girl she OBVIOUSLY knows how much she bothers you and she is using that to her advantage! Don't give her the power! She loves it when she upsets you! She can also use it against you, by saying how You don't trust him she could try to manipulate him. PLEASE don't give her the power to upset you and your relationship. If you trust him the TRUST him.|`|Q2X07amtaa	Pfff, that ho ain't got nothin' going for her.<br>  You've got no problem, you're freakin gorgeous. :]<br>  No competition.<br>  <br>  But I'd say something to her, or to your boyfriend, and tell her she needs to ease on up, 'cause it's possible she won't stop until she gets some kind of satisfaction, or she could get bored of him since he's not showing any interest in her, and she'll give up.|`|hcgaizJCaa	First off, you are adorable.<br>  <br>  If he is a tattoo artist and she is a paying customer, i'd hesitate to turn her away. As long as you and he are both honest with each other, i would do my best to not turn this into a big thing. Trust me when i say that she is not the only female in your life that has a "crush" on your boyfriend, she just happens to be the one you overheard say it. <br>  <br>  In terms of you just plain old not liking her, i think you have two options. One is to only go out with your friends when she in unable to attend. Problem is, that would likely cut down your time with other friends, which sucks. The other option, the best one in my opinion, is to continue going, but avoid talking to her as much as possible and ask your boyfriend to do the same. You won't be able to avoid it completely, but if you are both distant (but not rude) with her, then maybe she'll get over it. It's not fair to put your other friends in the middle of it and i'm afraid that blowing this up will do just that.<br>  <br>  The other plus to continuing to go places she is at is that it will drive her nuts to see you two together!

Ditch those ones.  It could be one of the below reasons:<br>  1.  It means they think you are hot but not interested in a relationship.<br>  2.  It means you're hot but you're not their type.<br>  3.  There's a difference between hot girls and beautiful girls.  Hot girls you just want to bang.  Beautiful girls are the ones you want to stare at all day and hold their hand when you walk with them.  <br>  Try to be a beautiful girl and be beautiful inside as well and you will attract nice guys who want to date you!  Good luck!|`|njHgfl99aa	You'll figure it out sooner or later.

dckhOavsaa	To rebound means to bounce back. So, rebound sex is when you've just gotten out of a relationship- typically a serious one, and you have sex with another person to either stick it to the one who dumped you or try to quiet your emotional hurt... or both! If the girl asked if you wanted to have rebound sex with her and another guy, maybe she just meant that she would be having rebound sex with you on separate occasions? It's definitely not her liking you too much and not being able to take it any longer. I mean, she could feel that way, but that's not what rebound sex is. I've never heard of rebound sex meaning the same thing as double penetration, either; and if that's what the girl wants, I would advise you to decline the offer.<br>  A girl who will just approach you to ask you for sex- whether it's a twosome or a threesome- seems kind of slutty. I mean sure, if you've been with her before or are dating her, or even friends with her, if might be acceptable, but this kind of just sounds like some girl walking up to you being like, "hey, wanna DP me with this other dude?"|`|mCoipTkbaa	it means she just broke up with someone and she wants to have sex to feel better or just to have fun or whatever her reason is.|`|L8J5nNjDaa	My avatar is my twin!!! is right about what a rebound is. your girls definition of rebound is soOo off!!|`|IytPJbv4aa	ok rebound sex is when she might of just had one guy that she had some kind of intercourse with and for some reason they stopped. now she still wants some sex to make her feel better and i guess she thinks 2 guys will be even better.|`|QymdQMUZaa	she just wants to bonk to guys aka slvt <br>  answer this bich<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai7praf2fHl0.HCQMd4Edmrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306161900AAtbqAw">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

I have probably met 80 % of the players in this town.. and they do stuff like that. so he could possibly be just trying to flirt with ya. . but the whole not looking at you as much when your close is throwing that method off.. cause a player would be like looking at you and trying to talk to you. If you like him.. talk to him, but don't look at him when your not having a conversation. Act like your having a great time, and be yourself.. just don't let him feel like he is your only focus.|`|cwVydXaqaa	I think it might be just a crush, unless you believe at love at first sight, because he flirts at you from a distance, yet he looks away when you're close to him. He probably is shy and doesn't know how to let you know that he likes you. Either that or he might be a player. Ask him if he likes you.|`|3b57964a5bbc4acf8158ff0a0df379f2aa	i wouldnt say love, unless you two believe in love at first sight. He probably just has a crush on you or your very pretty lol. I dont know if your one of those shy people...like me lol...but you could just ask him if he likes you? or write a note of something...thats the best way i can think of (:
rHuAhN3iaa	I think you've got the right idea by eating things that aren't messy, and if that works that is what you should go with. <br>  <br>  I think there are lots of girls in your boat, who are afraid to eat in front of guys in fears that they will look like a pig, or they will think you're eating too much, but it's my experience that guys are actually more turned off by a girl that just picks at a salad or barely eats anything when they are out. <br>  <br>  Next time you eat a meal, eat it in front of a mirror, you'll get a first hand view of how you look when you're eating, when you realise that it's not as bad as you imagine it, it should help as well.|`|XH1YP57Oaa	:d i am the exact same way lol just enjoy some kind of "finger food" liike chips or something. :D it doesnt make u look liike a pig &nd its food. or try having the guy (hopefully yer boyfriend) feed things to you. its cuute &nd u cant look liikea  pig. :]|`|ktDZjbH7aa	HI XXX JOYFULL,,,,HONEY,,WEN WE R YOUNG WE ALL GO THREW,,THIS PHASE,,EVEN SOME GUYS,,,,SO YOUR NOT WIERD,,,AS YOU GET OLDER YOU WILL EAT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE,,,JUST HANG IN THERE,,,,,PEACE|`|GBr7TphLaa	I know exactly how you feel! Don't worry, you're not weird - it's normal. I'm the same way with my boyfriend and recently I was thinking about how it bothers me. Just tell yourself that you have to eat or don't think about it. Hope this helps!  :)
cloASB6paa	I think you can be in love when you're 13, but it's a different kind of love. I wouldn't get too serious now when you're barely a teenager. BTW: Boys have worse definitions of love than girls do. I wouldn't really take it too seriously. I think he just means he REALLY likes you, but he just doesn't know how to express it other than saying "I love you". Your boyfriend does love you, but I don't think he means it in a commitment level-just that you're very near and dear to his heart.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	No, not really.  You can be in Puppy love, but chances are he's just saying that he loves you because it's what he thinks he suppossed to say.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm sure that other younger folks on here are going to say that its possible, but thats likely because they haven't grown up yet.  I'm 26, and what I thought was "love" in middle school isn't close to what love really is.|`|8Y4LUH3zaa	Personally i dont think at 13 you know what love is. You dont know how to commit fully to love someone. I think kids at that age just say it without really thinking and knowing what it is.|`|nlbJAtuZaa	ya age dosent matter|`|mCoipTkbaa	anything is possible|`|4HJ1KbfTaa	I don't really think love has an age. But I also believe yall are really young and can't even decide anything right now. Soo.. do I think he truly loves you? No.<br>  <br>  Wait til you're older for that ****, yer still a lil baaby. Don't believe hiim but keep dating to experience how guys are. Thats what its all about whenn yer a teeen.|`|o6ZNZzT3aa	Peronally, from my experience, of which i've had a lot, you cant. I read in a magazine once, that only about 17% of ppl marry there highschool b/f g/f, and more than 50-70% i dont remember quite how much, divorce within 10 yrs.|`|At4BBOuDaa	I was in the same situation to...<br>  He said I love you to me first...<br>  I was kindah resitent to saying it back...<br>  But later on...<br>  Than i kindah felt it...<br>  Dont say if you dont mean it...<br>  Cuss than going threw a breakup can make it evean worse...<br>  : ]|`|dkxceXXYaa	It depends on your age.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Yes, that's how old i was when i fell in love and we're still together.
s1Q9vnqmaa	Um if i were a girl I wouldnt date either of them they are just playing you and paige<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306154348AA6IiN6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a> <br>  answer anyone?|`|mDMnhqwdaa	I would say don't do it, because they both dated your friend..and that would be devastating and betrayal to her.If they did that to her,what makes you think they won't do the same thing to you?So yes, you can do way better.|`|ns1F0p8Laa	I don't think you should go out with any of them considering that they both have went out with your friend.  By her experience alone should have you running for the hills from these guys.  Eric will do you just like he did Paige once he realize that you are not going to give "it" up to him when he wants you too.  John seems like a okay guy and he broke up with Paige because he realized his friend had been with her but I still think you should let him be because after he asked you he then asked your friend and that is a turn off.  Either way their both are not worth the time so talk to someone who is.|`|H5qJPekAaa	Why in the world would even ask that? Say no. He went out with your friend and all he wanted from her was to get into her pants. He is not worth your time and yes you can do way better than that. There are a lot of guys out there that want more than just sex. So go find one. lol.|`|JyrvQBVgaa	Tell him first that you don't want sex and see if he's still as eager.|`|0ktcvglRaa	You should make it clear that you're not interested in doing it, THEN see if they're still interested in you.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	you can do better. don't go out with either of them.|`|HpNmpH8Daa	Well the hidden girl code says to never go out with your friend's ex-boyfriend. John is a jerk to be going out with your friend then ask you if you would go out with him if he wasn't with her. Eric is a jerk for breaking up with your friend because she didn't want to have sex. Say no to both of them. I know you can do better.|`|NVg06Egwaa	Personally, I think you can do ALOT better. If he wants to do 'it' (and it's what I think it is) than that is NEVER a good sign. He should never have done that, congrats to your friend for refusing. Not many girls are that smart! <br>  <br>  When it comes to guys, go by your morals and what YOU think, not what you can do to be 'good enough' for them. Follow your heart, conscience and morals.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|MuSYw7m3aa	NO WAY you can do SO MUCH BETTER all they want is sex, that's it. Theyu dont seem like nice people and they will leave you either way, if you do or dont have sex with them. They sound like they jsut want to hook up with you, or maybe just a one-night stand. i think any girl can do WAY better|`|geIcLJdgaa	i wouldnt because what if they end up doing that to you if you go out with one of them, plus paige is your friend so you dont want to swoop in right after all of that ! trust me its not the best thing to do.. so no you can do better|`|0PKoq9fdaa	You can do better...|`|r2j2PgIBaa	You could do much better.  Try guys that don't want you just for that.|`|cyRKzRqFaa	he wants sex with you... forget it.|`|XvWHlfkkaa	eric is an assssss. he broke up with paige just because she wouldnt do it with him. he will just use you. dont do it<br>  <br>  and john seems like a nicer guy...but id wait awhile. would paige get mad if you went out with john? if yes, are you willing to risk your friendship for him? <br>  <br>  just definately dont go out with eric.|`|dTenNrNraa	They both sound like they suck. If you don't like them, don't go out with them. John's and idiot for dating your friend and asking you out BEFORE he broke up with her. Eric just wants sex, not really a relationship I guess. So say no to both?|`|QnZbnD5Raa	F**k both of them man, go get a dude that wants more than p***y from you and your friend. Girls can do way better than dudes like that, but in the end are still attracted to dumb a** dudes like that. Don't fall for their game man, and tell your friend the same thing.|`|TkHFoHpJaa	ok first of all the whole who went out with who thing doesnt matter.. <br>  the only thing that matters is do you like eric as more than a friend and if you do then you should say yes.|`|zrJm2pjHaa	i think u can do better jus rememba if u r rlly paige's friend then dont go out w/ those 2 dudez..They didn't care for ur friend then y should u go out with them. Choose neither cause they might b using u....|`|QRYmyPPMaa	if paige is yer best friend, dont. <br>  otherwise they sound like assholes to me(:<br>  you can do betterr.|`|c91sWmqHaa	Run for the hills, romantically speaking|`|qRAwBtJ5aa	say no, you wasn't his first choice but your friend paige. he's using you for sex.|`|nMfeehmuaa	well if you like them say yes!<br>  just dont have sex.|`|PkDL8vemaa	go out with john cause erics probably gonna ask you to do it with him and if you say no he might just break up with you|`|mdoWbF6zaa	YOU CAN DO BETTER<br>  <br>  The former will just use you for sex<br>  <br>  and the later, he is on the rebound and he's your friends ex. IF he asks you out, check with your friend. Girl Code.
98UiMvb8aa	Admit your paranoid. Tell her you are jealous. Show her that this is bothering you and don't beat around the preverbial bush cause you both just end up burying it in you know what. <br>  <br>  Communication is so important these days and for all you really know she is just talking, not cheating, but talking to other men instead of you. Why ? I don't know but you should find out, but do it gently. Don't throw it out like an accusation. Gently 'toss it into the mix' over roast beef and mashed potatoes with a serious look on your face. <br>  <br>  She is clearly missing something and you are clearly seeing an aversion from you, to the computer and this needs to be addressed.

But the end of the day it all comes down to how much u trust her, yea she may be chatting, but might just be harmless cchat, cos shes bored while your away, but if shes on it when yr ment to be spending time together as a couple, then that isnt really fair, I would speak to her about it.|`|2yKkNyEvaa	I concur with Adam M. Don't make a fuss until you are sure and even then why worry if you can still get into her pants. Maybe its a harmless hobby of hers. As a matter of fact the same situation happened to me once and it was resolved no drama.
2S2onP86aa	They were just fooling around I guess? It doesn't mean anything special.|`|fb3aad21d8783ffe3b227fd0b9240204aa	it doesnt mean nothing prbably<br>  maybe the were making fun of ur hair instead of cmplimennting it|`|kkjhoNTXaa	what they are basically trying to tell you is that your face shape or your appearence looks better when you have your hair up. or away from your face. guys will admit anything to make you look more striking to them. :]|`|FHxegXZAaa	evan probably said that he liked your hair a specific way and they laughed because they were teasing him

So why dont u start by talking to her how u talk to people who u recently knew? Dont think that you're nervous coz u only think that. The fact that she's there gives u the chills.

goWHVmp0aa	you need to learn how to be comfortable with yourself. there must be times when you act totally free, right? There must be certain people that you can be around (maybe family, maybe certain old friends) and when you talk to them you feel relaxed, smart, and like you're really being yourself. Now imagine the way you act when you are with those people. The way you say what you mean and your reactions are quick and comfortable. You need to recreate that feeling with this girl you want to be friends with. The sooner you learn how to overcome this social fear the better because it will only get worse. Just relax, trust yourself, and go talk to her when the time is right. If you feel awkward about approaching her while she is with her friends, do it another time, when she is alone. Talk about something she can relate to, a little at a time, then see what happens. "I like your purse. It is huge." or "Ms. Epstein is a huge *****. Agree or disagree?" or "I have this bar of chocolate and word around the school is you like chocolate, so..." Just remember; friendships grow on their own sometimes. You can't force them.<br>  <br>  PS. Who cares if you are Korean? That has nothing to do with finding friends if you don't let it.

If your grandparents don't approve of your mother as much as you do, you should try and bring up the subject lightly in conversation and simply suggesting it, not hinting at it being a possibility just in case your grandparents do not approve. But if they do think it's a good idea, then invite your mother over for dinner so that you can all sit down and discuss the details.|`|TCZz2OKvaa	First of all, just remember that you deserve to be loved, and that your parents let you down but that it's not your fault.  <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd tell your mom to talk to them.  She should thank them for all they have done, but she should remind them that she is now in a position to take care of you and that if possible it is healthier if a child lives with his parents.  <br>  <br>  In the mean time, make sure you tell your grandparents that you love them and that you are very grateful for all that they have done to take care of you.  Give them a big hug.  They will miss you if you go.  <br>  <br>  But on the other hand, old people get kind of tired sometimes, and they sometimes feel that they raised their kids already and they need a rest.  Maybe you could say, "You know what, Grandma and Grandpa?  I really love you guys.  My mom might be able to take care of me again soon, because she has a job.  If she does, I sure will want to come and visit you a lot."  This will make them feel loved.  It sounds like you are interested in their feelings, and this will help.|`|BohXJpaNaa	If your mum has the necessary conditions to have you living with her i think it is okay. Tell your grandparents gently, explain how you feel about the situation, after all she is your mother, it's natural wanting to be with her.<br>  <br>  Other wise if she does not have the right conditions to have you with her, i think you should think twice. Think about you and what would make you feel happy, not forgetting about others feelings. Think about your future.<br>  <br>  Happy days|`|L1EnPN67aa	Well, if your grandmother has a heart problem or something where she can't hear devestating news, I might have to do something tricky and sly so it doesn't seem mean.

But, if it's better to stay at Grandma's because of living conditions, stay. <br>  <br>  Think of what's best for you in the end.|`|VlvT2saqaa	you should tell your grandma, she has taken care of you for a while and you should be very thankful. be courteous enough to tell her yourself. she probably will understand after all it is your mom.|`|DkHxvCzIaa	you should that way she'll know ur serious and this is something u really want to do<br>  if ur mom tells her she may think ur mom is making u come live with her

Then whatever he says, or how he acts after is your answer!|`|jJjfeylmaa	GO FOR IT! i def think that you love him in a boyfriend type of way! and you guys probably would be so good together, and really it honestly seems like he feels the same exact way. awww i feel so happy for you because i know the EXACT thing that you are feeling, because my boyfriend and i started out like that too. we were inseparable best friends, and we talked all the time. i always wanted to be around him, but i was afraid to go the next step. one, because he had to move to switzerland for a school year for his dad's job (that's a whole other story tho) and two because i was afraid he really just saw me as a friend. but i went for it, straight up i asked him if he wanted to go to a movie with just me, and we kissed, and omggg it has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. trust me, being in love and being loved back is the best feeling on the earth and it is SO worth the risk. and to me it MOST DEF, from everything you've said, sounds like you guys are gonna be a great couple. i'm very happy for you and it reminds me so much of myself. i hope you guys get together!!! :) let me know how it goes! :)|`|sLWC6vEmaa	Always go with your instinct. And if youre writing large paragraphs about him... there is a lot of internal emotion... so i think you should tell him. Try to be closer with him also ... and talk more.|`|RE4AaDQBaa	Tell him you love him, or spend the rest of your life wishing that you had.|`|dccwKbt0aa	if u feel like u want to do them or u would.|`|dhr7nnxoaa	You deff. like him as a boyfriend because you just took the time to write a HUGE paragraph about how you feel about him.|`|bVp9CeTIaa	i can't be bothered to read this, sorry :)|`|0VDMp2Q0aa	You will know when you start writing long paragraphs about how you feel. If you are having this much thought going into it, there is more going on that just friendship.|`|4Lzf3wenaa	Haha, junior high love.  He likes you in that way and you like him.  Go out with him before its too late.  I'm going to be graduating high school and I let my love and best friend slip from me and go out with another person (because she mostly just wanted a boyfriend).  Now we both know we love each other, but she is in another relationship and the guy she's with is my all time best friend.  It's a bad situation.  Go out with him... really, go out with him before it's too late.|`|4kyV3qZNaa	well first, it's obvious that you like him, and idk, but it kinda seems that you're not willing to admit that. don't worry, it's totally normal. trust me! since you wrote a huge paragraph about your feeling towards him, and since you guys are close, you should come right out and tell him. he might feel the same way, too!<br>  <br>  hope i helped! could you pleasssssssssssse pleasseeeee help with my recent question? idk how to attach a link, so just click on my name (alicia) and scroll down to my recent queston! thx!|`|5RUnWnf2aa	Okay, Wow!  So, first I have to say.  You must be very serious about this whole thing.  I appreciate that.  Your young and eager for love.  Remember that this issue is rather small when you think on the grand scale of life.  In 5 years you will be in college and he'll be gone.  No matter what you do, it will not be wrong.  Any path you choose will bring you closer to living life.  I say do whatever makes you feel the best.  In the end thats all that matters!  You and your life...  People come and go, there are alot of people out there.  We could only be so lucky to meet them all...|`|5pDbbrTiaa	u do like him! i can tell that.<br>  You will know when you start writing long paragraphs about how you feel. If you are having this much thought going into it, there is more going on that just friendship.|`|62e9ba78ee48eedceb41743f5846f0a9aa	I think you should talk to him && see if he likes you too. Maybe ask him out, where its just you & a movie or something. & see wat happens|`|9Eq2Xxbmaa	almost everything about your current situation was the same as mine a while ago. i smiled when you go to the part about how you were 14 and in eighth grade, because that was exactly my age when i fell for my best friend. except, MY best friend lived 500 miles away in another state (and still does). but i eventually fessed up to him that i liked him in "that" way, and he said he did too. now things are changing between us because of the distance a little, but that's beside the point.<br>          believe me, if anyone knows what it's like to be in love with her best friend, it's me. you need to tell him -- ASAP. grab on to the fact that he's THERE and he's SINGLE and he PROBABLY likes you back. don't be afraid of ruining your friendship -- if he doesnt have the same feelings, i'm sure he'll be very understanding about it all, and if he does? well, there you go :) <br>           the way i could tell that my best friend liked me (BEFORE he told me) were:<br>            1) he told me i was beautiful<br>             2) complimented me ALL THE TIME<br>            3) acted kind of jealous/suspicious of other guys in my life <br>             4). always wanted to talk to me. always IMed me first, etc.<br>            5). said that if anything ever happened to me, he would lose his mind<br>   <br>   all that good stuff.<br>  my heart goes out to you, from one girl in love to another. good luck, i'll say a little prayer for you tonight cuz i really and truly know what it's like. <br>  <3|`|EJMwqU3caa	Oh the fun of first your first love.....<br>  <br>  If you can't do anything without thinking of him, then you are in-love sweetheart!!!  If he's your best friend, maybe you should TALK TO HIM about it.  Say something like, "so everyone keeps asking if we're going out - what do you think of that?" or "maybe we should, you know, go out..  see what happens."  or "I have these intense feelings, do you have any of that going on with you?" or be bold and just kiss him, see what he does.   <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!|`|HirjMIoTaa	you are definitely in love with this guy. He sounds pretty cool. And no, i dont think your too young to have a boyfriend. It's only normal that people start dating at your age. If he likes to hang around you 24/7, i'm sure he likes you back. If he compliments you, cheers you up when your sad, or stands up for you, he definitely likes you. I think maybe you should try admitting your true feelings for him. Tell him you like him more than a friend. This is pretty risky though. He might still think of you as a best friend and this might make your relationship awkward if he rejects your feelings for him. If you dont want to take the risk of this, don't do it or else you may end up losing the closest friend you loved. Rejection can lead to awkwardness which then leads to separation, which is where you guys start to slowly stop talking to each other, and i'm pretty sure you dont want that to happen. But on the other hand, i think its best to admit your feelings because if he doesnt like you, then its time you moved on and find a new guy becuz hovering over one guy for your whole teenage life is just a big waste of time. THere are plenty of other guys out there that i'm sure you can befriend and truly find love. But there's also a chance that this is the closest you two will ever get. I would  prefer that you wait a little bit to see if he admits his true feelings for you. If he never does or never gives little hints, then i think this might be the closest you two will ever get. Don't risk losing the closest friend of your life.|`|JyDIrXzeaa	Don't freak out. Even if you go to different high schools, do you really think that he won't keep in touch?? Call him, talk on the phone. text. facebook. e-mail. if anything, the time apart will make all things apparent about how each of you feels. When you get that close it's not like you just drift apart and lose your chance. Don't be in such a rush. You got a great thing with him :)|`|k4iJ4BJqaa	You want to know if he likes you right? I mean EVERYONE can see that U like him but this is what you do. You get another friend to tell him that You like him. He will think she's just being a tattletale and he will know. If he likes you back he will tell you (hopefully) If he does'nt then you don't have to get rejected on the spot. Aren't I a genius?|`|KFvA7cJwaa	You like him that's obvious. You might wanna get a friend to tell him that because you don't wanna wait to long on that. I went through all of that last year and we were best friends but i ended up getting ditched because we were"just friends" and everyone asked if we were going out but we said we weren't. So you should get a friend to tell him before its to late.|`|TMm4pebPaa	I didn't read this long azz post but I know you're 14. Sit your behind down somewhere before you end up a statistic:  young, dump and knocked up! PLEASE!!|`|TOfbNPCqaa	wow that's a lot...you should try to calm down though...but anyways if you wanna test to see if you like him as a boyfriend try hanging out with other nice guys and see if they make you feel the same way..but the way you put this question sorta seems like you want people to say that it's boyfriend love..this may sound corny but with love go with your gut instinct.|`|YH6CB0Khaa	If you are that close to him, you should just be able to ask him how he feels about you. And he probably wont make a huge deal about it. =D hope that helps|`|mQhqRbRQaa	Definitely you like him a lot more than just best friends.  Otherwise you wouldn't have even cared to write this paragraph.  Your not too young at all.  I fell in love at 14, now I am 18 and still with the same guy.  You never know how things can turn out.  Keep being positive, start flirting with him and slowly start showing him signs.  However, do not become clingy, or overprotective.  That turns men off.  Do your best and I am sure you guys will work out.|`|v3yJAogcaa	well, you KNOw you like him, but i don't think that you are willing to believe that yourself. thats good that you thought about it...but what kind of love is it? no one else can make the decision on wether or not to tell him-only you. be careful if you tell him... a broken freindship might not last after a boyfriend-girlfriend thing. trust me-i know.|`|x9fuxbrMaa	IM 14 and in 8th grade tooo i had the same problem and I found out i had to get over he will probably date u but later idk guys r like that. if someone hides that they like that their are no signs, im sry i gave u the flatout truth|`|yP53nCPqaa	why dont you just ask him? talking about it might bring up some unearthed emotions in both of you

The important thing is he can only know and understand love if he know what love is and God is love.  I think he has to be confident, hard working, independant, and risk taking.  I am not intimidated by any man.|`|4Mc3ZNegaa	well it's different for very girl, some girls aren't intimidated by some and other are. it really depends on the girl. personally i think that us girls find shy ones interesting and often the most funny but loud, talkitive ones more fun to talk to and more confident. so for me personally i say......i like 85% talkitive and the rest shy.... ummm and im not really intimidated by- well druggies i dont like at all....i dont really know anyone who is....thank god, but ya.....other then that im not intimidated by guys.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	I like guys who are open to me. couldn't care less if they are social or not to others-as long as they are polite to others but shares his feelings and what he thinks with me.

I love guys that take charge.  I feel its the man role to do so.  Not that girls should be dependent and ignorent.  But in the general sense its the mans job.  I think I am intimidated by guys that don't talk much, and keep to themselves.  It makes you wonder what the hell is going on in their head!|`|3CeJHTDqaa	Well i like my guys to be wayy social so 100% social i suppose.<br>  Shy guys make everything akward so i rather have a guy that can joke and break the ice and be cute about it:]<br>  I'm intimidated by guys that are always like "oh i hate girls that smoke, or drink".

h0uAjCLzaa	Let's see, what you should do is take a break from each other. You know, maybe she is just tired of being so close. I know that hearing this might hurt but, there are other things to do and other friends to be with than her. Try hanging out with another friend or a guyfriend. I find that hanging out with a friend that's a boy really helps.|`|u7LSohRyaa	It sounds like she WAS your close friend and has found a new best friend. Don't blame yourself for this. Have the courage to tell yourself you'll handle it. You're not obligated to pretend to be her friend or ignore her out of spite. Just tell her that you're moving on and finding new friends. You'll still be nice to her but you can see she's occupied. Stuff happens.|`|QAEm0Yitaa	Um, you just need to let her go hang with the other girl, that doesn't seem like a good friend =/ I've seen the same situation happen to someone i know before.|`|JeorsIZwaa	Think back. Do you think it's something you may have done to cause her to act that way. If so bring it up. If not don't give up, It's just growing pains. Give her space and find something or someone else to occupy your time for now. True friendship outlast anything.
PRjvY6Vgaa	Oh, people on here are so mean!!! Listen, you made a mistake so ask her to forgive you. Sometimes people make those mistakes they realize how much they really love someone, And it sounds like you really do love her. Tell her that you only want to be with her, and take her out and give her the best time in her life. And then never cheat on her again. You've learned your lesson now from this. I hope this helps.|`|3vWpUXsmaa	It's just sex. That doesn't mean you don't love your girlfriend.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	3 out of 4 guys cheat and would cheat if they couldn't get caught. it's just guys and the way they are|`|wXyoo8mNaa	Before u lose it,find out what she did while she was gone Grab your umbrella and put it behind u.|`|aXlS0Oi3aa	Wow, you don't deserve her.|`|chZFmJOPaa	I don't know, why did you?|`|2S2onP86aa	What a typical guy, shame on you.

rEUI5sVvaa	There's obviously something upsetting her to the point that she feels the need to cut herself. Personally, I used to cut my self, not for my own verification or to follow some trend in fashion or whatever society but because I was in a lot of pain, it was like control in my life, paine management, you could say. As for you, A true friend would stick by her, like they say "A true friend walks in when the rest of the world walks out on someone." You can ask her what's up, but I doubt you'll get anywhere. Encourage her to talk to someone(a rational person whether it be you or not. Is this guy more important than your friendship with her? Ask yourself this question and make you decision. Follow your heart, not your hormones. Hope this helps. =)

lFFhcoXZaa	Unhealthy Attachment? Maybe not.<br>  In the way you present it I think it a little weird. But that's me. I wouldn't sleep with another man's shirt if I had a boyfriend or husband.<br>  But saying you're in love with your guy friend tells me you think more of him than the guy you're dating. Being "in love" is very strong. <br>  Just be sure you are "in love" with the right guy.<br>  Fast forward 15 or 20 years. The conversation with your daughter goes: Yes, I married your father but I was really in love with this other guy. Then relate how you slept with his shirt and whatever else you want to disclose. Sounds kinda silly doesn't it.<br>  Be cool and Good Luck.

Hkb7xoaQaa	Hey from a male perspective, thats pretty courageous and respectable. When we're younger we get distracted and obsessed with sex but when we mature(and it takes a while ladies,sry), we start to understand the importance and meaning of sex. I think women go throught the same process just in a way shorter period of time,(yes, i said it, and it wasn't easy, haha). You sound like your just about all grown up, and i think its a very mature vow to make to yourself, congrats and good luck.

pc5bVjffaa	you shouldn't let a guy who doesn't like you get you down, especially on your birthday. it's your time to be happy and have fun, get together with some friends to get your mind off of it. and there are many other guys out there. even though it might not feel like it, but take my word i've been in your shoes.<br>  <br>  -happy birthday|`|936dFoLeaa	Girl I know your feeling. It's like a big bummer, but you'll get over it. That's really all you can do..not to be mean by saying that cuz I know how it feels. But I know I've gotten over alot of guys when I realized they liked someone else..it's a sucky situation, but hey look at it as their loss. If you think you should tell him go ahead, but think about what his response might be, maybe you should just let it go cuz your feelings may get hurt if he likes another girl. Good luck and Happy Birthday..don't let this get you down girl! Take it for what it is!|`|DwiQ66qyaa	Hey it's the bday girl<br>  <br>  Happy Happy Bday, Happy Happy Bday, Hey!<br>  <br>  lol haha<br>  <br>  Seriously, they come and go...let it go....i know it's really hard but life goes on....it's your day, and the least he can do is not ruin it for you.

There are plenty of other fish in the sea. If, for some reason or another, they DON'T end up going out, then you still have a chance! You should tell him how you feel.<br>  <br>  Maybe if he knew that you like him, he would choose you over her!
JyrvQBVgaa	DON'T make a move. Wait until him and his girlfriend break up. That's not a good sign about his character if he denies being with her whenever you're around.. although that probably means he's noticed you and finds you attractive. If he's willing to cheat on her, what makes you think he'd hesitate to do it a second time with someone else?|`|FHrQzaPqaa	just be up front with him and tell him how you feel.|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	If he has a girlfriend, you should not be making a move on him.  You've become more familiar with him, and if he gets to be unattached again you will surely find out, and can make a move then.<br>  <br>  The best relationships are friendships that have caught on fire--and you two simply have not had the time to get to that point...I wouldn't say you are a bee-atch...but I would say you are a too-eager beaver!|`|2S2onP86aa	He's a player - if he has a girlfriend and pretend that he doesn't, then he might do the same to you when he gets with you. Be careful. Also you don't want to be the reason in stealing other girls' boyfriends because I don't think you want this to happen to you too right?<br>  Think carefully.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Until he is actually single, you stay the heck away from him.  <br>  <br>  Whether he denies it or not, she exists and you know it.  Don't steal someone's boyfriend.  It will only hurt you in the end.|`|AA12157752	Ask yourself. Do you want a boyfriend who, would not only woo someone else behind your back and when ask whether you exist, say you don't exist?<br>  <br>  Put yourself in the other girl's shoe. <br>  If it were me, I'll be really hurt. And you deserve a guy who is honest and can bravely walk the surface of the earth, with nothing hidden in his pockets. <br>  <br>  He might just be wanting you as a side dish, like an extra add on to his current girlfriend, so he secretly woos you at parties. If he really likes you, he would have broken up with his girlfriend. Why is he still keeping his girlfriend? because he wants someone to come home to, when he has had his fun outside. <br>  <br>  Stay out now. I have personally experience this situation before. at first I thought I wasn't hurt, but it hurt me so badly after I had the wisdom to fully realise what is going on.|`|NVg06Egwaa	Until he no longer has a gf, back off!! I know how hard this is, believe me!!! I feel like EVERY guy that I like already has a gf. Gobs of bad things can happen if you get in the middle of this. Wait until he is POSITIVELY single to make your move. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!!!!|`|rx0OyL3oaa	i would say tell him that you like him. so many times ive kicked myself for not telling people i liked them and then finding out they liked you but have moved on. better to tell him now and get it over and done with. you never know he might like you to.|`|QymdQMUZaa	make a move!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

54042690d0ee8dda741121976af71b28aa	You are just one more reason why men worry about their wives/girlfriends having male friends. My wife had a couple of guy friends before meeting me but she would never disrespect me by telling them our problems or even being alone with them. I'm sorry but you've been married for 7 months and already falling for another guy? You need to take a good hard look at yourself and the marriage.<br>  <br>  You're thinking about your friend in evey aspect of the marriage so in a sense, you've already replaced your husband. I honestly don't know why you're making this so difficult. Be an adult and work out your relationship through counseling or be civil enough to divorce your husband.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	More than likely your problems in your marriage are stemming from you not being completely connected and committed to your husband. Since you are relying on this other man for the should to lean on. You need to cut off all contact with this other guy and focus on your marriage, or you will end up divorced, and I'm sure the other guy's only interest in you is sex. So if you end up divorced don't think the other guy will want to be with you long term.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	What you feel is very natural.  However, marriage is mostly about doing the un-natural things such as having self-control, self-discipline, and self-restrain on what you feel naturally.  Otherwise, divorce rate will be 90% and infidelity rate will be 99.9%.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Stop talking to this man about your issues and speak with your husband. That is what mature people do. The talk to one another not at one another. They discuss the issues and come to a compromise. Having a baby so soon in a marriage can be quite stressful, it is stressful in any relationship. I suggest you leave the male friend out of the picture and work on your marriage; before it is too late and you do something you are unable to repair.|`|1b6c195ba207883a224264d44c013600aa	You should confide with female friends and not this guy.  Nothing good will come of it.  Also, is it ok for your husband to meet with a female friend who wants to get in his pants? <br>  Congratulations on fighting a lot and still having sex!|`|g7gvzhkpaa	well your fulling the void with your husband ,with this new guy , marriage concelling is your best bet ,think about your daughter,you did marry the guy you must feel something still .|`|iZbgUtxcaa	Natural for stupid immature people who only marry because they got knocked up.|`|lapMAm0Aaa	You're married! Not boyfriend and girlfriend. The situation is a lot bigger than how you perceive it. Stay Alert.|`|9BsyKN9haa	That means you need to stop talking to him about your marriage problems! He is not your husband.|`|oauYuhvDaa	Stop it.<br>  Tend to your own grass and soon it will be even greener than that on the other side of the fence.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	You're walking on dangerous territory. This "friend" of yours may or may not intentionally be threatening your marriage. He's there for you to help you when things are sour at home, you trust him, & he makes you feel appreciated & welcomed, right?<br>  <br>  I knew a married guy who was very unhappy in his marriage. He would always talk to one of his young, female coworkers about how his wife didn't want anymore kids, but he did. He & this girl started getting closer & closer. It could have resulted in a physical affair. She was smart enough to back out of it.<br>  <br>  Not surprisingly, he divorced (& remarried someone else) not long after. Her hunch was correct that he was willing to go outside his marriage for gratification.<br>  <br>  Point for you today? Your emotional needs - not just physical ones - should be primarily met in your marriage. The more you bond with your "friend", the more at risk you are for making him your boyfriend.|`|699ff79ff7efb620adfafa8aea8f3bcaaa	Natural, yes. You're fantasizing about the days when you were younger and you could be turned on by a guy without any of the problems that you and your husband are having. Enjoy the crush inside your head (yes, even the sex fantasies while making it with hubby are okay -- just don't tell either of them!). Don't, however, take it into the physical world. To get you over, imagine all the things this crush does that you don't see. Imagine the snoring, the never bathing on the weekends, the dirty underwear, the drying himself on the bed sheets, the picking his teeth with a magazine cover, any number of annoying little habits that husbands have that boyfriends never show. You don't know right now how you feel about the mundane details of living with a guy and you're not sure whether it's affecting your love. Only you can answer, but it probably isn't.|`|kxUigIkraa	When my husband and I went through marriage counseling, we made a deal with each other never to talk to friends or family when we are arguing. If we had to talk to someone, we would see a nuetral party--like a pastor or a counselor. The problem with taking your marital issues outside of the marriage is that sooner or later, you WILL make up if you work at it. (Newsflash: Marriage takes work). And if you had just complained about all of your husband's faults to those close to you, they will have a much harder time forgiving him after it is all over with. That is how most of the in-law issues start happening. Also, in our marriage, we have a rule that we are each other's best friend. And with opposite sex friends, we made serious rules--no being in the same room with someone of the opposite sex alone, no driving in the same car with someone of the opposite sex alone. We can hang out with others of the opposite sex as a group, but not one on one. Because when you are one on one, sharing secrets you shouldn't be sharing, attraction is bound to happen at some point. And as a married woman, you just shouldn't put yourself in that situation. You need to be focusing on making things right with the man who just THIS YEAR you promised to stay true to until death do you part. A promise is a promise.|`|qBHjIrVHaa	First, stop talking to another man about your husband.  This is very personal and just far to intimate.  Plus, you husband would find it insulting.  <br>  <br>  Your building up a fantasy about this other man.  All he is doing is listening.  He has no real responsibility.  He doesn't have to really fix your problems.  He is not providing for you and your child.  Your building him up to be something he is not.  Real life is with your husband who is with you dealing with a small child, which all by itself can be very stressful on a marriage.  <br>  <br>  Find a girlfriend to talk to.  It's just not appropriate to turn to another man about such intimate problems with your husband.  Keep this up and things will really get out of control easily.  Most likely, this other man does not want to have responsibility for your child.  Everyone will be hurt in the long run.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://marriagebuilders.com/" rel="nofollow">http://marriagebuilders.com/</a><br>  <br>  Look into Books about meeting emotional needs:<br>  <br>  "His Needs, Her Needs" by Harley<br>  "The Five Love Languages" by Chapman|`|FasxVeohaa	well it would be natural to feel closer to him being that he is that listening ear when you need it. But on the other hand he is giving advice to help your marriage not destroy it. So how would he(lil crush) trust you if you left your husband over something not good to be with him. You also should not being having sex with your husband and thinking of another man, because it will catch up to you sooner or later. And how you feel if he was thinking of some other chick when doing you!!!!!|`|meroRGRgaa	its human nature to want what we cant have... but you need to keep it that way!!!! you cant have it so dont go looking somewhere else.... your'e married.... theres should be no divorce and if divorce is an option then maybe you shouldnt have gotten married at all. another thing, you should NOT bring other people into your relationship... esp not one of the other sex. when you complain to someone of the other sex about your problems with your man it just makes the person youre complaining to seem SO much better than the one youre with. stay away from him- and work on your marriage!|`|hCoGFz0Daa	honestly, i would sort out your feelings about it. you'll eventually have to pick a guy, if you like this guy more than your husband than leading your husband on is only hurting both of you more. my parents divorced when i was a little kid, so that's gonna be hard on your daughter. do what you think is right, you know yourself more than i do. if you're fighting thats another reason to divorce, fighting isn't worth staying together, marriage or not.|`|wJ0iLG0raa	its possible.<br>  <br>  this is detrimental to your marriage ><<br>  <br>  u should work it out with ur husband and if he values u he should try to make a difference.u may not be ready to end the friendship w ur friend but u should atleast stay away from him while u sort it out w ur man.luck|`|5MUEN8mkaa	you sick freak... u oughta be ashamed...|`|0ocU0LJ0aa	Very dangerous!! when you place another man in your heart mind and soul you have commited adultery. I dont believe this is something you want to do. Do the right thing.Please. You got married because you love your husband, and everything you have invested in your marriage is not to be taken lightly. In the deep and private corridors of your heart, there is a room. It's called the appreciation room.It's where your thoughts go when you encounter positive and encouraging things about your spouse.And every so often, you enjoy visiting this special place.<br>  On the walls are written kind words and phrases describing the good attributes of your mate.These may include characteristics like "honest" and "intellegent" or phrases like, "diligent worker" or "beautiful eyes". The things you discovered about your mate when you guys met.When you think about these things your appreciation for them increases.most of these things are written in the beginning of your relationship.You may find yourself not visiting this room to much anymore because there is someone else involved now. DO NOT ALLOW anyone to come in and sway your feelings you stay strong and whatever you are going through you must endure. For better or for worse you made your decision and in Gods eyes it would be decieving for you to think of another man in your heart and not your spouse.Remember love is not a fight but worth fighting for.Fight fair dont attack eachother. Love each other. And if you dont know how think of how God loves you and how he sent his son to die for you.

We both needed more and eventually split uP.<br>  I do not recommend it. Unless, of course, you can send for them, or if you can go there where they are. (for permanent)<br>  That's the thing about the Internet. You meet the perfect mate, but they are thousands of miles away. Best to just be friends with them on-line, but get a local mate. Trust me! L.D. relationships are frustrating.<br>  Good luck!

mdoWbF6zaa	dude i feel you on this one.<br>  <br>  If the relationship is that bad then you may want to take a break. Kinda like a break up but less.<br>  <br>  I know how this feels and in my case the break worked and I am back with the guy.<br>  <br>  But sometimes love is meant to fizzle out. You guys both need to work on your own personal issues without having to lie and fight about stuff. That just stress's you out too much and it will just lead to more fighting.<br>  <br>  And if it comes down to it, do whats best for you. Don't hang in if you don't wanna hurt her. you both sound like you are hurting already.|`|zrJm2pjHaa	DUDE dont break up w/ her.

Hold each other accountable for your actions.|`|YIvIVvWFaa	"Our relationship is not healthy. She wants to work it out but I really don't see where she is trying to fix it."<br>  <br>  There is your answer. She has not intention of changing, at least right now, and you yourself say you both lie and mistrust each other. That is no basis for a happy marriage or even bf/gf relationship. It takes the efforts of both partners. You don't want to be arguing all your life, either, do you? You should follow your instinct and break up with her. Perhaps further down the road, she will learn from this and change for the better and you will get back together, but you should not agree to it easily. You have to be sure she has really changed.<br>  <br>  The truth is that at 18, you are still quite young, and your interests and feelings may well change in the next few years, but for now, everything seems to point to giving up on this relationship,for both your happiness and hers.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Break up with her.

Best friend means she'll understand right?<br>  <br>  Just make sure you are prepared to feel how she's taking it too. Respect her what ever her decision is, should be present. Be sensitive to her response :)
CDzStUPUaa	I think giving a present on special occasions is an extra special way for him to  show you how much he cares.   He should be thoughtful enough to do this because it is important in dating.  But he has to want to do it; not out of a sense of duty but to show you that you are special to him.<br>  Maybe you should have a convo with him about this, just be really sensitive to his feelings.  Does he buy you anything out of the blue just because he feels like it?  Sorry to ask but Is he  cheap in other areas or have you just recently started dating so he's uncomfortable about what to do?  Sometimes guys just don't know what to get; he may be new at this.  Have a gentle talk with him.  Tell him how much it means to you; some guys can be really dumb about these things!  :)   I wish you all the best!  Good luck.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	It used to be so important to me earlier on in our relationship but now it is not important at all.

392c4fdf05c765cd1f3b81c7f17c0329aa	Well first of all Nana, what does off the books mean? If he told you that he drove 25 years ago, don't you think that he has been driving all the time? This question has some holes in it or you are just in love and can't see the forest for the trees. If he does not have a job leave him alone and if he is working off the books and don't have a bank account plus use a prepaid cell phone, he is lying to you about something and don't have no money at all, cause if he did he would have a place to stay. Yes it is against the law to drive without a license and insurance. Here is my thing, that I would do, don't have anything to do with him until he gets his act together. Don't ask him about nothing, you want to see where this relationship is going. Don't feel sorry for him because he is a man and he is supposed to be the provider. Why else would he not have  a place to live, because the baby mama drama has played out. She through him away because he is a loser, so don't pick up where she left off. Keep focus on your Masters, and don't let the devil trick you into thinking that you are in love, because if you were you wouldn't be asking for advice from other people. I have learned from experience.|`|FyR1NAQwaa	what you really need to do is run a background check on  this guy. you can do this on line , this guy might have warrants out for his arrest.<br>  <br>  and he's covering his tracks.<br>  <br>  <br>  either way this person you don't need in your life .<br>  <br>  you got a great career dump this guy before he take you down  you work to hard to get where your at.|`|Tv0D5y9Waa	It isn't a felony to drive without a license, however it is a felony to to not appear in court.  I am immediately suspicious of a person who 'works off the books', meaning he doesn't pay taxes.  He doesn't have a bank account because that would be a paper trail for the IRS.  Pre paid cell phone is to avoid the credit and back ground check.  You should be very careful, this man could get you tied up into a heap of trouble.  You're doing everything in your power to better you and your daughter's life but it could all be ruined WHEN this guy gets caught and He will get caught mind you!  Better weigh your options and get this guy to spill the beans about his past before the Judicial system does it for you.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	I think that he is working off the books because he owes a lot of people money. So this way if he don't have a job he don't that people know about, they can't get the money from him (they can't garnish his wages). He also may owe the court (the state) money for past tickets and if he don't pay he will have to go to jail and sit it out. You can look people up online and see what they got against them. I am not sure what state you live in but in Wisconsin our website is: <a href="http://wcca.wicourts.gov/simpleCaseSearch.xsl;jsessionid=2D6A57154DF00DCB379872113A0207B8.render5?" rel="nofollow">http://wcca.wicourts.gov/simpleCaseSearc...</a>|`|pKzH1cFHaa	I believe driving without a license is a misdemeanor if no one is hurt.

Definitely keep talking to her and mention the idea of hanging out sometime (casualy) to get a better idea of her feelings. Good Luck!|`|ppWXraSHaa	Don't fall into girls hypnosis.

Boys are confusing. -_-
AdL8Y4X1aa	yeah i think you should def give her a casual call next week, it seems like you two have good vibes going, if she doesent pick up leave a voicemail, dont think that ur too cool to leave a vmail, so leave one saying <br>  <br>  "hey (insert her name) this is (insert your name) just was wondering if you would be free to chill this week, alright so give me a call when you get this, later"<br>  <br>  keep it short and smooth, now when she calls back set the day and time, don't just say "yea lets hang this week" no set an exact day and time this way its clear to her and u that ya'll are chilling that day and time<br>  <br>  now if she doesen't return the call, and you left the vmail, well the balls in her court and shes eiether really busy or ignoring you, so wait 2 weeks after the voicemail call again, if she doesent return that call, leave her alone and when u bump into her, don;t sweat it or bring it up, act live everythings cool<br>  <br>  but i think shell return your call so u dontt have to worry about all those things<br>  <br>  goood luckkk|`|L8J5nNjDaa	asking to "chill" does NOT make you desperate!

What I did was, one day at a dance, I just took him to the side and told him that I liked him. Now we are married and have been together for ten years. <br>  If you don't want to actually do the asking out part then telling him that you like him should give him the que to what he needs to do next. If he likes you back then that will start it all. <br>  <br>  If you are the more assertive type, then just come out and tell him then ask him to be your boyfriend. If you are allowed to go out on a date then ask him out on one. <br>  But whatever you do, do not pass him a note or have one of your other friends tell him because a lot of people don't like that and it wouldn't be smart to risk it. <br>  <br>  I say go with the first option I posted because well, it worked for me. :D I wish you the best.

Act like a prize, but if you chase him, he'll run away, so just try to be friends. After you've texted a few times and he doesn't think you're going to chase him,. tell him that; tell him you want to be buds and act like it's nothing else at all!!! Then sit back and watch him come around. He's interested, believe me. He's probably just as scared as you are. And if you do all that and wait around on him and he doesn't come around? By that time, you'll find someone else!! Wait and see.
87mkq7Zoaa	just talk to him, like txt him sometimes or something like that.<br>  you don't HAVE to let your friends see your phone, an you don't HAVE to tell them :D<br>  plus, its been a month- so if you and him do become good friends i think that whole situation will be blown over.<br>  if you just tell people you have no interest in him like that, and that your just friends i wouldn't think anybody would care too much<br>  especially if nobody knows you were flirting with him at the dance, then they prolly won't think you hella want his balls or something.<br>  <br>  lol's, hope that helped a little bit.<br>  mind returning the favor? <3 :D

You're attached. It's so cute, you just can't get enough. It's young, immature (not saying that's bad) love.<br>  <br>  Puppy love with people is like how teenagers feel about each other.

AA11199456	I have. I hung out with the same group for about 2 and a half years of high school and was always miserable. I was always the one left out and everyone else would joke around laughing and enjoying themselves. One of the girls in the group was my closest friend in school but when she had more fun friends around, she didn't talk to me as much. One day, I just decided I'll stop hanging out with them and hang out with my other friend and her friend. It turned out to be a good decision. They were much more laid-back and I felt like I fit in better. There were days when they irritated me but I wasn't as miserable with them.|`|OwfoyXpraa	Yes.<br>  Has happened twice now.. although, in both situations, there were only one or two of my friends that I felt were holding me back, or weren't being the great friends I thought they were. And then in the end, the entire group just slowly drifted apart, and none of us had many classes with eachother, so we started making new friends.. etc, etc..<br>  <br>  why?|`|i6jT4rpOaa	yeah, in 5th grade i was friends with some girls, but then i realized i didn't want to be known as a girl like that, as i realized they were all sluts. so i pulled away. we never talk now and i am friends with many, respectable, funny, nice girls that i love as best friends:)|`|68CpnNplaa	yeah it happens. plenty of reasons for it too. you dont have to be in a group, tho, plenty of individuals around =)|`|3swZV9uUaa	yes some people do xp that stuff like i stoped hanging around with some people because they do drugs and goth and they wanted me to join them... so yea you can say that...|`|ci7Q54Gwaa	Yes. Usually becuase they did something i didnt like, such as smoking or drinking or something that made me loose respect for them. As far as them holding me back, no.|`|MtQ9ea2Uaa	My freshmen year my best friend (a girl) and I hung out with a bunch of guys. Maybe six or seven. We were all just friends and it was so much fun. But then I went out with one of them for a while.<br>  We stopped being friends when the guy and I broke up. The whole group was separated because of that. So technically it is because of something we didn't like :)<br>  <br>  I really really miss them though. I miss that huge group! Now sophomore year it's just me, the same best friend and other girls but no guys at all :P

dMj0nrZtaa	He sounds like he is interested, but doesn't want to seem too desparate or anything. I dont think it would hurt to text and ask.
dHPA390Qaa	You called them 'your kids' so I am assuming that could be the root cause of his wanting you to choose between himself and them.<br>  Gosh, that is unfair of him.  You need to make it clear to him that when you had your children, you committed yourself to them for ever.  You want to help them out during this tough time, which IS temporary.<br>  tell him to get off your back!|`|zifEvqy2aa	1St off your daughter is an adult dont enable her by watching the kids, she can get daycare, either her or her husband need to be home in the evenings taking care of the family.  Tell your husband even if he is the bread winner you wont enable him to be this way either, dont let him control you, you are not a robot dont be treated like one.  also maybe he needs to take care of himself and not be so dependant on you.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Your daughter and her husband need to get out and find an apartment.  She did not marry a real man that can take care of her and their family.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	Your daughter is an adult, and you can stop raising her now|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Um I don't think you can do both without killing yourself.  Why do you think your job is to be the door-mat of the world?<br>  <br>  I think your daughter and her husband should be paying you for your services.  Even if they paid you 1/2 the rate of normal daycare, it's a great deal for them and helps out with the stress in your home life with your husband.<br>  <br>  Why do I get that this man is not her father?|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Im a mother too and I understand that you just can′t get rid of your daughter..you love her as I love mine. What your husband needs maybe is certainty..and for that i mean day and time when they are leaving for sure. Temporary could mean 2 years..or 1 month, maybe he needs to be reassured of  that. Men demand attention, we are little less selfish,,they take and we give beyond our strength..but reality is husbands should be first as wives should..but also he should be a little more condescend.|`|b8by7fSKaa	Your husband is your top priority not your daughter.  She is GROWN.  Why are you neglecting your husband so you can be a slave to your daughter?<br>  If your daughter and her husband has 2 jobs each, then when do they have time for their children.  Don't you think it is selfish of them to put this responsibility on you?  When I grew up, I was always surrounded by extended family, but you are being used as a babysitter and nothing more.<br>  Don't push your husband away just because your daughter is running all over you.  Treat him with respect and you will get respect from him.  He's only reacting to you not making him your priority.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	If you keep bowing to your daughter, it's not going to stop any tie soon.<br>  <br>  You married your husband.  Now that your daughter is a married woman and mother, it should be up to her and her husband to take care of their own playing house, not cause trouble for mom and her's.  <br>  <br>  If you and hubby need more money, I can't blame him for being upset.  <br>  <br>  It's not your fault or his that your daughter and her hubby each work 2 jobs and don't sleep. They chose to have2 babies and buy a home.
AdL8Y4X1aa	does he know that u are in love with him? If he does and he hasn't approached you in a certain way that I think you should let it go, but if he doesen't know then maybe be daring tell him, you have strong feelings for him and that he's the perfect guy, tell him you want to respect his girlfriend but you can't help the way you feel about him and ask him to be serious and for him to tell you how he truly feels about you, because maybe he's scared to be with you because he knows ur really the girl he wants , sometimes we search for things thats right in front of us all along.<br>  <br>  If it doesen't work out then its fine, youll meet someone 45 times better then him, but if it does work out take it slow and watch what ur doing because u dont want a friendship to end because u two decided to be together<br>  <br>  good luckk|`|u6qbJd01aa	Just confront him and say<br>  Look buddy..make up yo mind<br>  i love you..your like my brother but i'd like to be more<br>  and i'm confused 'cause your flirting with me and have a gf<br>  make up your mind...<br>  either chose me, chose the girl, or be friends with me..|`|IQpvK7vraa	Forget about it, you need to think about whats important, besides after a while you are not going to be able to communicate like you use to. try something else but never date a friend you intend to keep.|`|dkxceXXYaa	Tell him you love him and it will end like a fairy tale, unless you get hit by a bus..|`|6bSIAne3aa	If you all are best friends then you should be able to tell him how you feel.. who knows he might feel the same way about you....|`|AA10112105	Suggest a three-some|`|Xb6sf3oKaa	ask him y he has a gf if he likes you. follow his answer and see where it leads you. <br>  good luck :)|`|Og9abf2baa	Go for it!  What do you have to loose?  I married my best friend!|`|R05l8V3Kaa	If this guy really likes you he will leave his girlfriend instead of just "flirting" with you. If he told you that he loves his girlfriend why would you want to come in between that. Why don't you put yourself in her shoes and think about how it would feel if you boyfriend's "friend" was chasing after him. I bet you would be ready to fight. Instead of disrespecting someone's relationship why don't you try to go out on a couple of dates with other men who aren't taken. It could work in your advantage because if this guy really likes you he will be jealous, leave his girlfriend and be with you. If he's not jealous, you still might meet someone who you like. He might be flirting with you in order to keep you on the backburner as a backup (men and women both do it all the time). If he and his girlfriend are doing good, leave them alone and if they're not then they won't last and you will be free to be with him.|`|zrJm2pjHaa	wow a year and a half,,,first u should probably ask him out if he eva breaks up with tat girls second mayb u should tell him how u rlly feel jus for da hell of it.. rememba if he says yes itz ur luky day but if he says no well u guys can still b firends and u can move on... mayb u can find some1 beta|`|C7Cz9qqTaa	t3ll HiM 2 BRaK33 uP WIT dAT h0EE bAGGG.|`|ns1F0p8Laa	If he "loves" his girlfriend but "likes" you then thats a major difference.  First talk to him and see how serious his relationship is with the girl but I don't think you should mess up what they have because karma can hurt you don't want nobody to do you like that.  Know that what is meant to be will be.  Patience is a virtue and it is best to wait your turn.|`|JCGckRu6aa	Just tell him you have feelings for him.

9UQlhzitaa	first lets answer the question about teasing. <br>  we guys tease those we like to see how they are if they can take it or not, or do they fight back and turn it on us .It gives us an idea of how to handle the person and what to expect.<br>  The whole being nice and helpful is his way of saying I'm here for you.(see by my actions you now know you can count on me to be there for you.)<br>  <br>  a guy only does it with people he likes.<br>  <br>  he is trying to find the way to ask you ,He just has not found enough of a reason from you to take the chance because he doesn't want to be wrong about you liking him.|`|HQ4t7JfGaa	lol you smart girl    hes basically tryin move to you  i think you should ask him out before he does and YES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD  USE CONDOM|`|Y9Sj56D5aa	he likes u but don't know how to show it truly from inside maybe scared afraid u might reject him if he ask u out. ask him out  if u like him .|`|JGj8TN2saa	well i guess he want's to be friends with you and with the girl that i liked i joked around with her|`|6mpfxYwmaa	i think he likes you.. he seems kinda sweet. :) i think that if the guy were to actually ask those questions, they wouldnt like you. but he's probably more comfortable around you when you arent alone. or maybe if he does like, you he wants to hide that from you. hope this helps|`|XvWHlfkkaa	aw he sounds cute. haha. <br>  <br>  ok 1) yes he would do that.<br>  2) he probably likes you and the reason hes awkward when its just you and him is because he is nervous!! he probably doesnt know what to say. <br>  <br>  and guys usually tease you when they like you.|`|h8TPe189aa	he does like you.. alot of guys act that way. its really convusing cuz i dont really get wat the point is of being nice then being wird around other poeple..its a guy thing.. but he does like you|`|3szxLNfyaa	he likes you <3 love is in the air baby|`|OlK0Pa1Gaa	Hi Marishka,<br>  I think that he does actually like you. The thing that really lets me know is because when you two are alone he is more shy and calm. I think this shows that he may get nervous around you while alone which tends to happen with guys. (Even if they don't want to admit it). If that extra information wasn't included I might would have said that any guy can joke around with a girl but I think it does prove that he has feelings for you if it's noticeably more awkward while alone. This also may be your nerves too. But overall, YES :D|`|xUWejoiQaa	It really depends on the guy, but if his personality changes when he's around you only, chances are he likes you :).  Does he act this way around other girls?  Do you have any guy friends who are also friends with him?  Ask your guy friends for extra advice or your friends who are girls.  They might be able to pick signals up from him that you don't.  <br>  Here's a video on how to tell if a guy likes you: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yfo7Itx_s0&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yfo7Itx_...</a><br>  <br>  Just remember, if a guy doesn't show all the signals in it, doesn't mean that he doesn't like you.  The guy who liked me and who I liked didn't do many of those things and I asked him out and he said yes.   Now we go out and my friend who is also friends with him said he could pick up differences in his personality (around me) that I couldn't.  Also, if you're considering to ask him out, think about all his good and bad qualities.  I've had a crush on a few jerks before and now I regret it.  Anyway, I hope everything turns out for the best :)|`|n1nmxTUkaa	1.) I think he likes you! <br>  <br>     1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot.<br>     <br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  <br>            * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>     <br>  3. Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>    <br>   4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you, unless he's a bit of a "playboy" who flirts with a lot of girls. See if he uses any of the tricks in How to Touch a Girl, and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else.<br>    <br>   5. Watch his actions around other girls and see if he treats you differently. Some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention. It gives them a chance to see your reaction. It helps them know if you really do like them or not. The way you can tell that they are trying to make you jealous is that they find little times when they're flirting with the other girl to look at you. His eyes will flick over and look at you. Another sign is that when you leave, he stops flirting with the other girl. That will be a harder one to pick up on, but you can have a friend look for you or something like that. You have to be sneaky sometimes to find out if a guy likes you.<br>    <br>   6. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>     <br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies.<br>     <br>  8. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't?<br>  <br>  <br>  ..Tips..<br>  If he seems comfortable talking to you about other girls, he probably does not like you in that way. Either that, or he is trying to make you jealous, which might mean that he likes you but doesn't reflect too well on his character. Or he could be trying to see if you like him.<br>  <br>  ..Warnings..<br>  # Watch out for the subtle guys. If he asks you something that could potentially be a date but you're not really sure, make sure it's clear before you agree to it. It can be uncomfortable when one of you thinks you're on a date and one of you thinks you're not.<br>  <br>  # The wrong kind of guy might say he likes you without meaning it; if this is the case, he probably wants to see how far you would go with him, for any of those activities (whatever they may be) themselves and for bragging rights among his friends.<br>  <br>  Follow this to see what he's like!|`|AulaPWqbaa	he was just joking.

Talk about movies or books, something interesting, something that won't have you hanging up going, "God that was so awkward and boring!"<br>  <br>  My advice is cereal. In my experience most people have a very strong opinion about which cereal is best. Challenge her favorite cereal and it'll turn into a fullblown debate.|`|DwiQ66qyaa	awww that's so sweet<br>  <br>  umm...talk about everything?<br>  <br>  Seriously the subject doesn't matter...the important thing is that you say something
lNlL0Ag2aa	The girls I've met are the same way, I have never seen all my female friends asked out a guy who was ugly, they were either older male models. IT's all because people don't fall in love when they see a girl because of her personality?<br>  <br>   That would be stupid because how can they fall in love with him for his personality, if they only glanced at him? That would mean they were physically appealed by her, that saying "Love at first sight" is the best way to describe it. Sight means seeing and what you're seeing is not her personality, but her physicaly appeal. Personality is just what holds the relationship together, but it's not what starts it.
MQVmh5hiaa	Well it does sound like she doesn't want people to know that you guys are dating. But before you consider it I think that you should ask her weather or not she is ashamed that you and her are together. So don't dump her if you wanted to go out with her for a long time and you don't know for sure. Just ask.|`|6KdRfpehaa	dump her.<br>  if she doesn't want to show it, what's the point?|`|XH1YP57Oaa	im sorry 2 say.. but i think u should dump her if she is going to act liike that.<br>  you can do so much better.<br>  you could get a girl who is not afraid to show you are with her &nd who is pproud to call you hers. :]<br>  <br>  you will. you deserve better than her.<br>  :]<br>  good luck.|`|PkDL8vemaa	talk to her before you dump her cause if thats true what the point of having a gf if no one knows cause thats like not even having one

Well lets see I dont know about all girls but in my case when I talk about the guy I like I talk about the cute things he does, his 6-pack ;]], how cute, how nice and pretty much just stuff about him like that. also we talk about guys when they act like jerks.|`|Ddfff5psaa	Well yea we do talk about guys a lot! Not as much as guys talk about us though I think.  We worry a lot about school, our make-up, clothes, sports we are in, and other things.  I think it depends on the girl herself also.  Girls with more hobbies and things to do don't think about guys as much as girls with no lives.|`|ULkqriEhaa	Depends on the girl. If i am with girls we talk about books, music etc. If our boyfriends come up we talk about what's new and what we did on the weekend or whatever. We don't sit around and giggle like morons which you may think - we usually have intelligent things to say...the best of us at least.|`|AA12164862	I never kiss and tell........|`|nHi1mioBaa	oh yah.....that is our main subject <br>  we talk about if he's cute or not<br>  the way he dress,how is hair is...if the guy is weird or not<br>  the way he smell lolz<br>  and we kinda compare all the guys haha
6WjUi3M5aa	You need to explain this to your husband and have him stand up for you. You are his wife, and should be his life. If he is not man enough to stand up for you and put your sister-in-laws in their place, then you married a very weak man. Did you know he was this weak before you married him?|`|AA11578616	separate yourself from them.Speak to your husband and let him know how you feel about the matter.You married him not his gold digging sisters|`|AA10423186	just  tell  here|`|cloASB6paa	Make it a point to them that you have your own money (unlike them). That's the only thing you can do, because it sounds like they're jealous women who can't stand sharing their brothers. Otherwise, ignore them. If people so easily believe their lies, those people aren't worth knowing anyways. And why stress the opinions of people that don't matter too much in your life? Just keep in mind that your husband knows that you aren't a golddigger.|`|KwNpyp3saa	There are just some people are not happy. They seem like they are jealous. One, you "took" their brother away. Second, they may be thinking he isn't spending as much on them as they used to. <br>   <br>  If they are adults, I wonder why he spends money on them. His responsibility is with you. Just try not to let them get to you. Don't complain to him about his sisters. This will make him uncomfortable and soon he will begin to resent you.

AA11553531	just relax..enjoy the little things like holding his hand....boys r very awkward at his age...take ur time, u can show him how to act by the way that u act towards him.  when he becomes comfortable with his new girl he will want to take a more active roll....dont worry and dont hurry
W2pU2g9Eaa	hahaha well I'm a black girl, and I guess the best way to talk to me is just come up to me and have an actual conversation, dnt just act like all u wanna do is f*** me. be respectful. and be yourself a that would be the best way to talk to me, but it's not different for a lot of girls!!! <br>  <br>  best of luck!!
MRxm67DPaa	not at all its not bad look theres nothen bad about 2 friends jus hangen out and haven a good time ppl do it all the times i mean if u know ur not gonna do anythine dont let ppl get to u ok just like be happy that ur gonna have a good time with and friend of urs. so its not bad|`|i6jT4rpOaa	noooo they're all jealous that you're the first to have a guy over. hahaha. losers:)<br>  and it's totallyyy okay to have a guy over. i mean, you're friends, right? practically best friends. so it's totally fine.|`|VScRdzJKaa	It's not wrong at all.|`|1NSmBMjJaa	nope<br>  hello they are your friend i bet they would not try anything unless they like you than that is not the same!|`|3swZV9uUaa	No it isnt bad for a girl to ask a guy to go to her house trust me almost all my friends are girls and i always get invited to there houses but idk what school you go to but for people they take it not seriously aka "immature" people and they are going to start saying rumors/gossip. but no it isnt wrong asking a guy to go to your house|`|68CpnNplaa	no if youre just friends than duh why not? theyre just being stupid b/c they cant see tht not all guys are for dating, some make the best friends =)
68CpnNplaa	go to a cafe or club, somewhere fun, cafe if u cant get anyone to come, club if u can get a few together, plenty of things to do =)|`|s2DzUnhFaa	i totally understand where ur commin from--- and i have no advice sry
xq6dnRuhaa	Interesting ..... you have various similarities with me (except that I am not into playing music instruments and I definitely don't ever act "gay" but not like a loud mouth bada$$ either, neither do I hang out with band nerds lol) and guess what no luck with the ladies here either!!! Although I have against me the fact that I don't live on campus and due to the driving back and forth I really don't have much time for any clubs or extra activities, but still I know this is not a big deal because it hasn't stopped me from meeting women at my college.<br>  <br>  It feels like college girls are either taken already or just not interested, and sure enough I am smart so I do go for the ones that seem nice/smart only so it is not like I am shooting for the wrong ones or anything.... in fact, if she looks slutty or just not my type then I simply don't waste my type with what I don't want and don't talk to that one.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I am not giving up, but it is dissapointing to see it is your 2nd year already and no gf still..... and I must have meet minimum +25 girls these last 2 years that seemed like a possible match, but yeah I guess none of them felt that spark for me or whatever. Otherwise, I would have gotten email responses from at least 2 or 3 of them.<br>  <br>  Ok, my only advice for you (despite being in a similar situation) is simple: get to know as many new girls/women as you can given the opportunity to do so. I usually do it at lunch or anywhere....... and make sure you leave some way to maintain contact with the ones that were clearly interested in talking to you, the ones that barely looked at you or showed no interest..... well you would be dumb if you pay attention to them again. And also be realistic, don't go for someone you don't like because that will not work out, but hey consider the ones that are pretty yet not beautiful since you are like that yourself.<br>  <br>  And last but not least: the best confidence boosters ever are exercising/running (do it for yourself just to feel good yourself, don't do it to "look good" to anyone do it for your own personal benefit) and not allowing oneself to get interested in a girl early NO MATTER WHAT, or simply put not caring about the outcomes early on (but don't do anything stupid either of course). When you are not interested early you will not get nervous and you will not take rejection like a big deal if you actually do get it because dude you really weren't too interested!!! Besides, it seems to me that being interested at first sight is something that actually turns them OFF. I don't know why but I know it first hand. So at first it is just getting to know her and showing her who you are, if she gives a positive response and seems interested (you can tell this if you are smart) mantain contact somehow and keep going from there, but do not allow yourself to feel anything emotional for her until you know she likes you.... and of course if there was no interest the 1st and  2nd time DON'T BOTHER A 3rd AND FIND ANOTHER ONE TO TALK TO. Someone who likes the way you are usually likes it from the very start not 1 month later. Nothing must ever be forced if so then she is not the one period<br>  <br>  Now with all that said I guess I need some extra luck too...... and may be forgetting about getting a gf, though as you know, this is not easy and probably not completely possible due to freaking hormones and horniness........ oh well good luck to us! and to our lucky future women too hehe :p|`|FIWB7Dgtaa	wow!thats quite a question..acting gay kinda puts u in the friend zone-u just havent found the right girl..high school sucks|`|9btcOpxXaa	you remind me of someone. and im not saying that to be  mean. Just dont be as perverted girls dont like that, and dont go over passionate with girls of course they like that, but too much can scare them and it starts to seem corny. Be more hard to get ( but not too much cuz then girls feel like they have no chance). Yeah its all confusing an if you want someone to notice you look nice ( smell nice, having decent clothes, and take some time on ur hair) yeah good luck!! sorry if this all is a bit much.|`|g1qoAtaRaa	Absolutely NOTHING is wrong with you. It's the girls that are at fault here, because you sound like a really great guy. And don't worry about being "perverted" or gay....cause every guy is perverted, no matter how innocent. If i could (and was ur age, ur probably too old) I would so date you!!<br>  <br>  Go get em... and you'll find the right girl some day!!<br>  <br>  PS how old r u?|`|6ddNezzSaa	you sound like you're trying too hard. just go a little easier on the "Prince Charming". or maybe its cause they think u r gay cause u act like it sometimes. but other than that u sound pretty cool.|`|Otatq4LTaa	To be honest, I have no clue. You seem like a pretty fun and cool person to me. (:<br>  <br>  Maybee, the girl doesn't like that you always try to be friends with her friends? I'm not really sure, you sound pretty cool to me. (:|`|QUaKca1Caa	Honestly.. It does sound like your trying to hard. And your SO sweet to girls, dont get me wrong girls deserve sweet, but they want a guy with an edge to him.<br>  <br>  And the acting gay.. isnt going to really win you a chance. <br>  <br>  I honestly hate perverted guys. Some perverted jokes here and there are okay, but they have to be funny, not gross.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion..|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	my best guess would be it's acting gay. or maybe girls don't feel that ever get to know you because you spend so much time by yourself outside of school. i hope your luck improves.|`|TuBzc1R5aa	you sound really nice! like a great friend.<br>  thanks for telling about your negative side instead of being full of yourself and only talking about your positive side. idk why you don't have a gf. i don't get it either. i don't think there's anything wrong with you.
BbT3DCHvaa	stay with your current boyfriend if you really love him|`|S46FYzmjaa	I am in the same boat unfortunately...when you find the answer...let me know :'(|`|UtKVRhubaa	Stay with your boyfriend,<br>  you answered your own question idiot.<br>  Quote from you in your question "i dont want 2 break up with mii bf &nd get with mii ex cuz mii friends haate him.."<br>  So why are you asking us when you know?<br>  Psssh fcukhead.|`|LxfqUaaIaa	Your ex is your ex for a reason. Stay with your bf. Besides, your friends wouldn't hate your ex unless they didn't think he was good enough for you. Move on for your own good :P Good luck.
w7aHSXCIaa	this, litterally, just happened to me a week ago, only the other way around. Me and this guy liked each other for a little bit, and then i decided that i didnt like him anymore cuz it didnt feel right. so then he told me at first that he still liked me, and now he says that he's getting over it. So i think it would be best if you kept him updated. Or, better yet, you could ask him if he wants to know!! Lol|`|ns1F0p8Laa	If he's a jerk then leave him alone.  How you going to like a person and dislike them all at the same time?  I think you should just talk to him about it and see if he still feel the same way if not let him be and talk to someone who is interested in you.|`|0tKNkAMuaa	it hurts, im sorry but he doesn't like you...just be friends. good luck!|`|AA12157752	If you tell him: <br>  <br>  If he cares about you and you tell him you still like him but he doesn't like you back, he'd say sorry, I don't feel that way for you.<br>  <br>  Some people however, would only take advantage of your feelings, because they know you like them and would do what ever for them. <br>  <br>  Or he might change his mind and like you. But there is a fine line between taking advantage of you and liking you truly, so just beware of where you are really at, when you tell him.|`|AA11353473	If you think that he's a really big jerk, then don't bother doing that.<br>  You can get someone better than that.<br>  Although, you two should've got together when he used to have feelings towards you.<br>  Try finding another guy.<br>  I know that it sounds hard, but I had to give up on someone that I really liked before.<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq.YAP4TDTdtrBR4BSoAy_zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304152842AAjiLa3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	Yeah if he likes you back. dont pass this up. please?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  help me?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306161235AA62VP6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|UhWQuxLVaa	No he's not wort it find another guy|`|rLvOOuPhaa	Okay, he's not an asshole.

Sometimes it is better to face him and ask him to be honest, no matter how much it hurts. I know because I went through the same thing. (the pain it is to stand up! )
rEUI5sVvaa	Wow, this is a tough one. You impersonated someone else and fooled her into telling you the truth (and it must have hurt), It's going to be very hard to earn back her trust when you tell her, but it will show her that you aren't playing around and your a true friend, whether or not she is or isn't. Another thing to consider is just because someone tells you someone else is talking junk, doesn't neccessarily mean it is true. Just remember: KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE, BUT YOU ENEMIES CLOSER. Hope this helps. =)|`|3b0d3b4009331e9ee3cc64d4986f1820aa	Honesty is the best policy. Tell her that you pretended that you were someone else.

U pretended to b som1 else to get answers from ur friend (Which is very disonist) and ur friend talkin behind ur back (which is mean.)

F-R-I-E-N-D-L-Y-!|`|wZFRYA4Kaa	OMG YES! you should totallyyy confront her! shes tlkin behind ur back! my this just happened to one of my 2 best friends and they got into a fite. but they tlked it out and stuff.<br>  and just say i heard u were mad at me and jealous and stuff, is tht true. and if she says no tell her about online :]<br>  <3 summiee
UqLbDHBraa	imo, he's your ex for a reason.|`|P85LVLCTaa	can't say|`|0ktcvglRaa	Don't go back out with your ex.|`|FzFSzilmaa	he's your ex.. perhaps you need to mature and move on with your life...|`|3szxLNfyaa	why the frigg don't you ask him|`|V2RNpIFZaa	how old are you? if your not in college or older dont get back with him it wont work out in the end never does
UXrtUTgEaa	alright i have the perfect plan for you.... so, first of all, the boy that is older than you is not a good idea. im in 9th grade and let me tell ya the older the guy gets the worse he is. they might seems like prince charming at first but the truly end up immature and he will break your heart. i promise you that he is a bad choice the reason i think you should pick elfin is because he is your best friend and you guys get along and he will treat you like a princess. the way you should confront him is say "i know you probably dont like me anymore... but i was thinking about what i said before when you liked me and i know you heard me say some bad things but i got to know you and i like you alot now. i hope you understand." please forget about the other guy and stick with elfin :) glad to help, vote for me ;) tell me how it ends up and you should take my advice because i know it will work|`|LpedVLedaa	Elfin doesn't deserve you....he deserves better with someone who will be with him because they want to be and not because he was 2nd choice.|`|29tiSHnnaa	i dont think you're being fair to the first guy, he seems nice but now you're just leading him on.
zzaScg0haa	He is a jerk and you deserve better
i6jT4rpOaa	you are totally pretty:)<br>  <br>  and she is a total slut.<br>  tell your boyfriend you have bad feelings about her trying to steal him away. if he loves you, he will listen.<br>  try talking to the girl. explain about the foster care thing and feeling like you're going to lose him and then you will have no one to love you left.<br>  if she gets sassy, tell your boyfriend. he will not want anything to do with a ***** like that.<br>  and if shes nice about it, dont say anything.|`|PzbYPcSwaa	awww im sure he loves u only so just go to the other girl and tell her to back off and then u will feel better!
ZCLdV2HBaa	she is for sure going to be contacting skin :) haha.. hints she's worrying about your scent on her. . After the last time when she said lets forget about what happened she could've said something like that because of the way you acted towards what happened. Like if she was really glad it happened, and you acted calm like it wasnt a big deal. she might of been trying to push herself away like he didn't enjoy that he must not be very interested in me. Also ( coming from a woman in a smiliar situation) Married or not.. she is unhappy with her marriage, and that's why she is doing what she is. So as far as sex goes.. a woman's mind tells her wait don't have sex with him yet.. ya know? She might just be holding out because she actually likes you, and wants you to treat it like an actual relationship.. not like oh she's married she just wants sex.<br>  <br>  i dont know if any of that helps. hope so!|`|L2pkns9maa	If she has morals and self respect then no... But shes a whore... go for it.
Hk39AkNGaa	Yea and That "Friend" is probably You...its ok dont be shy ;P and ur to young to be on the site. <br>  <br>  Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. <br>  Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  <br>  <br>  His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually. <br>  Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company. <br>  Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you, unless he's a bit of a "playboy" who flirts with a lot of girls. See if he uses any of the tricks in How to Touch a Girl, and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else. <br>  Watch his actions around other girls and see if he treats you differently. Some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention. It gives them a chance to see your reaction. It helps them know if you really do like them or not. The way you can tell that they are trying to make you jealous is that they find little times when they're flirting with the other girl to look at you. His eyes will flick over and look at you. Another sign is that when you leave, he stops flirting with the other girl. That will be a harder one to pick up on, but you can have a friend look for you or something like that. You have to be sneaky sometimes to find out if a guy likes you. <br>  Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well. <br>  Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. <br>  Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't?|`|fb3aad21d8783ffe3b227fd0b9240204aa	those r all the right signs to tell if a guy likes u or not|`|lHWJljNPaa	You can't tell with signs because some guys do that even if they don't like her.|`|dZ8c9AtOaa	She is eleven and desperate??

95211d0e5eb98a4a0fdb5680545d4d06aa	Whether you believe it or not, I don't care about money. I'm going to be in major debt from my education just because I want a job where I can help children even though it won't pay that much. As long as I have enough for food & shelter, I'm happy. In fact my boyfriend can make major money right now as a doctor, but I constantly encourage him to pursue his writing dreams, because I can see that's what truly makes him happy. He says that he wants to make enough money that his (future) wife doesn't have to work, but even if that was me I would work anyway. I don't want to be some bum mooching off my husband. I'm working hard in school for my career and I'm going to put my knowledge to use. I have plenty of female friends who have no desire to be a housewife. And the attractiveness thing is individual to everyone- guys and girls. There's no point in saying everyone only wants a good looking bf/gf, because that's not what relationships are built on. As much as my bf compliments my looks, he also compliments my personality (interesting, nurturing, good listener, etc.) And I like my guy for how he lives his life, his goals, his sense of adventure, how he treats me. Looks are just a plus. So basically, stop generalizing! Just because you've had some rough experiences with women doesn't mean we're all that way.|`|WBtifYxDaa	u r right for some girls.

X4i2jej5aa	I think that girls who don't try to make themselves look attractive are the best looking girls. I am a girl, but I have friends who are guys who tell me that they think girls who doesn't wear make-up are much cuter than those who do. And I think jogging pants and a sweater in a pony are very athletic, maybe they like those types of girls. The bottom line is that you should be yourself, don't try to make yourself look anymore beautiful than you already are. That would just make you look like a wannabe. Be yourself, and you will eventually get their attention. To further into the relationship, try talking to them, make them notice you for you and only you.|`|iJzlRCkOaa	They're just 12.  They don't really even like girls other than cute crushes at that age.|`|BXe211Fvaa	ummm, then wear something nice when their single?<br>  you're 12? aren't you supposed to be over 13 to be on here?|`|AA11353473	Then, I'd suggest that when you expect to see them just wear makeup ( not too much, just maybe mascara ), wear a cute top and bottom, and put your hair down.<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq.YAP4TDTdtrBR4BSoAy_zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304152842AAjiLa3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|dF9VvSTEaa	well drop something in front of them and get them to pick it up...or<br>  <br>  time it so you walk through a door together....both convo starters|`|3CeJHTDqaa	Ok your wayyyy too young, uhm try focusing on school please!<br>  You will get your chance at dating later in life trust me!|`|UhWQuxLVaa	you need to wait til ur a littl oldr b4 u start thinkin bout boys|`|mmrcaoUzaa	Life's to short to care about your age, if you need an uplift for your complexion and eyelashes, do it up.

9nDqbYyHaa	well you can either stop talking to him, which would be option 1.

He wants you to know that he thinks a bit more of you. Don't seem needy or force-full to him over him being intimate, he will come around sooner than you think. Leave yourself open a little to give him the opportunity to show you in some small way, later they will become huge!|`|RDgyb7W8aa	He is making sure you like him for himself and not sex.|`|xol0rAjLaa	Why don′t you try to ask him?|`|dlGZebDmaa	Totally understandable...You guys moved too fast.<br>  There was no chance to have romance, the flirting and the things you expect when you first start dating.<br>  It's normal that sometimes things happen fast but I agree.<br>  Slow things down, promise you will love it too!|`|EVc90HV0aa	He said he doesn't wants to have the relationship to be based on sex, so i'm guessing that's what he means. Maybe he wants more than that.|`|5df004c13545e833eab59ba6fdcb1e18aa	Just ask him and hope for the best|`|JDukHa70aa	he is afraid of commetment and is fixing to run|`|Yd1la6mLaa	What he is trying to say to you is "I am done with you."|`|r7u2g8roaa	Really, you should just ask him.<br>  <br>  Men and women are different in many things and the same in many things. We both share the same hormones and body parts just in different quantities or shapes. All embryos begin with the same things, in the same amounts and in the same places. Some men have a little more Feminine and some women have a little more masculine but both qualities are in every male and female.<br>  <br>  Women have much more to gain from sex than a man. I wish I could have orgasms as strong as my women have. A man is stimulated on a very small area of his penis while a woman has her clitoris, her vaginal lips, her opening, her canal and her uterus. The woman feels much more and men can "see" this during intercourse.<br>  <br>  He may just think you enjoy the sex so much he doesn't want you to forget the really important parts of love.<br>  <br>  There is a very good chance he has been giving you so much sex because he wants to impress you or be certain you are getting enough to keep your mind off other men.<br>  <br>  If he is a normal male he is already wondering how long he can keep up giving you constant sex....when a man desires or loves a woman it is normal that he questions his abilities to conquer or maintain.<br>  <br>  Just talk to him openly and understandably and let him explain in his own words.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I'm a female, but I still know what he means. You must be having sex the majority of the time you spend together. So what he's saying is he has more than just sexual feelings for you, which is a good thing. He wants to get to know you more, and not focus mainly on sex.|`|AA10093500	"What more do he want"<br>  <br>  Great grammar.<br>  <br>  He's (probably) trying to communicate to you that his intentions are genuine in an immature, caveman sort of way.<br>  <br>  Here's an idea....why don't you ask HIM about this instead of a bunch of strangers?
L1EnPN67aa	Lots of women and girls like older men. It's pretty normal. I like mature guys, but they have o be within 4 years for me to actually be comfortable. It depends on what type of person you to are if it's a good match. You can find out if he likes you:<br>  <br>  If you don't want to be direct, ask a friend, find out who he has a crush on, or ask someone what he thinks of you, or does he ever mention you in conversations or talks about you at all.<br>  <br>  If you're the bold type, sometimes, it calls for that- Just ask him how he feels about you, but find out what he wants with you? Because if you're underage, it may be a questionable union. But if you're 18, why should age really even matter? There are things more important than age to consider when you're an adult.|`|rEUI5sVvaa	Personally, in my opinion AGE is JUST a number...but do keep in mind, if your underage it can cause problems. With the whole finding out if he likes you thing, don't over do it and don't be obsessive about it. If he likes you all you have to do is let him know (lightly) and if it's meant to be, it will be. It's not weird, just don't go up to him and say "I'M TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH YOU GUY!" Be Subtle. I hope this helps. =)|`|HdVHfVhRaa	Nope it's not. It might be weird if you're like 13. Just find out what he's about. Make sure he's not in a relationship, because you don't want to be seen as a home wrecking whore.|`|3Y7RJu3taa	It's not weird, its perfectly normal to like older men.  Girls (in general) mature faster, so older guys are much more appealing a majority of the time.  Honestly though, I don't think you should dwell on whether he likes you or not.  It sounds like you are young enough that the age difference really would keep you two from being together (and most likely it would be a statutory rape) so keep in mind that even if he does like you (which i wouldn't count on because you really are much younger), the knowledge of that would only make it more difficult because unless i'm mistaken about your age and you are over 18, chances are it wouldn't work out.|`|DFXyD8riaa	Is he 8?  because that would be weird.   WHOA!   THere is a baby on the computer!!!|`|NwMEfejLaa	it depends on how old you are. If you are like 20, 20 & 28 isn't that odd but if you're a teen or younger then it's pretty weird.|`|zC3SLBKJaa	My dad was 7 years older than my mom.   Is it weird? nah.  its almost normal or even commonplace after age 20 or so.|`|0sI33S9Kaa	nope|`|GrWCIQvJaa	no it not!
CDzStUPUaa	Don't worry,  ok?  All he's gonna think is that a younger girl has a crush on him.  No biggie;  happens all the time.  So stop worrying, and start looking at boys your own age.   That will get your mind off him and raise  your chances of getting a b/f that you'll have more in common with.   Good luck!   :)
Wo5Ezmwiaa	I'm a woman, and I agree with the above answerer. It's sort of in our nature to do that. I typically do that, with people I'm not interested in, and people who I am. It's just in the way we carry ourselves. It's part of our nature. I wouldn't take it as a sign all on its own.|`|0VDMp2Q0aa	Some people in general just do that. Its not a sure sign of anything, at least I don't think you should take it that way.

8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I wouldn't be certain she can legally do this, regardless of whether the divorce decree is silent about it.  See an attorney licensed in the state where the divorce took place.  See if the divorce papers gives that state ongoing jurisdiction (probably does, again, even if not in the decree)...<br>  <br>  I think that he has a good chance of getting his child support offset by travel expenses, if nothing else.  Also, he needs a modified parenting plan (or w/e it's called there) anyway, to give him set visitation.<br>  <br>  If she has left the state, in violation of a set visitation order, she may be committing the crime of "custodial interference" or "kidnapping," depending on how he wants to handle this.<br>  <br>  Have him try this:  Send her a certified letter, asking for a modification by agreement.  See if she will attend mediation and come to agreement which will save huge costs for both parties.<br>  <br>  Personal note:  My ex has zero visitation/ zero legal custody in the divorce decree and we've both left the state of the divorce (VA).  We work it out.  My ex pretty much just lets me bring my son down to FL when I can come and he might pay for half of the gas (if I ask and his gf will do it lol).  He isn't in a position to fight for anything and I don't bug him too much about the child support arrearage (huge, btw).  Check cheap airlines in your area and hers.  I can now put my son on a plane for $39 each way from TN to FL (which I am doing for Spring break so I can take a vacation for a change lol).|`|AA12133859	I have no idea, he needs to talk to his lawyer.<br>  <br>  That said, are you perhaps unable to see the forest for the trees? His kids deserve as much as a relationship with their father as possible. If he does not see them for years because Mom will not pay what does that say to his kids, money was more important than them to him?  He needs to do whatever he can to see his kids and you if you love him, need to do all you can to support it.

I would tell the courts and force her to bring them back or risk loosing her children. Your attourney is wrong. She can be forced to move back because what she did can be considered kidnapping.
2hcA3VP9aa	there are many reasons why he would make the excuses that he did. one reason may be that he might have some things planned with his family and he might not want you to know for some reasons that are unknown. another reason may be that he is just hesitant about hanging out with you since it has been a while since he seen you the last time. i think if you really want to know what is wrong with him, you should just straight up ask him " is there a reason why you are avoiding me because i feel since you came back you have been trying to keep your distance", or you can say something close to that. i hope this helps and i hope every thing works out for the best. good luck.

9nDqbYyHaa	First of all hey, lol ok but ive been in that situation before, andi think i might have eneve asked the same question. Well there are alot of first date places that are really good, trust me lol. But i chose to go to the beach and take a walk on the sand, it was reallly cute, and very quiet so we got to openup about our personal life and stuff and since it was a bit chilly he gave me his coat reasllly cute.And or if you do not have a sandy place, or calm place near by... Go out to eat somewhere but you gotta make sure its was you both like. Oh annd the movies... but to be honest i never really liked the movie thing, because your so into themovie that you dont really know how to talk to the guy, and if you do the ppl  behind you get mad, and if you are close ppl watch you lol. So the beach in other wrds would  be better. Alright so the place is done, lol now we will figure out what to do, i hope your a really cute girl, and aren't someone who just goes out with a person and dates them:) But ok, so your walking along the beach and you 1. throw rocks and challenge him lol (and he'll try to impress you ;) 2. Go eat some icecream,( share it) 3. Dont bring a sweater lol 4. climb the rocks if there are any 4. Draw your names on the sand ( put a heart with you and the lucky guy;) lol  NOWWW.. time for what you should say . Ok for this one there might be different times to say diffferent things. When your all close and lovey dovey, say " Im glad i met you." <br>  or " I want you to know ill always be here for you" ..<br>     Now, if your funny or something be like, " Come lets see you try to beat me ( in rock skiipping)" <br>     And, if you just want somethign to talk about be like "So hows ur lyfe?" and if she says pretty good ask if theres somethign troubling you or if he wants to talk about it.. It's always good to help so meone with their problems they may feel wanted or something you know.  And how to get there, honestly lol just talk the bus its like funyou see ppl andits cheap :D, good luck loollll this got so long, iwas so interested in your questioon, hey message me back and tell me if it wrks out lol byee , good luck:D|`|JYHlPczxaa	With great weather and a desire to be adventurous, there's no excuse for you and your partner not to go on a date.

6879286ebd43f9d2a6690a2120e9e880aa	Lets see I am 31, married.  Have that tattoo (since early 20's).  And have been with 5 men my whole life.  I've never been with a man on the first date or just met someone and had random sex.  All 5 men that I've been with, it has been a serious relationship.  <br>  <br>  Your statistics don't seem right.
6eaWRGaqaa	Less drama:<br>  No backstabbing, no sarcasm, no pretending.<br>  <br>  They are what you get. I completely agree!<br>  -Catherine|`|e3801fbb401743baa0ab90373a0be8ebaa	boys = less drama<br>  that's all I can say.<br>  I'm 18 years old and a college freshman, let me tell you, stick with the guys. You don't have to be a tomboy to hang with them but if most of your guys are friends in high school, you will be drama-free. <br>  <br>  Girls get jealous and envious really quick. They are quick to gossip and defend whatever they feel will benefit them. They subject to other powerful girls and even tear their own self-esteem down and become catty.<br>  <br>  It doesn't stop, even in college. I've had girls last semester pick on me very tactfully just cause I had my papers done before them. Just last week I had some girls assigned to my group try and sabotage my presentation. <br>  <br>  Guys like to have fun.|`|9GmrHmyuaa	well, im a guy and i think that's because its easier for a guy to lose a girl than it is for a girl to lose a guy. girls tend to find the worst parts in a guy but guys ignore that. oh, and girls have a different way of thinking. 2 guys get in a fight, they'll both end up hurting physically. 2 girls get in a fight, they flick each other and thats that. guys are more of the peace keepers, not the peace interupters.|`|DET61tGPaa	Guys aren't picky about things like girls are, they usually try to avoid drama if they can and while girls, though they usually claim they hate drama, usually are the ones to start it|`|e2i7KRnUaa	Less drama|`|80DPSlhJaa	Yes I do feel like that.<br>  There is WAY less drama!|`|cJ1kMG6Saa	boys are way, way, way less dramatic.<br>  that's how i am. i mean, i have female friends.<br>  but i just find that guys are way more laid back, and easier to get along with.

Did one or the other do something to hurt the other ?  As it seems like this fighting has only begun recently so there is something that is not being talked about if you got along before.  <br>  <br>   And if you never got along....well, then that probably won't change and you can either decide to agree to disagree or go your separate ways.|`|Vi2CCYTRaa	Yesterday<br>  <br>  Or maybe there's something bothering your friend or maybe even you that's making you guys more irritable and prone to fighting.|`|xZI6noJiaa	what are the fights about? who starts the bickering?|`|nVdYIHhzaa	sorry...<br>  <br>  when there's more bad then good you should let go.|`|fPxxAgNSaa	Just have sex already. Sex makes everything better.
7DZ5z8Vyaa	Try to repair the relationship. Spend more time together. Dont drift apart yet. Give it another chance. Apologize for anything you have done. Take your friend to a place you and him/her have been before that you have had fun at. It will bring back memories and build up your bond. Dont give up on friendship unless you are 100% sure you want to. You dont sound like you are (beings you are asking).|`|GqTSa85daa	Think?

BKfl3gjWaa	why dont you ask him to work out with you?<br>  in some ways, i dont think you're being shallow. you just expect someone to take care of themselves as much as you do, or more. <br>  however, i dont think you should stop seeing someone because of their fitness level/gut. i dont think guys are too sensitive about their bodies to be upset if you were to comment or talk to him about it. i would if i were you. also, i would look at the person on the inside, because thats what counts. do you think you are always going to be fit? and what if you're not, would you want someone to dump you because of it? physical features like weight can usually be "fixed" just suggest/talk to him about it.|`|1854fb53779c38ad23e299fcc95f6010aa	Just look for a nice guy that you have a lot in common with and enjoy his company , even if he is a little on the heavy side it wont matter if you fall in love .

2nc9k9BSaa	Telling you "You're beautiful", exactly like that, every single day?<br>  <br>  Heck yes. Actions speak louder than words. I don't mean him buying you stuff and taking you on trips, but little things matter more than just saying it out loud:<br>  <br>  Kisses<br>  Hugs<br>  Enjoying time together.<br>  <br>  And so on. Besides, he already thinks you're beautiful anyway. No need for reassurance.|`|jN4Eprtxaa	yes unfortunately it is no matter how much we all wish they did guys don't think like that and won't its just who guys are not just yours|`|ADP9swbMaa	That sounds REALLY needy. <br>  Maybe you need to work on accepting yourself as beautiful, instead of needing your man to validate you.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	give you a little saying to give him by a famous football player:  Have him say, Honey I can't wait until tomorrow because you get better looking everyday. After many years of marriage, neither my wife or I look the same, but at least once a week I compliment her on having the same beautiful face that I married.  Really everyday is a little too much but he should tell you are beautiful either weekly or biweekly.
AA11899313	Unfinished business!<br>  <br>  He likes you as a person / human being!<br>  <br>  Does 'sex' always have to be a motivation in your life?

Another reason is that he might still like you.|`|yoqiYBasaa	If it was a friendly mutual breakup, then perhaps he had a connection with you, but the sparks weren't there and he wants to keep the good part of it.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Establish a more-than-just-friends relationship. Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier. <br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on. <br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go. <br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. <br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner. <br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself. <br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions. <br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope. <br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. <br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. <br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. <br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk. <br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."|`|HdSaN24caa	they ask those type questions because, they don't have the brains to figure out the simplest things in life. you're talking about the sheep in this country, who have to have everything thought out and done for them. neat, huh?|`|QAGaQUDRaa	You must be new here.

I've gone with my friends without him too.|`|l6rSKl46aa	trust me most lads cheat when they go out to a club unless you have a kid with them which is impossible so there you go. then again girls cheat just as much or if anything more. i went to a club which my g/f didn't want me to go but it was my mates birthday. usually we chat up a few girls, but don't always mean that we will sleep with them(that if your only me by the way since im shy) but instead we just chilled back since it was his 23 b day and had a few drinks (orange juice for me since i don't drink) during the end of the night we decided to leave early about 1am and guess what? we found my mate's(who b day it was) g/f in the car park heading back with another guy to his car. so to tell you the truth he will get up to something no doubt about it. its what night clubs are designed for and what people to expect from a night out|`|AA11645129	yes, i would trust my boyfriend to go to a club w/o me. he loves me enough to not think about cheating on me and i trust him=)|`|PlRYgRcoaa	The question should be what is she doing out of the kitchen and bedroom.|`|wXyoo8mNaa	Yes, no trust no real relationship.|`|HCTsrKAPaa	I would definitely trust them. If you are paranoid that they're going to cheat then something is wrong with the relationship. I think if people feel that way about every partner then they have self esteem issues.

Xel3S1W5aa	Yeah, alot of times its just the excitement and flame of the relationship going away. If you love him you should stay with him.

Maybe take dancing lessons or something :]<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|NTC6g8hYaa	Well if you really love him then you need to talk to him about:<br>  A) your future together (whats gonna happen after graduation)<br>  B) how you feel and why you think things are different<br>  C) what his opinions are about future, things being different, if he loves you, ect.<br>  <br>  Just by talking about these things, it will get better!<br>  Good luck!!|`|1N60ixK8aa	honey, if he hasn't even decided whether or not you are his girlfriend, you are wasting  your time.

Dont worry|`|jZikbLE3aa	it depends on if he really likes you or if he stares at you that means he likes u|`|g1CsXtupaa	How often do you guys see each other? If you are concerned about it, I'm guessing very little, or at least not enough to satisfy you (which isn't a bad thing ;) )<br>  <br>  I think that you two should definitely keep dating if you feel that you love him. If you see conflict in your guys' actions, then tell him about it and try and work it out. Ask him why he acts like you're bothering him. <br>  <br>  Just to tell you, though, I've experienced talking on the phone a lot to my girlfriend, and I don't like it. So if your boyfriend doesn't like talking on the phone much either, that may just be the problem.<br>  <br>  I would see how things go after you consult him about your problems. If he likes you enough, he will do something about it to please you in the best way he can.|`|AwVTT9iZaa	well before you do anything tell him how you feel... if he isn't as serious as you are don't even waste your time<br>  im not big on long distance relationships but 2 hours really isn't bad, if you both put effort into it, it could totally work, it just needs to be a mutual effort. <br>  the thing that is odd though is that you haven't discussed if you are boyfriend/girlfriend...<br>  you NEED to have a serious talk with him<br>  good luck :)|`|POfAilFfaa	you definatly need to talk to him me and my girlfriend just went through a similar problem im sure that if you just let him know how you feel and you to can come up with a solution ecspecialy since he is your first serious boyfriend alot of people get scarred into breaking up when something like that happens its just another problem couples go through itll be ok:)|`|BKfl3gjWaa	why dont you just tell him your concerns... or how you are feeling about the situation you both are in? i think its only going to get worse when you do move farther apart. i know there are people who think long distance relationships work... and im not saying they cant. but if you're having trouble now (when you arent 2 hours apart) then i dont think its going to get any better. BE REAL WITH YOURSELF. ask yourself if this is something you want.|`|fGmtFjfsaa	it's okay to feel this way... but the real question is : "is it easy for you to be on a long distance relationship?"... don't break up with... take things slowly =]|`|Rxsr2nPJaa	I would say end it. But at the same time if he loves you hewill fallow you. some times you have tolet them go and if they return it's ment to be.|`|JjpsQFnpaa	I think that is not normal. You and him should break up. I'm serious.|`|O0MEdyKfaa	NO! Dont dump him. And yes it is normal.|`|nL7SG4A9aa	wow i am soooo right there with u!! all i can say is give it ur all. if u feel like things come down to the point to where u HAVE to break up do it. but dont do it when ur in doubt. because then when u found out u made the wrong decision the never ending question of " what if " will huant u. as far as not knowing what to do maybe u should bring it up with him. the best way to get it out is to talk to him and express how u are feeling and see how he reacts. tell him what u feel and how ur hurting. he needs to know because men, are NOT mind readers like women can be at times. spice things up. send him little reminders of how much u care and maybe he will catch on. Men after a certain amount of time feel like the little things dont have to come into play anymore but it is sO the opposite. Its the little things that make us happy! hearing how much he cares or just knowing he loves u as much as u love him.<br>  <br>  dont worry things will get better, but above all just remember to not only trust ur gut but ur heart to.<br>  <br>  :) keep ur head up!!<br>  <br>  much love!|`|vugj26g2aa	Well, to tell you the truth, I'm sort of going through the same thing. But from the way I see it, I think you should talk to him about how you feel about everything. If you feel like you're bothering him, ask him if he's busy or tired or something like that. Don't make up an excuse to go unless you do have one. Try to spend a little more time with him. You just might be missing him a little bit. ^^ All you have to do is talk to him about it. It might get a little bumpy at the start, but if you both really feel the same way about each other everything should be fine.|`|yoqiYBasaa	I think that you should tell him exactly what you said here "when you are together things are great but on the phone he is cold and distant" and see what he has to say. You need to confront the problem head on. I always tell my husband when I feel there is something lacking in our relationship and all he can do is try to fix it. BTW I think you should discuss your relationship status and clarify what you two are before you think about moving in with him.|`|707gOCvbaa	You are growing apart. It's normal. You can give your relationship a trial period when you switch schools and see how it holds up. No need to leave him unless the feeling is mutual. This cold be the separation to make your heart grow fonder or split apart. good luck.|`|FHrQzaPqaa	you need to find out what on his mind and asked him how he feels <br>  about you.|`|wf7V6MZ4aa	breaking up is not the answer. i think as soon as you two finish school things will get a whole lot better than things now. And yes. What you feel right now is normal.|`|AA12157752	It's good to talk to him about how things are instead of just ignoring it. <br>  <br>  Keeping communication channels open is the way to finding what's really the truth and problems between the both of you. :)|`|zGZe0mt8aa	why do you want to break up ? there is no special reason for you to do such a thing , the distance between you guys is not that far maybe you can just plan how to keep in touch, or moving together.<br>  that 's not a big deal.|`|jp1DWT5Aaa	Talk to him about, maybe he feels the same way, odds are he does. Maybe you can both work something out to get that old feeling back. If not, then maybe you'll find someone else, vice versa for him.
Xel3S1W5aa	ha, well it sounds to me like he is interested in you. He probably looks away because he's nervous and embarrassed that you caught him. <br>  Also, he's probably avoiding you because he's nervous or shy. Maybe he doesn't know what to say or thinks you aren't interested. <br>  You should talk to him!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :]|`|UinOWcMUaa	I Think He likes you and you like Him.. huh ??!!

He5OH4b4aa	Um I don't know if he likes you or not, but you already said yourself he's a flirt.<br>  If he likes you do you really want to go out with him when he flirts with other girls? It seems like a habit he wouldn't break easily.
b70cNqyqaa	This is cool though. You are "interested" in him in more than just friends. Now you have to detect if he starts to show "interest " in you. If he doesn't reciprocate, he is "not interested" in having a special relationship. He may not mind a date night once in a while, but not anything more. So be on the lookout, for hints. Does he come to you and talk? <br>  Is he knocking a hole through the group of people to be with you?<br>  Is he coming over to you? <br>  Now you should stand back, and see if he comes to you at a party. He has to want to know you better- too.|`|POfAilFfaa	if you have known him for a while then just call him and ask to hang out sometime and if your ready tell him how you feel its best not to do that kind of thing on the phone. if you just met then give it some time to see how things work out.|`|yYiQuPacaa	I think that the best way to get someone alone is to go and take them aside in a group.

He might not even be from Alabama for all you know. If this guy is lying to you, and you guys started a relationship, most likely you would want to meet in the future; that would be very dangerous. Try putting yourself out there for the people around your area more just for your own safety :) Good luck!|`|APctQdilaa	good luck with it my best advice is hope for the best but expect the worst remember you guys are miles away and cant see eye to eye and there would be the issues of honesty and trust. I just got out of a long distance relationship where it hurt real bad because it was is to lie and love hide the lies my relationship was almost 2 years
ISMColXfaa	First of all, facebook chat isn't a good idea.<br>  Girls love it when you come and talk face to face, (i know it's hard, but you just gotta.)<br>  I get annoyed when guys keep facebook-ing me. It kinda seems like they have no other life and they're desperate.<br>  Face to face is awesome cuz you get to really smile other than do this - :)<br>  <br>  Good luck dearie! :D

Or somethin like that , u know?|`|WHBh88HQaa	Personally, I think she is hitting that she likes you and is expecting something back? ;)<br>  <br>  Wait a little bit and talk to her more about it. And then if you want ask her to hangout!|`|3UNSbe0Maa	that you should speak up if the liking is mutual|`|WgRe1dZTaa	how old are you?<br>  You know that she likes you and she clearly told you that she does not like this other guy...how more obvious do you need a girl to be? she's not giving you messages in code.|`|bmhT1IrTaa	obviously she want you!|`|3a8d2a1828c01a0871e1f800150ea1e0aa	that she wants to be with you and not him

(as an obvious answer)<br>  <br>  She could be trying to suck up to you.<br>  <br>  It's just another way of showing you that she likes you and you're a great guy.<br>  <br>  Any of these three. But that's up to you. Ask her what she means when she says that next time.|`|SX85iYYnaa	uh well kinda hard to tell you didn't give a lot of details. look for these signs: she tries to spend a lot of time with you, she jokes around with you a lot constantly making contact with you, and mos importantly watch her to see if she watches you! hope that helps!|`|bmhT1IrTaa	i call my guy friends sweetie all the time, and i tell them the same thing. i couldnt tell you if she likes you more then a friend but she definitly likes you. just take it slow and tell her how you feel. i hope things turn out good for you  (:|`|AA10112105	Hate to break it to you, but in my experience that means she wants you as a friend and not in bed.|`|NtSQcyHLaa	She's just being nice. And if she really does just like your personality or "whatever," then I'd say it's just her personality being nice to you since she doesn't see you in that way.|`|32xAPpvvaa	if you do nice stuff to her then she like your personality... if you look hawt then she likes the way you look....lol|`|P4ODtQ9xaa	is that bad for a girl like u for a personaility i don't really get what ur trying to say
qvcLqJiPaa	I would like it if he just went and told me, not online or through text though. Say what you feel, tell her you think shes amazing and ask her out! In person though, cuz to me that says the guy would risk rejection to be with me and thats sweet!!!<br>  <br>  PS. you sound like one of those few guys who actually care about the girl so good luck!!!|`|lFzXZQQDaa	You should go up to her and say it in person to her face, and look her into the eyes and say.

No special way, I'm satisfied with just one-on-one "I think you're beautiful and find myself incredibly attracted to you" type thing. <br>  If I like the guy back, just knowing that he likes me would make me incredibly happy. <br>  A guy that is nervous to say anything is a little bit adorable, as long as he says it. It he waits too long because he has very little confidence, it damn near kills me, because it's one of those "I really wanna know!" kinda things.|`|gCGzs6PDaa	say to her "I think you are pretty" or something that will make her smile then you should write her a few secret admirer notes (they may sound corny but they are sweet) then give hints that's it is you in the notes and then one day come out and tell her flat out that you like her I think that would be so nice if a guy did that <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  help me out????????? :)      <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsW.jqCQXHmnMXRcdmXrHc_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306175502AAhTP5n">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|LABJI7dfaa	for him to come right out and say it|`|qRzbOMYGaa	Every girl wants a guy to look in her eyes, admiring her beauty.  Tell her she has the most beautiful eyes, and sound poetic.  Then, smile gently at her, and tell her that you really like her.  Also after your done doing that, tell her she's the most beautiful girl in the world--girl's like that cheesy stuff, it makes them feel beautiful.<br>     After you do that, just stare at her warmly, that makes her feel wanted.|`|bN8OhZ3Aaa	ok im a girl, so i definately know how it works. <br>  i know that girls like it simple, actually.<br>  she would love you to either write something telling her that. (make it look cute, with standard boy messy-ish writting, just make it seem meaningful), or better yet in person. <br>  <br>  (if your going to say it out loud to her):<br>  as contradictory as this may seem, girls actually like awkward-ish speaches lol. not like long, but just see cute. lol cute is what you want to aim for. childishness, kind of makes us happy, because we usually see boys all tuff and cool, but then when you guys act cute around us, it makes us feel special, like we have weakened you, made you softer, nicer, happier, kinder. Trust me, girls like boys to not me all muscular and cool and happening, we prefer nice boys:) well idk about them, but i do. :)<br>  so if you can decode all of this very, very, very, very weird phrasing, then everything should work out just FANTAsTic for you and her:)<br>  <br>  good luck:)|`|nnJAaDX8aa	just saying that she is beautiful is flattering.<br>  you'll catch her eye if you say that sincerly<br>  personally i rather him not hesitate but nervous is in da cute because you had the guts to say it either way.|`|IgUA5RK2aa	I find it cute when a guy is confident but still alittle hesistant and nervous because some girls think if you act too confident when you ask they might think your just joking expecially if your friends with her.<br>  Tell her exacrtly how you feel.<br>  Goood luck!|`|v3wNNc1Uaa	look into her eyes, smile at her, take her hand, and just tell her you really like her.<br>  <br>  i think its cute if a guy is a bit nervous, because it shows that he must really like the girl!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ghISlqExaa	Do you know her for a long time?

dsuXOaRraa	Usually, I can tell when a guy likes me when he calls me pretty or something or he flirts with me. Flirting is a big sign. And also, I can tell a guy likes me when like I'll sign on msn (maybe you're his first choice in calling, or he'll always talk to you in person, or texts you all the time) and he'll talk to me right away, and puts lots of hearts and stuff.<br>  <br>  Usually just when they pay attention and show interest in you.|`|ghISlqExaa	This question varys and depends on so many things that it would almost be impossible to answer accurately. But when you truly love someone you will know right away. That is a question that has only one answer. But to find out if someone likes you is much different. When you refer to "like", do you refer to it as love or just crush? Be aware that boys are very different and some aren't really mature. Theis also depends on the position he has in the class. If he loved you, believe me, he would do anything anytime anywhere to be with you and only you. He would tell anyone that he loves you and he wouldn't resist the urge to stay and touch you in any way. By your hand, your lips any body part! And also when someone loves you, you most likely feel it. But when someone just likes you (and im not saying that it's bad), the guy will stand against. He might be aembarassed or ashamed or even afraid to show himslef and in public that he likes you. But remember when he loves you, you'll know it.|`|0dAXDMATaa	he will stare at you a lot. He will most often ditch his friends and talk to you. He will talk to you a lot more than usual or he wont talk to you at all. The guy gets offense when people talk about you around him. last but not least he  will act a lot more sensitive and gentle around you.|`|FnWmRL85aa	He will usually look at you continuously.  And it will be pretty obvious.  If you think this guy likes you because you think he keeps staring at you, keep an eye on him.  Then if you seem him look back smile and make eye contact.|`|mjyK0lAbaa	They will flirt with you.|`|8TDnfCkaaa	You will know. Trust me.|`|RhKhyol0aa	Look into his eyes and bite your lip a little...keep smilling and you will make him like you even if he doesn't.|`|u1T5TQP7aa	you never ever can<br>  <br>  unfortunately, but look at it this way: there will always be fish in the sea|`|9851deb6f5776ae6834cf0b79571e624aa	He will listen to your every word and not seem like he is in a hurry to be some where else.|`|9QyrW2iCaa	He asks for your phone number or some way to get in touch with you!|`|vwsO7Pv8aa	If he seems to talk to you alot,<br>  flirt with you.<br>  anddd you catch him eyeing you.|`|uJOWhThlaa	if he says ''girl come over  to my house 2 night'' and have fun!!!!
UBvUG8GZaa	Maybe you have become more confident or good looking, or both at the same time. Maybe you are just noticing more. . . . .Are you wearing Lynx, lol. Just kidding.|`|kvmWDuOJaa	Well it depends in what way they're looking at you!<br>  <br>  There could be a weird rumour going around about you, I guess. But it's not likely, and you probably would have heard it.<br>  Maybe they just think you're good looking and are interested in you. You go ahead and flirt with them! ;)<br>  <br>  If I helped, could you please consider sparing a few seconds of your time to vote for my school by clicking the below link?

LaE7ksIaaa	Just talk to him more.. <br>  It always works.<br>  Promise, and if he likes you, things will just work out..|`|zRBKZtT1aa	I would say that you should go up to him and ask him. I know that you might be nervous, but you have to find out sooner or later. I know that you want a boyfriend, everyone does!
EPTaL9Ajaa	Just truthfully ask yourself; is it out of pity or do you really like him?<br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind you aren't going to marry him anytime soon; just go with the flow.|`|MqtEUrWjaa	yes i would, if i truely liked him<br>  <br>  only do it if u know what ur doing. Like, it is hard doing that stuff, but that pays off. u never know, he could be this really amazing guy but no one will give him a chance because of what he is doing|`|d559eedf1a6404ca818b57c6e03ceeffaa	yea, if you love him definitely. just think, what if u were in a wheel-chair? their still people it's just that unfortunate events should occur. Try this, just pretend to forget the wheel-chair for a minute or two and ask your self if you like him enough to spend the rest of your life with him. If you say no, then move on but if you say yes, then go for it! I totally agree with u though on the rudeness factor of yahoo.
dU0ibtU1aa	its when you text eachother dirty stuff like he might say put your hand in your pants and rub around can you feel me ******* you|`|4AHGY6jnaa	ahhh yea i can just feel it there right now ahh yea there ahhhhh<br>  <br>  i just had text sex with you (im 15 d/w)<br>  <br>  it's some pretty much just some loser **** lol.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  First of all phone sex on TV shows gorgeous models but in fact they can be old ladies of any age and not look at what you see.<br>  Men are crazy for paying to have phone sex talk.<br>  <br>  Why would anyone talk to someone on the phone which they do not know.  <br>  <br>  It could also be a man ( with a womans) voice for all you know.|`|HCf73ZsEaa	Phone sex you act like your having sex over the phone and tell each other what you are doing with your genitals etc. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't do it unless you want to lose your virginity with them as it will lead to them wanting more.
YvF0kUsUaa	the only way to know for sure is to ask him. some people have flirtatious personalities, which are so confusing!
etV271ARaa	Its good to have a good woman friend. One you can share things with. I have one and we have never even thought of crossing the line although my wife and her husband have wondered about it. But the temptation to take things further have cropped up now and again. But if you value her friendship, dont spoil it. Keep things clear and boundaries firmly set|`|AA11050777	I have been friends for 10 years with a woman I had immense attraction to. We flirted all the time, but then she got engaged after I was gone for 2 years in another state. I came back, we hit it off again, but it was a choice I made. That ring said someone had promised to take good care of her, and I liked her enough to let that happen. Believe me, I could have moved to break her engagement, we had that chemistry, but I let it go and we moved on after about 5 months of a rocky road.  Even her fiance knows about me, but it was much easier because just before we ever kissed, I was stopped by my morality, and had I crossed the physical barrier that day, I don't think I could have ever been friends with her so long.
Rrsp3fWIaa	Don't hold your breath waiting for her to call or text. You did the right thing by asking for her number. Stay on the hunt for other girls.|`|SHoIWZ56aa	i think she's getting your number and she'll calll you when she decided taht she really wants to kit w/ you|`|Kw3xFKCRaa	I did that once...I'm nor gonna lie but I did it to get rid of the guy sorry|`|rHpsLZimaa	Well most the time they won't get back to you if they're not interested. Girls are very complicated though. Im sure she is. She might have been through some bad relationships and doesn't trust guys. Im sure she is going to get back to you.|`|LOfZNNdfaa	She could possibly be a serial killer.  I've heard stories like this.  A person can find all your personal information about you just by using your phone number.  Have you ever seen her in person or did you meet her online.  If you meet her online I got one word for you dude. Serial Killer.
f2fyXyulaa	She might not view you as popular. In the game of popularity, it is not "cool" to hang out with people who are not considered "popular." In my opinion, popularity is stupid. People should pick their friends for what their character is not popularity.<br>  <br>  In this situation, I think that you just need to walk away from her. I'm sorry that you lost a friend that you used to like, but in the end she is a waste of your time anyway. <br>  <br>  Find other people who you know will not do that to you. "Friends" like the one that left yall's friendship for popularity are a bad influence anyway. Be a good friend and you will have good friends. Eventually. It's hard to find the perfect friend.
A9AurTy3aa	If thats true then A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND THEY LOVE ME ALL OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|tNuJomoYaa	i have never heard that nor do i believe it is true however, some cultures have myths of the evil eye and so when someone loves you, they can give you the evil eye although they do not mean to which may cause this problem|`|ISMColXfaa	never heard it.. but probably because the age you get pimples is when you get like,,, girl friends and boy friends.|`|jLdmFH8paa	its nothing,  only its a feeling|`|63JKaFVGaa	thats a lie<br>  i dont have ANY pimples|`|eTm9uLqyaa	Its just something stupid to say.|`|jUaTq4Itaa	its just some time passs or crazy guy's idea of love!|`|85294ca7b4849e5282e9f017650e63feaa	idk thats silly|`|7gpHfFwUaa	hmm never heard of that.. but i doubt is true|`|zprAkP3eaa	I have never heard that one before!|`|iuB1BRj5aa	I've never heard about that, but it does make me feel better about myself.|`|AA11447210	I would guess they say 'goose pimples', 'goose bumps'. or 'chicken skin'...you know, when your skin gets bumpy and your arm hairs stand up when you get cold, or scared, or really anxious/excited. <br>  <br>  Hearing someone say they love you, especially for the first time, can give someone "goose bumps". ???|`|VzzQP2PJaa	Because love brings stress ? or I heard something like every people you get means that someone loves you or something like that. Its just a myth to make people feel better about having acne.|`|2c88J3M7aa	I've never heard that...<br>  :O I have acne.. does that mean someone loves me !? =D<br>  OMGSH , YESS !|`|MQVmh5hiaa	Never heard that one b4.

HKHCuRI8aa	both ,nice (im ) a bit older though. If you were old enough to (16) be with I'd do U. Both.If that's what you mean,?|`|rPoKRm8gaa	Um...cool?
BbcBTIrUaa	Most guys, if they are really guys,<br>  should like ANYTHING.<br>  really, they just need to know that YOU like them.<br>  <br>  I simply like it when a girl has a crush on me,<br>  But if you wanna play "indirectly" and try to get his attention<br>  then it really depends on the guy you are after, <br>  there are many types of guys, so first find out what he finds interesting<br>  and then you should apply that to yourself.<br>  <br>  But just acting like his favorite type of girl is not going to cut it,<br>  if none of you makes the move.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question what do guys like girls to do?<br>  Personally, I like it when they are asserive playful and loud,<br>  but not just with their friends but with everybody.  I like the way <br>  they smell and their hair and their eyes... *sighs<br>  <br>  I like when they move!!! yea like, playing a sport, but not just<br>  while playing a sport but when they move while they do anything<br>  or just to express how they feel.  I like them obnoxious!!<br>  <br>  But that is just me, and every guy is different.<br>  <br>  But nothing will work if no one knows that one person<br>  likes the other, so I suggest taking care of that first.
o2v0bxITaa	Yeah I mean he might be interested considering he's making such a conscious effort to talk to you even though you act kind of aloof, which is also good because guys like to chase, trust. Just keep your eye on and it and take things slow, maybe things can progress in time. Just don't rush it|`|h06mx3d8aa	i think he does like u! :D|`|jl66LEdEaa	According to the facts you gave,I'd say he likes you just try to relax(if you're as nervous as you say) smile,laugh at his jokes,that will certainly show him that you're interested and maybe he'll ask you out.<br>  hope that helps ;)|`|CDQJPqQcaa	i think he likes you but he is  shy and doesn't want you to know yet

z8YZY9lOaa	Well, I wouldn't dive right into asking her out if you can't even carry on a simple conversation with the girl, so talk to her alot more and like another person said if you and her both have a myspace or facebook, email, msn or aim anything like that then add her and try to get her number, key thing is just talk to her ALOT more.|`|dPgP28Aiaa	Start talking to her more. If she has a myspace or a facebook, add her on there if you have an account on either of those websites. Ask her for her number, and ask her if she wants to hang out sometime or something.|`|xwDzek6uaa	Talk to her then.|`|9QyrW2iCaa	I think you shouldn't worry about Hilary. Your spelling and grammar is so poor that you really could use more time studying!  Good luck to you and don't be afraid to hit the books sometime!  ; )|`|AA11539689	get to know her a little bit more. start talking to her in the hall or at lunch, that's always a good time. once you get to know her then ask her out, it'll be a lot easier on you and her.|`|uJOWhThlaa	first of all how old are you and just ask her|`|NeBDl4Hfaa	Talk to her more often.  See if she is actually interested in you at all or if she gives you any signs of interest.|`|FAyWGjUPaa	I think you should really get to know her before you decide to ask her out!<br>  I mean if you only have one class with her then you couldn't possibly know her very well and you dont want to date her and then realize after it's already too late that maybe you dont like her in that way as much as you thought you did...<br>  And you should make sure she likes you the same way because if you ask her out and then it turns out that she doesnt like you like that than it can cause a bit of awkwardness between the two of you...<br>  You also need to ask yourself...if we were to go out, how often would I even see her? I know from past experience that its really no fun to date someone you hardly see...<br>  Now, I'm not saying that you shouldn't go for it and ask her out...I'm just saying that these are some things to consider!<br>  But if you really decide that you like this chick well...then go for it dude! What have you got to loose, right? :)<br>  Good luck hon! Hope this helped!|`|kdcK9xataa	Before you ask her out, you should make an effort to talk to her more and she'll definitely notice, also if she feels comfortable around you already and knows you a little better, she'll be more likely to say yes. If you think that you guys would be good together and your not afraid to ask, go for it. You never know if you don't ask.|`|wFD2xTgYaa	maybe get to know her a little better.  Start with her number.  If you don't want to straight out ask for her number say something like "I'm having trouble with this homework, do you think I can get your number so i can call you for help."

I feel conceited saying that but oh well...I love him because he is the sweetest person I have ever met. Its kinda hard when you see a really attractive guy making eyes at you sometimes but its all worth it in the end. Whenever I date really good looking guys they end up being jerks anyways.|`|U0WMFNC3aa	No, but it doesn't really matter how they look to me.. i just like a good personality.|`|PeRMKqTpaa	He wasn't exactly ugly...but he wasn't the cutest one out there.<br>  <br>  We're in band together.

7q5HsXALaa	Don't listen to the bs first 2 answers, it is love cause the way u talk about her u really like her A LOT. You need to tell her u want to take the relationship to the next level if your man enough ;)<br>  <br>  PS: A crush is someone u want to have sex with. Love is when sex is the last thing on ur mind, u wanna spend all ur time with her and you wanna give her the world because she means everything to you....<br>  <br>  :)|`|hc9deZ7aaa	Sounds more like love than just a crush. If you only lusted after her then during break that you had from talking to her you probably would have lost interest. <br>  <br>  Similar thing happened with me and my boyfriend and now we are together and very happy. Don't let her slip through your fingers again! tell you you like her|`|QNSmbmJvaa	I'm the same way with this guy that is moving at the end of the school year. I cried for 3 hours when i heard he was moving. He's one intense crush I will never forget. Maybe someday we'll bump into each other again, but one can only hope.|`|chZFmJOPaa	Well, it sounds like you really love this girl. Usually when something like this, if you love someone, you can pick out the difference between a fling or an infatuation. <br>  When you know you love someone, you love everything about them.... their flaws, their differences. If you can accept her for everything she is, then yeah, I'd say you do!|`|jG55tGJAaa	i think it's love. If it was just a crush would it be this strong. you've been friends so you know her well. if you know a person well and have feelings this way it's usually love. give it a chance|`|ebbef023ccd68bc1cb490382cab61cbaaa	Crush. Not love. You have to be with them to truly experience love, even your first love. You'll know it's love when they kill you.|`|dB2uMDb5aa	if you can see her inner beauty that  is call love,, love comes from the heart  you ask am i in love,, what dos your heart tell you.  ME I SAY YES|`|0EUBc2hRaa	just go talkt o her|`|FkB3jQzWaa	its love babe|`|2040myy2aa	you never know it could be just a strong like but im not going to sit here and tell you it's not love because it could be love i know i didn't really give you an answer but we can not tell you what's real and what is not but good luck n i hope u guys get together :)|`|C5EjooGDaa	Ive been where uve been, my Bestfriend was a Girl but i had the strongest feelings for her but i never made me move, afraid of rejection and i only lost her to people who treated her like ****, never respected her and only used her.<br>  <br>  I regret not making a move on her, i think to myself maby if i did some of the bad things that happend to her might not of happend, might of been a little more different and that maby she would have made better choices.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and if u really love here then listen to your heart|`|QMbxBynZaa	i think its pure infatuation, because i cant tell you how many times ive felt that way about a guy, but it could very well lead to love. but i knew right away before i even read the whole thing it wasnt lover, because if you have to ask if its love, then youre not in love. when you're in love you know it, there's no questions or anything, you simply know it. when youre in love you feel everything you are currently feeling, and more. trust me. :) good luck and ask her out ! :D|`|e4M5FUOOaa	wow... thats a really tough question... i just got out of that situation..... and it ended badly for me.... i was in your position... and the guy just messed and messed with my mind until he blew me off entirely.... and now i wont know until i get into another serious relationship if i really was in love with him or not...|`|qP3p6TxGaa	Ask her out for a few dates, and see where the relationship heads from there. It could be an infatuation, a crush, or the start of love. You'll never know until you get the ball rolling!|`|r6lEsstAaa	i don't think its love, maybe just a huge crush|`|kdrKkMwNaa	I think that your in love. It's a great feeling right? Tell her how you feel about her; maybe she'll feel the same as you. Good luck!|`|ci7Q54Gwaa	I just read the first paragraph and though yes its love. And the more i read the more it sounded like love. I think you love her. But honestly be careful and see how she sees you before telling her you "Love" her. Maybe start off with really really like her. But it deffinantly is love. ;-)  just dont scare by being so blunt unless she mentchions love. But i say do tell her you really like her. :-)|`|hFr004olaa	It's a crush. You need to actually be with the person to know for a fact if it's really love. Does she have a boyfriend? If not ask her out and maybe she feels the same way and is waiting for you to make that first move. Go and don't be a coward!!!! I am behind you all the way with full support. The longer you wait, the more space you'll create for other guys to come to her. Don't let it slip while you have a chance. Take my advice and GOOD LUCK.|`|esYTfoYraa	its love no doubt about it just take things slow|`|lGcpXteaaa	I dont think anybody REALLY knows for sure what love is. It could be love, it could be infatuation, we wont be able to tell you.<br>  You will know more when it ends or when she hurts you, it will hurt like nothing before.
IkjSbxO1aa	Sounds like you like her dont worry and dont deny it that only makes it worst i know what you mean dude She turns and looks at you wit dem pretty eyes and smiles and we act like idiots turning away quikly be cool talk to her stand in the doorway and wait for her to try and get thru and and say what if i dont cool like do or she'll freak out then smile and giggle and get out of her way without trying stuff it aint going to happen.|`|LmbucDK6aa	if she is talkative then just comment on something she says. or when she walks in class say something about the weather. anything. say one thing, and she will most likely respond, whether or not with great enthusiasm or just a smile, you will get a response. and thats your ticket to "break the ice", it doesn't take much :) and if you really just want to be friends with her, be yourself, talk about stuff you like. when she sees your interested in whatever your talking about, she'll want to listen. good luck!|`|5H64mGX1aa	if u just give her one word answers shes eventually gunna ignore u<br>  try giving her complete sentences. Once you get out complete answers, you can work on spitting out a whole paragraph. Get it?<br>  Good luck!!!|`|uRbeSOMwaa	stop thinking about it to much, relax.. and just be yourself<br>  ask her questions, stuff you guys have in common<br>  <br>  good luck|`|v3wNNc1Uaa	just relax and be yourself!<br>  she obviously doesn't think she is better than you, otherwise she wouldn't talk to you all the time.<br>  think of something to talk about with her, maybe you should start the conversation and do more of the talking.<br>  <br>  being shy isn't a bad thing, shes a person just like you, so don't worry so much!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|EaIR89pbaa	I'm 15 also and I used to be shy.. it's important to be confident in yourself. That's a big thing. And know that pretty girls are no different than any others. But once again, be confident in yourself. I am and now I can talk to anyone and trust me, confidence is attractive, whether you want her to like you as a friend or anything else.<br>  <br>  Answer mine too?<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306175027AAGkgSl">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|c1GpXYL9aa	get a life. you need to be strong. you should let people make you feel  down because of there looks. who knows she probably had the same problem and she is trying to look nice so no one will make fun of her. she takes care of herself and so should you. make yourself look nice and take care of yourself. then people will start to notice you. but you must give yourself some dignity first.|`|m3C3tb9Eaa	Stalk her until you find out about something that she likes and then you will just "happen" to like the same thing. After that the stalking is not necessary but you can do it for fun.<br>  <br>  P.s. Don't get carried away. Peeping toms are frowned upon.|`|IlxWfUlSaa	this isn't hard at all never think someone is above u this will help your confidence just think of her as one of your male friend then talking to her will be much easier.trust me this works i had the same problem|`|gRWZvNlPaa	when she ask you something<br>  instead of jus saying yes or no or maybe tell her your opinion.<br>  tell jokes, listen, && stayy stuff that come to your mind.<br>  be yourself|`|SUOsfKYdaa	omg be urself n jst talk dnt be like yeah sometimes maybe tell her stuff|`|nGMJhroEaa	Ask her how her weekend was on monday , and if she says just good or bad....then ask why? ask her what she did? Just keeping asking questions that will lead to more conversation. Asking why forces her to explain and not just answer you yes or no. <br>  I sat next to a girl in biology when i was 15 too and she was considered the best looking girl in school. Well I never took the chance to really converse with her in depth. We graduated and then years later after college I heard she died in a rock climbing accident. <br>  On top of that I found out she liked me too. True story. You have to get past your fears in life because you won't regret your failures, you'll regret NOT TRYING. Regret is awful and it will eat away your spirit everyday. Just go for it. WE GET CONFIDENCE AFTER WE TRY SOMETHING, NOT BEFORE IT. and you'll find that you won't mind if you fail , in fact it could be exhilarating......|`|00f3f78a75750648783d2869d3f216a4aa	i think it will be best for you to talk with her by not looking at her and pretend like she is one of your other friends or get her phone number and talk to her on there that way you dont have to stare at her while you talk.|`|iDc4r4RWaa	grow a pair and elaborate on your answers!! JK no but seriously|`|xwDzek6uaa	Open your mouth. Ask her how her weekend was. Ask her questions about her. just share yourself with her. Share your life.|`|4hv0y3bEaa	find something you have in common with her, like a wierd teacher or gross school lunches, or the nerd who sits in front of you guys. or talk to her about school, the biggest most general thing u two have in common. just talk about things with her that you talk abotu with your other friends

GrCj35muaa	if you want to help him, be patient. I'll bet his mood changes doesn't have much to do with you. You can send him messages and pictures and care packages to let him know that you are thinking of him. Also, sometimes they are around other people when they call you and aren't comfortable with being sweet on the phone, you know? They may be getting rushed off the phone, the lines break up a lot and it gets irritating. there are so many things going on around him, he has many, many obligations that he still needs to attend to once he is off the phone and that is on his mind as well. no matter what his mood, stay sweet and calm. If you fight, acknowledge your faults. People will yell at him and if he doesn't tell you about it, chances are it will only make him more mad. Try to talk about happy thoughts. One thing that you should try to avoid is talking about things that he 'needs' to do when he gets home. I'll bet he wants to do nothing at all, just relax, shower in water that doesn't smell funny, take naps, eat home cooked meals, have sex, and just relax. Try not to fight with him even if he upsets you. stay calm when you talk about problems. Good luck to you two. My bf is in Iraq as well and this is how we make it work. Just stay patient.

FZKFLTyLaa	Be frank, and honest. Just ask :<br>  Would it offend you if I considered you as more than just a friend (or classmate)? Do you know how much I like you?<br>  I cannot understand in this age of communications why so many people have such great difficulty<br>   just speaking to one another.<br>  <br>  Make eye contact a lot and touch his arm gently with your hand while you are talking to him.<br>  He'll get the message.<br>  He will either accept or reject you from that point. Note his body language and other reactions.
AA12000543	It sounds like he was fishing to see if she would tell him you like him too.<br>  lets see if the guys out there agree with me..... anyone???|`|8SRjELNBaa	"did he do this on purpose so i would know?"<br>  <br>  yes.<br>  <br>  "is he telling the truth? also what does he mean by kinda like somebody? as in just a little bit? or kinda as in "i'm-shy-to tell-you" kinda?"<br>  <br>  Your over thinking things, cut it out...|`|Nc9aASDlaa	YES HE LIKES YOU!
Av8aVFAaaa	It is awkward for him to be around you, he knows that you know he likes you, so he doesn't know how to approach you. Go up to him first, make him comfortable with taking to you in person. Don't make him doubt himself.
c9wgJprEaa	Wow, I know exactly how you feel. One thing that helped me was to find a common ground with the guy, or, maybe just ask him some simple questions about himself. For me, the first couple of minutes was awkward, but you just gotta work through those first few minutes, and then it becomes easier. And don't worry about sounding stupid! I know that's easier said than done, but you just gotta try it. Or, this is what I did; you say you work with class projects. What I would do was research the material to the point where everyone else was asking me questions, and so did he! Makes me sound like a nerd, but I got the pleasure of having his undivided attention, so I was happy.
t2dx9C3qaa	Just ur fat ugli azz, LOSER...  Probably fugged him and had a child just for the support money..  Another welfare Mom...|`|jjDZJmfpaa	That would depend, are you seeking sole physical custody? Will he be seeking custody? Will he be in the child's life? Do you have a good support system in place without him/ Is he going to use his parents as a part of his support system when he is away? Do you have a better job then what he has?<br>  <br>  The judge will be looking at all of the things that is best for the baby. If you don't have an answer for every one of those questions then the father could get legal custody. Go see a lawyer. If you cannot afford one at least go to a college and talk to a para-legal. There should be a Women's Justice League in your area. Google it so you will have the best defense.|`|41e284c4ae4178dd7ffd2cdd7557871daa	Just make sure you have any documentation that the court may need. Like if he has been providing support at all prior to this date, you might want to write it down in what manner. This is for you won't be trying to remember things from the top of your head. All papers pertaining to the case paternity hearing papers, summons, etc. if you have them.
uqSpDgy9aa	Time. Lots of it. Give yourself all the time you need, don't feel forced to hold anything in. Cry, kick, scream, do whatever you need to do to express the grief you're going through. Eventually it will just stop hurting.|`|sMrYGtdmaa	omg i so sorry. u just gotta remember that theres someone out there 4 EVERYONE...u just gotta search for it:) once u find someone else, the pain will seem 2 go away:]
op4jNySSaa	i kinda went though the same thing.i just started lifting weights to get my mind off her|`|3reHk4I1aa	no feeling is stupid but the thing is is that you broke up with your gf and you said that there were a lot of problems right? well if there was a lot of problems why would you feel bad for ending the relationship and if she cant respect your feelings as your gf then she deffinetly doesnt even deserve you as a friend. you shouldnt like someone that was making you feel unappreciated. dont worry you will get over her|`|C5EjooGDaa	Im got the same problem, but i never had sex with mine.<br>  <br>  If i where u i would just try and be friends with her, after all you wouldnt wanna lose all contact with her would you? And never no u might 1day get back with her, <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|T6fe2T9Raa	not really. the cold truth, either you're being stupid or she's being stupid. get over her, or go after her. <br>  whether you feel depressed and don't know what to do or not, life goes on. you've posted this question, have you not?|`|nDaLHm3Daa	tough luck she was a burden.....<br>  Toughen up..this country is not for the weak....depression is a weakness that corrupts you from within....you need to me cold and emotionless|`|xnIwI00daa	Well, ask yourself: Is this relationship and your love for her worth it even despite all of the problems you guys go through?<br>  <br>  Sometimes, if you love her enough, being to be is satisfying enough and will overwhelm all the problems you two will have. If it is not worth it, then move on. <br>  <br>  People usually gets depressed after a breakup. It's humane to be sad. And it shows that the relationship did meant something to you and so that means that you did receive the best you could have out of that relationship and so it was a worth while relationship. However, after a period of time, you'll feel better. <br>  <br>  Time is the best medicine to all emotional injuries. You'll feel better and she will be too. Let it go and move on. Always remember the best moment and carry it out in your life and treat it as it is.<br>  <br>  I believe that there is always a purpose in life for everything. Maybe she was only meant to be a part of your life for just those moments and you are supposed to move on and let another person enter it. <br>  <br>  Hope you feel better...and hopefully I'll solve my own love sick problem as well. *Sigh* Love/Like... It's driving me crazy!|`|NQ8fKb3Haa	No way! Of course you aren't stupid for feeling this way. A majority of people feel this way after a break-up. Psychologically, your heart can't really tell you anything; it's really your mind. Put yourself out there if you are ready and find someone new. You could have just talked over the disrespect, but what's done is done. If you aren't ready for a new relationship, then just make more activities to keep yourself occupied with your friends! Lighten up, and good luck! :)|`|dYTCUkyLaa	no its normal to feel this way after a break up <br>   it took me forever with my boyfriend larry we started going out 9-08-08 <br>   I've been heart broken ever since. even though he claims he hates me  never wants to see me again. i still love him i lost my virginity to him also i know its hard and sooner or later the pain will slowly go away. im still heart broken so don't think of it as something terrible think of it as a new start with a new girl.<br>  i hope this helps|`|0zAmUHC1aa	no honey. i went through this...kinda...except, i was going out with someone who took my virginity then ran. That was all he wanted, but no. just give her space and see if things get better. if not, thats what is meant to be. remember, everything happens for a reason.|`|IcD2cKuJaa	Its your first so yes you are going to feel like sh*t but there are other girls out there. You will get over her. It might take a wile but you will.<br>  <br>  You should stop calling her so you can move on.|`|q6SuOScfaa	It is definately for the best mate; I too suffer from depression so I kinda understand how it feels. What you have to remember is that you are not wrong; if you're depressed then I realise the amount of pressure your partener can come under, however, if she loves you enough she would stick by you and help you through it. If she is unwilling to do that then she obviously wasn't providing you with what you needed from the relationship. My advice is seriously to get over her, there is a good video on <a href="http://www.videojug.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.videojug.com</a> that can give you tips on how to get over your ex in a way to minimise the "hurty" feelings. (well, it helped me anyway :) ) There are plenty more fish in the sea, always remember that (but also remember that relationships have to be worked for, dont believe in the idea of a soulmate that's out there cos there isnt, it doesnt work like that).<br>  I wish you luck, let us know how it all works out :)
2nc9k9BSaa	Hmm.. I'd rather show them in little ways first. Get to know each other more and communicate better and more often. Since you mention that there hasn't been a decent conversation in months, just saying those three little words out loud will probably rush the relationship and possibly make communication worse.|`|sC2WFC81aa	and you love them?
jG55tGJAaa	it's hard to tell by just online chatting. but you have a small shot . she says she wants to hang out. Thats not a tatal rejection but not an exceptance either.|`|hxQaqSvkaa	Prob...hun u have a shot with any girl you meet if your really that smooth...u sound hottt|`|zwpJCdrJaa	It's hard to say so early into the relationship.See if you like her really and truly then ask her if she feels that way about you.
x3bkJHBZaa	He's more like flirting than sincere, u might wanna draw aline and stays as friends.|`|1uRUaSblaa	He's being flirty, playful & naughty.<br>  He's also  trying to see how far you <br>  can go with his nonsense.<br>  Don't take him seriously.|`|R6Rjtv0saa	Why do u post one question so many times ??<br>  lemme guess, u r nervous bcoz he is d hottest thing u hav seen, isnt it ??<br>  <br>  just forgot all things, just listen to ur heart, wht do u want ??<br>  if u want sex, then dont think much...|`|FlSLNhsoaa	sounds like hes just flirting, he probably has a crush on you, and omg he does weed!!! wow oh no!!! who cares weed is nohing. hes probably a good guy you know him better then any one who is going to give you advice on YA, but it sounds to me like hes just flirting.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	He is playing around with you. He figures if you continue you will do anything he wants. Move on.|`|8Ucq2EEAaa	he just wants to take advantage of you.. he sees you as an easy catch that he doesn't have to work for.. guys are extremely lazy so they(i should probably say "we") love when they don't have to win over a girl. i guarantee you if you make yourself "hard to get" he won't want to waste his time on you. to him your just another girl he can use, abuse, and ditch. weed isn't that big of a deal but it does make people do really stupid stuff. <br>  <br>  i'm sorry i can't tell you that he honestly loves you. unfortunately, guys that really care and don't just want sex are hard to find. i hope this helps. message me if you want to talk.|`|ZCLdV2HBaa	he's flirting.. you cant tell what he wants yet. and even if a guy is just wanting sex at the beginning.. crack him.. make him wait. make him commit if ya wanna be with the guy. If he likes you he will wait. If he just wants sex and you give it to him right away. kiss him goodbye cause he's got what he wanted no need to flirt with you anymore. <br>  haha. the weed thing..... not a big deal at all. little secret.. aloooot of people smoke weed... I bet a good number of the parents of ppl you go to school with smoke weed, and even if you strongly disagree.. you will more than likely try weed someday.
ajKJcoBFaa	I THINK THAT HES PLAYING AROUND WITH YOU SO DONT PAY ATTION TO HIM CAUSE YOURE JUST GOING TO END UP HURT SO JUST TELL YOURE HEART THAT HIS NOT THE ONE AND FIND BETTER.<br>  GOOD LUCK AND DONT LET HIM TREAT YOU LIKE CRAP.|`|tOwcRHoOaa	if he says things that he likes you but then he asks your best friend he might be using you to get to her or hes saying that so he wont admit that he likes you very much.
W9dabUw7aa	Crush on someone else...serves 2 purposes...it may re-spark his interest or at least you're opening up to other options. People at your age go in and out and even back in to attractions...it may not mean anything...he's just not into you at this time...maybe he will be later...lighten up the best you can about it and that will also make you more attractive to everyone, including him...people are attracted to cheerful, positive, confident people, right?
Qxexz4mEaa	If he tries to get too close to you, you should say, "hey don't you have a girlfriend" or something like that, so that he'll back off a little.|`|GykCnbR7aa	when he holds ur hand and flirt say stop doing this its wrong u have a girlfriend and just go and approach him about this just get this off ur chest<br>  <br>  P.S. please answer by latest question the one about spring break shopping please i need ur help and its a possible 10 points
E7TkNO00aa	Do the opposite. If you complain, be mean to your brothers, get bad grades, and feel sorry for yourself, don't do that anymore. Instead of complaining all the time, don't, instead of being mean to your brothers, be nice to them, instead of getting bad grades, study, instead of feeling sorry for yourself, look at life in a different way. Good luck. Maybe your mom will have a different opinion then.|`|xwDzek6uaa	You cant make anyone do anything. <br>  <br>  My suggesting is you stop complaining if you feel thats an issue.<br>  <br>  However, you have to do what you have to do.
JWV2J8Gfaa	First off both of your ages would be important information in answering this question. But for the most part always remember these following rules, Ive made my f***ups several times and still do today every so often.<br>  <br>  1) If you start talking to a girl and you both start to click well, ease back a little and seem less interested. If you seem over excited, like if she asks you to do something she knows you will cancel everything your doing for her, that is bad. <br>  <br>  2) Dont always be the first to make contact, ex: text or call. Let there be a few days in between communication, that not only gives them a little space but then makes them wonder why all of a sudden you arent talking to them daily (aka buggin).. this will keep them attracted to you. When you do talk to them just keep it short and simple.. dont start telling your life story about things you havent told her in the past couple of days because then she will think your trying to hard.<br>  <br>  3) Never bring up things you like about other girls or about things you have done in past relationships (unless she goes down that path)... but do mention another girls name maybe once a week or once every 2 weeks so she knows that she isnt the only girl, which inturn makes her jealous even if its just a friend of yours.<br>  <br>  For example: Blah blah blah.. ya thats cool, my friend Jennifer wanted to meet up with me later and grab a bite to eat.|`|EaIR89pbaa	It's a tough call. If you feel like you want it to continue, then talk to her about it. But if you're sick of trying to force it and feel like you want someone you'll connect to more, then it might be time to end it.<br>  <br>  I'd appreciate it if you answered mine<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306175027AAGkgSl">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|ubdCAMWAaa	Ok us girls are so complicated.<br>  We dont like to show are feelings.<br>  But dont give up on her. Cause she might like you.<br>  && if you give up on her then she will give up on you.<br>  Try to stay in there longer and next time she makes <br>  an excuse stand up for your self&&say no i really need<br>  to talk to you and i need you to listen to me and then go from there.
4l2qOy7Paa	well you're never too sure cause guys will flirt with literally every girl. and they'll tell you you look hot or something like that and laugh at your jokes and stuff and always stare at you during class and hug you and try to sound all tough and stuff. haha. =]
CVWizvy6aa	The fact that you love and trust him does not have anything to do with him being truthful to you or not. You also have to consider from whom you got the information from. You have to evaluate if that person is trustworthy.   Also, talk to your boyfriend about it. It does not help if you just sit there and guess. Ask him. Say..I heard so and so say this about you.  What do you think of that? See how he reacts. Be calm and understanding when you talk to him.  Closely pay attention when he replies.|`|ti1BpC4Paa	pretty asian is right she is telling you wat i was going to say lol
p4wdTloEaa	Well your boyfriend shouldn't be talking about other girls when hes around you. talk about hot guys and when he gets mad tell him "if you get mad when i talk about guys how do u think it feels when u talk about girls"|`|WSQSbZPsaa	Uh.. I suggest you drop this guy.  He doesn't sound good for you or anybody.|`|daSyJZyeaa	Look- I'm sorry to break this to you, but he probably doesn't care that much about you if he completely screws your feelings like that.
FZKFLTyLaa	Sure. He's got no commitment to this other girl as yet. 50/50 shot!
zzaScg0haa	Honestly from the sounds of it you desevre so much better then an *** like him
eSZ4RskIaa	not right away.<br>  you need to things out and see if there is any possible way that you can work it out! especially if you love them! but if you just really like them its different|`|XwMn6aY5aa	it's not working and give reasons why you breaking up...so the person knows what they did wrong..
kSYtcENRaa	its part of our nature. <br>  <br>  9 times out of 10 it is just her talking, as girls do. it is only normal for you to feel this jealousy when she is talking about past boyfriends. thing is, you have to be the man and ignore this. you should think to yourself that that relationship was in the past. meaning it must have gone wrong and that you shall do a better job than the last person. think about it. she's picked you. who cares if she talks about an ex. she obvs thinks your man enough to be about to talk about other men like that. <br>  <br>  if it is really effecting you, talk to her. be open cause there's nothing worse than a relationship where the couple never tell each other what they dont like|`|AA11899313	And, beating him up would do what?  Solve the problem that is you / yours!<br>  <br>  Talk to her and explain to her what you have explained here.<br>  <br>  Any sympathy I might have with your situation would be simply 'blown away' by your infantile or childish desire to beat him up.<br>  <br>  Try to behave like an Adult and 'resolve the problem' instead of like the child with an attempted 'fix'.<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|i5Zi5hf7aa	She should know better than to mention her ex, she should have more respect for you and your relationship, I think you should talk it out with her, don't raise your voice just ask her why she talks about him so much and let her know that it makes you very uncomfortable and if she doesn't stop then she doesn't respect you.|`|IW592N5Zaa	Well you have to know that girls are more sentimental than guys are. Relationships are really important to us and we never really let them go. Talk to your girlfriend about how this makes you feel. It sounds korny but it could solve a lot.

e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Why choose? Dump them both and find a guy to love who has his life together and is financially stable.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	Before you bail on your marriage(although it is apparent in distress), why don't you see if you cant re-exhume the one you have. Remember, you took a vow for better or worse, not until I am sick of my partner. If your current marriage seems loveless have you communicated this to your partner? What made you fall in love with your spouse in the first place? Why don't you get your communication going with your spouse and try to get the sparks up again. See if you can't revisit things you did when you were going out in the beginning and see if you can do that with a spin towards today. Start doing things together - make time for it.  You should also seek counseling if this does not do it for you. On the side of the affair, I would phase that out. What you have there is the newness of the relationship and that early euphoria - we all get it. After all, your learning about that person. That in time will wear down too. A marriage takes work and you have to perform the upkeep to maintain the sparks. You owe it to your vows to give it a shot......
OepV9xNMaa	there is really no way to let break someone's heart nicely, it is going to hurt no matter how you do it. sorry, just telling the truth.
chZFmJOPaa	Mmmm yeah I suppose. It depends on the type of love it is. I waited for a year and half to tell my ex I loved him. But we had a very unhealthy relationship. Things were always confused with him, he wasnt sure what he wanted from the situation.<br>  <br>  But my new boyfriend... we were friends and got to know each other.... we told each other how we truly felt -love was mentioned- and we ended up making it official. <br>  <br>  It just depends on how you feel I guess... love is much more than 'oh yeah shes my girlfriend so I love her'... no, theres a huge difference. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you really dont love him back haha. Which is okay, but just be honest with yourself... and be careful cause he could be trying to take this much further than where you want it to go.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Say it with flowers!|`|hNFtO9vXaa	wow. 3 weeks that's really fast in my opinion.. but hey if u both love each other it's ok i guess..|`|zxVLEccsaa	no|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Definitely too early.<br>  <br>  Loves takes time to grow from a seedling to a full on blooming flower. In this sense, 3 weeks is not enough to know everything about someone, and like everything about them regardless of their faults. I would suggest that you immediately call him and ask him to meet you. From there, discuss that you (probably) don't love him back and why, and that it is simply too early to say I love you to each other.|`|wf7Q4SqPaa	No, its not too early to say I love you. That was good that you said you loved him back because if you hadn't, he may haven't gotten upset and then your relationship would be at risk. Don't rush into anything though.|`|km8oM3YHaa	Yes.. I believe three weeks is way to soon to falling in love. There are four stages of love.....1. Lust 2. Attraction 3. Attachment then finally.... 4. Love. There is no way you guys could have fell in love in three weeks.|`|G4pmbc0Qaa	I would say yes. In three weeks you barely know a person - What was his grandfather's name? What was his childhood dream? - much less love them. :\<br>  <br>  Edit : Wtf is up with everyone talking about flowers?|`|QLji3RCLaa	Three weeks? I don't know...that seems a little too soon. It depends on how old you are too, I guess. I always thought love took time.|`|jG55tGJAaa	3 weeks is fast maby you should slow down but, if you both really like each other then go for it|`|e4M5FUOOaa	HA.... you dont love him...and he doesnt love you.... not yet.... he either is too emotional.... wants SOMETHING from you..... or just throws the words around like they mean nothing|`|0EUBc2hRaa	just get some flowers|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Yes. And you shouldn't have said it back. What can you possibly know about each other in 3 weeks?<br>  <br>  I love you doesn't mean, I like you, I think you are hot, you turn me on, and I want to do you. <br>  <br>  And you don't tell someone you love them just because they say it to you. <br>  <br>  Kids think they are in love every time they are attracted to someone. IT IS NOT THE SAME THING. Save it for the real thing. You'll thank me later.|`|RhKhyol0aa	Yes never utter those words they are a last resort.
AA10865878	It sounds to me his ears don't work well. When you say you just want to be friends and you don't like him that way, he should not be so pushy. <br>  <br>  If he acts like that again then look him in the eyes and say "I've told you once and I've told you again the same thing, I don't like you in that way so let's stay friends, if you can't accept how I feel then you obviously wouldn't know how to respect me even if I liked you that way". Then walk away and leave it at that.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure any other way to handle that but it's a start.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WKBVrHhbaa	If you only want to be friends with him, then leave it at that. Obviously if he's begging you then he wants to be more than just friends. They always use the "you're scared of a real relationship" line...it's silly.<br>  <br>  Put your foot down and say that you only want to be friends, but like I said sounds like he wants more, so he'll either keep asking till he gets tired or stop being friends with you<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|0DguhW0Daa	If you haven't been friends with him for long, and don't really like him, then stop being friends with him.<br>  Or you could just be a little rude to him, and be like, "Listen, I just want to be friends, OK? OK."<br>  Or just let him know gently and say, "I don't think we would be good together, and it would honestly be for the best if we were just friends. I'm really sorry, but I don't want to lead you in the wrong direction."|`|vzRBqU75aa	hey girl.<br>  He's going about it all the wrong way. he should respect you and <br>  your wishes and be like ok. and don't Force your self to do anything <br>  you don't want to do. its good that you put your foot down. but if he keeps<br>  doing this you no longer can be good friends or really anything.<br>  best of luck :D|`|c2jTBSn7aa	Sounds like he really likes you. Whats a good reason why you DONT want to go out with him. Why Not? Why not give him a chance? For all you know..He could be your Mr. Right. I say you should tell him. "Okay.

You should tell him that you really don't want to go out with him, and if he doesn't drop the subject, you won't want to be friends with him at all!|`|4l2qOy7Paa	you should have a serious long talk with him. or maybe you should really give him a chance. he could be the one... you never know.|`|YweMJm2Eaa	he sounds like a creeper. <br>  stayy away from him.|`|6YbxTlDCaa	you're already doing it.

Well I was 12, and he was 14. Things went okay, but things got too serious. Not really physically, but he always came over, dayyy after day. He was pushy, and things werent really a relationship. It was more of an attention getting situation. <br>  <br>  He's my neighbor. We don't talk now lol. I'm 18 and yeah, it was a big waste of time and emotions.|`|9GmrHmyuaa	my first girlfriend was back in early middle school, and it lasted about 5-6 months, but we really liked eachother. as long as you are open, honest, and above all, a gentleman, then it will go on for a while.

How do you know you don't like him.  Looks may not be everything.<br>  Look at his personality and qualities in him.<br>  You might change your mind once you speak to him a few times.<br>  Maybe he might become your friend.|`|d9mhyVmSaa	If you don't really like this boy, why bother to know he like you? Okay, maybe it's out of curiosity. If you really want to know whether he like you or not, just ask him.

iLkPXONQaa	Depressed? First you need to relax and realize that it is normal to feel very sad sometimes if you have problems with a guy. But be realistic and know that it is temporary. I hate to say it but if he asked her out then he wanted to and if he didnt ask you then he didnt want to. Be thankful that his feelings werent returned by her. She doesnt like him and he may ask you out later. But just know its temporary. Just cry and pray to God and evryday you will be stronger. Also remember that this is a fact of life most relationships dont work thats why we date to marry one person. so chances are ull go thru this again in your life sweetheart. Just use it a something to make you stronger for all themen you have to weed thru before you fid you husband. And dont have sex....you sound like a young girl.|`|wrhi24jTaa	If you want you can stop texting him completely just for a while. Talk to a close friend about this problem just to let it out. It helps to talk about it with icecream.  Spend time with ur bff. watch funny movies play a sport and go shopping. Try to go to parties maybe you will meet another guy. thats what i did. my friends made me go to a party when i thought it was completely worthless...then i found someone and weve been hitting it off pretty good eversince.

q2Gz07yZaa	Dude if you like this girl and you see a future with her, there should be nothing stopping you from finding out if she's going to be your life partner! That's the reason most people date RIGHT! To find someone to grow old with us! If she in a commitment make sure you are going to offer her more than the person she's already with because if not your the only one who will be hurt at the end! I made a decision similar to this and it was the best choice i ever made. Expect the worst, it makes it easier if it doesn't work out and if it does work out it's 10 x better!|`|OJKWiLuTaa	im not sure???????????
BbcBTIrUaa	There is alot of people who would love  to help but<br>  how can they? they only know you through here and through this question.<br>  <br>  I really pity but what more can I do?<br>  Here are my thoughts on what its like to be you.<br>  <br>  I get really desperate when I am single, I must have<br>  a girl with me at all times!!,<br>  And there are times when I think that I am never ging to make,<br>  when I think that my life is worth nothing to anybody.<br>  I just feel like its pointless to do anything.<br>  <br>  I am sure you are exaggerating about how ugly you are,<br>  but if you are not, then think about this,<br>  how do you think elephant man or rocky dennis lived their lives.<br>  <br>  It makes you wonder "what good am i even if I am alive?"<br>  but that is a question EVERYBODY should be asking themselves<br>  but they just get distracted from it because they are not like you.<br>  <br>  But anyways, what I suggest, just keep looking, show that you are looking tell someone, but dont make this goal your only purpose in life.<br>  I am sure that somewhere in the world someone is dying to be<br>  with you, like this guy said, there may be a girl that is in the same <br>  situation as you, when you find her, take your chance.<br>  but you have to keep looking and meeting new people. Until then<br>  you can keep trying with the girls in your everyday life, expect to be<br>  rejected, its okay, but do not get heart broken every time it happens.<br>  <br>  Other than that, if you really expect to not get anywhere in life with relationships there are still other things in life you can do, shifht your focus to something else. Get healthy, lose some weight, get some <br>  muscles, then you will start to look better automatically.  Do not be<br>  so depressed, learn to deal with your life, learn and accept your life for how it is, develop a sense of humor even, so that when people make fun of you, can play along. develop a unique charm, research on what girls like,research on what attracts people.  Just like you are doing now, ask around for tips on what you can do, but dont live online, challenge yourself to gett out there and become social, dare yourself<br>  to ask a girl for help, you dont have to freak her out and tell her that you love her (if you think she will freak out if you say that), just be honest and ask her, " hey, I know I am ugly and stupid or whatever, but do you think I can still have a chance with a girl?" It doesnt matter how she answers because every person has a different opinion (remember this), so whether she says yes or no you can always ask another "hey, what do girls like? what should I do to become more appealing to girls?" cmon dude. you can do it, develop a charm,<br>  <br>  Its not really about the body you are in, but how you use this body.<br>  Okay so now picture this:<br>  Pretend you travel to another parallel universe, PICTURE IT AND I KNOW YOU CAN,your body is the same, your economic status is the same, your clothes are the same, HECK everything else is the same...<br>  but there is something different---- you have alot of friends!!, girls flirt with you, when you say "hey cutie!" you may or may not have a girlfriend but everybody gets along with you, and you feel loved, and you get enough attention and communication so that you dont need a gf.  I know you may think this world is absurd,   bbut it is possible.<br>  <br>  STUDY this world, how are you different in this world than how you are now, how are your actions, your movement, your character, your responses to everything, your personality, why would anybody pay attention or flirt with you like that WHY, FIGURE OUT WHY!!!<br>  WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY IN THIS WORLD!!!?!?! FIGURE IT OUT!!!<br>  and once you have the answer make it your world, its going to be a challenge to change like this but its what you want right? this other world? <br>  <br>  As for lonely nights. these are horrible, and I still havent figured out<br>  what to do about these, but just remember that you are not alone going through these lonely nights.<br>  <br>  This is not the best answer, this is not the solution to your problems,<br>  but you are going to have to figure out how to live through this on your own,  and looking for help like this, asking questions like you are now,<br>  shows that you have hope to learn more of what you can do.  So keep it up, but get better at it. you have a  long way to go, but be honest to yourself, if you need help say it. if you are lonely at night look for someone but if you are turned down dont feel so bad, at least you get the comfort of knowing that you did what you could.  <br>  <br>  you did what you could, you did what you could. you did what you coul<br>  <br>  and if you ever get stuck and it doesnt  seem to be getting better.<br>  stop and figure something out, ask for help.<br>  but remember THERE IS ALWAYS A WAY.<br>  So picture your goal, visualize and ask your self,<br>  "okay what the hell did I do here to be so happy that I am not doing<br>  in real life?"<br>  There is always a way, so ask around, take risks (what can you lose?)<br>  and be glad that by doing these things, you are living life at the peak.<br>  <br>  I will be p|`|uhKBBQ9raa	TRUE LOVE, is not about looks, it's about the heart.<br>  You always can make something about your looks, but your personality is what should matter. And if you're constantly sad and with a lack of confidence, people obviously won't get attracted to you. Talk to your brothers about it, you share the same blood, they can help you.<br>  Wish you the best of lucks, and hopefully you'll find somebody to share your life with xx :)|`|PbCeuT36aa	You can always go out with another unattractive girl.  There is some girl out there that feels the same way you do.  Ask your friends to hook you up with someone that is also ugly.  Girls say im ****** hot and ****, and i havent had a girlfriend in two years (doesn't mean i havent handled with anyone, haha).  Anyways, there are some girls that like you for who you are, if you have a bad and boring personality then you are screwed.|`|sMUw3bJCaa	Im gonna tell you what to do, and follow what i say i promise you that it will help you. <br>  <br>  first of all, stop being sad and stop thinking that you're ugly. Think that you are the most beautiful guy that excist and that you can get anything and everyone you want.  <br>  <br>  Dress up nicely and build up your confidence by telling yourself that. Just do it and dont let anything keeping you back. <br>  <br>  Girls goes for guys that believe in them selves|`|zkqMYpRsaa	if you are insecure about your looks, it is actually great to meet someone online and let them get to know your personality first, then exchange pics.

zIGTzoxjaa	no its not cheating unless it gets physical|`|chZFmJOPaa	Well, I wouldnt consider it CHEATING. She was very honest with you about it at least. Just let her know it hurt you... ask why she needs to look that guy up. Its not fair for her to do that, no. But it's not cheating.<br>  <br>  Edit: someone mentioned its not cheating unless its physical.... well no thats not true. You can emotionally cheat on someone. Which makes you want to make it physical. That has happened to me. My ex would sit on a game and flirt with women on there.... its just as bad. So just watch and see if she starts talking to him... if she does, then I would be a bit more worried.

I selected my church specifically because it was outward focused.  Our pastor has teamed up with community organizations and through coordination of effort they are able to get more done together than by themselves.|`|0ocU0LJ0aa	I suggest that her sanity would rest in the Lord...she should go to church and get involved in the womens groups so they can pray over her and God can heal her life...God can bring big blessings...such as money support housing away from the abuse...the people who follow Christ love to help the people who go through suffering with a joyful and compassionate heart i suggest that she goes...God heals the less fortunate and those that suffer and i got that word today and i want to share it with you with a compassionate heart. And with all my love for God's people i encourage you to encourage you just ask God for giudance. I went through the same thing and then i joined the army however i only had one child but i can only imagine how challenging it is...but God is waiting for a way in to heal her she just needs to know. And God will bless you to for leading you to her..and abundantly if i may add you should look into Jesus and his Father yourself.God Bless you both.

Since no known address is available for the ex-husband, a notice will be printed in a newspaper of record.  This newspaper will probably be located either at the last known place where the husband lived or where the marriage took place.<br>  <br>  Notice will state that she is filing for divorce on month/day/year and if anyone having an interest in the divorce want to make their position know, they must appear in court to voice their opposition.

ZjM0ghSnaa	Dont worry, I sometimes feel intimidated too, since I'm always surrounded by underage girls and boys making out in the hallways. Though, I really dont care if I had a bf or not. <br>  <br>  Anyways, you should'nt feel that way. You'll get a guy eventually, so there's no need to rush things. Think about it, if you have a bf at this age, what are the chances that you'll end up being together for a very long time? What's the point? It'll be considered as a little kid relationship, that doesnt count. I dont know how old you are, but you seem pretty young. I dont think your ugly. You dont know if people think your not cute or hot, so most likely there is at least someone who likes you, you just never know it. Dont worry about your looks, they shouldnt matter. Maybe its your personality that keeps them away? I dont know you, so I cant judge, but you might wanna re-evaluate yourself. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|e7uUfLsqaa	Well, you look cute from your pic!<br>  <br>  But more importantly, you need to be happy with yourself! who cares what people think of you.

If she says no shes too stupid to realize that your crazy for her and shes not worth it.<br>  <br>  Best of luck :D
JEPf71vlaa	Don't tell your father anything. Men's ego are so high that you giving them advice makes them feel imasculate. I know how hard it is to have  parents that fight all the time. Calmly address your mother and say:<br>  "Mom, I don't want to sound like a know it all but I don't think you're being treated fairly. You do and do and do for us constantly but somehow dad undermines that. I'm suggesting you separate again but you should at least confront him. I've noticed this and you could do so much better. Please don't tell him I said anything. I'm just trying to look out for you like you do for me so often. I love you and I care for you. Just take my suggestion into consideration."<br>  <br>  Try and do some quality things together. Suggest your parents have a date night so they can reconnect. Chances are is that they're hitting a rough path so don't jump on the separation wagon just yet. My friend had her parents go through a rough patch for three years. Sometimes a little hard ship goes a long way to help a relationship really thrive.<br>  Love and Blessings,<br>  Bella|`|RB1HEmByaa	nothing to do but get family councling, or you can just get away from it all, just stay over at  friends house more often and get out of the house.|`|qqLcvDDKaa	I'm sorry you have to go through that, it hurts to see your parents being so ugly to each other.|`|b3iuhwuPaa	yea dude get away from it stay over at a friends house|`|AA11578616	Try talking to them one at a time when no one else is around.It's important that someone get them to understand the impact their fighting is having on the entire family.Maybe talking with another family member present would help,an aunt, uncle or grandparent.good luck|`|iAhz88tEaa	if he pushes her or some physical contact, man up...lol i cant do the same in my family because..first of all its not a family...moms not respected..for a reason..

I can read people like a book and I use that to my advantage...I love a woman who can make me laugh without even saying a word. She also has to be able to take a joke and dish one out. Someone who LOVE's God with all of her heart, mind and soul !!<br>  <br>  Second, her eyes. When I look into her eyes, I want to feel completely relaxed and trust her...I want to feel loved and needed.<br>  <br>  Third, her smile. <br>  <br>  Fourth, the way she acts when she is around me...the way we interact with one another. How she treats other's with compassion, merciful,  friednship etc..<br>  <br>  But most importantly, she has to be herself when she is around me. And I think a lot of guys will agree when I say that we really don't like "fake" girls. I women of virtue and honesty is great !!<br>  <br>  Someone who is pure, Godly and intellectual, who can actually carry on a conversation and not talk about herself.!! A girl who respects a man and honors him truly !|`|a7f3d8bf66bfd9fc1daac1814d6e6577aa	warmth and sweetness|`|daSyJZyeaa	I look for things in this order<br>  <br>  Pretty face<br>  Good hygiene (Clean hair, Brushed teeth, etc.)<br>  Personality (If she's a *****, that's a definite no)<br>  Sexual Parts (I'm sorry, but every guy notices these...)<br>  How comfortable she is around you and other people|`|0ktcvglRaa	BIG **** AND SIDEKICKS!|`|HyDlROg0aa	a pulse :P|`|rju0fqVcaa	eyes flip my switch on|`|EaIR89pbaa	There's really a lot of things. To be honest, looks are part of it, but only the face. I could care less about her other features. Her personality is HUGE, I don't like girls who are always feeling sorry for themselves or trying to get attention. Girls who are strong enough to be confident in themselves is also important. I also appreciate girls who care about how they look, but don't obsess over it. Generally a cute, somewhat quiet girl will usually grab my attention.

Or you could switch the phone number.|`|CVWizvy6aa	You did not give enough information for me to give you a complete advice. You have to ask yourself a question. " Does he deserve for me to give him another chance?" IF the answer is yes, start working on the broken relationship. IF the answe if no, tell him not to call you again. If he does not listen and still calls, BLOCK his number. Chance your number.  Cut the communication line with him.|`|Bx6OtwUDaa	Well, To tell you the truth the same is happening to me. If you really don't want him calling you tell him strait up. and if he doesn't seem to listen then thats wen i think u should change your #.

aITWZoQzaa	First of all, how old are you.  Just wondering because I sounds like your young and don't really know how your own body works.  If you masturbated, then you would see where your sensitive areas of your penis are (I'll call it hyper sensitive veins) and if your gf intensely bj'd with her mouth and tongue hitting that spot, you would orgasm.
c89c8fdd87fe86f024b998d2d6d24211aa	Well first off think about why you went out with him in the first place. Obviously you did it for a reason so you must like the guy. Secondly when  your in a brand new relationship it is kind of hard to talk to each other because everything is just so new. You have to take the time to get to know each other and see what you have in common and what your likes and dislikes are. Don't always wait for him to strike up the conversation you have to do that also. The other thing is just because everyone else doesn't think he's cute doesn't mean you shouldn't. Everyone has their own opinion but don't let that influence what you think about him and even if he isn't that great looking he is still a human that has feelings and probably has a lot of other good qualities that you just don't know about. It might be a good idea to give him a chance. Hope this helps!!|`|1V1r6il7aa	Wow!<br>  Are you talking about ben?<br>  Nice|`|dEb85e07aa	its good cause y'all didn't even talk..|`|HuVfzU06aa	well yes for the not talking to you considering that's what a relationship revolves around, but no because other people didnt think he was cute
1EBn5A6daa	what i would do is take it slow.....start by being extremely friendly to him, ex. talk to him by saying good morning or afternoon(which ever it is) and always smile big or wave, look good, try to get him to notice you.... if that doesn't work you could be really tricky and maybe report something to him like a lost item...say i lost my ipod on the train the other day did you hear anything about it or even hey..you look familar did you go to so and so school...either way try and catch his eye, good luck sweetie
vimfbSxfaa	remmeber there are different kinds of love. dont get hung up on it. things you can do:<br>  <br>  make your move by hang out with her alot untill she tells you im breaking up with my bf cause your so much funner and more awesome, so careing, wonderful. remember dont talk **** about her bf while you are with her. <br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  just get over her and have a life of your own. your own girl friend or girls you kick it with.|`|xbGgF6dLaa	um sorry to break your bubble but a new fad in school is to call people "love." I remember i first heard it when i held the door open for a girl and she said, "Oh thank you love". So do some of the teachers. She um might just "love" you as a friend. But she doesn't love you like that. I think that people in England say love and sometimes people in the US like to imitate them soo.... sorry. I'm around your age so i know what your talking about. I'm a girl so i know what girls are into at that age right now.|`|F5eKBBaXaa	Look dude be strong yea I know that sounds like a dam repeating machine change the record. If you truly want to know if this girl has any feelings towards you. The best choice would have to be move on, and find a new girlfriend and see if she accepts it for what it is or has an issue with it. Chances are it will work.|`|bmhT1IrTaa	this girl has some problems. i think that you should keep your distanve or talk to HER about the situation. i f you think that you two love eachother.. then tell her. but wait till she's over this guy actually, cause if you mess with her now. t=problems will just start. she will be moving between you two, comparing you two, and when with you she will think negative of him and reverse. it will be just a big emotional mess, so if you dont want to loose her, wait till there done and make a move.|`|N1ZwqgHPaa	all you have to do is ask<br>  <br>  <br>  btw, <br>  totally get free stuff for filling out easy surveys!  totally free, period. <a href="http://www.myopinionnow.com/joinus.aspx?ref=28395B478CE35" rel="nofollow">http://www.myopinionnow.com/joinus.aspx?...</a>|`|vzRBqU75aa	Hey.<br>  looks like u have a hand full. only you can answer that question bud<br>  what does your heart tell you?<br>  best of luck :D|`|2dnfK7mmaa	SHE DOESNT|`|jsbHNurgaa	Don't ask us.

I am now 23 years old. When I was 14 I started having sex. I thought I was in love and that we were going to get married also. We didnt. He liked another girl. I have regreted my decision every day. People change and you cant judge what you feel right now. I know that you are experiencing feelings that say this is right but it isnt. Also dont forget the STD factors and if you are both virgins pregnancy. I was 16 when I had my first child and we used condoms and i was on birth control. Dont ever think that you cant get a girl pregnant. the best way to prevent pregancy is to not have sex. by the way I have 3 children now. If you can make a right decision it would be to wait.|`|zwpJCdrJaa	I know you might want to, but what if she got pregnant? How would you handle that? I understand the pull and desire to have sex with her can be bewildering, but you have to keep a clear head and don't do it.

r7u2g8roaa	The law of the world:<br>  <br>  If you find someone on the internet they most likely have problems.<br>  <br>  Many men are intimidated by very attractive or sensual women and may need more help than usual to obtain an erection. If you mechanically stimulated him (mouth or hand) and he still did not obtain an erection then he has a problem and should seek medical attention.<br>  <br>  Did you check to see if his eyes were constricted of dilated? (thinking narcotics), he may be on hypertension medication or under treatment for depression. Most high blood pressure and antidepressants can cause impotence but there are some that will actually increase a man's potency. First line hypertension medications are inexpensive but cause impotence...newer, more expensive drugs improve penile blood flow as a secondary effect thus improving male erections but these drugs are not commonly given most patients unless directly demanded by the man. Some newer Atypical antidepressants are also given to improve male erectile ability but usually must be demanded by the patient.<br>  <br>  Narcotics such as cocaine and heroine will eventually limit dopamine production thus causing impotence in a male and frigidity in females. This is temporary and is reversed once the drugs are stopped.<br>  <br>  Don't see this person again until you get ALL his information through emails and then help him solve whatever problems he has first.|`|ckr2be5daa	Please please stop this a-moral behavior.<br>  <br>  Why don't you think that your OWN husband can't pleasure you?

The "best" relationships are based off of friendships.  Give him time.  He maybe worried that if you two go beyond friendship that it may ruin your closeness.  Your best chance is to remain his friend.  Girl, you don't need to be telling him everything, just some things.  Change your hair a bit, where something nicer.  Dress up a bit.  Enjoy his company.  Being his friend is the best thing ever.  If you push this with him, you may lose him for good.  Be careful.  Great friends are hard to come by.|`|61067fedf264463ca62586a8d1d24170aa	Sounds like he already is totally crazy for you.<br>  <br>  Have a friend ask him if he's into you.<br>  <br>  Chances are, he loves ya!<br>  <br>  If he doesn't like you.....just be yourself and be nice to him.

Never tell someone elses business thats how things get started.  She is in a relationship and there will be times where she is going to spend more time with him thats very normal.  You have to stop talking so much and thinking she is going to always have to hang around you.  You have to accept that she is in a relationship but you need to talk to her and apologize because you were wrong for telling someone even if you didn't spread it.|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	tell her the truth but if you can, prove<br>  to her that her boyfriend told whoever you<br>  told first.<br>  <br>  you still kind of broke the promise,<br>  but idk, do the best you can to seem nice.<br>  <br>  good luck:)|`|3reHk4I1aa	the best thing that you can do right now is say hey i know thatyou are mad right now but can i at least tell you my side of the story and sit down and talk to her (make sure she cant leave) and then tell her what happened maybe even get that person that you both tolkd to tell her that he was the one who told before she did. and then if she still doesnt believe you then all you really can do is wait it out let he be mad but then she will realize that boyfriends are not forever b ut friends are|`|2040myy2aa	get the person that he told to let her know that he said it first but at the end of the day she will still be mad because you said something|`|MKHd10MYaa	Well, for one, don't blame her for believing her boyfriend -- even if it was only for 3 months. When you get in a relationship with someone, generally, you really trust them and what not. So you can't really blame her for that. She has more trust in her boyfriend because she thinks that she's in love and he's in love with her.<br>  <br>  And as for her boyfriend saying that you told, that doesn't seem like a really good boyfriend. Try to get the person that you both told to go and tell your friend that you did accidentally tell them but her boyfriend did first. If you can't, oh well.<br>  <br>  Look your friend in her eyes and tell her "I'm not lying. I did accidentally tell someone, and I'm sorry for that. But your boyfriend did too, and he said it first. I'm not trying to blame him and I'm just saying the truth, but if you don't want to believe me that's fine. Just keep in mind that if he lies to someone like that, he may lie to you more and in the end he's going to hurt you more through lies if he can get away with this one. You don't have to believe me, it's your lost. At least deep down inside, I know I'm telling the truth and your boyfriend knows I'm telling the truth as well."|`|VD694WY1aa	well, sad to say you did violate the trust. And although I can tell you are truly sorry, it is not unlikely that she may have a really hard time forgiving you. Think about just telling her the truth and standing by her and hope she will stand by you. <br>  <br>  And next time someone tells you anything in confidence, remember to keep it that way,.|`|lldB0Tkbaa	It doesn't matter WHO told first. You broke her trust. You are just as guilty as he is. <br>  Just admit that you were wrong, apologize and ask for her forgivness. <br>  <br>  You need to also understand that being in love (or what you think is love) can leave you blinded. Sometimes people don't realize that they are acting silly or selfish, but in the end it will either pass and she will come crawling back, because she will need your friendship, or you will get to see what kind of friend she really is.<br>  <br>  Just apologize for what YOU did wrong and give it some tme.|`|9MoytEURaa	sisters before misters ! <br>  <br>  why would she do that .<br>  if her boyfriend dumps her whats she gonna do ?<br>  explain to her why is she doing this and if she still dosent believe let her come to you .<br>  if you was a true friend you dont have to apoligize .|`|FLZaCrF9aa	explain it to her and if she don't believe you don't worry she will when this bf dumps her|`|YJ3pPYCOaa	just tell the truth and if she doesn't trust you thats her fault.|`|b3iuhwuPaa	first of all u'd shouldn't tell secerts karma will kick u in the ***

On the brighter note, you can do things to draw attention to yourself from him :) such as talking to him more, asking him to hang out as a group, and going to school fundraisers or community services together. let him get to know you and make a good impression :) you can't hope for something to happen on it's own.

R3uWGbFDaa	Ok, here is the truth. If your boyfriend is dating someone in seventh grade, then I think it is safe for me to say that you are young, and if that is not the case, then your ex is a freak. But, if you are that young, you have PLENTY of time to find a new boyfriend. Believe me it is not the end of the world. Just remember that there are alot of people out there and that in time you will find someone. No worries. I don't mean this in a rude way, but you will move on eventually.|`|9btcOpxXaa	what grade are u in? if hes dating someone in 7th.|`|aZvzGTUBaa	The first time I got dumped (the only time I got dumped) I stayed away from boys and just hung out with my friends.

nmQZIYutaa	Monday: Any contact would be 3 hours tops. We have math 120 together in college.<br>  <br>  Tuesday: an hour tops<br>  <br>  Wensday: 2.5 hours we have the same class math again<br>  <br>  thursday: an hour tops.<br>  <br>  Friday: five hours. we go to tutoring and class together. then hang out for avout an hour and a half. then traveling home together 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  Saturday and sunday: None at all<br>  <br>  We are both in college and work. He lives about an hour away from me in another town. I am 18 and he is 20. We both love the independence that we do have and how we are not smothering each other like a lotof couples do.<br>  <br>  So 12.5 hours a week....that doesn't seem like a lot but it's enough for us. I have been on relationships where we were together all the time and I hated it. Minimal contact is enough for me , you have to find what is right for you.
NpzNHmCGaa	This might be because you do not yet have that depth of friendship with them maybe because you haven't known them that long. However if you have known them for sometime (the point at which they should know you well enough to be a good friend) and they still show no care or concern then they are more of an aqaintance then a good friend.<br>  <br>  Never rely on this type of friend. aqaintance, even if you really like them they probably won't be there for you in a crisis. Unfortunitely you can't get a friend to care or show concern who doesn't naturally show this sort of behaviour towards you.<br>  <br>  I would focus on your good friends who genuinely care and do show concern as these are the ones who will be there for you. Your other friend/ aqintance I doubt will worry that much  if at all as they don't seem to want a close friendship with you.|`|WSQSbZPsaa	I'm not exactly sure what to say because of the lack of details, but sometimes expecting too much of another person can cause you to feel the way you are.  I suggest talking with the friend that you feel isn't meeting your expectations.|`|R0o5rvpGaa	Casual Friend<br>  <br>  ----- like all my friends but 5 are like that... i just ignore it and talk to my good friends about it:)|`|OegheALwaa	no there just an acquaintance, someone you know but not a close friend.
7AdNKLLAaa	Girl my husband has the same problem, and would 4real be in denial when I told him about it. My best advice is to be honest with him. It's better u be up front and honest with him because you the one who has to deal with it. Get him some Dr. Tischnoer (not sure if i spelled it right, but close enough) mouth wash, it works, also I hear that if a persons colon needs to be cleansed that can also cause bad breath, or he just may have a bad tooth that causes it. Whatever the case may be, have a sit down with him and tell him. Its better u tell him than someone else, because his feelings may really be hurt. I mean u want 2 stay attracted 2 him, but bad breath can be a BIG turn off. Overall don't sugar coat it, be real. Good luck Girlie!!|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Here is my bad breath story.  My wife quit kissing me.  I finally got her to tell me why.  She said, "You have bad breath".  I was really hurt because I did not know I had bad breath because I could not smell my own bad breath.  I then looked on the internet and learned that 90% of bad breath comes from the tongue where bacteria produce those bad smells.  I also found a great tongue cleaner, OraBrush.  I got one and now clean my tongue every time I brush my teeth.  HORRY!  She now kisses me.  Get your husband an OraBrush and tell him to use it on a regular basis.  His breath will be much much much better.  <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>|`|0rpN2419aa	Buy him a new toothbrush, toothpaste, gargle and floss....sleep on the couch..he'll get the picture pretty quick.<br>  Maye he needs to go to a dentist to see if cavities are causing the problem, or maybe a Dr. in case there is something going on with his digestive system.|`|AA12197561	Well when he tries to kiss you, kinda refuse it .

But if you are just calling her a lazy pig just to get our reactions and you real do care about her.  Then I say to you to sit down and have a good hard talk with her about her doing her share around the house and that if she doesn't start helping out around here that she is going have to just leave because you just can't take it anymore and this is your last chance to get it right, because your done.|`|43y0iwSdaa	i say tell her the truth<br>  tell her u thought it was going to be different when she moved in|`|PiG14ByFaa	You need to tell her you need to have a talk. (don't sound like a parent but a concerned partner) Sit down with her and tell her how you feel in a democratic way. Say that you have been overburdened with the work, and you need her help as a team mate. Say if you would like we can split up the chores individually (For example I do mostly everything, since I am a stay at home mom, but my husband cleans our bedroom, bathroom, and takes out trash) If you guys get it on paper, and create a solid schedule until you get used to your individual chores. But honestly if you tell her sincerely and express your deepest concerns, I am pretty sure she will respect your needs. If she doesn't, then maybe you guys have more issues than just cleanliness.<br>  However if you want her gone then you need to sincerely tell her you need her to leave, that you guys are just not working out. Give her time to make other living arrangements. (This is unless she is on the lease, then you might have other legal issues.)<br>  Best of luck|`|dlGZebDmaa	Just be honest. <br>  Tell her you want to live alone again.<br>  Tell her how you feel about this relationship.<br>  It's better to be honest and say it all at once (in a respectul way that is)<br>  Do it slowly and going around the bush won't help at all.<br>  This will bother her and she'll have time to get over it sooner than later.<br>  She'll respect the fact that you were honest.|`|7RbootLlaa	Tell her you are bi-sexual...oh wait, she might like that.

If she gets offended than just tell her to peace the hell out because at least you tried to be nice to begin with.

Then follow thru.|`|61067fedf264463ca62586a8d1d24170aa	Tell her that she's really nice and all, but you don't think that deciding to live together was a good choice. Say that you feel that things aren't working well and you think it's time for a change. Also say you still would like to be her friend.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, move out. hahah<br>  <br>  good luck :D|`|NUBeg2paaa	I thought your mother taught you to not call your woman a "pig".
NtSQcyHLaa	If he's running with you and looking at you like that, then obviously he's interested. So you should just talk to him and start something. It couldn't hurt. Or you could wait a while (like a couple weeks or so) and see if he makes the first move.|`|8TDnfCkaaa	I say talk to him. Just be yourself. If you aren't yourself, then you'll always have to act fake around him so its easiest to let him know exactly what type of person you are from the get go.|`|OjTejQc6aa	U should try and talk to him!! he seems like he really likes you so dont be afraid to say hi or start a conversation with him!!|`|e2i7KRnUaa	Flirt with him|`|OuT9fMiTaa	start talkin to him if you like him alot b4 someone else comes ur way to take him away|`|yuwjQjKqaa	I think he likes you and you should talk to him.|`|hc9deZ7aaa	definitely talk to him, if you really feel you can't then while your running beside each other pretend you have hurt yourself, if he likes you he will want to help, that will get the ball rolling for you.

Eo8I3fbnaa	Its going to be hard to overcome being shy. How are people suppose to know you are fun & crazy if you are hiding behind a wall. Maybe join some groups where the chance of making friends is higher. But you have to make the 1st step. You have to start talking.|`|Oxwi4YbUaa	i'm totally the same way. but you have to put yourself out there and go up and talk to people. not like interrupt conversations, but before class, if someone's just sitting there, ask them a question or give them a compliment.|`|4itrD0tzaa	lol i used to be the same way,  u just need to break out of ur shell.  It seems REALLY hard but just dont worry wat ppl think.
t2R3mEMoaa	It really will not matter what you say if she is not interested. If you think she may be, then say what truly comes from your heart, naturally. It has been my experience that preplanned words never work out. There are just to many variables involved at any one given moment. Be spontaneous.|`|csLpCzFtaa	Say you like talking to her and she's interesting.  <br>  <br>  Eventually, if you think she responds well to this, you can say you will miss her and ask her what she's doing over the weekend.|`|AA11899313	'No'.  The rumour that the 'One size fits all' type of thing you want exists, is not true.  It is a fallacy.<br>  <br>  What you want would depend upon the Girl, and on the Class at the time you chose to speak, surely?<br>  <br>  Sash.|`|0ktcvglRaa	"Hey, are you from heaven?

I really do think you are pretty.|`|bCRy9vY0aa	you look really pretty today|`|xnIwI00daa	I really don't think there is anything to say that "will completely work no matter what." It really depends on the girl - what she prefer in a guy.<br>  <br>  For an example, if you write this friend of mine an attempted romantic poem in dedication to her telling her about how you really feel about her, she will swoon! <br>  <br>  But, that tactic won't work with some of my other friends. They starts to gag if they ever receive any of those things. <br>  <br>  based on this girl that you like, determine what type of things she likes. <br>  <br>  Romantic, comedic, sweet, serious, straightforward?<br>  <br>  It really depends.<br>  <br>  You can just walk straight to her and say, "Hey, I just want you to know that I like you and would you be my girl friend?"<br>  <br>  Or...you can be someone who declare in the middle of the class how you feel about her...<br>  <br>  ETC.... There's no specific ways since every girls has their very own preference.<br>  <br>  I myself, prefer the guy just to be casual. I really don't like fancy stuff.... I ESPECIALLY HATE flattery. Doesn't really work with me. But it works with some others I guess.|`|nZcSOxB5aa	in my opinion, one of the things that girls like the most is being called cute or pretty. if she randomly starts acting cute you should laugh and say, "wow you're so cute" or something.<br>  <br>  one thing: don't call girls hot. girls usually hate it and think that the guy who said it is a pig. so no matter how "smokin" you think she is, don't call her hot. beautiful is sooo much better.|`|5bGlDr5Baa	well if u play any sports, then invite her 2 1 of ur games or something, but if she has a bf, then wait. dont sabotage or anything like that cuz it wont work (trust me on this i ended up having to go 2 a 7 year old's birthday party when i tried that no joke).  or if its just u and her and nobody is rlly paying attention 2 u 2 then compliment her on something somebody else hasnt noticed like say her hair looks rlly good 2day or if she has a necklace tell her it looks good on her|`|zkRcTXckaa	I think alone time in places can help. Like, ask her to come help you buy a new shirt r summit... that gets you's alone. Then go for like coffee or whatever.. and have some 'intimate' chats. Be INTERESTED in her! LISTEN to her, and LAUGH at her jokes.!<br>  <br>  Best of luck buddy!|`|O0MEdyKfaa	Im not sure and im a girl and i would rather a boy give me something romantic like something she can take with her like a teddy bear or flowers because you might slip up when youre talking to her so giving her something is better.|`|LZslebpiaa	just be yourself - smile and look her in the face and tell her how beautiful her eyes are - how happy she always makes you when you see her etc<br>  <br>  ie - not that you have an erection or want sex!|`|3tXg9NSbaa	if you wanna ask her out just tell her that shes beautiful and that you would really like to take her out
yuwjQjKqaa	You should ask him about the stuff you found.|`|0ktcvglRaa	What did you find in his room?|`|2nc9k9BSaa	1. Why would you look through his room in the first place? That's not really any of your business..<br>  <br>  2. Confront him about it, but don't involve any your feelings. Just say that you saw certain things in his room, whatever it was, and you'd just like to have your questions answered. But keep it simple and direct. Don't ask for details.<br>  <br>  3. If he fesses up, it's your choice whether to forgive him or dump him.<br>  <br>  4. And hey, if he did it with another girl, it's HIS life too.|`|lgMZJQtwaa	well, what did you find in his room because that will help me.

I'd break it off with him because if he's done it once, he'll do it a hundred times. And if you give in to him, he'll still do it with others, trust me.|`|9GmrHmyuaa	um... if he "did it" with another girl, talk to him about it. you'll know, even if he doesn't tell you. you will see the guilt in his eyes. it sounds like he just wants one thing and one thing only and we both know what that is...|`|zwpJCdrJaa	Talk to him about it straight forward. if he loves you he wouldn't cheat on you. You can handle the truth just talk to him.|`|LsW1id7oaa	If you're 100% sure he did it with some other girl, you got played, break up with him.|`|UwtXmgtUaa	ask him if he did it. if he didnt let it go you will figure it out later if he did or not|`|OcxVkWUBaa	do him and see what happens|`|VahEkjUcaa	well do u knoe the ather grul ask her or dump him its gunna be hared as heck but u dont want to be played..

SjFiTnmdaa	Maybe tell him....For right now i think we should be just friends. And you dont really like him like that you just like him as a friend and you are trying to be mean and to make him feel kind of happy say maybe sometime we can try dating but i am not ready now. Also maybe ask him out to a movie but just as friends and nothing nothing at all more.|`|HOVvKqxsaa	let him down gently and alone|`|eJvlZZeNaa	i am 12... but trust me on this i have had to let down a ton of guys... that sounds bitchy but true. you want to DEFINITELY say sorry and i don't want to risk our friendship over a relationship or some crap like that.<br>  hope i could help!!<br>  <br>  xoxo,Emily

5Xo1qp8Daa	Say LISTEN MOTHER ****** STOP SMOKING OR NO MORE PUNANI|`|z9ey2Uqkaa	Leave him.  you are growing up and putting things like smoking weed behind you.  he isn't.  You can't make him quit for you, you need him to want to quit and he doesn't.<br>  Its not just about the weed you are noticing that he isn't advancing in maturity the way you are.  This is only going to get worse over time.  <br>  End it now like tearing off a bandage.  Do it fast and get it over with so you can move on.|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	You know, I don't smoke weed, and I have always thought it was a bad thing to be involved in.  But, you know, if you two got together and were doing it, then so be it.  If you chose to not do it anymore, and you love him dearly obviously.  Just let it be, let him know, you aren't going to try and stop him from it.  Just ask him not to do it around you.  Ask for that much in return.|`|A9AurTy3aa	What exactly is it that you don't like about the weed. Is it the negative health effects, the way he acts when he smokes, or the hazy smell and suffocation from the smoke.<br>  <br>  Its a tough question but if he won't quit for you and you are sure you really want to quit then I would leave him.|`|hFr004olaa	He knows how you feel about the weed, then what's the point of explaining it to him over and over again. It will only make the two of you quarrel. He seems stubborn and won't quit that easily. Just go with the flow and see how your relationship goes. If it's really bugging you that much then move on. If he deeply cares about you, he'll find a way to quit.|`|Xel3S1W5aa	Sacrifice is important in relationships. If it bothers you a lot then I think you should sit him down and tell him that it really hurts you that he's doing this. Just be really honest. And tell him it would mean a lot to you if he would work in stopping. If he isn't willing to try for you then is it worth it? <br>  On the other hand, maybe he could just do it less, and you could sacrifice by dealing with it. <br>  Just communicate with one another, just tell him how you feel from the heart.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :]|`|UBFGCvVOaa	You need to ask yourself if this is a dealbreaker, because as much as we want sometimes, we can't change other people.  The most you can do is explain this to him and try not to nag him to quit, because that will most likely just make him starting smoking behind your back.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|xRKs5vseaa	omg i have the same problem with  a guy i luv too..and i told him and u should tell ur bf to stop wat is he gonna gain by smoking weed ....he might get more weed but he is going to loose a very special person in his life that actually cares about him !|`|X3GjiecGaa	oh screw it sweetheart weed is about to be legalized anyways so just let the man smoke its not like its goiong to kill him if it interferes with ur persoanl life sooo bad then just leave the dudee|`|yqWXJMO9aa	tell him to stop or it's over........forever|`|UXPyQTfMaa	"stop smoking weed *****" or break up with him. done|`|eDlxp0n2aa	me or the drug- jimmy eat world. pretty much sums it up|`|6mpfxYwmaa	tell him how you feel..if he cares for you and wants to make you happy, then he'll stop. if not, he's not worth it|`|wnOAxQcoaa	tell him u find a REAL man if he does not stop|`|3f04d9ffb6ff4f3a0291d329acc40e45aa	Well hon my husband and i have been together for a little over five years and to this day he still smokes weed.

But then i can't handle him being pissed all the time. I tell him all the time don't do it for me do it for our children, cause he knows he isn't aloud to have that stuff anywhere and our house he has to have it some place else...|`|uVBrBGh1aa	you answered yourself when you said you love him to much to let weed get in the way.  i dont think you should give up on your relationship nor try to make him quit.  i think you should make sure he doesnt buy weed instead of important things that you need.  i just think he will quit when he's ready,  if your still around then cool but if you leave him i would hope it would be for bigger reasons, like if he was spending the rent money on weed i could see getting fed up and leaving, but not because of the habit alone.   either way its your life, you gotta figure out what you want to get out of it and what you want in it.  good luck|`|SjFiTnmdaa	Tell him to not be dumb and even no you did it that it doesnt make it right. Tell him i dont wanna leave you its just i dont like that you smoke weed. Maybe tell him can you even cut back at all maybe only smoke once a week. Witch probably wont be that bad right, right.

Pick a good time and nicely tell him that you don't like him doing it and  ask him to quit. If he really loves you and cares about you, he will quit. If it is not getting in the way of your relationship, it shouldn't really be a problem, unless you really want him to stop.|`|5tmU8cbAaa	Just tell him what you feel. If he really cares, he should listen and value your opinion. Give him reasons why, the same reasons why you stopped. Hopefully, if your completely honest, he will stop. Good luck!|`|pIMXHktGaa	Well if you really love him that much then i guess thats just a decision you have to make on your own... but just keep in mind that weed is an illegal drug, your boyfriend can get put in jail if caught and you might even be at risk as well. What if he was high and then attempted to drive you somewhere in his car and got into an accident? Its addicting so even if he wanted to stop for you it would be very hard, but if you want to stay with him just keep in mind the risks you are putting onto yourself.|`|ADP9swbMaa	If he's not ready and doesn't want to give it up, he's not going to give it up. Trying to change people usually isn't worth the effort. <br>  Just something to think about.|`|MQVmh5hiaa	I think that you should dump him because it's not good that you around that enviornment like that.|`|0ER34nnqaa	UHOH CALL THE FUZZ..|`|chZFmJOPaa	Yeah that is tough, its hard to date someone who is real into that when you arent.

I know that well.|`|zGZe0mt8aa	i don't smoke but let me tell you that isn't that easy to stop suddenly something you use to do, you said that you love him why don't you just  ask him not to smoke around you.maybe that will help a little but if he really want to be with you he will listen to what you are saying maybe just give him time.|`|laOQ1OAQaa	Just be assertive about, express your true feelings, if your trying to quit and fly right tell him that he isn't helping you, if he truly loves you he will give it up for you, just make sure your assertive and sure of your feelings when telling him.|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	agreed with the first answerer<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306154348AA6IiN6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a> <br>  answer anyone?|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	It's amazing how many people here support drugs.<br>  <br>  If he continues to smoke, you're doing damage to yourself as well, physically and mentally. Might be best to leave if he values his weed more than you..|`|5yATLJi3aa	Eventually the police will take care of the matter if he chooses not to.|`|hh403SkVaa	just say if it doesnt stop, im gone. <br>  <br>  or if you dont love me enough to stop smoking, u dont deserve me|`|CVWizvy6aa	You have to be determined in what you do. That is how you can control your relationship. First, do not, I repeat, DO NOT put up with anything that is below your standard. I hate to say it, but he does not respect you or care for you enough to stop. You told him once, or maybe more than once. But he did not stop.<br>  <br>  Stand your ground. Give him a bad consequence when he does you wrong. After all, he's going to keep doing it if nothing bad happens.  <br>  <br>  My final advice: Tell him ONE more time that you would like him to stop. Give him a consequence.  You can approach him by saying something like:  I really care about you, that is why I'm telling you this. I don't want drugs to be a part of my life, and YOU are a part of my life.  IF you care about my feelings then you would stop.  If you dont stop, I don't think you are ready of what i have to offer.  I need some time alone to think things over. If you are ready for a serious relationship I'll just be a call away. If you are not, I' have to let you go. <br>  <br>  I know you love him alot. But you can do better. You have to be strong and stand your ground. If he truly care for you, he will stop. If he does not-I think you have some serious thinking and reconsideration to do.<br>  <br>  I was in the exact situation. That was how i dealt with it. My guy stopped smoking weed.  He is now a wonderful boyfriend. Good luck. And remember to stay strong.
2nc9k9BSaa	1. There's no set "speed" as to which a relationship should go. That's just baloney.<br>  <br>  2. Whatever speed you and your person are completely comfortable with.

This can be described as the boy modeling or in essence mimicking what you are doing. Maybe their feet are pointed toward you, or in the same direction as yours. Cracking knuckles after you, etc...<br>  <br>  Sign #3: Eye contact. You will catch him sneaking a peek at you, or even making full on eye contact. Have fun with it.<br>  <br>  Sign #4: Grooming. Boys like to impress. While he is talking to you, does he smooth his hair, or touch his face to make sure nothing odd is there? <br>  <br>  There are certainly more ideas out there, but you just need to get a feel for him.<br>  And make sure he isn't overly sweet, or making intense eye contact with EVERYONE. Because if he is, he's just a good guy, and might not be interested in you like that just yet.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :]|`|9QyrW2iCaa	He may not actually come out and tell you that he likes you.  You'll just have to keep chatting it up and see where it goes.  Just keep smiling and talking to him and see where it goes!  Sounds fun!  = )|`|XwMn6aY5aa	just keep on saying hi..or flirt a little<br>  or tell your friend to invite him over and you guys can talk and see what you guys have in common and just wait til he say's something to you..good luck!|`|NeBDl4Hfaa	You should sit down and talk to him sometime.  See what he thinks about you, strike up a conversation about anything it doesn't really matter.|`|NtSQcyHLaa	Just talk to him and continue what you're doing. Believe me, you'll know when he likes you. He'll show interest in you above his and your other friends, he'll go out of his way to talk to you and make sure that you're comfortable, and he'll try to make you laugh. And if he seems to not care about those things, then he probably doesn't see you like that. If you really want to tell him that you like him, wait a while to find out that he likes you first, that way you're not let down if he doesn't feel the same way. Best of luck on it, though!|`|GPAidQs1aa	It seems to me that you don't should get to know him a lot better. Guys adapt to girls when they hang out with them more. If you hang out with him or even just have a nice conversation with him i am sure he will be into you in no time and always remember to be your self! hope this helps give me some feedback<br>  xoxorissixoxo|`|XyVnWc4zaa	Haha, by the way he acts around you and your friend it sounds like he likes you.  But you don't know completely.  :]  It sounds like you two are friends, though.  Don't wait for him or he might find another girl he likes!  Don't worry and just GO FOR IT!  But talk to him first, so you can get a better idea if he likes you or not.  ~good luck~|`|dQSjnDvBaa	its possible that he likes you. you should probably wait a while and see if he sends you any more signs. if so, then tell him|`|7ASuOIUpaa	I think you should tell him that you like him because then he would be less shy to tell you if he likes you :]|`|0mwpAxfRaa	Wait for him to make the first move. It can take a while esp if he's younger but it's better that way.|`|N6yyU2iaaa	talk to him for a while and c what he is like near u|`|pkUkIQoEaa	i ithnk we gonna need chris hansen over here yo|`|ojwRgCLqaa	You know if he likes you if he flirts with you or if he up front tells you. I don't think you should tell him you like him yet. Get to know him a little more, talk to him. You don't necessarily need to wait for him to tell you. I'd just wait till you both know each other more. He might like you now or just be being nice. take your time. What's the rush?|`|rMuWsjRWaa	Try to get your friend to find out. That's what friends are for right?  Lol.  If he likes you, then go out.
nkiwlf7Paa	You can vidoetape as long as there is no sound , alternatley, you can have sound, but no audio - combining them without someones prior knowledge is illegal, but if it's only video, and there's a sign posted somewhere that there are cameras on the grounds - it should be fine - private investigators do this kind of stuff all the time.
GWRP3vLQaa	I think there are many women who find sex less than it is cracked up to be. And many women who find some aspects of sex not appealing because it has no connection to what really pleases a woman. What does please a woman is individual to each woman. <br>  <br>  One thing you can do is talk to her and find out what she actually does like and work with her from there. <br>  <br>  Movie sex, where a lot of people get their education these days, makes oral sex and other acts seem like basic requirements, while in reality, a some people just don't get that much out of it. <br>  <br>  Don't assume you know everything there is to know about sex and how to please a woman. And DON'T hound her for sex. That is probably the greatest mistake men make when it comes to sex.<br>  <br>  Talk to you wife. Respect her opinions, and let her know that you love her more than you want to do her.|`|oauYuhvDaa	Sexual Aversion Disorder is something you may want to look up.  It's more common than people think because it's hard to admit.<br>  There is help for it...if that is the problem.  Don't give up on her.  She likely doesn't want to be this way.<br>  Good luck to you.|`|yULnOJUwaa	Could it be your techniques?  <br>  Consider a sex therapist.
AfnQ95Z5aa	Without sex it's just a friendship, not a relationship.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Yes. I don't want to be with someone who doesn't satisfy me.|`|cMrieID4aa	Sex is a gift. Sex isn't needed for a healthy relationship, nor is it necessary to keep it healthy. It is simply a way to express how you feel about someone and form a bond, but the same stuff can be accomplished without sex.<br>  <br>  As said, sex is a gift. If you give it out too much to too many people, the one meant to have it in the end gets less of the gift. So, give the gift with caution.|`|Df3EdAynaa	Ofcourse it is not. i am not an adult, i am only saying it is not. GOD says to refrain from sexual activity. u do not need sex to be in love with ur partner; sex is infact cheap let me tell u. opening ur clothes, what nonsense. u can love ur partner by appreciating who they r. not by taking ur clothes of and entering the penis in the vagina with something cheap called "sex"|`|c9ef9f6a7f9912c790ef88395bc2d81caa	well at a certain point i think it is! if your dating for a short period of time u dnt think its necessary unless u wanna hit it and quit it|`|dB2uMDb5aa	yes but only if you or in love|`|akimNXn5aa	Personally I don't think so. Sex complicated things in my relationship all we did was have sex talk about it and soon all other conversations were boring until we got to talking about sex again I got bored cause I need someone to be there mentally too not just physically . So we broke up because of sex
zzaScg0haa	I have no idea what you are saying here, and the cap locks don't help
2dESDCBnaa	i have the EXACT problem! like i like some1 then when they like me and talk to me and stuff its SUPER awkward cuz im really self concious and i get realllllly nervousss!!!! i think u should just pretend like u are best friends and just talk to them in a normal way (be yourslef) dont plan out what ur gonna say just sorta say hi hows it going what class do u have next etc... the more u practice the better ull get!!!! good luck girly!|`|KhyPqoFIaa	Hello i am the surfer!<br>  <br>  From a guy perspective i was nervous and shy around women during the year previous to last year from high school because i came from a transfer from an only boys school and now (then) i found myself lacking the necessary set of skills to go around women <br>  <br>  But over time i get little by little less shy around girls, by the time i hit college i can start conversations around women!<br>  <br>  Get conversation openers <br>  Go with another women like your best female friend when she is talking to other guys, that way you would be familiar with guys around more, then you can go solo<br>  <br>  Talk to a guy and be around him and other guys will follow suit<br>  <br>  Ask another female friend advice about how to talk with guys and then ask a  guy how to talk to another guy <br>  <br>  Go to www.askmen.com and read first date tips and conversation openers is great source of info!<br>  <br>  There you go<br>  <br>  From the surfer!|`|FkB3jQzWaa	just look into their eyes, smile, and talk slow.that way when you think your talking slow your actually talking normal lol.
SFUM3Jgvaa	Uhhh there was no question here...
FZKFLTyLaa	Perhaps the best thing to have done -it's rather too late now - would have been to ask her what SHE would like to do on the date. And really, take her home. She's a drag and just not interested!!
zzaScg0haa	It seems like he is insensitive
qRzbOMYGaa	Take it from someone that knows.  Don't just ask her out randomly, she barely knows you.  Just sort of start talking to her, and find out what she likes.  Then look for flirting examples.  Then when you feel comfortable and you think she does too, ask her out.|`|wf7V6MZ4aa	Before you ask her out you at least have to a conversation with her. Talk to her, find out what shes into, make her laugh, etc.|`|ubAPZjp5aa	Just make casual conservation first get to know her better
THiWa3Imaa	hey =]<br>  i have kinda the same problem. like i have this friend and we have been texting EVERYNIGHT for like...3 weeks. and when i say every night, i mean like everynight, from like 10ish to 11:30/12 sometimes even 1. haha anyway, we are really expressive through texts..its serious stuff...but when we get to school we only joke around and stuff and its kinda wieerd cause i like him and never know what to say. so i guess we just have to wait it out, ya know? like everyday i just tell myself to be more outgoing and just BE. i hope you understand|`|UinOWcMUaa	Give it some time, and be patient !|`|bmhT1IrTaa	does he know how you feel? make sure he knows and make sure you take things slow at first. make yourself standout compared to other girls, be different and vibrant. show him that your the girl for him (if you really think you are) and think positive. come out of that shy shell that you put yourself in, act comfortable around him. <br>  hope things work out for ya|`|P4ODtQ9xaa	try find stuff to talk about like how was ur day? anything new? find something in u both like and talk about it can u answer my question plz <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ar1ONDaKLesxTJlIH9kosnnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306175125AAoCtqb">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
uNJirnYoaa	She is, in my opinion the second most beautiful woman on the planet.  Right after Adriana Lima.<br>  <br>  I think everything about Frieda Pinto is beautiful, she has a very pretty smile, beautiful eyes, a nice body, and from what i can tell by seeing her on TV and interviews a very kind girl|`|8SRjELNBaa	because she's hot... she's not too dark.|`|AOkucu5haa	I think Freida's quite pretty. <br>  <br>  "she's kinda dark too."<br>  <br>  Oh, how charming! That doesn't sound utterly ignorant in the least. [/sarcasm]|`|jdNisPl2aa	becuz shes hot and do i detect somebody being a little racist? I think she's hot but i think UR mean
ZQxCcG6qaa	talk to your parents. tell them a boy you really like asked you out and rather then sneak around with him you wanted to talk so that they know they can trust them. also ask them for a compromise. ask if they will Consider letting you date this boy if they meet him and the first couple dates are supervised....dinner at your house followed by a rented movie?<br>   this will show your parents that you respect their wishes by asking them and show that you're responsible enough not to sneak about.<br>  <br>  define boundaries with both your parents and the boy if your parents agree. your parents if they don't want you dating aren't going to want you to do anything people are dating do. kissing..etc.<br>  <br>  holding hands and appropriate snuggling...like leaning against a shoulder are Ok PDA infront of parents. i wouldn't try and kiss when your parents are around.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|FAyWGjUPaa	Either A:<br>  Keep it a secret and only hang out at school<br>  B:<br>  Tell him you can't date...<br>  C:<br>  Talk to your parents hon <br>  maybe if you talk to them about whats going on <br>  they will be a little understanding :)<br>  <br>  I have the same problem...<br>  I'm 16 and still not allowed to date DX<br>  but...I date anyway...<br>  just go places in a group with your friends and invite him :)<br>  maybe your parents would be a little more lenient if you were with a group of people and not just 1 on 1. <br>  I mean...technically its not a "date" unless it's 1 on 1, right?|`|d9mhyVmSaa	You shouldn't think of whether you are allowed to date or not because you should ask yourself whether you like this guy or not. If you like this guy and this guy like you too, why give up the chance where you 2 like each other over this ' not allowed to date ' ?|`|CdZK7XjOaa	Yea im not allowed to date either. If i were you i would date him and keep it a secret and when you can date or convince your parents you can, then you tell them. Well thats what im doing.<br>  <br>  :) Good Luck!!|`|zRBKZtT1aa	I would say don't do it. I wasn't allow to date til I was 18yrs. old. You would also be breaking your parents rule. Just hang out with him at school. It wouldn't hurt to go to the prom with him.|`|1ZNNKY2uaa	i get to date i am 11 but if my mom would not let me date i would i love to know if i get in to a fight i have a boy to back me up but do not try to lie just keep on asking|`|XU1fftrMaa	Just stay friends.

If you don't want to go out with him then telling him you're not allowed to date yet is the perfect excuse.|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	say no OR sneek out OR go out with him in SECRET!|`|uRbeSOMwaa	how old are you..?
3MmVWDT3aa	You don't...<br>  She is taken.<br>  RESPECT IT! :P
OauZKhKVaa	Sit on top of him, either facing him or away from him (the former usually stimulates the clit better so I prefer it) and rock your hips front and back. You'll get the hang of it once you're up there! You could also watch a few videos online if you wanted a better idea of what some people do. Don't forget to use protection!|`|E7TkNO00aa	You don't know what sex is.|`|8SRjELNBaa	why don't you try a simple google search..... that should answer your questions......|`|vyHrvt0Zaa	You don't lie on him completely. It's like you're ridding a horse. You put you legs on both sides and rid away. Up and down, back and forth, bend over him and kiss him, grab his hands and put them to your breasts giving him something to do.

062dcebc0cae227b915e6808bf0dcd18aa	That he can wait till you are feeling comfortable with having sex with him. Just ask him to be sure.|`|e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	That he is OK with you not being ready.|`|HCf73ZsEaa	Yeah he is fine waiting, but really he wants you to do it. But take your time, don't rush no matter the pressure.
0bYcYz2jaa	Only by being yourself and being loved for who you really are, will you be happy.  If you change for someone, they don't like you, they like what you might become.  If you are talking about someone who is a "friend with benefits", then you really don't have very solid ground to try to attract them to a relationship.  If you try, don't be surprised if it takes a long time.  Most people cannot see the good in front of their faces, they take those nearest to them for granted.|`|pWER972Yaa	welcome to the neighborhood!   just tell them you like him thats the only way,trust me there is no other way than talking.

And get off the computer, too!<br>  <br>  If you're only 11 (and live in the U.S.) it's way past your bedtime! If I were your babysitter, I'd make you get undressed, give you your bath, dress you in your pj's and send you right to bed!<br>  <br>  If she's really getting undressed and walking around the house naked, all you really have to do is hide all her clothes, secretly call your parents and tell them there's an emergency and that they have to come home right away. They'll walk in and catch her naked.|`|U1pMvDvgaa	No, she was probably just too hot and had to take her clothes off to cool down, that is natural.|`|FHrQzaPqaa	YES you need to tell your parents.|`|5135834c90cc2c12523172c90a0e1a7eaa	hahaha. you have amazing punctuation for being 11.<br>  <br>  no 11 yr old boy would see this as a problem...|`|d9mhyVmSaa	You're only 11, boy.

T1vgsbyKaa	The simple explanation is...your nervous! Everyone gets nervous around the person that they like so its okay and normal. If it really bothers you, I would try to make a joke about it, or just try to laugh it off.

If you aren't uncomfortable talking about it then go for it.|`|IFd94XDkaa	Not something I'd bring up in casual conversation.  I would wait till the relationship hit fairly serious status.|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	Only if he asks or if the subject is brought up. As much as I would wanna know it would seem weird for a girl to just randomnly say hey guess what...I'm a virgin. So I recomend just waiting until he asks, the subject gets brought up, or you think you may be gonna have sex with him.<br>  <br>  Man I wish people had to wear a sign saying things like "virgin, slut, a little promiscuous, etc" That would make life so simple.|`|65960a4770fc3571b7f8bfa49f7590feaa	a girl that is a real virgin usually wont tell you she is a virgin untel the actual moment. if a girls keeps braging about being a virgin is because she isnt and just want you to think she is so that you will sleep with her thinking you are the first|`|cV0Z8d94aa	yeah i guess but only if like they have been on a few dates and the subject comes up<br>  but no they should not be like"hey thats for picking me up, btw i am a virgin"|`|rLvOOuPhaa	II don't get why not?<br>  <br>  Help?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApIEGZpdMHJwdFbvAMu6w8jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306171426AAZ9mEA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|HCf73ZsEaa	No, as it has been said, none of their business.

If you are going on dates, you want the focus to be on building a connection.  You don't want to focus on sex.  A guy may be perfectly happy with you, and if you mention that you are a virgin it could have undesirable effects on the growing relationship.  You shouldn't mention it until you feel a real connection to the guy and would consider having sex with him.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Not unless you are planning on having sex and you think they should know beforehand.
AA12159712	Just as a casual warning to him that you may not have too much experience, but you're willing to learn if he'd be gentle and kind enough to give some instruction.|`|AA10746669	No, definitely not.  If you get in a relationship, and time goes by you may say this, but not in the beginning.|`|9TAHh7tjaa	it depends
JWV2J8Gfaa	Your ages would help answer this question. But generally when he said he likes you back .. was it awkward or forced or did he seem like he genuinely meant it? <br>  <br>  If he seems like he meant it then it might be that he is talking with another girl or he just isn't ready to take things to the next level.<br>  <br>  Talking to his brother was a bad idea, because even if you really did want to find out, showing neediness is a big turnoff. If you really wanted to know that bad just ask him... or start hanging out with him and slowly doing things that might seem more couple orientated.|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	yeah. he seems to be concerned about why u were talking to his brother..i think he got a lil jealous.|`|23f7be6415d7965c88f38a51d089c640aa	YOU ARE RUNNING FAST THAT IS REASON THAT ACCIDENT MAY HAPPEN.

I mean, if he is jealous of his brother, what else could it be?|`|TmzyWXqPaa	he might like you or he could of just got upset because you went behind his back and was talking to his brother and took it the wrong way people get upset over things like that...like he might of thought it was not your place to ask his bro but i dont know im like that|`|WKBVrHhbaa	Sounds like a boy who just doesn't know that he should be calling and or when.<br>  How old are you?<br>  <br>  Him getting upset over you talking to his brother means he got a little jealous..which means he does like you.|`|3ROdgg8Taa	he probably doesnt like u anymore sorry hon. 4 future reference: never ever go to the crush's family members for information..thats rtarded and  u just should wait 4 him to make a move...:l|`|KGcLnxO9aa	yea if hes getting that upset about him thinking your getting with his brother than he does like you. just tell him that you were tying to figure out why he wasnt calling you|`|HCf73ZsEaa	He got jealous which means he likes you. He is probably just shy.|`|E0gcH9Jsaa	if he didn't he would have not got mad
fZkFgYDmaa	I think you should tell her before anymore problems start. then if she gets more clingy because she wants to work things out, ignore her. She can be messing up you life and it is going to be much harder if you keep talking to her. leave her alone and said you moved on. tell her the past is the past and you want to keep moving forward.
wO8yECYqaa	if you like him, tell him!!!! a chance is a chance girl! love is meant to be here if he likes you, and you like him!!!! but about the embarresment.... i'm quite a quiet girl normally, so i know how you feel with that. hmn.... i usually try to think of something funny or happy, and if i start to laugh i think of something really sad. Helikes you|`|wFBaJUwIaa	I think so. I'm not sure about where you guys stand in the school obviously. Like if you are popular and he isn't. But i know for sure when I was in high school and I liked a "popular girl" I was SOOOO shy and like never wanted to talk to her because I didn't want to blow it and stuff. But you should make a move for him. He sounds like a cool guy waiting to come out of his shell!|`|P4ODtQ9xaa	HELL YEA he likes u i should know and guy did that to me ( i hated him) if u like him back then go for it can u answer my question plz <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ar1ONDaKLesxTJlIH9kosnnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306175125AAoCtqb">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|35pHRf2caa	ask him can you get his numbers.|`|2kIoIhqyaa	He totally likes you. Just talk to him, your being a pansy.|`|cubhDLkWaa	A lot of boys act like that when they like a girl. Do you like him?
DDVTjan8aa	uhm take her on a non pressure date like ice skating, or something like that, where if she wants it to feel like a date she can, but then it can be just two people hanging out if she doesnt.<br>  and if, this is a big IF, it does feel like a date, and the feeling is just RIGHT, ask her in a cute way to kiss her <br>  (okay i'm going off by what i would be comfortable with me [i havent dated anyone either] so yeah make it fun and non awkward and i think it'll work out how its suppose to)
hCJzZ5rnaa	He's beginning to limit the frequency of his glances towards you, because he thinks that you're catching on (which you are) and doesn't want to seem weird. That is all.<br>  <br>  You know, you could bring all this to a happy end if you just go and ask him out or something. I know it is easier said than done, but don't make the same mistake I did and just end up throwing away the attraction between you and this other person. I did it to another girl, and I still kick myself everyday in frustration, "Why didn't I just make a move?" You will feel similar if you don't take action!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TkgVGbj5aa	I know what you mean you can't help but to like someone back if they like you, that is what is going on in his mind he has very confused emotions he can't stop thinking about you, but he likes someone else too.
dFmZhtpvaa	well here's a poem<br>  dreaming of you makes my night worth while,<br>  thinking of you makes me smile,<br>  having you is the best thing ever,<br>  loving you is what i plan to do...forever|`|PJZRGsc3aa	corny lol|`|35neO5IJaa	ahaha just add smiley faces and winks ( ;] ) at the end of some of the texts. its kinda florty without being too over the top.|`|eTm9uLqyaa	Imma bite you like Edward Cullen, so you can be with me foreverr.
NiirnVYXaa	i think you should forget about him. ignore him for awhile until he talks to you. if he doesn't ever contact you then move on. i don't think it's really worth it. you can find someone soo much better.
AA11312719	I don't want to judge you but you are WAY too young to be involved in anything like this. I'm not saying that you are naive or anything but most girls your age don't understand that when older guys say "I'm really into you" "I love you" and things like that they don't always mean it. You should be more careful because this could end very badly if you put your all in this relationship and he does not really feel the way he claims he does. I also agree that you should talk to your mom about this...|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Yes.  You are in no way ready for the emotional consequences of what you did.  Go talk to your mother before you end up with a yeast infection.|`|4VN9nmPAaa	You pushed it too far. <br>  <br>  Most 16 year olds i know aren't emotionally ready for anything like that. <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't try to grow up too fast.|`|yOtUlfChaa	Back in the day it would have been fine if you were married and even further back it would have been ok even if you wont! Though today things have changed and there are many things you need to do before getting into that phase of your life. Even though it does mean to ignore who you are as a human. Trust me its best to wait as long as you can for its very unlikely you will end up with anyone your with now and most people I know including me are happier the less partners they have, no matter if its kissing or everything.|`|2YC8QGkEaa	Yes. You're tooooo young. At this rate, you'll end up pregnant or contract some kind of STD.<br>  <br>  The thing about fingering, you can get cuts by his nails and possibly get yeast infection. And who know what else he had touched before touching you.<br>  <br>  Also, you just LIKE him, and you're not in a relationship. Believe me, there's a BIG emotional age difference from middle school to highschool. He's a horny teenager and you're a naive little girl that could be easy to have sex with.<br>  <br>  Be careful now.
S3uLASLnaa	8th grade relationships aren't REAL. Anyways you are in the 6th, you don't need a boyfriend. And the age gap is two years, age doesnt matter, but you shouldnt be dating, so forget it.|`|AA12159712	Oh, and are you ready to take on a boy two years older than you already? I don't think so. Having gf/bf relationships as young as you are may seem cute. But what if this boy wants to do a little more than just kissy-huggy with you? Huh? Maybe he already knows a bit more about sex, enough to be dangerous and expects to feel you up or want oral sex or finger you. What then? Stay in your own age group and play with your girlfriends and just be friends with guys for now.|`|3Hg60esPaa	u should forget about him.<br>  it doesnt matter wat grade he is in.<br>  but he has a girl .<br>  maybe he thinks ur the hottest chick in ur school,<br>  but that doesnt mean he likes u.<br>  he would be wit u if he did so its most likely he odesnt and he is wit his girl cuz he likes her.<br>  and if he has a girl its better jus to leave him alone.|`|GwWAiH6Taa	okay....it does'nt matter what grade you're in if you're both in middle school. But you need to stop thinking about him like that if you know that he has a girlfriend. NOW!|`|mWn2JAOiaa	well i would stay friends with him because if you realy like this bot then you would not reck i good realtionship.<br>  i have done it before.|`|mcJBDBSbaa	just let them be im sure he loves his gf  and dont ruin that at ll that would be messed up of you|`|upQNVa4caa	u remind me of someone i know
VzzQP2PJaa	Well if you show him more so that you like him or you open up yourself by not being so shy then he might want to be more open to you too. But you should show more how you feel on the inside that usually is what helps a guy show his inner feelings. Hope this helped and hope things work out for you.|`|S3uLASLnaa	First of all, thats not love, its a crush or like relationship. Im guessing you are really young just starting out as teens perhaps? Just give him time and he'll feel comfortable with you.|`|lbmFZkDSaa	kiss him !<br>  <br>  & see how he responds to that.<br>  <br>  that could open him up.<br>  <br>  if it doesn't then he's probably shy, but <br>  <br>  if he's really into you it should open him up<br>  <br>  & make him look forward to kissing you.|`|uTQCKQQ9aa	go out on dates Start talking in person  <br>  don't worry about the dating part look more into being friends and the rest will follow|`|6a23d4378fc62f24a25913afcd956609aa	make a move before its late! give him hints, u know flirt this and that! talk to him about it, about how much it bothers u!
6GB5P7ojaa	She has hurt you and your friend already. Stop being friends with her. You and your friend deserve someone who doesn't treat you like crap. Let time pass. Something good might come up|`|0WYCfpDHaa	ditch her, shes not a friend if she's gonna betray her friends|`|SxqYguUCaa	If she betrayed you and your other friend, WHY be her friend? How can you love someone who doesn't put any effort into not hurting you? This is going to be tough but you need to break it off with her.|`|FDq7fEZMaa	omg, im going through this too! <br>  i have some advice but i really dont wanna bore you.. <br>  email me at:<br>  <br>  brittany.kolb@yahoo.com|`|1Q7vREwzaa	Talk to her...|`|FZYCouSeaa	lol ummmm if she betrayed you badly then yes make her GTFO|`|cf61851ec33503b4ce6edb44b843b22aaa	Was it really a betrayal or miscommunication - misinterpretation or misjudgment. Of course yes, if it is not hard for enemies to be friends why not best friends.<br>  Give yourself a cool first and ones you have settled down your nerves, go and approach her and speak with her in a refined, friendly (patiently and calmly) manner and iron out things and peaceful manner.<br>  A prayer for peace might be helpful before you have a talk with her.<br>  You mean much to her and so does she to you.<br>  ps: bring a boxful of soft paper tissues.
OZbfhG50aa	you = ***|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Just do it, you aren't doing him any favors by pretending you still care. Set him free.|`|S3uLASLnaa	I know what you mean, me and my boyfriend have been together for one year and six months, but you have only been together for two months! It hasnt been a long time, just hang on for a bit and if you no longer have feelings for him, let him down easy.
RDgyb7W8aa	Are you sure he has cut all ties to his ex?  I am not meaning that he physically sees her.  But it appears that both are keeping emotional ties to each other.  As a man I would appreciate your trust but isn't he carrying it too far.  If you are going continue together he has got  to stop talking to her.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	He's angry because you didn't ask him and didn't take his word for it.  That means you don't trust him.  He should be angry.  You went snooping behind his back.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	But it IS a high school drama, sorry but it is ridiculous that she is still bugging him and that he responds, and that you allow this to go on. He's mad ?? What if the shoe was on the other foot and it was some ex of yours doing this etc. how would he feel ?? Also she did all that crap to further butt into your relationship. You need to put your foot down about this nonsense now. Trust or no trust, it isn't right what's going on.|`|ajKJcoBFaa	I THINK THAT YOU DONT HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT JUST TALK TO YOURE MANN AND MAKE SURE THAT HIS IN IT FOR YOU AND NOT FOR ANY OTHER WOMAN, AND THATS GOOD THAT YOU DONT CARE ABOUT THE EX CUASE SHES ALLWAYS A GOOD PERSON TO FIND ABOUT RELATIONS SHIPS BUT, DONT LET IT GET OUT OF HAND AND LET HER CALL AND CALL,  JUST TALK TO HER AND MAKE SURE THAT HIS IN IT FOR YOU AND NO ONE ELSE.<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|Rrsp3fWIaa	As long as someone keeps in contact with an ex, it will be a constant problem in your relationship.
dqbUp4nGaa	Who's the hottest?  Hard to say - y'all look pretty fine!  But I'll tell you this - no matter what a girl looks like, it's how she acts that really makes her hot.  And I don't mean being trampy or vampy - I'm talking about how she thinks of herself, what she's doing with her life, even if it's on a very small scale.  Looks get a man's attention (and vice versa for woman), but looks are NOT what keeps his attention.  (If he needs to date 3 women at a time, ain't nuthin' gonna keep his attention!)<br>  <br>  I don't know about payback, but I do know that what bothers people most is not being insulted or anything but simply being totally ignored.  Don't pretend you can't hear him if he's there in your face talking to you - answer him, but let your tone let him know that he completely bores you because he nuthin' more than dog ****.|`|b70cNqyqaa	Im not going to start a storm over which 3 of you is the hottest, you all 3 are very hot! But, can't you see why he likes all 3 of you? I mean, wow... he's got pretty good taste. How does he do it, how does he find time for all 3 of you?<br>  <br>  You all look pretty smart, I hope you go easy on him, at first...|`|3F8v8bgQaa	you're the hotter of the three, but the third girl is hot too. if you wanna get back at him just give me a call. i would help you
XiuBD5eCaa	nope but if he really liked you it wouldent be a secret u need to check that|`|gxFJMeY5aa	way is it a secret? that seems silly

fwLW0cUQaa	Yes I have the same issue, only its cuz of previous guys and i have a boyfriend now.But like u, i have a hard time opening up to him but i dont want to tell him about it. anyways, he kinda realizes something is up so he tries to get me to open up more, and i've been pushing myself to more and more and things are starting to get better.i suppose they would be even better if i would just tell him.but he is the first guy that i am trying to open up to, he is just the one i think. so u should find a guy who is really sweet and understanding and just try to push urself to open up to him slowly. just start with the little things like i would just be "indesisive"about things cuz i didnt want him to know me. but now, when he asks me something i try to make myself answer him with a real answer.
2C8tjiwLaa	I was in the same situation as you about 5 years ago my junior year of high school. Had a huge crush on a really cute girl in lab. I'm a pretty shy guy too, and this girl was waaaayyyy out of my league.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to try and get together for some homework or a review session. You can start meeting with other people at coffee shops or something. The key is getting to spend time with her outside of school, even if it's not one on one. This will make asking her out on a real date much much easier. Find out what she's interested in, and no matter what it is, even if you hate it, tell her you love it too. It'll be the easiest and most comfortable way for you to get more time with her.<br>  <br>  If it's getting towards graduation time you're gonna have to go out on a limb no matter how shy you are. There's nothing to loose because if it doesn't work out, you never have to see her again. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Oh and by the way, I've been dating that girl from lab for 4 and a half years now. It's only a matter of graduating from college before we tie the knot....|`|Okg1QD1Haa	Just talk to her - let her know how you feel about her|`|3Ff1WJ8iaa	Ok ONE, DO NOT do what Jess said...people don't like to be touched out of no where like that....Two, maybe act like you see a fuzzy in her hair, touch a lock of her hair and say "Oh nvm. hmm your hair looks nice" and be sure to smile.|`|FG8TKqbeaa	awww that is sooo cute. try droping somthing or have her drop something by mistake and get it for it, that is the sweetest thing you could do, hold her books. after class be nxt to her while she grabs her stuff take her book or something of her that she usually carrys in her hand and walk a littel ahead thats really sweet. yess yess do NOT touch her out of no where that is just weirdddddddddddddd. <br>  BE SWEET, IF YOU BOTH SHY YOU BOTH NEED TO BE SWEET. maybe after a while you could ask her to go chill with you or your friends|`|dhlfiK5Saa	just touch her arm when you say bye or something

My friend's like that and I know what you're saying.  Its tricky because people like that are so peppy and excited all the time that you can't tell if they're being sincere or not. (sometimes I want to shake her shoulders a bit and say, you can't possibly like everything!!  what don't you like!?) Yes, eye contact and body language is the way to go.  Is her body facing yours while she's talking to you?  Do you have her undivided attention?  Even then, its not fool proof, so yeah, just what you don't want to hear... just ask her out.  Yes, just casually ask her to have coffee or lunch with you to further discuss whatever it is that you strike up a conversation about that she seems interested in.  (Again, tricky because people like that try to show positive interest in practically everything)|`|l7g5JBEEaa	Ah these girls are tough because they are so friendly.  Even if you invite her to lunch she will say yes and that isn't going to answer your question.  So I would just ask her out and make a point for her to know it is a romantic date (not lunch) and see how it goes from there.  Just be upfront and honest with her and she will do the same to you|`|UuSmemr7aa	if she likes you, talk to her and see how she'll react.<br>  thats kinda like me and how i act but yeahh.<br>  it's either she'll get quiet and not know what to say or start blushing if you try to start a conversation with her<br>  ask her out, im sure she'll most likely to say yes(:|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	Just ask her if she'd like to hang out with you sometime.

Either way I don't care because I'm not into the bar scene.|`|JajEhcsUaa	I think married people should put out or stop being whiny noobs.|`|T9m0YQgFaa	if it's men that are there after 9pm to get laid...then it's men who should have a ban!|`|7gpHfFwUaa	lmao ..people-_-|`|nRcSFAxlaa	what are you talking about?|`|98LDN0Quaa	stuck in the 50's are we.|`|ABvnT9xKaa	So you're basically saying women can't be trusted and they're not smart. Cause, if you remember, women are WAY smarter in the relationship than guys are, and you can always trust the girl.|`|Z3GQYrtUaa	then married man also shouldn't go to bar after 9P.M so that this will be fair.|`|QFouNTa6aa	and u were serious? lmao|`|YR9l82vmaa	uhm, no. you can't just ban an entire part of the population from a public place after a certain time, because it would help YOU get laid.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	That's a good point. But the feminists would all cry discrimination.
QKfa1tYSaa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is very desperate there are girls at my school who do that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|XYBCQz8Naa	sometimes yes. sometimes its funny and amuses us haha. like if a chick keeps texting me and i dont like her, it gets quite annoying and i just ignore her then unless shes a good friend of mine
jJZNf1gTaa	We allll hate our grandparents from time to time. Dont worry.|`|qpmGLd7laa	I'm guessing you feel guilty about it or something.  Stop thinking of family as something special; people are people whether you're related to them or not.  If some stranger treated you that way, would you be worried about hating them?|`|0Uo20SmWaa	Don't say you hate anyone. You hate the way she treats you, but not her. Treat everyone with politeness and be kind. You can't change her, but just yourself.|`|XhtDtZK9aa	No I wouldn't hate her, and if you think about it you probably don't either. You hate what the person does,you don't hate them.You are not cruel, I think your just hurt. A Grandma shouldn't call you ugly,I would say gee Grandma I guess I take after your side and laugh it off.|`|AA10518697	Sounds like dementia. Or maybe she doesn't like the way you came about (doesn't like one of your parents). My grandma used to call me evil and mean. I just didn't pretend I liked stuff that I really didn't. She didn't like my cousin for years because she was born out of wedlock. Old people are crazy like that.|`|AA10757358	You don't hate people especially your grandma.  You may not like<br>  what people say or do but hate is a very strong word.  You love the person but hate what has been said or done.|`|txKnh4i5aa	I'm sorry to hear that she isn't nice to you.  My grandma was also too tough on us growing up and she LOVED my cousin, so I know what you're going through.  I find the best way to deal with it is to not take anything she says too seriously. Just remember, that she is not seeing things the way they really are.  We teasingly call it the 'smile and nod' principle, that is just politely respond but don't get too involved in all the family drama.  The less you interact with her at this point, the better.
Dga6TTr9aa	well just talk more|`|ptWHIVjZaa	Give her some space, physically, not all girls want to be smothered by you during a movie!  Communicate with her by, I dunno, maybe, crazy concept, talking???  It's hard to talk to somebody during a movie, meaning that she doesn't feel she  knows you very well, meaning she doesn't want to be incredibly close to you, especially if she's shy.  (You've no proof she's antisocial.  If she were antisocial, she'd stay at home instead of going to the movies.)  <br>  <br>  I'd also like to point out that you sound incredibly condescending toward her in this message.  You say, "shes [sic] totally antisocial" and she moved away until she "calmed down".  I think you're giving yourself too much credit here.  Just because she doesn't jump up and down at the thought of a date (for which she was probably nervous) you call her antisocial, and you assume that you were the cause of some sort of excitement that made her move away so she could "calm down".  It's far more likely that you were smothering her and she just wanted some space.  You then called her sister a "total freak".<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what the relevance is that her sister likes your friend, although if you want any chance with her, you better be nice to her twin and treat the both of them with respect.  If any guy were a jerk to my sisters, I'd drop them immediately, and I can only assume it's an even stronger bond with twins.<br>  <br>  To recap:<br>  a) get to know her better by conversing with her, try to give her some space physically when speaking with her<br>  b)  don't talk rudely about her behind her back<br>  c)  don't be a jerk to her sister, or be a jerk about her sister, because she will resent you for it, plus it isn't acceptable anyway<br>  <br>  P.S. It's not "getting" a girl.  Girls aren't possessions to be won, they are people with whom you can create a relationship just like with anybody else.|`|NzBjnqztaa	Girls aren't pieces of meat; they have feelings, too. You have to work to get her to like you by being yourself. If she doesn't like that, I'm sorry, but there's nothing that you can do.<br>  <br>  PS- Don't start being like your friend Eric to get her. Girls don't like fake guys.|`|DoKXlLL3aa	Get to know her better.|`|SJisSKUqaa	If she likes sombeody else is better you dont intefer with love
2qDvXCX2aa	First start with some compliment & telling them you care about them or appreciate them. Then add the other as gently as possible. Focus on how it affects your nephew. Maybe tell them you agree on some points but you are concerned about how your nephew will feel about it all. It sort of takes them off the hook for being the bad guys & puts the focus on the child.<br>  Good luck!|`|QQaE4C7raa	tell ur sista wat u just wrote.|`|vnYhL5ZXaa	I think that you should tell your sister what you wrote above. I mean sports are meant to be exciting and entertaining not dull and full of lies. Yes there are some controversies going on in the sports world, but there are many more exciting things happening. Instead of trying to talk to your sister (who might not change her mind) try showing your nephew the good side of sports and all of the fun that comes with being a fan. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps in some way<br>  Have a good weekend Scooter :)|`|AA10554783	Watch sponge bob with them and see if they have negative things to say, if so they are just peas in a pot filled with negativity.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	That's tough, I mean don't blame it on the sport, blame it on the individual. This is a very deep question. Players can choose to play by the rules, or they can cheat and will be caught. If you're caught, you're going to end up like A-Rod and nothing he accomplished will deserve any credit. <br>  You could take your nephew to a Red Sox game when they play the Yankees and see how A-Rod gets booed while Jeter is revered.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is you have to give your kids something to dream about, teach them wrong from right, weed out the good from the bad. <br>  You can't have a negative attitude with a kid like that, he will grow up to mistrust all things and have a bad outlook on life. If you teach your kid to play by the rules and to teach your kid that hard work pays off, none of this will happen to him, because hard work and playing by the rules means you don't want to cheat, take steroids...and there are many players that believe these things. <br>  Basically back to the bad attitude, if you believe in nothing, you're going to have a miserable life.
qaWtwRGpaa	OMFG SAME HERE!!!!!!!!!!! and the thing is last year he asked me out and i said no then i regretted it when he had a new gf.. but then they broke up then this year he did it again and i let him down again!:( and i dont know why maybe it was that i was just nervous. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  so your not alone! and it pisses me off! so sorry but i cant find a cure for our disease! lol|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	That is kind of weird.  Maybe you really want a bf and dont know how to show it?|`|Qtha4ZjHaa	u might have abandement issues like me.
uqwL9544aa	He is using you<br>  <br>  congrats
7DJkwzKDaa	Idk why your calling everyone rude & disrespectful cuz you're the same f*cking way.<br>  But it was obvious you were joking so idk why he got all worked up over it...it looks to me like he made up that sn and person though xD<br>  Just to make you jealous maybe idk maybe he likes you :]<br>  Anyways just don't talk to him for awhile and if he wants to be friends again he'll talk first!<br>  He reminds me a LOT of my guy friend, who gets all sensitive when I say stuff like that, when I'm really just joking around.<br>  I usually end up apoligizig, cuz I know he's been thru a LOT in life & is probably extra-sensitive cuz of all hes been thru.|`|Xm4NvBPLaa	yes he is , he should have some sense of humor there for example when you suggested that I should find a you know what I teased you were playing a game ! (in fact I would tease you about seeing some pictures too but before we talked I read your question and I decided not to push the joke to far , not to say it didn't work you were for the moment 'woa what this guy wants' in your mind wasn't you)<br>  (you remember ?) he is propably a bit frustrated but it wasn't your fault you called me names also and I didn't get offended ! I mean whatever you call him you still treat him as a buddy love interest or whatever ?<br>  <br>  ok I l  splitted the answer into three your questions !

1OJgKMzVaa	Gargle with warm salt water cheap and effective. Stop feeling sorry for yourself there are millions of people in the world who have real problems. At least you have a job and are able to work just be thankful for that.Now that you are alone without a partner you will feel lonely and depressed so if you have spare time on your hands try a bit of voluntary work helping the sick or handicapped it might just do you the power of good to see how other people are really suffering. Good Luck|`|Cpwedckvaa	gargle with salt water and drink hot water with lemon in it.|`|PhPD7uAFaa	If it hurts that bad it is best to visit a clinic or doctor. Try calling your old primary care physician and see if he or she could write a prescription based on your symptoms? Penicillain or amoxcycillain should clear up any soar throat. Pick up the prescription and take it to walmart they will fill any prescription for $4.00 and if that fells go to the free clinic you will have insurance soon and if you say your spouse lost his job and you don't have coverage they may not charge you anything. In the mean time gargle warm salt water with applecider vinegar. cover your neck with a towel. Drink plenty of green tea between gargling and use honey and lemon.|`|sqmHXmKDaa	i had a sore throat before that wouldnt even let me sleep all i did was drink pain relievers while it went away by it self

cxNLOPHNaa	I'm a woman who has made the first move with a guy, on a few occasions. I've always been confident to do so, and never shy about taking a chance. If I want something to happen, I'll try to make it happen. In all aspects of my life. That's the difference between living and merely existing. Also, when I have made the first move... The guys were always impressed that I had the confidence to do so.|`|HeOwMaxaaa	it depends on how you go about it...<br>  <br>  it can be either way|`|FibyMiMzaa	It's not a sign of desperation at all.  It seems confident.  I think it's important for girls to know that many guys might be hesitant to make the first move if they are the type who are very respectful toward girls (no matter how much he might like her), and that other times a guy might not make the first move if he's unsure of how the girl feels about him.  So when a girl makes the first move it doesn't look desperate at all, it shows confidence.|`|gKhR0sgLaa	Confident.<br>  <br>  They know what they want, and they are confident enough to go and get it themselves.|`|rY84Ap6Maa	me too cuz i was voulenteering at a friends school today and a 3rd grader got to 2nd base with me. god boys r little sh*ts.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I would say that the girl is confident.|`|2uxaGUNqaa	I don't believe it's a case of desperation or confidence to be quite honest. You obviously just want to move further into the relationship, maybe you think the time is right. If you're even in a relationship. But I wouldn't make a ginormous first move, because usually the guy makes the first move and if he doesn't make it before you, maybe he isn't ready to move that far/fast. But I don't think you'd be desperate, or confident. I believe you just want it and think the time is right. You're just doing what you want, and that's fine. Just be careful I suppose.|`|ABvnT9xKaa	I honestly think it's the right decision for the guys to do it. But everyone's shy. Depends who takes the first step i guess.|`|4t709Ws7aa	To me it's confident. Most girls usually wait for the guy<br>  to make his move. But girls that are willing to put their <br>  feelings out there in the open are really brave not desperate.|`|cezUEo0Haa	Confident and honestly:<br>  <br>  Makes it a hell of a lot easier for the guy.|`|zNpNpyadaa	no make the move girl
0ktcvglRaa	She means that just because you broke up, that doesn't mean you have to delete her!|`|ldI8DRu7aa	well i think when she says delete me have u been ignoring her or have u been not talking to her she prob just wants to be friends but maybe she just doesnt think u want to but idk if u do or dont. i dont think shes putting the blame on who wanted to break up i just think its cuz ur not umm should i say hanging out that much.....|`|hLSIRDtZaa	Sounds like by the tone of the sentence. Like she's got something for ya! LOL Sorry to deliver you the bad news that may be coming to ya. It's like saying "We broke up...and you delete me?!?!?" Okay. Like Okay. I'm gonna getcha. LOL It's like someone tell you, O.K., I'll be back...after a fight and it's calmly done. They're going to get a gun and they're coming back for you. It's one of those types of scenarios. You should watch your back for whatever she got planned. Sounds like she's crazy to me. LOL Fatal Attraction and a Thin Line between Love and Hate. You seen those two movies haven't you? LOL|`|MQVmh5hiaa	When I read this it sounded like myspace or something but she probably meant that you won't talk to her anymore like you deleted her from your life.|`|HqoOjAHVaa	taht means u should forget get about her there is plenty of fish in the sea|`|NgawN7Pcaa	saying like don't delete her from you're life, she wants to still be there.|`|2f0137f09289e62bcaf3e3903473e994aa	it means that since you too broke up she assumed it was mutual and that she still wants to be your friend. Maybe she didn't realize you deleted her till now, or she was ignoring it.|`|d1kmidbJaa	did you delete her on myspace or on ur phone or anywhere and u deleted her. ....if so then she is mad at u cuz just because u guys broke up it doesnt mean u have to delete her. soooo if not then i am not sure....|`|DoKXlLL3aa	Are you cutting her out from your life and not acting like friends?<br>  <br>  Or  did you delete her from something like your myspace/facebook or phone contacts? lol|`|jCq07Ik6aa	i dont know who acctually broke up with who. but i think she was just saying that it happened and not referring to who was the dumper at all.|`|621af0f098099c92f52aa36d2f3c318eaa	She expects you guys to remain friends still talk and call each other every now and then|`|tPNHw5VPaa	theres really nothing to misunderstand. she simply wants to keep u as a friend on facebook or w/e. i dont see the confusion. dont look too into it. just act casual about it|`|wpNXDJGkaa	You deleted her from MySpace?! So wrong, man, so wrong.|`|PmDYyH0naa	delete you on myspace?|`|72UoLQFWaa	it means that once u broke up your taking her out of your life. By saying ok she thinks you dont want her 2 b in your life anymore.|`|2v6I81Vdaa	Have you deleted her off of myspace?<br>  Or maybe you've been ignoring her? (ie: you deleted me out of your life)|`|SUOsfKYdaa	she means u have been ignorring her n she still wnts to be frnds with u but i dnt kno the whole story so thts all i can tell ya sorry|`|VusJJBbYaa	she means now she likes you againa dn thinks you dont and wants to get back together take it from  A GIRL|`|ZSRnRhBZaa	i would say that she wanted to be friends with you after the break up but you acted like you dont know her any more
h0g4txW5aa	Well this is what a guy said to be once that got me thinking, "what de he mean by that?"<br>  We were talking about his track meet and he's like, "You should've been there, we won and I got first today"<br>  So I said, "Wow the one time I don't come you get first palce. I must be bad luck."<br>  And he goes, "Well I guess usually I'm just distracted, you're very distracting."<br>  I was like, what does that mean ?! haha so yeah, you can say something like that haha, if that even made sense, cause it sure made me think and it was extremely subtle<br>  Just keep dropping hints like that, and see what he says|`|9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	Well why do you like him now only because he is into someone else?  Are you sure you really like him? It's sounds like you just miss his attention.  I think that you are use to getting his attention and he probably liked you before, but he got tired of waiting so he moved onto someone else.  You snooze you lose.  Honestly it's pretty selfish that now you want to take him away from someone he likes.

fMLHjSekaa	haha we are soooo in the same boat right now!!!<br>  <br>  im going to the movies tomorrow with this guy i have liked for quite a while. and hes kissed quite a few girls before.<br>  <br>  im hoping it all goes well for you too. but as i did some research into it most people have said dont bother asking others cause nothing can be explained properly. tilt your head to the side, kiss his lower lip and rest your palm on his chest.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  let me know how it goes|`|VugDp9Byaa	personally, i turn my head to the right. haah. <br>  but it's really not that big of a deal.<br>  it just sort of happens the way it should.<br>  so just get in the moment and let it happen :)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|OLagHfwOaa	I'll let you practice on me so you can get better.<br>  <br>  (Edit)<br>  <br>  I knew the thumbs down was coming.|`|0oyiXko0aa	girls tilt to the right<br>  <br>  its easy from there|`|zvgDa2v1aa	just go with it.|`|TbRADGbyaa	LOL , it just kindof happens .. you'll know ..|`|kvWNtA1zaa	tilt to side of face that u touch <br>  <br>  tilt to right if right handed  left if left
nK4j9s7paa	no|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Yes a few times.  Its disappointing.|`|jL688SnKaa	How is that unrequited love?|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Yes.  The problem was that his past still haunts him and makes him distrustful of women who really care...and bad timing (my life situation).  We don't even speak anymore...and I think that's worse than if we'd have never realized we cared for each other and stayed friends because I miss him everyday, but we avoid each other to keep from getting hurt.  I lost a dear friend, and it still hurts.|`|4ff0fd7bb74640e1958bcc90b8338320aa	Yeah. In 2nd grade. I miss those days. And if the guy I like right now likes me, that's unrequitted love where nothing happens. There are signs that he likes me, but I can't tell him I like him because it would be humiliating to have him say he doesn't like me.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	no....<br>  <br>  can you please answer my question ?<br>  <br>  go to my profile under my questions the first one that says <br>  <br>  "HElP!!!!advice....."<br>  <br>  i would gladly appreciate it<br>  <br>  thanx :)|`|uLHtXibRaa	No|`|rW4bt6ZAaa	Well that's not unrequited love. Unrequited love is where one person likes someone, but the feeling is not mutual.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to debate it with you, but that can't be answered with unrequited love.<br>  <br>  However, I'll answer your question by saying yes, me and a person have liked each other a lot, but the relationsip just never took off for whatever reason. It's a crappy feeling, but it teaches you to really chase what you want and not make the mistake of letting that special someone get away like you did before.|`|oIY2Dgafaa	we both liked each other, i asked if he felt something for me, he said yes, and never talked to me again. but hey, that was my freaky- grade-9- full-of-insecurities- friend<br>  <br>  then, another case. he liked me, i liked him, he did nothing, i did nothing, we both moved on.<br>  <br>  third case. he liked me, i liked him, he did nothing, i did nothing, he got a girlfriend, i got a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  fourth case. i liked him but he had a girlfriend, they broke up, we started dating, we got married. :)|`|ACNECiZAaa	No never experienced that fully. Now I was best friends with this guy who I had sex with on a constant basis but he refused to date me since he had this fear of commitment. It sucked but had it's good points. For instance, I could use him as my "boyfriend" when I went out and a weirdo tried to ask me out and/or to dance, lol.|`|rNE7XAmgaa	If your ever in a situation like that, it's up to you to do something. Don't just go around posting things on Yahoo Answers. Change the situation.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	Eventually, I ended up telling them. Usually in an email, pathetic I know. It turned out alot better and made everything so much easier!|`|tpioRQHkaa	yep|`|Qvql4KGLaa	yup, this girl I liked in college. Sucked. Now I found her again on face book, but she is taken now.. dang!!!|`|AA11202730	YES. That's kind of going on with me right now. But I think something will happen soon. <br>  We do hang out and I'm a little out going sometimes. Sometimes you can't wait for the guy to make the first move with everything, especially if he's shy. And if you're both shy you might just have to step out of your shell and go for it. Especially if you know he likes you, theres no reason to not do anything.<br>  <br>  <br>  Everyone is saying that you're wrong because it isn't unrequited love but:<br>  1. That's not the point! Just answer the question, it makes sense if you're not stupid.<br>  2. It does kind of make sense that it's unrequited because you both like eachother but there isn't any love going on.|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	yes. although I wouldn't call it love.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it just happens. But it probably signifies you two aren't suited to each other, and subconsciously you both know that, that is why you are not consciously making actions to your attraction.<br>  <br>  It will pass. <br>  or maybe you're both just shy, if you both like each other, make a move|`|NYOvfc4haa	If it's unrequited, it means the other person does not feel the same way about you.<br>  <br>  I have experienced what you are talking about though ;) Nothing ever happened because I was dumb, and I have been regretting it since. Try to make something happen!|`|3W319sopaa	no but my friend chaney has.  she liked this guy named dylan and dylan had a crush onher too. my friend lucy and i tried to hook them up so many times but chaney started not to like him.  hse isnt the dating type|`|oNZxccqmaa	Then that isn't unrequited love. Unrequited love is one-sided.|`|fq2Cffy6aa	yea im in the situation now really blows|`|iOmYtUDtaa	yes dear, what is the rest of your question though?
Bd16ixUQaa	HE DUMPED YOU translation you have a right to whatever you want and he's given up the right to be mad about it.<br>  Now, he can be mad at his friend if his friend decides to go out with you.<br>  But girl, don't sit at home crying over him if you're ready to get back out there! Do yo' thang! lol!|`|cubhDLkWaa	If the opportunity is there, if the intuitive nudge is there, don't hesitate, don't second-guess. Act. If you like him, you should go out with him.|`|is13swG4aa	No! He dumped you, but do it for you not to hurt him. You 2 were not married! Live your life!|`|DbMCubDuaa	I think that it is too soon you should just wait for atleast another week.|`|zozBJ45paa	Quit worrying so much, If he dumped you than date his frined who cares, Why care about someone who dumped you, Life is to short to worry about such stupid things if you really like this boy, THAN GO FOR IT.|`|aMBEcziBaa	keep talking with this friend for a lil while then ask your ex if its ok or you mite just start a fight between them. If he says no then just ask your new hubby if hes willing to risk that, if he is than just go for it|`|KPsndfELaa	I think you should respect your relationship with your ex, as well the relationship between him and his friend. If you and his friend are really meant to be something then it could wait.|`|dcApnpq7aa	Nope not at all Ive done the same exact thing to hope things work out with yall|`|JfsN4FSraa	nope seems reat to me if ou and them click y not? its harmless if you ask me|`|CMU9XTaMaa	no you are young live it up! and plus he broke up with you, so everyone is free game! have fun on your date :)|`|ZFUhiD4naa	No if you just go on a date with another guy then that is not wrong and if doesn't work out then you could always play the field. If he dumped you then you have ever right to go out on a date|`|CVWizvy6aa	Why did he dumped you? Is it because you were clicking with his friend?
zzaScg0haa	I have no idea what you are talking about, Jen Aniston is GORGEOUS!
q9i3RqwYaa	maybe he had a major ***** and was embarressed.|`|46932e299a057eec247337f7bca2654baa	maybe he got a b o n e r.... and was embarrassed to be around people..... idk... go figure|`|GjKMUIpIaa	mayb he wuz rely nervous or he has prostate cancer.
BETCfjFdaa	It is not normal for a guy to go to the bathroom very often and definitely not normal for one of his friends to check up on him!<br>  The guy you were dating might have even been masturbating in the bathroom. <br>  I would suspect this, since you were grinding on him all night. Did he get a b**er? If he did, that would be normal, then he very well may have been jerking off a little bit! But he would not tell you this.<br>  If he did not get an erection from grinding with a girl, then something is wrong!<br>  <br>  (If you want to arouse him even more, grope him with your hands and spank him a little. Just not in public.)|`|AjLOGpaJaa	This could come from so many things. Without going to check on him yourself, you are only going to assume your friend tells you the truth and have to trust him. If you think it is something else, go check on him or get someone you do trust to check it out and let you know next time.<br>  Good luck.....|`|9dcj2zFFaa	Ok, first are you a female or male, he was drinking water from the sink in a public rest room because ?? he didnt have money.... whatever the<br>  case - IT IS NOT NORMAL|`|oOU6XJOqaa	i think he is just really nervous around you, see if he does it next time.|`|BTlUhYvwaa	No. More than likely he has diabetes and needs to be checked.|`|ymbbuuBBaa	he was probably just really thirsty and too drunk to use the drinking fountain|`|j0oHHuNFaa	he was so high haha|`|72UoLQFWaa	Have you ever heard the song on SNL gizz in my pants|`|GHnkKwl3aa	He could either:<br>  <br>  1) Just be taking a break and getting some air<br>  2) Or you were a REALLY good dancer. Let's leave it at that.<br>  <br>  :P|`|0lQtTE9Daa	he probably just got hot and was thirsty. has he heard of a bubler? lol|`|0ktcvglRaa	If he had been drinking, then yeah, it's perfectly normal, especially if he was drinking water afterward. My boyfriend and I drink beer all the time and we have to pee a LOT.|`|uLHtXibRaa	Not out of a glass?..erm well yerh thats little weird..|`|98LDN0Quaa	maybe he does coke|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	maybe he got a ***** hehe
lMHy05Lmaa	he likes u or being a complete ***|`|uLHtXibRaa	Hes tryna impress....most men use this to get a woman interested..and sometimes its just habit...most of the time tho flattery is used for ulterior purposes...and sometimes its a genuine compliment..sometimes you never know!!!|`|iOa7rriGaa	Well my first thought since I don't know he likes me and is nervous is kinda turned off but it really depends on how they say it if they say it like he's looking me up and down then I think he's a jerk if he says it in a joking kind of way it would catch me off guard but I might talk to him no matter what he looks like.|`|uiGx0rPVaa	Okay hold up. If you're talking to a girl 2x a week... man not yet!! When you guys talk in the phone and know each other pretty well then you can say that but in a jokey manner if you guys are not going out. Otherwise, she'll think you're a perv!  :P|`|0RpicF24aa	look i have answered alot of your questions and i think you should back off a little give her some space become friends first really good friends you'll just stuff up the whole thing by doing what your doing give it a break sorry but it's true|`|gzlz4i3Naa	lol at the first answer. i think the girl probably is flattered that you would say something like that. ask her out =)|`|5P3spnOWaa	Haha well it depends on the situation.  If you're normally that forward with her, then I guess it wouldn't be all that weird.  However, if you're normally shy and suddenly called her "beautiful," than personally I would find that to be a little random lol.  But HEY at least you have the courage to say it, so maybe she'll like you for it.  Girls like guys with a lot of confidence, so if you've been shy until now perhaps this is your chance to finally be yourself!<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope that helped!! :)|`|8XqzxKz9aa	Hey beautiful is outdated just like "Hey cuttie!" Come up with something more flattering and own it! Dont second guess yourself! For example "HEY Gorgeous!" or "Hey Lovley" One that gets me is (look her in the eyes and truley listen and say "how are you doing?" <br>  <br>  But they hey beautiful thing is more for friends I think because everyone says it to me! And I dont think you want to get stuck in the friend zone.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|WdVzjQBZaa	I would think that he really likes me to have the courage to approach me. Also, I'd think he's sweet and caring and clever. I would also feel really flattered, because he thinks im beautiful, and glad he didn't say hott because beautiful is more respectful. Really, if someone did say that to me I wouldn't be able to stop smiling for a long time.<br>  <br>  Trust me, if u say thast to ur crush, she'll probably have the same reaction. Good Luck! :)<br>  <br>  Can u answer mine? <br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307025634AA5zvMl&r=w">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|hN3k3ggSaa	I'd say that he is firstly captivated by your looks, and secondly, trying to get your attention so that he can tell you more of what he feels. So put the poor guy out of his misery by rescuing him with a conversation!|`|VVA3nDTtaa	I'd think he's weird.<br>  <br>  You can't just go up to a girl and say "Hey beautiful" to someone you don't even know.<br>  <br>  PS. This is exactly what I said in you're last question. You're name doesn't change Mike.|`|AKc8EaKTaa	i would take it as a genuine compliment cuz he said beautiful and not "HOTT" which is a sign of respect. flirt with him and see wat happens. if he is shy he may just need to have a boost of confidence|`|Wt3t6rUPaa	I would think that if I was interested in him that I would be IN WITH A GRIN!! Ok, beautiful??|`|P7BfFo88aa	I would tell him to **** him self if he is playing games.|`|wWKJxT82aa	well its a good start but you may want to say something like hey beautiful how are you? my days been pretty boring til i talked to you or something. help her get into the conversation. but if all you said was hey beautiful id probably take the comment say thanks then say see you later because theyre isnt really a way to respond to that even though its always good to complement girls lol. hope this helps!|`|oKdfQgLqaa	are you a dude or a chick<br>  <br>  anyways, it sounded like you were a dude until all the answers were for chicks...i guess i should make two options then. lol<br>  <br>  *girl<br>  this guy really likes you and wants to impress you. talk to him<br>  <br>  *guy<br>  i would start talking to this cute guy. I think it's not the most practical way to greet her, but still attracting.|`|7PJFouzPaa	could come off as a bs sweet talker. but if your a shyer kind of guy that doesn't hangout with a lot of girls it would be really sweet. as long as those weren't the only coherent and interesting words that came out of your mouth.|`|sK6mrNVqaa	aw =)<br>  just say heyy back real friendly and smile, <br>  show him that you take it asa compliment and that your not nervous<br>  around him either,so he will be more relaxed.|`|nbLx5SK0aa	i would say  hay sexy back cause its just a joke wat eva it for fun have fun while u live my modo is its a short life if u like some1 ask them out as soon as u reilize u like them if they say no f them!1 ha|`|f6L8C3mJaa	You prefer "hey beautiful" or "hey ugly"?|`|8th9KY1haa	It is an expression when some one does not know the name.<br>  It could Hey sweetie or hey honey or "Hey Beautiful".|`|Dob2OhIYaa	well if i like him and hes the good kind of friendly ( like not creepy) i would feel butterflies and smile and blush and say thanks because when a guy says that he usually really means it|`|RPpHLXKWaa	if he says it w/ those circumstances he means it.|`|H4W29m7Baa	He's trying to impress you or get you to be like 'aww how sweet'.. he's diggin you girl!!|`|QQaE4C7raa	he's either into u or being sarcastic|`|HoUdB8COaa	id be amazed.....id prolly say awwwwwwww|`|mzfTAtC4aa	Man I Love College|`|tpioRQHkaa	i agree with catty m|`|defeBgqdaa	i say that sometimes, but it doesnt mean i like the person. but if he likes u its a good thing
ise05jjUaa	In my opinion I would say yes its way to young, you haven't even experienced life.  Get out there an establish yourself, get an education & a good paying job so you can support a family.  Most families nowadays are living payday to payday with the way the economy is.  Besides, lets say you do get married, 10 years from now which I hope it never happens, he leaves you.   What are you going to do then, you need to build a foundation for yourself first so that you won't have to depend on him if anything like that ever happens.  So yes I would say its to young as far as life experience, but on the other hand the law says your an adult now & that is a choice that is completely up to you.  I'd ask other women who, at one time were like you & wanted to get married & start a family at such at early age & how things turned out for them.|`|SGjhNidDaa	18 is not too young, but i would say wait until you're at least 20, 21. theres no harm in waiting, but you do mature alot in those years and make it more likely that your marriage will last|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	That is way too young. Why are you rushing? Are you in school or working? Do you have your own home? Do you mind living with your parents and being married? That is sad. You are sad.|`|8SRjELNBaa	i'm 19, i've seen a few acquaintances start the family life right after high school.  <br>  <br>  There's no wrong or right answer.|`|AuthyG9Qaa	M A R R I E D  at 18?

If you really do love each other and you've been through everything that would make life difficult then get married is all I have to say just make sure y'all can support each other.|`|TNjKwlA9aa	Marriage is a big decision, but if your sure, then maybe. I don't think that you should have a family quite yet. When your 18, even though your an adult, your actually not done growing, when you have kids at that age, it could really damage you, or the baby. You should wait till you are at least 20.|`|8th9KY1haa	If two people love each other and have the means IE income and a place to live, than No it is not to young to get married.<br>  Just remember that being married is total life commitment.<br>  Are you ready???|`|CT64FYrvaa	you're never too young to fall in love, if you both feel the same way and both wanna get married and start a family, then they're is no one stopping you, i hope it works out~|`|UagWwcEEaa	Its not too young but I would wait until like 20-22 so you can start a career and stuff

AA11263103	Be yourself, don't  be fake.<br>  Best Answer - Chosen by Asker<br>  1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real|`|kvWNtA1zaa	yes he likess you <br>  punch him back  - hard  , not girlish|`|Ap6VVo1zaa	i take it the girl above copy and pasted = ) this is a stupid answer but yeah

Start off with simple responses when you see her, like say hi.  Then slowly talk to her more and then you might get your answer.  Best thing is don't just flat out ask her why she is doing it, because then she might feel as if you brought it up because you were annoyed. Also don't flat out ask her in case it is just an innocent look. Just slowly start talking to her and see what happens.|`|RTy34wtoaa	well, it could meen that she kinda has feelings fer you but not enuff to come talk/flirt. most girls wait fer the guy to make the first move so maybe you should get to know her a lil bit better before you assume something that might get yer hopes upp then they get crushed.

But I don't like short answers.  I think maybe you are reading too much into some of this.  I don't think she is getting up everytime just so you will look at her.  But I definitely think that there is something there if she looked at you and smiled.  Why don't you try talking to her sometime.  Keep it casual so you can get an idea where she stands (no pun intended).|`|BltBopVgaa	Well it seems like it does mean something,but not anything major yet.Based on her actions she wants you to make the first move!

RsBmU4pvaa	i don't get it. why would you even consider thinking about having sex at 13. your visa card (or whatever you wanna call it) is something precious. think about it, like honestly, your chance of actually living with this girl forever is umm...3% -ish. treasure ur virginity. and do it with a woman you love. if that woman that you love could wait, and if you could too, it would be pure love. so cheesy, i know. but honestly, it's sick to think that that girl that you're going out with lost her visa card.<br>  <br>  do whatever you want, but grade 8/9 is not for sex. i'm in grade 11, and am soo happy i haven't put myself in a position of having to do it so far. and it's not like i havent been given options buddy, i have. if your asking for my opinion, you should not do it. and if you know that everyone is going to say you are too young, then umm...we obviously carry a point.|`|rkoxkAPDaa	First ask yourself:<br>  Am I ready to have sex?<br>  <br>  The first thing that pops into your mind is the right answer.<br>  <br>  The second thing to ask your self is:<br>  Do I love her?<br>  <br>  Don't confuse love with like. Love is unconditional. Like is fickle and ever-changing. You need to save your virginity for love. Even if you are pressured to have sex, to feel like you will be accepted: don't. Sex is a personal thing. Only you can make the decision.<br>  Take into consideration, that this thing isn't going to be private. At your age, gossip like this spreads like wildfire. So, go ahead and risk your reputation. <br>  This girl seems as if she could have problems. Young women who promote their bodies tend to feel the need for affection. She may have problems at home, and sex is her way of feeling loved. You need to tell her that you guys don't have to have sex to "love" each other.<br>  <br>  In the end, If you know it's wrong, go with your gut feeling, and don't do it.<br>  <br>  If she breaks up with you over it, or is angry, you may be sad, but in the end she wasn't worth it.|`|Qtha4ZjHaa	Well if u don't want to tell her u feel it's to early if u want to on the other hand well thats up to u
9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	Hi,  I am a divorcee and had one child with him when we divorced.  There were many problems in the marriage that escalated and the relationship became so unhelathy it wasn't in the best interest for us to stay together even for our child. Reasons for divorce vary from case to case.  You have not stated the reason why he wants a divorice but it's up to them if they want to work it our or not.  My cousin is currently getting a divorce from his wife and they have four kids.  He tried, but she didn't want to go to marriage counseling to fix things so he finally gave up.  She hid very important things from him like their teenage daughter getting pregnant.  There are many other reasons like she was lazy and would never work, cook, clean or help much with the kids.  He made a very good salary, but finally got fed up with everything, filed for divorce and moved out last week.  I think that if BOTH parties are willing to make their marriage work, it is well worth the try.  It can't be just one person.  Talk to your brother and be there for him.  Make sure he has exhausted all options before resorting to divorce because the kids will be greatly affected and is he really prepared to pay child support and alimony?  That is what my cousin is already getting ready to do.  He was obviously fed up.  My divorce happened when my child was very young.  He became abusive and it ended shortly after because it was bad for everyone.  Your brother has to determine if A) He and his wife still love each other B) Are they both willing to make it work C) have they exhausted all options, therapy, etc.?|`|rOMTKmjDaa	Sorry, it's really none of your business.

If they are not cheating on each other, it might just be a rut.

cezUEo0Haa	If he says he doesn't like anyone. He is lying. Short and simple. If he avoids you, he thinks he made himself look like an idiot. It isn't necessarily being immature, just avoiding any other awkward situations. He wants you to talk to HIM. So just say hi next time you see him.
um8s6agzaa	I'm a girl and I can't stand him... He's cute but that's all, but he seems to believe that he is gorgeous!?!? I mean it's like David Beckham, at first I thought he was hot, but then you see that he knows he's hot and that's so not attractive...<br>  do you know what I mean??<br>  <br>  Plus, there was and there's still this huge Efron-mania, it's like for Robert Pattinson. People say he's hot only because he plays Edward Cullen and is popular and rich.... I first saw him in a movie like 4 years ago and I told my friend that guy is hot... and they were like NO and know there all in this Pattinson-mania....<br>  <br>  it's just our society|`|mXZ4825aaa	I agree with you 100%.

When he first premiered, he was more attractive than he is now. I mean, he plays ball, he sings, and in the movie, he has a good personality. I, however, do not find him attractive anymore. And I honestly find him to be kind of gay. But ya know, if they're going on and on about his body, they're just being girls. It's a girl thing, and we all do that. But maybe what they really like, is the personality they're seeing in the movie. Although, I don't think that's really his real life personality. But don't worry about it, it's not like all those girls have a chance with him, and probably noneeee of them do. It's just a silly crush. Don't worry about it.|`|VmEGho8Waa	abs.... hair... hawt everything....<br>   lol|`|Pi4tU2Pyaa	ahaha, I don't like Zac Efron but he is so hot!<br>  I also love his face!<br>  <br>  The celebrity guy I love the most is Adam Brody!|`|E7TkNO00aa	You wish that was you.|`|p0pDGL6zaa	HIS FACE=]<br>  AND HIS EYES.<br>  <br>  aha. <br>  but then again, hes not that "hot" ..ive seen better:)|`|YR9l82vmaa	ahaha! you are SO right!! everyone hates him in my school (save the few and far between JB/Miley Cyrus/HSM lovers who no one likes anyways). he looks so feminine, and i've heard he wears makeup (and not just in photo shoots!) in my opinion, he looks like he's trying way too hard. his hair is better than most girls' i know! and that's a reason to be frightened. :^)|`|NwpGhT31aa	He does look like a drowned rat there!!!<br>  <br>  Bwahahaha!!!

Hell I went to prom with a girl friend of mine and had a blast, no man needed!|`|4d3Md9pnaa	No, it's not bad.<br>  Don't worry so much about it.<br>  <br>  If you get a boyfriend just for the sake of having one, I'm pretty sure you'll still have that "empty" feeling.<br>  Just live your life and let things go on. :D<br>  If there's a guy you like who's single, ask him out, unless you feel like you're not ready for a relationship.|`|69qn7muFaa	Don't feel worthless.

But If I could go back, I'd wait to date till I'm in college. haha, you're probably like 'what!? why?!' well, I mean think about it.. All the guys in high school want one thing. Right? and Most of the time, the relationships don't last more than a week and that's just pointless. I wish for a relationship that will last forever. <br>  <br>  I felt completely worthless too.. But you know what? I pushed all the pain and hurt aside and the right guy came along.|`|zW8tc64qaa	I don't see why people need to be with someone to validate themselves.

Call one of them NOW, or write them a letter.|`|oLXJTK0Iaa	:'(  wow that must suck... you made ME want to cry!!<br>  <br>  hmmm... let me think about what you can do...<br>  <br>  can't you schedule a time where you can hang out with your friends? like maybe you could have a sleepover once a month, or see a movie on saturdays or something like that? tell your mom that you're really gonna miss your friends, and ask her if you can schedule some times that you can see them. i know it won't be the same as seeing them every day, but that will probably never happen, so try to make the best of the situation.<br>  <br>  as for your teachers, all teachers (or at least 99% of them) are required o stay at least 45 minutes after school - and most of them stay longer than that - because they have to grade papers and stuff. maybe your mom wouldn't mind driving you down there after school to say "hi" to your teachers every once-in-a-while.<br>  <br>  if your parents say "no" to those things, still try to keep in touch with your friends and ex-teachers. remember that you can call and email them any time you want. if you want, you could even email your friends some pictures of you once a month and ask them to email you some pictures back. i know it's not the same as seeing them, but at least you will get to know what's going on in their lives and stuff.<br>  <br>  i know it's really hard to leave your friends behind, and i know people say this all the time... but i'm sure you'll meet new friends at your new school! people move all the time, and it always seems like it's the end of the world, but trust me, it's NOT!! you WILL make new friends.  :)  it may take time, but you WILL make them.<br>  <br>  you're probably not gonna get to go back to your old school, so there's really no use in feeling sorry for yourself, it will just make you sad, and you won't acomplish anything. the most you can do is try to make the best out of the new situation! so instead of thinking, "i have to leave my friends!!" think, "i'll get to have TWICE as many friends as before!!"<br>  <br>  hope i could help, and good luck!!  <3
bPKLKi7haa	I don't think this will help you, but I'm 16 and I've never ever had a boyfriend and that's just the way I like it. I reject 'em all! eha! Personally, I think boyfriends and girlfriends are a waste of time. I mean, look how worked up you are about some guy that you think might like you but you're not sure but you thought you like him first and then you're friends told him that you like him and now you're friends want you two to go out but you who kinda likes him thinks that maybe he thinks you does or doesn't really like you but you still think you might like him and bla bla bla..  It's silly. Sorry, no offense.
19iD220Jaa	She likes you .... could be shy  or even scare to move to that next level. Don't move too fast, it could turn her off  . Ask her" what if ...questions" that is if you don't to just come out and ask her what the deal is between us....or you could just play it cool and if its meant to be .. it will be.|`|pgseuoE7aa	NO SHE DOESNT LIKE U, of course she does why else u post this question, be a man and confess u like her if u wanna go out with her|`|bERQ3UCdaa	Get Some|`|0oyiXko0aa	dude totally tell her how u feel man 8th grader with a fish dude thats nice man if u dont i will.|`|TyqGdBw1aa	yes she obviously likes you. no girl would let you put your arm around her, play fight on her bed, or wear short shorts while she was play fighting with you if she didn't like you. unless she thinks you're gay. which isn't the case. she likes you if you like her make your move now before it's too late|`|XnwuXYELaa	damn boy, you should talk to her about it, it seems like it but you can never really tell, good luck|`|DoKXlLL3aa	Ya probably.|`|ICTr6kHhaa	funny, after your mom comes by, i usually have gotten up and went as well...|`|fkOLAOsAaa	hit it and quit it|`|4oxZ7u1qaa	duh|`|BddRfJ2caa	she wants you bad. From the sound of it she waiting for you to make your move. Most girls are usually nervous to start the "action", that is way it is up to you. <br>  <br>  For starters, try a little peck on the lips. If she feels comfortable , then she will release her self to you. It's either that or she will get creeped out and never want to see you again (jk).|`|6iuZEUhzaa	i would say yes but shes not looking for a relationship.|`|SJisSKUqaa	yes ok everything is setup tell her how you feel about her
d0WQ2pZNaa	It happens.<br>  When you have alcohol in your system, you lose your inhibitions - most of it anyway.<br>  You let yourself go and do things your ego wouldn't normally allow you to do.<br>  <br>  And I highly doubt EVERYBODY finds you boring, there are a lot of shy and conscious people, but they aren't necessarily boring as such.<br>  Most people are more 'fun' when they are drinking, but of course there are different sorts of 'drunks' that can be the life of the party when they're sober, but shock horror, balling out their eyes singing nursery rhymes when they've had a couple of drinks.<br>  So it is very normal for people to act different when they're not sober.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it, if you really want to change it, try letting yourself go and just not caring what people think of you(when sober), alcohol pretty much allows you to do this, thats why different personalities come out.

jEC8Ctp5aa	Diamonds have a symbolism that she might not understand, so run this by her before you buy anything else.<br>  <br>  A diamond is the hardest natural substance known to man. It's not for nothing that the slogan for the diamond industry is "A Diamond is Forever," because nothing can break them. Diamonds represent strength and a union that will withstand all outside forces. They have the obvious outside facets that everyone looking at the ring can see, but there are also more facets hidden deep inside the stone than can only be seen when she looks real close - kinda like how the two of you are together. Everyone sees the outside stuff, but only the two of you know what's really on the inside.<br>  <br>  Now, for her to call such a rare and wondrous thing "commonplace" can only be considered a crime of misunderstanding. Run this by her and see if she changes her mind. If she wants unique, design the ring yourself. However, with other stones, you run the risk that another stone might not withstand all that a diamond can. The wedding ring is meant to never be taken off - remember ?<br>  <br>  Best of luck !!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Look for a stone that is pretty high up on the hardness scale.  I find this site to have lots of unusual stones at reasonable prices.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gemstv.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gemstv.com</a><br>  <br>  I like morganite, kunzite, tsavorite, rose de france amethyst, yellow sapphire, zultanite, ametrine<br>  <br>  I am unfamiliar with ice.com, but agree those are stunning choices.|`|iE2sDxDAaa	Whats her favorite gemstone? Use that as the center stone...|`|RuKK1LYiaa	A good stone is Tanzanite set in white gold, they shut the last mine down so its quite rare but a good alternative to the diamond, its a light purple shade and so beautiful. She'd love it.|`|LCAzlHhEaa	What about a center stone as her birth store and then have a small diamond on each side of the birth stone.  Or both of your both stones in one setting without anything else but the two birth stones?|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	My first suggestion is to go to a jeweler, choose a setting and have them put the stone of your choice into it.<br>  I do suggest you stick to an engagement ring setting so you will be able to later find a wedding band that will sit nicely next to it (we are experiencing a problem with that right now with my aquamarine engagement ring and having a wedding band custom made is really pricey).<br>  <br>  If you & your intended do not mind possibly having to move the engagement ring to another finger/hand and to wear just a band on the wedding ring finger then the sky is the limit.  I would just suggest that you research the stone you want in the ring so you don't buy something too fragile.  Mine & my fiance's top choices were: Aquamarine, Topaz (many colors available), and Tanzanite (too expensive).<br>  <br>  If you want to check the web, I really love www.ice.com<br>  <br>  Something like this has a nice look to it and it would make a unique engagement ring (the center stone is very big so if your girl is small, stick to under 3 carat stones): <br>  <a href="http://www.ice.com/AST/Ice/Ice_Primary/PRDOVR~P_RCC_019071/P_RCC_019071.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ice.com/AST/Ice/Ice_Primary/P...</a><br>  <br>  This ring has a very similar style to an engagement ring: <br>  <a href="http://www.ice.com/home/product_details.jsp?productCode=P_RCC_016054" rel="nofollow">http://www.ice.com/home/product_details....</a><br>  <br>  Another engagement ring type style and Citrines are VERY pretty stones:<br>  <a href="http://www.ice.com/home/product_details.jsp?productCode=P_RCC_017868" rel="nofollow">http://www.ice.com/home/product_details....</a><br>  <br>  You can also check overstock.com as well if you want to look around online.  I do sincerely recommend dealing with a jeweler - - it may not save you money but you'll know you are getting your girl a truly unique ring.|`|FxgpfXpSaa	I just finished a romance novel and instead of a ring he gave her a fancy diamond and birthstone necklace and matching bracelet. I like that idea. However when my Fiance proposed he picked out a beautiful (and heavy) 5 Sapphires (my birthstone) surrounded by small diamonds. All in a gold setting. I can't stop looking at it and it's been on my finger 2 months. This ring is definitely different.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	I don't love diamonds. I prefer to wear my statement jewelry around my neck and keep my rings simple. My husband gave me an emerald cut white sapphire solitaire in a white gold setting. Sapphires are the second hardest stone (important to consider if it's a ring she's going to wear every day). He had the ring designed so he can add green sapphire side stones on our first anniversary. My wedding ring is a very simple white gold band. <br>  <br>  Sapphires are great because they come in so many colors. If she doesn't want a gemstone ring, you could get an engraved or open-weave band.|`|J38v75bvaa	money is an issue now a days. when my fiancee and i got engaged we just had a son so our money was super tight. im real old fashioned i wanted a solitaire diamond. its small but real clear and perfect for me and our pocket book.<br>  <br>  they have a stone called an aquamarine. alot of people think its a diamond but it has a very light tent of blue to it. it is very pretty tho. you might want to look into that, its also marchs brithstone<br>  <br>  goodluck!!! and congrats!!!|`|JSwO2hRqaa	A pretty sparkly gemstone.<br>  <br>  I have heard of couples getting their birthstones in a ring, or a stone to match his or her eyes.  There are so many possibilities.<br>  <br>  This is a really good article on the topic (read toward the bottom)|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	I really love aquamarine stones! Do that, with white gold. They are light blue and so beautiful and unique.|`|XhtDtZK9aa	Black Hills gold with her birthstone, or another favorite stone.|`|LqomT0tPaa	1. If she likes the look of a diamond but doesn't want one for ethical or budget reasons, I highly suggest checking out moissanite. Moissanite is silicon carbide and is as hard as a sapphire. It will also never lose it's brilliance over time. I have a pair of moissanite earrings and they have more fire and brilliance than most any pair of diamond studs I have seen. <br>  <br>  2. If she really doesn't like the look of a diamond, you could try various colored stones...possibly her birthstone (or yours if she likes it better!). Or, I did see a custom engagement ring once that was made with a beautiful South Sea Pearl. I recently learned a lot about pearls when I was in French Polynesia and there is a lot to consider (similar to diamonds if you are talking black pearls) so do your research first if you decide to go that route.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yTirNVXyaa	My FH gave me matched earrings rather than a ring because in my line of work rings are very dangerous, but they are amazing amethysts my favorite color and stone and he spent hours finding the right ones for me. What is her birthstone? or favorite gem? and does she like classic settings or modern? Go to a local jeweler and have them do a custom design where you combine everything she loves into the ring to make it just for her. That way it's unique and she will know that you really put effort into it by picking the stones and designing the setting. Trust me on this it will bring on the tears and mean so much more than if you just went and picked something out.|`|c9sXhnKpaa	Well can I suggest that if you have Sky tv then check out Price-drop tv on channel 645, because at different times of the day they sell Jewellery at cheap prices also there is a stone that looks like diamonds but its called Diamante.  Anyway if you check out that channel then I`m sure you will find a ring that will look beautiful, but also at a reasonable price.  I think its also on Freeview as well.  Can I take this opportunity to pass on my best wishes and congratulations.|`|55b8fb502d696b2763b1fa2013c036b6aa	I don't like diamonds either - so not worth the money. My bf (now husband) bought me a pink heart shaped sapphire. I couldn't have been happier.

If it is in India, that too in South India, I definitely like a girl in full saree and related costume with copious jasmine flowers on her plait. Sometimes, the girls with such costumes come out of their houses only to kindle the minds of vivid nature appreciators and there you are, you feel like saying namaste envisaging the girl to be a  goddess, say Lakshmi. (FYI, I am a muslim).<br>  If it is in a foreign country, I would like her to dress up in the western style, of course, in a most respectable costume. Why should we think if it is a western dress, it should be only two piece. Hundreds of fashion clothes covering the complete body are still available in western countries.<br>  Last but not least, any thing kept covered has its own value.|`|Hw5eIMRYaa	both ways go for me ... but a girl must dress decently when dressing western . Showing skin for no good reason is just a method to invite trouble. As far as indian dress are concerned i like when a girl wears Saree.|`|3EM66IWFaa	I prefer Indian dress.

AA10687516	It all depends...normally I'd say yes. But then again what do I know about you and your prospective mate.<br>  <br>  I would though advise the following.<br>  <br>  1. Try living together.  You're 17, so it's not like you've got to get married today.  So why not test drive marriage without the legal ramifications of it?<br>  <br>  2. Remember you're a very different person than you were just 3 years ago at 14...imagine how different you'll be at 21?  So don't commit to something until you are sure and you've given it enough time to be sure.<br>  <br>  3.  Under no circumstances get married at 17 because you're pregnant.  Keeping and raising a baby together is all well and good, but marriage is an unnecessary stress on an already stressful situation.  If that's even the case.<br>  <br>  No matter what you do, do it because you're sure.  Not because you've got a friend or family member or because he wants to.  This is your life.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Vote for Best Answer!!|`|OyEEyIpdaa	eh society undeniably looks down on young couples, or couples that dated for a short time before getting married.  they pass judgment on you, almost dooming you to fail.  my girlfriend is 17 and i want to propose to her more than anything.

Us teens don't know what we really want in a man/woman, so just chill.|`|gr5gSYiXaa	I think it all depends on whether or not you love this person so much that you wanna spend your whole life with!|`|OgFgBxd8aa	well i think u should get married if you been goin out with him for a year or more but 17 mite be a little too young|`|sy40JGgTaa	uhh yea! and 18 is too young to get divorced too.|`|9KDE7v7Haa	Yes.|`|SD655BkFaa	too young. plus i think its illegal without parental consent. at least where im from. haha|`|bEFHzitFaa	nope, if ur willing to waste money on the marrage then let him/her take half ur things on the devorce :)|`|MDhGURU4aa	Yes, definately too young.<br>  Please don't<br>  you dont know what your getting into|`|qvUFVgiVaa	waayyy 2 young|`|tsOFwHv1aa	WAY TO DANG YOUNG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|93BCmFm2aa	Yes and for gods sake dont get pregnant!!!!!|`|iOmYtUDtaa	HELL YEA!|`|qMnuRO50aa	As long as it's not a relative|`|qndkvEEFaa	yes|`|gRSm6QDGaa	get better grammer<br>  and yeah|`|HoUdB8COaa	ur still a minor babez.....go live a lil|`|cFrtOg45aa	Of course it is. You haven't even experienced real life. Wait until you turn 21 and the real fun begins. Poor you will miss out because you have to work and support a family. I was 32 and had my share of fun before I got married. Met a lot of wild and weird people along the way. Don't regret a thing and am thankful for my husband and two children. You can have it all if you wait and allow yourself to grow a little.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Too young.....|`|anfhcnWeaa	personally i think it is way too young everyone i know who got married at 17 were divorced by 19.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Yes.|`|4PAY40Flaa	YES! well depends if you think...wait, no. Yesh, it's definitely too young|`|ApLovDgeaa	more points for me! ho!|`|M7r7gHNGaa	Yes! You couldn't possibly have enough life experience for you to be certain the person you are thinking of marrying is THE ONE. You would also miss out on having fun being a kid and a teen without the burden of adult responsibilities. Wait another 3 or 4 years at the very least. Better yet, wait until you're 26 (Like that's going to happen).|`|NLi51W1Saa	well i mean some people are more mature that others at certain ages so it depends, but alot of people that young go into it too fast and get hurt, just be careful, but its up to you dont worry what others think.|`|7hZLgQOMaa	Yes! Think of how much time and "freedom" you still have left in front of you! Your not even legally an adult yet! I think over 21 is ok but anything below that is much to young|`|AA11536708	By at least 10 years too young.<br>  <br>  27 maybe...17--that's just crazy.|`|Qv1zeDFvaa	Absolutely!!|`|GmGEGqn8aa	way to young|`|Rj7L1Rc6aa	yeah im 18 and im AT LEAST 5 years away|`|0id6jchSaa	depends wat ur living status is =]<br>  but if u wanna, why not?|`|N7gOE1btaa	Yes.  I don't know you so I can't elaborate on why I think its too young, but I firmly believe it is for anyone in any situation.  If you are in love with someone, there is no need to rush to the altar.  But you are young, and while you don't doubt your feelings, you haven't come close to the peaks sexual and mental maturity, so your emotions for this guy may change.|`|AKc8EaKTaa	no. im 17 almost 18 and im engaged to be married next year. but it has to be for all the right reasons. generally speaking the majority of 17 yr olds dont know wat they want and getting married may be a mistake, but you always have the few who grow up faster than others. if you are having doubts cuz of wat ppl say and ur questioning your age too much, DONT do it. cuz you may just regret it.|`|vejBlTO5aa	I can't answer for everyone, but the 2 couples I know who got married at that age in the last 2 yrs are both divorced already. Don't see what it could hurt to wait until you really know yourself and each other a little better.|`|639100282a044872ddf321481bbb4ac1aa	i thought u have to be 18 to get married unless the girl is pregnant she can be marrried at 16<br>  thats what people told me<br>  <br>  anyways for me  its not good to be married at 17<br>  but im not anyone to choose so its the girls choice|`|dHYVE076aa	I don't know you so I can't answer. Some 17 year olds are just as capable as 40 year olds at making a relationships work.|`|TYpvpaYxaa	way way way way way way too young.  no way can that end well.|`|rNE7XAmgaa	Way too young, you have to be really sure about this girl or guy. Don't want a divorce story.|`|UuSmemr7aa	yes.|`|CktiV6KJaa	It's illegal in most states.<br>  Does that answer your question?|`|DDIZsZWeaa	uhhhhhhh its kinda early but if you really think its the right thing go for it!|`|82XPLs8Zaa	whoa, yeah that is too young, you haven't explored what's out there yet|`|1B985Rtfaa	Yes!|`|CX5RGqZuaa	yes|`|gAFuXxY9aa	nah|`|HCaAUig4aa	stupid question,|`|FOWQ8d0Qaa	my mum got married at 17 :S
7e9f66e8183a6115754d5680f9ad5f36aa	I just want to be clear:<br>  <br>  You and your boyfriend are dating (not living together?)<br>  You have two children together<br>  He pays zero child support<br>  He won't help you make car payments<br>  He has two large trucks<br>  <br>  What, exactly, are YOU getting out of this relationship?<br>  <br>  I'm going to take a guess that the two children you share are not his only children.  This guy is a taker, a user and a leech.<br>  <br>  He's not doing anything to support the family he helped to create.  Is this the example you want your children to have as they grow up and figure out how to be mothers and fathers?<br>  <br>  You deserve better than this.  Your children deserve better than this.  There's an old expression that asks why a man would buy a cow when he's getting the milk for free.  Seems to me that expression could be about your guy.<br>  <br>  Dump him.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Sounds like he's a free loader. Take away his truck and keep it for yourself.|`|zprAkP3eaa	So you want him to pay your car payment?|`|fMEypXDYaa	Sue him for child support girl, he needs to pay for the kids, your not helping things by letting him get away with not paying you to support the kids, and quit having sex with the guy, he is just gonna knock you up again if you sleep with him.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	You are only treated as you allow yourself to be treated. You bore two children for this guy and he doesn't help you out ?? Take his sorry *** to court and get child support already. Think of your children if not yourself. Get a clue !!!  He's a JERK>|`|abDyYtLhaa	Do not stay with that guy, he sounds awful, immature, and selfish. You should be with the one who supports you, instead of bringing you down cause thats not what you need right now.<br>  Good luck!<br>  xxx|`|MQVmh5hiaa	Tell him if he doesn't start helping out I don't know how this can work.|`|PHkDtKcVaa	what the **** are you doing with this ******* *****???????????????????????????????????... sorry for the way I say it, but girl you need some better then that. OMG I would have left him a logggggggggg time ago!! like 4reals. I have a small Q. for you to ask your self? do you value your self???? do you have pride, dignity for yourself or what? or are you worth that piece of ****?!   ask your self that! you love him yea, ok but dose that help you pay the bills or take care of your self?|`|F5eKBBaXaa	Stay with him I love free loaders but for  some reason everyone hates me. O well maybe they are all jealous because I am beautiful.|`|LJ0fRcMGaa	i would tell him child support payments are a lot more expensive than car payments...and don't even think of marrying a guy like that!|`|0ktcvglRaa	He sounds like he's too immature to be having kids.|`|Rfrc80Hqaa	Probably not.|`|33lCc8mhaa	what a ******* JERK|`|x1FzJLwZaa	no he only thinks of himself go find a better bf|`|F8wzcKntaa	If he is the type of guy who will listen,then talk to him and tell him how you feel. But what I really think you should do is think about how you would feel if the tables were turned.Would he stay with you if you wasn't doing your half of taking care of your responsibilities. Having kids you need to think about them first!!!!!!!! Is this healthy for any of you,don't get mad at what you are about to read because I don't mean any harm. I was told by many people that "I can do bad by myself " and sweetheart you are in bad shape. It's to many men out here to be screwing around with a DEADBEAT. One last thing if you believe in GOD. PRAY on the situation.|`|zFqDvkJDaa	I would stay away from him till he says he will be be better to you. Good luck because men get angry next thing you know you will be calling the cops. Good Luck

S2xWbrgpaa	I think that your safest bet should be an LBD (little black dress). It can have wide straps and be "short but not too short" and can still hug your body in a very accentuating way. Just add lots of sparkly jewelry or eyeshadow to brighten your look. OR you can wear a LRD (little red dress) to really look spicy. Its a fool proof dress that makes you look amazing, and show just enough without going overboard. Your bf could wear dress pants, dress shoes, and nice collared shirt and a tie.|`|3J7xX66waa	it depends to how he likes you to be. HE(ur bf) or whoever you count on him,,,,
0ktcvglRaa	Let your friend know that you don't like him, and you can't help the fact that he likes you! She shouldn't be so immature about this, and she shouldn't even care since you don't like him back.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	you attracted the guy, which is not your fault. Tell your friend to grow up and not get mad over something that isn't your fault|`|ojwRgCLqaa	She's probably just jealous. It's not your fault so don't worry about it.

Let her know you are her friend and you like her. You are not interested in him and did nothing to make him like you. It is not your fault he likes you. People have different tastes. She feels hurt because he likes you instead of her. It makes her feel that she is ugly or not attractive. She is no seeing that guys may have different tastes and personality traits. Just because he is a guy and she is a girl doesn't mean he has to like only her.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Tell your friend you can't help that he likes you, but you have no interest in him.  Tell her that you hope he changes his mind and likes her.  Good luck|`|iQaKNSI6aa	u didnt do anyting, its just a crush and she will get over it, just wait till it passes|`|ABvnT9xKaa	You didn't do anything. He made that decision to like you, you have nothing to do w/ it. Don't worry about it, she's just taking it all out on you because she's really angry and don't want to blame it on herself. So she just used you to get her anger out.|`|5VdK2YUKaa	well first off.<br>  if you dont like him, tell yer friend. and let her know<br>  that its not yer fault, and that she should find another guy.<br>  <br>  ps. if she stays mad at you, it may be at the guy,<br>  and that shes sad. so give her time. (:|`|lzM5GBBKaa	Well, girl drama is always dumb. I've personally never experienced it on this level. So what I'd do is if she doesn't forgive you, shes obviously not a good enough friend. Find someone that will still luv ya no matter what dumb guys think or do.|`|TbhVNI6Taa	You did nothing! I've been in this situation before. Defend yourself and tell her that she's just jealous and making lies up because he likes you, not her. You didn't really steal him or anything. Just act cool and be confident that you're right. Best of luck.|`|Cih2eTqlaa	it sounds like somebody has a green monster on her back..<br>  his name is Mr. Jealous!!!<br>  if you haven't talked to her about it yet then do it now!<br>  if she doesnt listen, talk to him.<br>  if he doesnt listen well i cant help you there.<br>  sorry!<br>  good luck|`|wlWwoJs0aa	Obviously you didn't do anything<br>  If you don't react back to it,<br>  she can't blame you for anything.<br>  <br>  She's just upset about how he's not liking her back,<br>  and she's taking it out on you:/|`|qoxSB5Dfaa	you should tell her you dont like him,he likes you and you didnt mean to hurt her or anything, if shes your "friend" she should understand|`|NgeZASTYaa	Probably nothing.<br>  <br>  Girls are just catty.<br>  <br>  That's just the way it is.|`|D5UAhY8jaa	you go out with me then and the guy wont bother you lol im kidding or am I
8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Well, he's your friend and you know him better than  we do.  Your av shows some maturity, so you can probably handle it if he tries to cross a line.  Better yet, just go ahead and pick up the phone, give him a call and ask him for specifics so no one is surprised.  It's 2009!<br>  <br>  If you were 18-25, my answer would be different.|`|LUhh9bSWaa	No ...this is a perfect opportunity to stuff that beaver.  You'll be fine....and wake up with a grin on your face...and some dried crusty.|`|qXkTatLMaa	It doesn't sound that innocent.  He may be digging you, and see this as a way to get closer to you.  I do not think that I would take him up on it if I was opposed to being come on to by him.  And if he does come on to you, how would you feel about turning him down... if you want to.  And then how would you feel about turning him down, but still staying at his home.  Awkward.... There are many aspects to consider here.  If you do not feel anything for him romantically, then you may need to look into reserving a hotel room.|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	Do not assume anything. He is an adult male-- you say a 'former' friend. Is that a good idea in the first place? <br>  Make sure he has a sofa bed and tell him you intend to sleep on it, not with him.   <br>  Keep it right up front.|`|4d2B1hRBaa	Guys are never innocent. Enough said. If you want some action stay at his place. If you want "innocence", get your own hotel room.|`|9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	He definitely wants some action - never innocent when a guy asks you to do that.|`|YMgm99gdaa	Beware of the 4" wide dildos he has in the "guest" closet.|`|pTlnCNYJaa	Your never gonna know until you do it.|`|1OJgKMzVaa	How green are you. ?
29zyJ95Eaa	Well I can't read her mind because someone could do that but think you're reeeally ugly, DON'T assume that I'm calling you ugly.<br>  You're probably not.<br>  But she definitely wants your attention, she wants you to notice her.<br>  Do you talk to her?<br>  Have you talked before?<br>  If not... TALK TO HER!<br>  If I was to do that I would hope that the guy would notice me and start having a conversation with me.<br>  <br>  Unless, she is a pure air head like the oh so known Paris Hilton...|`|1UZMBxpeaa	didnt you just ask this?<br>  <br>  yes she likes you. ask her out.

I don't think you have a choice but to have DCF get involved.  Nobody wants to end up in a foster care situation.  I hope that someone else in your family will take some responsibility for you.

0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I agree with what you need to teach your daughter. Your husband has seen and lived in hell overseas, unfortunately, he brought some of it home. You are doing everything that you need to do, and in all honesty, you are on the right track.<br>  <br>  Your husband also (I'm hoping) saw the effects of his anger on your daughter. How did he react to that? It must have been just as terrible for him as it was for you.<br>  <br>  One of the most difficult and challenging problems a couple will ever face is combat stress. Stick to the counselling, and yes, it will take lots of work, but you know in your heart this is what you need to do. stick with the regular visits. It took a long time for him to get messed up, it will take time and support to get past it.<br>  <br>  I'm an army vet, and a former counsellor. I used to help people in transition from military life to civilian life and with addictions. PTSD was always showing itself in my line of work.<br>  <br>  Never forget why you were together in the first place.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	He must keep going to therapy. This may take several years to heal, because this is the root of everything, he went through too much, and being a  hearted person the worse is the emotional damage. Time and patience will work, love will work, but all together is what will work better.|`|c07v7O80aa	Figure out what you want without considering what it will teach your child. If it doesn't work, you sure don't want to be teaching her that you have to put up with a ruined marriage.|`|y21VcTjDaa	Maybe you should be getting some counselling for your daughter too...sounds like she's going to need some help coping with this.  I hope that she doesn't follow your example one day and let some guy knock her around.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, but I cannot understand any woman who stays with a man who hits her...even once!|`|d6c1c9b41cdd7f1278ae2d338064377daa	it is not up to you and you alone to talk to your child. you need to talk to your husband and tell him that what happened has had a very negative impact on your daughter and the two of you need to sit down and talk to her. he needs to tell her that daddy did a bad thing and that he loves mommy very much and he loves her and he will never hurt mommy again. now as for you, i understand what your saying that he has been through a great deal over there, but that is not an excuse for him to put his hands on you. now that you have decided not to give up on him, make sure you don't give on your self. you can not allow this to happen again, if it does, for the sake of your child and your self you will have no choice but to ask him to leave. good luck. and please make sure you and your husband sit down A.S.A.P. with your daughter.|`|ZFS55we5aa	There is no excuse for domestic abuse. Don't lie to yourself with claims that you stay with him for her. That look in your daughters eyes should be proof enough that she would be better off if you two separated. <br>  When a guy gets away with hitting a female he feels like he can say or do whatever he like and she will still stay. He doesn't respect you and you will eventually lose your daughter's respect if you stay in this situation|`|YMgm99gdaa	Be very careful with this.  There was some news about this (I even think 60 minutes or 20/20 did a story) on some people who come back from war have been extremely violent.  And in some cases they murder their wives and/or children.  If you see things start to deteriorate I would strongly suggest that you leave the residence until he gets things back together.  Let me say again, this can be extremely dangerous so proceed with caution.  Look it up on Google or something for more info.  Take care.|`|0hBXnqPIaa	did u hear about r&b singer chris brown and Rihanna!|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	What about your daughter?? Have you gotten her in to counseling (alone and with the two of you) to deal with her father's change of attitude (probably due to PTSD). How old is she? If she's just a baby, then of course counseling isn't going to do anything, but if she's old enough to communicate...well, I'd get her in to counseling too. <br>  <br>  There is NO EXCUSE for physical violence (or mental/verbal abuse). Make it really clear to your husband that you WILL NOT put up with it no matter what his issues are. Keep going to counseling, together and seperately...and time will heal.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Youre already doing the best thing you could ever do here. Youre showing that mommy and daddy really love each other and are trying to work thru some very special challenges in their life. Children are very smart and see reality for what it is so she understands and sees the love.As she gets older she will understand the rest, but she seesthe both of you together and not where did my daddy go and why. So you really are doing the best thing you can for her right now and Im impressed that you have taken such a positive attitude in saving your marriage where most would have thrown him out. Things will get better as it does sound like youre over the worst part.Hang in there and good luck|`|0cfba6ec58258d9277443cf769413b9eaa	your husband and you have gotten help but have you gotten help for your daughter (depending on her age) and if she is to young to talk then you should just try to comfort her as much as possible and not pretend to fight around her or if your husband gets angry try to keep him away from her so she won't see it and he should help in the comforting that way she knows that he is just joking and not really angry. I think you did the right thing by not leaving him this time but if he hits you again then I would say the best thing is to leave other wise your daughter will grow up thinking that this is ok and you know it's not and you have to do what is best for her and you. Your husband has been through a lot but that is still no excuse for him to lay his hands on you
lregX2Cpaa	he is doing this cuz he is a very stupid man. He does not know that he has something good happening to him right now and he is not use to it. I guess what he wants is to have power over but he still does like u a lot but he just doesn't know how to express it to someone he actually like a lot. So he doesn't want to lose that feeling of having power. So u have just got to tell him in some way and soon|`|ZzjUHawhaa	that is just a prime example of playing wit someones feelings and not really caring about what u are doing to the other person. u still have unfinished business with him; that is y u still want him and miss him so much. he is never going to call sweetie so just save urself anymore heartache and find someone who really cares for u.|`|vyHrvt0Zaa	He was letting you down easy.

lPvJI2mNaa	Love is such a confusing feeling to me. It scares me, and excites me at the same time. It's live walking into a room blindfolded. I love being in love, and feel empty when I don't feel that way, but sometimes it scares me how intense it gets. So yeah, I like the feeling all in all, but that's not to say it always feels great and happy go lucky. Sometimes it tears my heart out, and sometimes it brings me to my knees in agony. But it always makes me smile so much, and I randomly break out in song because of it too. That's how I feel about love.|`|eknuWrLLaa	**** yea!! Especially when your lover feels the same. OMG!...

Something is up on her end. If you're doing long distance she might feel lonely or bored.
3y0w1qIBaa	Well, from what I can tell, it seems that she is developing feelings for you.  Try asking her out for a movie.  If she said no, then simply respond back "just friends", this is a perfect comeback to prevent you from being humiliated.|`|ZLExTyoNaa	well. if she hugs her other guy friends either shes shy or shes just not that into you.<br>  lifes to short kiddo.<br>  ask her straight up,<br>  i DARE you. :)|`|xwDzek6uaa	Ask her out. stop torturing yourself by wondering. Ask her out and youll know immediately.|`|uLHtXibRaa	You gotta ask yourself..'Why is she so popular?'..then ask yourself how much do you really want to be around her ?|`|iW80AcLgaa	cry yourself to sleep|`|HqoOjAHVaa	try telling her how u feel and let her know that u are there for her

LFNF0ihZaa	I would just be yourself and try to start a conversation with him. To get noticed more, you should also just be yourself because you get noticed most when you act like yourself.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	be yourself<br>  talk to him relaxed<br>  don't be stupid<br>  <br>  populartity is overrated,<br>  you're truely noticed in high school|`|0lQtTE9Daa	haha you will look at this in three years and laugh. its only middle school relax. dont be a slut like those other girls your only in 6th grade. if you want the guy to notice you just talk to him and flirt with him, thats all you need to do.|`|WcoLUc8Laa	First off you are in middle school and once you get into high school like me then everything and everyone changes. You should just try to be yourself because guys don't always go for the cute ones.|`|98LDN0Quaa	clothing optional|`|mmBw7NUWaa	Those girls are in every school mainly known as sluts,fake,bitches,or just simply preps.You just have to grin and bear it sweetie.<br>  Anyway,you are in 6th grade and I wouldnt expect you to really make friends with eighth graders b/c Im in eighth grade and its a joke to us how underdeveloped you all are and we have other things to worry about like highschool.Anyway, I would try to um keep hygiene up b/c I know in this grade like the girls who wore no deodorant or didn't shave there legs and whatnot were really unpopular.I would also spend time on your hair too,dont wear makeup yet though your too young.Anyway, also I would try to develop your style more- but make sure its not like everyone elses;Im saying dont follow the crowd and be bold but not too bold. <br>  Also, I would try to be as friendly as possible to everyone in your grade(or just the cool kids) and also try to make friends with some cool seventh graders
e7HkdzNSaa	I've always believed that to meet the right girl/guy, you would have to become the right person beforehand so Love is definitely patient...so the right girl's worth waiting for as long as you acknowledge her presence and notice that she's come into your life for a reason.|`|c2jTBSn7aa	Ahaa. :]<br>  Wowzers.<br>  It means that you<br>  have to stop looking for her.<br>  She'll find you. It's really simple.<br>  Just live your life normally.<br>  Go hang out with friends.<br>  Keep your options open.<br>  Do your work and stuff.<br>  She'll randomly bump into you. :D<br>  Andd,Thanks. for answering my Question.<br>  I appreciated it. I Loled at the end. xD|`|85YtzzKraa	Well waiting patiently will allow time for you to work on you and when you're ready then the girl of your dreams will come! You might even know her!

You may just like someone becuz you feel like you should or need too. If it just happens, it's not expected. It's more real that way. I know a woman who met her husband at a loews.|`|Qv1zeDFvaa	"Be patient" is a way of saying "don't give your hopes up"<br>  I'm 32 years old....Been with lots of women, but now i'm dating a woman that I KNOW will be my wife.How?

gvKFzJf4aa	Ask her what kind of likes she has for you, sexual or non-sexual. I have many close friends. We are are straight, and we say that to each another alot. Our friendships are bonded, without any sexual feelings toward one another.<br>  <br>  You should be more open to her, and ask her what kind of like, sexual or non-sexual. If she has non-sexual friendship love for you, grab it. You will have the best friend for life.|`|KhCcGy25aa	Okay, if you are straight and she is not just tell her how you feel that you are straight and that you don't feel the same way back to her.<br>  <br>  Otherwise if you don't your friend will get the wrong impression of you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3reHk4I1aa	i like bettys idea but try not to be mean to her and just tell her the nice way and tell her that you are srry that you dont share the same feelings aback
c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	You're 15 CHILL.  Its not a big deal to not have a bf right now.  Maybe your problem is that you're too cool.  You're one of the guys so guys don't see you as a potential hottie.  They see you as their friend.  In high school its usually the slutty girls that date a lot and trust me, you don't want to be them.  Wait til you get to college.  That'll be your time to shine.  Its the people who think high school should be the best time of their lives that end up sadly mistaken.
yROLq2l1aa	um...say helloo!
6B6UPxT1aa	ITS BECAUSE YOU A SKUM BAG AND YOU HAVE NO HEART!!!!!!!<br>  AND OMG I CAN GO FOR DAYS WELL YA TELL HER SO YOU VAN BRAKE HER HEART LIKE ALL THE REST OF THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|JZ8rkTykaa	your heartless|`|PBDXgNBgaa	becuz ur a fkin pimp..ya digg.. i aint mad at u my ***. females do that shii all the time y feel bad. the get u for ur money n gas then say not to night..lmao.u digg me..i say what they dont knw dnt hurt them ya digg|`|hl4kkvXhaa	It may be because you saw a different side of yourself...a human side, and now you see how easy it is to slip and make a mistake.  Now...if you learned from this and it doesn't happen again, it just means you know you messed up and you're human...but if you think you might continue to do this, then yeah...you're a dirt bag.<br>  <br>  Or maybe you're a hypocrite who thinks it's wrong when someone else does something but that you're beyond reproach.  Part of me thinks that, if you don't feel guilty then it's probably because deep down you believe the relationship with your girlfriend is basically over, and part of you doesn't care about her feelings.  You might not want to hurt her, but you don't love her enough to have stopped yourself from cheating, or at least felt guilty afterwards.|`|4WZMto1oaa	its time for you to have a reality check GROW UP you sound like an enmature jerk if you can commit yourself to one person then you are not ready for a relationship and i think you should let  your girlfriend that before you totally break her hart you have to think about other peoples feelings and one more thing becareful going out there cheating with other girls there are alot of sexual trasnmitted diseases out there i hope you read this very carefully and think about what you are doind is very wrong|`|Wd8hcEkJaa	your an awful boyfriend. she should dump your ***. why cheat? if you like someone else, dump the girl your dating and date the other girl. its simple. seriously people, why cheat?|`|JcTk21laaa	you are a dirty horrible shitbag... <br>  thats pretty much it...<br>  (here's where your supposed to start feeling terrible)<br>  and apologize to her so she can decide whether she will dump your cheating a$$|`|gRXy66dOaa	cuz u have no heart<br>  no feelings*
xVKEVGUZaa	They know when you keep looking at them, or when you sit next to them and or flirt with them a lot. It was always easy for people to tell who I had a crush on, which I hated. But I always looked at my crush a lot. I daydreamed like a twit in those days. Some how they always catch you staring at them, and if they like you alot, they are always staring at you, unless they know you like them.
e6Kyqb22aa	Don't be too sensitive and don't imagine the worst possible scenario...like I do. I scare myself(same age as you btw)so much that I am glued to my bed and if my toe happens to go out I think someone will kill me lol, I know weird right? but if he is not far away no big deal...if you're really terrified, talk to your parents about you working there. Mabe they'd tell him to stay inside at all times. I wish you luck!|`|AA10757358	Tell you brother the next time he leaves you alone in the service station that you are walking out also.  Tell him how scared you were that night and that he had no right to leave you along while counting money and having customers.   You should always lock the doors and put you closed sign out before counting any money.  Do not count it where people from the outside can see it.  Your parents or brother should have told you this and it would have prevented you from being so nervous and upset.
o6ZNZzT3aa	nope, never have|`|aZHAmaudaa	Huh interesting question....... some girls like eating white "glue"
ynCJxyagaa	The proper way to respond is with politeness and respect in all places and at all times.|`|2c88J3M7aa	OH MY GOD.<br>  RUUUUNNNNNN ! =0|`|gjuVMkxzaa	AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  FREAK OUT AND SCREAM MY HEAD OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! btw y?
AA10776535	Oh No very bad idea.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Maybe taking this third person from his neck and putting him on the street will help..I′d do that. He′s not resolving anything, hi′s messing because he′s looking ahead of the entertaining thing after marriage|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	A properly trained marriage counselor or physcologist can work wonders in solving marital challenges but once that counselor gets too close to anyone they are trying to help then all perspective is lost and the challenges get more complicated. Friends should never try to solve a friends marital issues at all, nothing but a disaster waiting to happen. Once a marriage has terminated theres no controlling what happens afterwards|`|zAfKvhW4aa	Be a man and stand up for youself. Stand up for your marriage. Kick that guy out of your house.|`|RPhla0R7aa	nope!
szyrw5P0aa	he just crushes alot|`|4a88b6f3d78184085afa47effba9cfebaa	Mmmm, sounds like a player.<br>  You have to be SO careful - sooo many guys are players.<br>  There is absoluetly no reason why he should ignore you and then be interested again, that sounds fishy.<br>  You can do better, find someone who wants to get to know you a little everyday, not once a week or wen he feels like it.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|0vo7tDP5aa	haha. you can't just will yourself to stop liking someone. good luck with that one. the only thing that can happen is that he does things that genuinely destroy the attraction you have for him. however, you can't just turn it on and off like a switch.|`|slM9uHmnaa	Forget him girl, you're too good for that!|`|njl3mIbCaa	hes a player.my sister had a guy like that.And she fond out that he didn't really like her after a month.
TNjKwlA9aa	There is a possibility. One thing I tested and asked myself if I was really in love:<br>  <br>  Ask yourself:<br>  <br>  Would I die for this person?<br>  <br>  If this person left the country, would I cry?<br>  <br>  If I had to risk my life to save this person, would I?<br>  <br>  Fill in the blanks, and if you decide yes for each question, then your in love!|`|cdGzUG7paa	well we cant answer if you're going to be successful in life, if you're going to raise a good family, if you're in love. you tell yourself that because in true love you don't think of anything else when you're with that person but them. And if that's so and you notice other things you do when you're only with her it's true love.
dKUSJ23Qaa	some people take longer then others but its ok, go for him cuz as soon as he finds out how great u r, his ex will be the last thing on his mind
tWePoJYNaa	If you love him, I'm sure things can be fixed. Do something out of the ordinary! My boyfriend and I go through phases where we don't go out much and we get bored of our routine. We go to more parties when we're in one of those stumps. It's fun to just hang out with friends and then go home with him after! Of course, if you're younger that may not be realistic. If you think it's hopeless, maybe being just friends is better for you two. Who knows.|`|P7BfFo88aa	your contradicting yourself ! if you love him it should not matter if he is as boring as a snail.<br>  <br>  be careful how you use the L word called love.<br>  obviously you don't if you wanna break up because your bored.<br>  think about how this is gonna make him feel.<br>  <br>  but if you wanna throw away all the time you both put in this then do what you want.|`|p3mBh6zQaa	Just because your relationship is "GETTING" boring<br>  is noo reason to break up with someone<br>  do something to spice it up<br>  have a party or something !?<br>  If you love him then don't <br>  you shouldn't break up with him just because it's boring<br>  now it is . later it'll be exciting .<br>  so see where it goes then decide later !|`|fq2Cffy6aa	talk to him about it, tell him that ur getting bored with the relationship chances are he is to and you can work on it together|`|HoUdB8COaa	try make it exciting babez....be outgoing be random be silly give it a chance if u love him how could u even ask this question|`|rkkyNwBqaa	follow your heart|`|Vh3TGfdEaa	try to get intimate with him
YR9l82vmaa	you've got a bit of a belly, if that's what you're talking about.<br>  <br>  but yes, most everyone has a stomach. unless it has been removed and they are being fed on IVs. which, from the picture, does not look like it applies to you.|`|0lQtTE9Daa	you do not have a stoumach. didnt even need the picure. i used logic to figure out that anyone without a stomach would not be alive. i figured out your alive because if you were dead you could not ask this question. duh. haha but really no you dont your fine ;)|`|hCpqhn27aa	You kinda need a side pic to be able to tell something like that. But it looks like you've got a slight one just based on that pic.|`|CFjFaKBzaa	Are you a guy? The angle of the picture makes you look pregnant. Not trying to be rude, sorry.|`|nRcSFAxlaa	yes, most people do. it's part of the digestive system.
mcYeXxptaa	Honestly?<br>  Usually girls who go around having heavy sex with tons of guys need to be appreciated. Obviously, that way of going about things (giving sex to get love) invariably causes permanent emotional damage, and probably even reinforces the feeling of worthlessness for the girl.<br>  <br>  The best thing you could do is be her friend. A platonic friend since you dont feel that way about her, but take care of her, you know? Keep her safe and help her realise she's worth a lot more than she thought.|`|JK2RvliYaa	Those things ain't horrible.. probably just normal human things, I suggest you get off your high horse!
W8GMnYMZaa	If you start causing a scene its going to make you look crazy.  He'll think it was a good idea dumping you because you look crazy and other guys might have second thoughts about being interested in you.  The best thing to do is also the hardest thing to do...pretend like it doesn't bother you and flirt around...
L1ob0kXnaa	I don't think this is really enough information to decide if she likes you or not but it's definitely a possibility so go for it.
kVQrAYMyaa	i think your really beautiful actually. and im being honest i swear!<br>  i thought you looked alot like Vennesa Hudgens but more natural.<br>  <br>  i think you could be a model for sure!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|PwkYJoVgaa	mabey, honestly. 1-10....7? your very beautiful/pretty though=)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  help me on my questions please=)|`|Ddfff5psaa	I'm so sorry but no way, you  don't have anything special about you, and your not that attractive.|`|J3W93q55aa	only  you can answer that question. always follow your dream|`|uqwL9544aa	With photoshop and a couple of softboxes you could be a 5.|`|JajEhcsUaa	No|`|2AAhiwgnaa	no|`|40H9dPTHaa	no, models don't have acne|`|o6ZNZzT3aa	Well, i'd rate you a 7, but do you really want to go through all of the PAIN of being a model???????????????? think about it, its not easy, and this may sound weird, seeing as i'm not, but i know what its like, in a way, and i'm sure that most sane girls wouldnt want to do it, if they only knew...|`|bYakT177aa	Yessss you are perfectly gorgeous. I would rate you 10 on account of beautifulness. You didn't really show your body that much, though, but still there are models who don't have a fantastic body, but still who model because they have good bone structure, confidence, walk, etc.|`|19iD220Jaa	I think you could... I would suggest alil make up or proactive. I think you are pretty tho...( im not bi . by the way) I think you just need a support group to build your confidence and or self esteem. YOU GO GIRL|`|ne0EjucSaa	Erg. Dont you just hate it when people call you ugly when they dont have a pic of them self!!<br>   any one can be a model no matter what models come in any kind of form your pretty . hmm. thats about it good luck with the modeling|`|GdgHSFY4aa	psh.. come on... model? wouldnt you rather have a career in something that is really important like a doctor or a photgrapher or something like that.. i guess you could be a model if you really wanted to..|`|CX7FtsCMaa	5 - average <br>  i dont think a model is a very good carrer path tho :( models have to be tall and you dont look that tall , plus looks doesnt mean everything in modelling|`|WYZPI9buaa	7 ur pretty|`|F8wzcKntaa	you are pretty and as far as a model not sure but I'll give you a 7 1/2|`|8m3Hx0jKaa	if you wanted to be. <br>  you are adorable!!! i wanna give you a hug!<br>  but fallow your dreams|`|aZHAmaudaa	8..... and maybe|`|eNXRHD09aa	sure!|`|sQTMvSYqaa	no, but your daughter could|`|xxyaYG0caa	idk bout a model, but i give u a 7|`|2Zoq6Lj5aa	your very cute. i think you got what it takes.|`|6PwhYOhIaa	I'll give you a 6 1/2<br>  Probably no with the modeling.|`|yHaGnT4gaa	no<br>  i'd give u a -5|`|2YC8QGkEaa	4.<br>  <br>  You don't have the facial bone structure that models do. Plus, you didn't give us your height and weight to see if it could be like a model.<br>  But your face already made the decision to not be a model for you.|`|07plDK15aa	Uhh nope. You're definately not ugly...just a 6. You wanted to know!|`|BDCC4popaa	the pic sucks...get it right ugg bag.  the only thing you could model is dog food.|`|CccEgzqmaa	i think you could<br>  ~Pam|`|Xw37uAkWaa	No, maybe a 5.|`|vslC8rB0aa	No. 6/10.

You should look into modelling for that.<br>  <br>  I'd say your about a seven because your cute looking. You could pull off a sexy look, but you'd have to change quit a bit to pull that off.|`|gPtt8e0iaa	Well I wouldn't go so far as to say that you couldn't be a model or that you could be a model, but I would say that it would be more towards the not end of the spectrum.<br>  <br>  Plus your mom is hot.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	6 average|`|iW80AcLgaa	maybe, but probably not
v9Zv9aGzaa	It means you have someone to love, kiss, and have sex with|`|MQVmh5hiaa	What are talking about?|`|702f83b079a03568e52b59e470049ba4aa	means you have someone to kiss|`|uqwL9544aa	You forsake your soul.|`|uLHtXibRaa	Your body is no longer your own..lol..|`|jVJMd5nQaa	you should love her!!!!!

onny0Rgtaa	i think hes trying to play you both over if there really even was a second girl. he is probleay just trying to get as much as he can. i used to have the same problem and thats how i thought. all i cared about was dating and who to date but now i regret it all because now i cant seem to find anyone anymore. if you find that he is playing girls over tell him to stop because no one told me and look were i am now. as far as you wondering if it was a good idea or not it probleay was because he obviously wanted you to know about this other girl. if he tries to come back i say dont casue he hurt you once so theres no reason he wouldnt hurt you again.|`|Qy9mH2s7aa	PURPLE XD|`|Dob2OhIYaa	it sounds like he was trying to get you jeolus, age should really matter in your decision unless your like 18 and hes 40 cuz thats just messed up but like it sounds like he still might have feelings for you, and you might just have feelings for him, have a big tought day to think about it think of the possible reasons why you like him then the reasons you dont want to go out with him or if it could be you just want closness with a guy or something|`|4d2B1hRBaa	If he would even want to take the chance in hurting you (LIKE HE DID) about telling you about another and about how this other girl is "amazing" and all that, he OBVIOUSLY doesn't care about you enough for you to be wasting time worrying about what he thinks, he obviously doesn't care what you think. He's not worth your time. If he was he would of been 100% devoted to YOU ONLY since the day he met you, not telling you about other "amazing" dates!|`|8th9KY1haa	AGE,AGE,AGE,We need to know your age in order to give an educated answer or advise.

0ktcvglRaa	I have a friend who has always been into older guys. She especially likes guys in their late 20s to early 30s. She's 18 now, but she's been at this since she was 14 or 15.

g7uMKvEzaa	You obviously care alot for this guy..Something about him caught and kept your attention...People sometimes try to generalize all people and give their unwanted opinion about things they shouldn't...If it is you mother or dad, chances are they think he isn't good for you and they may be afraid of things like his actions, his habits they don't like, his age,, and things like that...They think they are trying to help you by telling you to keep away...That might make you only want him more..I would talk to your parents about him and ask them in a sincere way why they don't think he and you should be together...If they know ,and truly get to know this guy they might like him ,,,but I find ,they will seek out his bad things way before his good things...That is what many people usually do..They are only conserned about you and want the best. I know , my daughter started dating a guy that drank and smoked but she ended up loving him and helped him with his drinking habits and trying to get him to kick the habit of smoking...She has made him find a purpose to want to be a better person and stop things that are doing him wrong. It can and does work..Alot has to do with age too...But this is between you and him...Than  your parents and his...But all others should just keep out of it..It does NOT concern them at all...Love is a funny thing and if it is Love it will survive no matter what others say.. GOOD LUCK!|`|35xruAUYaa	Screw the other people. There is goodness in everyone and you can see it in him, so make your own decision. Don't let them make it for you.

Like an actual slug, or a person you are referring to as a slug? Either way, why let them in at all?
2uxaGUNqaa	The only way you're wasting your time, is if you really want to be in a relationship and don't tell him. I would think it would be obvious you have some feelings for him if you're making love to him, and even getting with him when he's talking to other girls. Tell him how you feel, and that you would like to be with him, since basically you already are. And if he doesn't want to be with you, then I would say stop seeing him because you're wasting time. The only reason he'd be turning you down, is so that he wouldn't technically be in a relationship and could keep talking to other girls. And if that's the case, you need to find someone who will really love you to settle down with. Not one just using you for your body and pleasure. Think about it, what if the guy gets you pregnant? You're not going to be his number one priority. If you're giving him sex when he wants it, what makes you sure you're not the only one doing so? Be careful.|`|e44119010390a00af9488defd455d797aa	He is taking you got granted. I know this is hard but if you really want to have a relationship with him, you need to give him space. No texting, no talking, dont see him, nothing. Time will go by, could be a a couple of weeks could be a couple of months, you have to be strong. If and when he comes around, and comes back to you, he'll want to settle down.|`|2YC8QGkEaa	Yes, you're basically his prostitute.|`|m3C3tb9Eaa	badjojo.com<br>  glad to help.<br>  :D|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	yep...|`|VTyyDaUIaa	You sound like me. I was in a similar situation, and recently ended it...or whatever it was. I'm 25 and he is 29. I think he was afraid of a commitment and I got sick of waiting, so he lost.

When I would bring up relationship type conversations with him he would get so pissed off. I recently started dating again and found a great guy.|`|oKoABzNtaa	This is a relationship.  He might not be committed to you, but it's still a relationship.<br>  <br>  So.  Why, after letting him waste your time for four years, are you allowing yourself the delusion that he's *ever* going to commit?|`|Ps0tDYBAaa	its called a piece of *** on the side, which is what he sees you as. get rid of him.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Yes, it's called a frequent customer.|`|gRXy66dOaa	yeah u could*

xzMUxGpgaa	Hi there, you are nice to want to be there to help others in their time of need. Death is an issue that we each handle differently. Some just like to be by themselves, while others like to surround themselves with friends. There is no correct way. <br>  <br>  If your friend wants to talk and just needs you to listen, you will know. I will give you a piece of advice that I have noticed. When someone dies, a lot of time others will stay away from those that lost the person. It is mostly because they are not sure what to say to them. But what they don't realize is that most people need the support of others and it is ok to talk about the dead person. So if you are needed to listen or to even talk and ask questions about the dead person, it is alright. Your friend will let you know by their actions. No correct way of doing this, but you will be able to tell just by watching and listening. I think it is wonderful though that you are a caring person. We need more people like you that does care.  Thanks.  Aunt DeeDee.

Bi7zxniPaa	Completely agree with everyone who has mentioned her being shy and busy as opposed to plain rejection.  She might not be used to guys approaching her in that way. As a guy, its not always in our nature to know if wer'e being rejected and i understand your question.  <br>  On the other hand the timing might be off with finals around the corner and we all know how stressful it can be around that time.  The last thing on her mind is meeting someone new (maybe).  <br>  Her giving u her number (if real) says a lot though since she could have just said she had a bf. You been around a few months so I assume she seen u several times and its obvious your just a reg. student studying.   <br>  Definately see her in person and pay attention to her reaction/body language/eye contact when she sees u.  Approach her like u normally due and let her update u on her weekend etc.  If she's the shy type u don't want to come on strong but be assertive.  If she doesn't mention your proposal then it might be that she's not interested or is just really busy.  <br>  Casually bring up having coffee again and just feel her vibe if possible.  She will probably give u a straight answer this time around.|`|N29mJ8qfaa	I don't think she really rejected you, maybe it's the truth but it doesn't sound real. Your plan seems good though, maybe try texting her though, if you ARE rejected, it won't burn as much. Good luck!|`|dD6XLDqlaa	If she gave you her number, she doens't hate you.  It seems positive.  I would make sure it's actually her number though.  If she is quiet/shy, she probably really is busy and has things going on.  Since she gave you here number, I would think everything was good.|`|aIEezfgaaa	im sorry btu i think she was just trying to be nice. shy girls get alarmed reallll easy and you came on a bit to fast<br>  <br>  give it some time and call a week after finals|`|98LDN0Quaa	ask her in person...dont look to desperate just in case she's just not that into you|`|2Zoq6Lj5aa	i would prolly ask her when shes free if its hard to get a date set up.|`|Ad41yDKhaa	it sounds to me like she's just a little shy and doesnt know you that well. i think texting her might come across as a little creepy, most definately call her. as for asking her on the phone or on monday is up to you. go with your gut. also if she still says she's busy it'd be good to talk to her to make sure if she's really busy or if she just doesnt wanna hang out with you. if she says she's busy then make sure that she knows that you understand but just want to know for sure if she's busy or rejecting you. hope that helped a bit|`|fJ0csRIIaa	why don't you give her your number? tell her you understand how hectic the next couple of weeks will be preparing for finals, but if she needs a break from studying she should give you a call and you can get a quick cup of coffee. Maybe the "get to know you better" thing threw her off. How about that you find her interesting and can always use a new friend.
k7Pd7Glqaa	Very interesting question.<br>  Being cheated on: done all of the things you asked and more!  I lost my self esteem, my trust in other people, I had a terrible experience after my husband cheated on me, but we eventually got back together.  Today,  we are getting along great!  The Past Is the Past.  However,  the emotional scars it left on me will never heal, because I actually shot myself,  I had every intention on dying.   Thank God and He is the only reason I am here today, for the bullet passed through the small hole that opens when your heart takes a beat!<br>  That is how close I came to spending Eternity In Hell,, all over a man who took my whole life away from me.|`|914eae329dc013f1fa679fc3425c5a61aa	1. yes, for a period of time<br>  2. yes, for a period of time<br>  3. yes and no, I'd be hurt and upset, don't know about insecure<br>  4. no<br>  <br>  and I've been on both sides of that, cheating and being cheated on, neither was a pleasant experience. and I'll tell you this much, I will never take my partner for granet again nor will I tolerate a partner cheating on me again.<br>  <br>  a hard lesson learned|`|ibaLRXY2aa	I was cheated on by my ex-fiance. He didn't even try to hide it. He wanted us to all be friends and hang out together! I think he was trying to work up to a three-way. What a perv. I certainly did 1, 2, 3, and 4. I tried to do 5 when she dumped him, but they were back together a week later, so I gave up.<br>  <br>  If I'm ever cheated on again, I will end the relationship immediately and not think twice about it.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	1. No<br>  2. No, could care less about them<br>  3. Yes, I'm a lot more careful now and pay more attention<br>  4. In a way. I want to do so much better than them and have a happy marriage (whether they see it or not). I've never cheated on anyone and they will probably be alone forever.<br>  5. No I did not stay|`|H6Lc79EOaa	I've only experienced cheating before marriage, before engagement.  My thoughts are: if it was a mistake, and the cheater expresses regret, you can move on.  If the cheater tries to play games, make it your fault, acts like they don't care, then they actually wanted to get caught and want to leave, and you should let them leave and move on to better things.  You have to look at the circumstances.  Was it on-going?  Was he spending money he shouldn't have?  If he truly regrets it, it was a mistake.  Sex is nothing, especially to guys.  I fear more for the emotional side of things.|`|nnsuWIVYaa	I truly do love myself. I would never let anyone disrespect me by staying in the relationship.<br>  <br>  No revenge.  silence is the best way to end a bad relationship.  just walk away.  he will always be asking himself why you did not care.  <br>  <br>  Love hurts but we all learn from it.  it life.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|G9ruFZtbaa	All of the above<br>  <br>  I would say a little less on the bitter and insecure side but AMPED but the practical side.

I felt bad about it all and thought he just went after something that was offered, my spouse was the one that had all that coming.<br>       She had a strange feeling about it all, her two sisters and father were the same, it's there, it's yours and life is short, use it.<br>  <br>        Well I told her that if it happens again I won't say what's going to happen I won't say when, I will find out eventually and then it will happen, she asked what will happen, I told her she didn't want to know. She could leave now, after fifty two years of marriage or stay and cheat again.|`|IM1bLPf6aa	It did all of the above! Really does hurt, but if you try hard you can forgive. you cant forget though!!!<br>  Yes i did stay but more for my kids than the relationship. Sounds wrong but in that situation you do what you have to do!
J18K52Wtaa	I tend to watch how people treat their parents.<br>  This will give you a good indication of what type of person they are.|`|4tDTQOgNaa	Well if you think about it's almost like an interview. People's first impression is by someone's clothes, personality, and character. I would say I judge people on their character most importantly.|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	I judge people by their personality and their actions. Of course, when you first meet someone most people get a first impression based on looks until they have a chance to talk with the person. I have found that the old saying "never judge a book by it's cover" is very true. The one thing I do pay attention to is the first instinct I have about a person. You know, the feeling you get when you are around someone for the first time. It's either a positive or negative vibe. I think many people can surprise us if we just give them a chance and talk to them for a while. I also believe that actions speak louder than words.|`|Vh3TGfdEaa	judge people by the content of there character|`|5bt3ujJraa	There personality & what they say|`|S2xWbrgpaa	At the first impression, how they speak

Thanks.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	This is totally immoral and in most places illegal, that's two good reasons, is that enough.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	I would suggest working up to the question over a glass or 2 of wine, then send me the vid and I will rate it for you, good luck.|`|UYTdVcDkaa	First question: Heck yeah it would be ok for her friend to film you.  Who knows, she may want to put the camera down and join the two of you.  Dude, you could be hittin' your wife and her friend.  <br>  <br>  Question the second: Just do as suggested in an earlier posting and oil her up with a glass or three of wine (or her alcohol of choice) and some chocolate.  Then compliment her on the great job she did taking the stills of your wife.  If she says something like "I enjoyed it" or "It was my pleasure" you bring up the video suggestion.<br>  <br>  The best part is the answer to your third question.  If she says no, or doesn't allow the opportunity for the question, I'll do the filming.|`|c07v7O80aa	One thing you just have to face. Humans who aren't being film by experts and directed by talented directors just look ridiculous while having sex. To see what I mean, buy a camcorder and tripod and go to it.|`|pYtXrnDfaa	That is disgusting.  I would never film someone else, friend or not.  I certainly would not want them filming me.|`|OojlfDlBaa	I think if the friend is comfortable with the idea then it is fine. If it was me and it was a best friend I would probably ask her in private without my husband present. It would make the situation less akward. If my close friends asked this favor of me I would be more than happy to assist. If it was just a casual friend I would probably say no but in a nice way. Hope this helps!|`|pTlnCNYJaa	Kinky, if the friend  is okay with that go for it and just ask her straight up. I've never thought of filming another couple at it, dont think I'd like to either.

bc5421ca108468c9f896e074e44712daaa	1) No, it's not bad that you haven't had a girlfriend. But is it be choice? or have you asked girls out and they've said no?<br>  <br>  2) I personally think looks do count in some way. First a girl will go by looks and see if a guy is attractive and then they'll get to know the personality<br>  <br>  3) If she likes you too, you should talk to her and then once ya'll build some kind of relationship ask her out<br>  <br>  4) I dont think you should wait. Just be confident. <br>  <br>  5) I think you could have a chance with any girl if you clean your looks up. I really think you should fix your eyebrows.<br>  <br>  6) I personally wouldn't date you because i already have a boyfriend and you're not my type. But good luck with your girl "issues" and i hope whoever the girl is, she says yes<br>  <br>  (:|`|AA10814202	so this is advice coming from an eighteen year old girl if that helps with anything but listen:<br>  first of all i never had a boyfriend, never been kissed, never asked out by anyone. i thought that something was wrong with me too but within the last five months, i found my special someone and everything changed so fast. so my point is this: it doesnt matter if you are 6, 16, or 26 when you find your someone. age doesnt matter and just because you havent found someone yet, does NOT mean something is wrong with you. <br>  second of all, to answer your next questions, for some girls looks matter more. looks are the first attraction but obviously they arent the only one. for me personally, looks are not that important as personality. to me, the guy has to have a shining personality and character. he needs to be decent, funny, and most of all, understanding and not a D I C K.<br>  third, if you really like this girl, you should definitely tell her how you feel. if she feels the same way, she will go out with you. however, you say that you love her but its kind of hard for me to believe that you are in love with her, but i ll take your word for it. most guys think at first they know what love is and they might even think they are in love but in reality, its just infatuation and affection and attraction...not love. but think about this, would you still love her even if she was to be with someone else. would you be able to be happy for her? but anyways, you should also be okay with the thought of her saying no. either way, its better to have asked and her say no rather than not ask at all. i have learned that the hard way and trust me, you much rather tell her than forever hold your truth. you dont want it to haunt you for the rest of your life and you dont want to be going thru life thinking " What IF"<br>  and fourth, looking at the pictures, you really are not even fat, but just chubby. Losing weight is best always because you do have a good looking face and i am sure once you lose weight, your face will outshine even more.however, i think that if she really likes you then your weight shouldnt even be an issue. you really are not fat and i dont think that should be such a big issue that you want to wait until the summer time to ask her out. better to ask now and if she says no then you lose your weight and try again later. and lastly, you are not ugly and you do have a chance with girls. you need to be more confident and you have to think that you look good. girls dont like it when guys arent confident or think that they are ugly fat or whatever. so yeah i hope that helped and to answer your last question, yeah if you had the same personality as my current boyfriend and he looked just like you, i would go out with you. <br>  <br>  good luck aasking out your girl.|`|rkkyNwBqaa	just ask her  out and youre cute :)<br>  <br>  help pls<br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ahjedc41F.PMPajnnd6EEv_AFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090306205256AA5ICtL">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|vD0Nkjvfaa	you def have a chance, just be yourself, and btw you have a good sense of style., that'll come in handy. lol, so yeah, umm, try losing weight NOW instead of wait till summer, so then you'll be ready for the summer to pick up girls at the beach or w/e|`|70iHXEvqaa	Hey! =)<br>  <br>  1) There is nothing wrong with you! I promise :)<br>  <br>  2) Girls LOVE a guy with a great personality! But looks do also play a part.. But not a huge one!<br>  <br>  3) Thats so cute you dream about her! =D If you have never asked a girl out.. the first time might be a little hard for you! Do It casually! don't just flat out ask her to be your girlfriend. Just ask her to go somewhere with you! Try your hardest not to make it awkward while asking though.. that gives off the impression of low confidence, and girls like a guy with confidence.. but hate a guy that's argent! to much ego is not good!<br>  <br>  4) Your not fat. That shouldn't matter anyway! I wouldn't wait till summer! To long, and she might have a boy friend by then! Ask her while she's available! <br>  <br>  5) you are not ugly!! =) you absolutely have a chance! I'm just going to say one thing! I really don't want to be mean! But it will help! if you get you eyebrows waxed that might help your appearance a bit! I know it sounds like a girl thing.. but I have a lot of guys friends who get there eyebrows waxed! And it looks very good! =D<br>  <br>  Good Luck!! =)
BltBopVgaa	Okay, if you've been friends for two years and have a crush on him you should either explain your feelings towards him or try to find out if he feels the same way.If he doesn't,its ok you will always be friends.You can't force some one into a relationship.But if he likes you and you like him,you should be careful about getting into a relationship with him because from my friends previous experiences;the boy (which she was friends with before they went out) and her ended up breaking up and not talking and this ruined their friendship.Not saying this will happen with you.But be careful,think wisely,and good luck! =]|`|ZBDk7ISvaa	typically, if a guy likes you he'll ask you out or he would do anything to spend a lot of time around you.

BaguqDHiaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  It seems to me, that he likes you, but maybe his friends don't, and that he may feel embarrassed being around you while around his mates.<br>  <br>  Seems Pretty sad... i would dump him and find someone who appreciates you and is proud to show you off!<br>  <br>  But that's just my opinion ;)<br>  <br>  Thx
zXYh2umoaa	No!!<br>  <br>  People are sometimes opposite of there soul mate.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Not really: I have diplomas from three Universities, I read at least two books a week. I read two newspapers and the 'Net, I keep up with the news. <br>      My wife has never read a book, she only looks at a newspapers sale section. She's a high school graduate though.<br>  <br>       She has absolutely no interest in anything outside the home. She doesn't like to cook, I do most of it. She doesn't know we just got a new dryer, I do all the wash. I share the dishes and cleaning with her. As long as A&E is on, she's quiet and, she's no longer interested in sex. By the way, we've been married for over fifty- two years.|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	Yes, definitely.  A successful relationship is about a balance between doing those things you love together, and doing things with others (family, friends).  But it is also very important that one or the other does not feel he/she has to be doing things with their spouse all the time.  <br>  <br>  I enjoy spending time with my husband, doing "our" things together, and when I think about "what if", meaning, what if we didn't have those common things to hold us together, I wonder what we'd be doing with each other. I truly enjoy the things we do and I love doing those things with him because we both share that same passion. The reason you are attracted to a person might be one thing, but the things that hold the relationship together involve just being a couple!  And doing those shared-interest things a couple should do.<br>  <br>  That said, it is equally important that each person does not feel suffocated or that they have to spend this day, and that time with their spouse, or at least that's the case for me.  I love to be with friends and there are things we do together my spouse wouldn't even consider. <br>  <br>  So basically, yes the need to have the same interests.  Views, well that helps too.|`|mCUNl9Wgaa	Not necessarily, but it can be difficult if you do not. The pros of having different hobbies and professions is that there is actually more to talk about at the end of the day.<br>  <br>  Initially I had a hard time coming to terms with my husbands political philosophies and the fact that he was not religious, but we got over that.|`|AA10776535	In a way yes or you both have to agree to disagree on certain things.  Its better for the relationship if you have the same views and interests, makes living together much easier.|`|y21VcTjDaa	Not at all, but each partner must agree to disagree respectfully.<br>  <br>  Sharing the same views and interests, etc would be mind-bendingly boring.  Intellectual stimulation is so important in any relationship.|`|512dd30dd4fa35da6b4c826537a039ccaa	Yes, and the woman is supposed to bend to the man's wishes as long as they aren't sinful.|`|b34a54682dc09f70279f26554322d78aaa	For me, I think it's VERY important to share religious views.  I love my God and my Lord, so it only makes sense to stay with someone who also share the same passion.  I also think it's important to share similar core values, for example on how to raise our kids and how to save/spend money and share similar views on future goals/ambitions and such as well.  And yes I also think it's nice to have same political philosophies, but this doesn't matter as much ya know?<br>  <br>  I could care less if he has different hobbies or professions, it's all about compromising and learning to accept our differences.|`|OhiNV9a4aa	Mine and my husband's relationship is not successful and we have none of the same views or interests. (I could never have anything in common with such a loser.)|`|aCMkyR3saa	i think its  good to have SOME of the same morals, values and hobbies   but everything doesnt have to be the same for the relationship to be successful...by being different you can teach eachother|`|YMgm99gdaa	Yes on religious/political philosophies because they indicate your stance on moral issues.  Hobbies and such...not as much, but in some cases...yes.

MQVmh5hiaa	#1 I think the best way to tell him is strait up. but b4 telling him that tell him what you do like about him but that you don't like him that way.<br>  <br>  <br>  #2just tell him that ur more comfortable with just being buds and that ur not feeling the urge to take it to the next level! <br>  <br>  <br>  #3 Be upfront with him. Be careful of what you say, and don't try to avoid hurting him to the point that you lead him to believe that if he holds out long enough, you will change your mind. You may have to give the dreaded "Just Friends" speech that no one really wants to hear, but if he can't be your friend, he REALLY won't cut it as a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  #4 "I like you to much as a friend then to ruin it by going out with you." If he does not get it then you can tell him that you think of him as a friend and only as a friend.<br>  I hope i help!!|`|ed72c617bb10153eb98393db9edf6b5aaa	just let him know that you are not interested in him that way|`|31wQMeMcaa	I would first say "I want to talk about our friendship." By starting off with the word friendship, it will be clear off the bat that you aren't into him in any way other than being friends. Sometimes guys can be a little thick and have selective hearing, so you might want to say something to emphasize that you don't like him as a potential boyfriend. If you don't want to hurt his feelings you could say that having him as a friend means more to you having any other kind of relationship. Tell him that when people become more than friends, it usually doesn't last, and you would rather keep him as a life long friend. Or you could just make out with someone else in front of him. That might get the message across...|`|pjLqg6pgaa	Well, I have been in the same situation. You should just tell that guy that you don't like him that way. Well... I told that guy that, and he cried o.O.... Ahahha.. Yeah... If you dont wanna hurt his feelin than ust tell him gently... If he doesn't stop like botherin you... just ignore him. The guy (THAT I HATE NOW) I really WANNA KILL HIM! But oh well... just ignore him... And just tell him u JUST wanna be FRIENDS! xPP<br>  <br>  Good Luckk! :]]

Not even looking back.|`|gRXy66dOaa	here are some tips*<br>  <br>  Just have fun making someone's life a little worse (just a little) when they expect you to be down in the dumps. <br>  <br>  Smile a lot, dress well, flip your hair. Basically, look happy and self-assured, and hopefully a little disdainful of your ex. <br>  <br>  If your ex has a new partner, do not be condescending towards them. <br>  <br>  This means that you should be incredibly nice to them but don't treat them like a 6 year old. <br>  <br>  Become closer to your guy friends and flirt in front of him this will make him realize that he lost an AMAZING girl. <br>  <br>  If your ex has a new partner then become realy close. And when he <br>  tries talking to you make short conversations but make it interesting so he will want to talk more.|`|T02BJJGjaa	I don't know your age but it really doesn't matter.   It's time to learn how to grow up.   He's your ex for goodness sake... leave him alone.   There's a saying that says "do unto others as you want them to do unto you" which clearly means to treat others good all the time so you in turn can be treat the same.    You get out of life what you go after so why not take the right road and just be a nice person?????|`|eXRyCdvwaa	u ask som1 else to kiss u i guess. srry bout my horrible brain. i'm only in the 5th grade.|`|1OJgKMzVaa	Sounds like you are the one who is jealous. Move on with your life he has.
pZA16dloaa	I'm just 16 and have the same problem. I'm not a sports star but I'm smart and can be fun to be around too.<br>  <br>  Just take it easy and let it happen. Flirt with a bunch of girls. Not seriously, i'm not suggesting being a player, but just enough to get yourself mentally in their heads so that you're thought about. You have time. Let it happen|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Are there girls you want to get with?  If so, make sure you pay more attention to them then other people, say nice things and sweet things to them.  If you are smart and fun, they'll start hanging around in hopes you will date one (or more) of them.  Then it'll be up to you to make the move and just ask one of them out.  Doesn't have to be a big expensive thing; could be just going to the movies or for a walk or to lunch/dinner.  Just somewhere you can feel relaxed enough with each other to get to know the other.  The holding hands and kissing will come along.  It is not unusual at 15 to not have had these experiences yet.  I have one nephew (who is now 21) who has never had a one-to-one relationship with a girl, he has dated them and kissed them (I assume) but just nothing even close to serious yet.  He's a jock and prefers to spend his time playing sports and trying to get his life in order.  I have another nephew who's 17 and has never been on a date with a girl; he has female friends and girls he hangs out with.  He's in a band and is tall, dark and cute but just doesn't want a girlfriend yet, doesn't want to put the time and effort into making any one girl happy.|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	Keep it that way.  Your future wife will thank you for it.  Believe me.|`|AG4Spieqaa	Well if you spot a girl you like you say something like "hi not something like"will you go out with me"right away get to know her better.And if your REALLY nervous ask a friend to tell her something like"Hi my friend we'll like to get to know you better and would like to go on a date with you." And if the girl likes your friend be a girl or make your friend that's a boy tell her things that he likes what she DOESN"T like and get your friend to tell her likes and dislikes if you like what she dislikes say it nicely, she'll get over it. And same with girls.|`|3EjaVKj6aa	well i've got a friend just like u and my advice is i'm secretly liking him so if u like a grl u should ask her out. if she says no don't get discouraged AT ALL just go for another one but not too soon just wait a while so u don't look desperate cuz idt u r!|`|YniG6IiGaa	maybe girls just see you as a friend. or your not making the move|`|lW62jIvuaa	u are fine,dont worry about that
AA11578436	Hun, you probably just need to keep your head straight for a little bit. Don't worry about chasing boys right now. The right guy will find you, not the other way around. Don't make yourself too available. It seems like you're worried about finding this perfect guy but trust me, he'll find you. It may be a quiet kid that you really never noticed or someone will grab their imaginary balls and ask you out. End point? Just enjoy high school as it is for a bit. After all, you go to high school to find your bridesmaids, not your husband.
lfsxZA59aa	Sex? No. Be yourself. Talk about what went on at school, your life, his life. Anything. But not sex. That will make you seem like you want to have sex with him, and you guys aren't even going out. Don't make yourself look stupid.
d0WQ2pZNaa	Well you not getting nervous around girls will make this a lot easier for you.<br>  Talk to her, ask for her name, even simple things like that can make a girl wonder and think about you.<br>  I had a boy come up to me in class that I found relatively good looking, he randomly asked what my name was because thats why he had never said hello before to me, it was very random but it made me want to talk to him even more, but (im shy) and he hasn't spoken to me again (except for saying hello when we pass each other), it made me extremely curious as to who he was and what he was like.<br>  <br>  When you're good friends, or just friends - thats the best time to say they look nice, if its before you get to know each other - you'll seem like a bit of a sleeze.<br>  <br>  And you said the girl - to others, is just above average but to you shes extremely hot, so she might even think your extremely hot even though to the majority of others you MIGHT only be above average (of course you could and probably are more and the reason I say that is at high school, just about everyone goes through stages where they think they arent that good looking when they actually really are, even the really hot ones)<br>  <br>  So simply, talk to her about anything. Don't do things that aren't like you to impress her because if she becomes friends with you because of it, she will eventually find out you were faking it.<br>  <br>  If shes into some pot head instead of you - it says a lot about her. so think about that too.
mSN2em8Qaa	i think she means it in a friend like way or maybe she does like you who knows.I noticed this alot that friends that end up goin out f up their friendship because once they break up its goin to be hard.|`|0lQtTE9Daa	i think she means it. if she loves you then she wants you to ask her out.<br>  good luck|`|oOU6XJOqaa	asking her out won't eff up your friendship, but the break-up has a higher chance of "effing it up." But she said it, and she probably means it.|`|CFjFaKBzaa	There is only one way to find out..so ask her.

SgGB9Ji7aa	I would agree with you ….what’s the difference between porn and cheating? …in the least common denominator there is none.<br>     <br>  Porn can be extremely destructive to any relationship {your case in point}. And I wonder….. if the tables were turned, how do you think your bf would react …. <br>  And now the question<br>  Is this something you want to put up with the rest of your life?|`|bELqEsdOaa	Well I happen to have a girlfriend who doesn't enjoy if I were to look at porn. She says she wouldn't care if I did but I know how she truly would feel so I choose not to look. From what I've known, it's not that he is bored of your body by any means. It's more that it's a feeling of freedom and being able to express his freedom whatever time HE wants. Are you sure he's even imagining the actress and him? He could just be enjoying the sight of people having sex in general or he could even be imagining the people in the movies as you and him.

YvvYtsjNaa	So, I'm not a girl, but maybe I have something to say that will help you out. <br>  <br>  If you don't have the answer from him that you want, what are you waiting for? How come you can't get his number if he can get yours?  Ask his friends.  Ask the people who put the retreat together if they know his name or number.  Were everyone at the retreat strangers?  Who did he pal around with?  Who was he sitting next to in the bus?  Did you know any of the people at the retreat?  Ask them if they know him?  When you find out, DON'T msg him.  Call or try and "bump" into him, accidentally, if you can't stand to approach him directly.  But it's up to you to get the answer you seek.  Get up the courage to walk right up to him and say, "Hey, I'm interested in you.  Are you interested in me?"  <br>  <br>  Think long and hard about this next thing:  What have you got to lose?  You don't have him now, so if you go to him and it doesn't work out, you haven't lost anything.  What?  You think he's the only boy in the world for you?  Stats show that girls have 4 or 5 bfs before they get married.  If this is your first, you've got 3 or 4 more to go.<br>  <br>  You should be playing the field.  Learning who you are and how do you go about integrating all your authentic personality traits (some of which you won't discover until you're older) with someone else's traits.  That's the hard part of relationships.  Since you can't expect to change someone to suit yourself, you have to decide whether you want to put up with some weird trait your bf has for the rest of your life.  If so, how are you gonna do that?  <br>  <br>  Relationship stuff is complicated, so it takes a long time and a lot of heartbreak, so you better start working on it now.  But YOU have to do it.  Don't wait until it's too late to get an opportunity to "integrate" with a guy who has some traits you like.  You need to learn to deal with the ones you don't like.   <br>  <br>  As young as you sound, it's a confusing time about relationships, but "what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger."  Who knows?  You may luck out and find a guy who's got a whole bunch of good traits so you don't have to put up with any.  You'd be bucking the odds, but it happens.  Just not to people who don't communicate well.  Don't be one of those.  Talk to him if you can find him.|`|Rj7L1Rc6aa	i think he likes you back just give him some more time to write u back

Your Friend is superior to you is what your expression says....<br>  So, STOP COMPARING Her with Yourself and stop self demotivation..<br>  Last but not the Least...Forgive her past actions and Future acts too..!!!<br>  <br>  You will experience Personal Freedom in your healthy relationship.<br>  Love you, Take care:Uncle Kishore|`|ayOWrkNtaa	im not trying to tell you how to run your life or your friendships, but shes not your friend, you are better than that!|`|0VqXYmiTaa	Everyone has a friend like this in their life, all im gonna say is if she is like that then she's is not worth it at all. I had a friend like that, that wanted to be better than me at everything so i just let her go slowly..it all worked out. But if you want to stay friends with her then i guess you should confront her on the whole thing and tell her how you feel, and if she was a good friend she should understand.|`|9JAadroiaa	for that u can improve ur way of talking.and nice talking to others.so that u get good friends
3AfNaLPpaa	Anger creates ill health and unhappiness. The sooner you ditch your anger the sooner you will be happy and healthy. Try smiling at the check out person, the bank teller, the person standing in a queue with you and all you come in contact with on a daily basis. Each day try to do a good deed and give praise to anyone who is helpful, even if it is only having a door held open for you. Kindness works both ways and remember, what goes around comes around. Forget your ex, he will get his just deserts one way or another in the end. Don't let him win by making you sick with anger.|`|c07v7O80aa	He was an a**hole. You can't do anything about that.<br>  He hurt you. You can't do anything about that.<br>  You're making sure he keeps hurting you. You can do something about that. <br>  <br>  The only question you need to ask  yourself is when you're ready for him to stop hurting you. The best revenge is to be happy. Without him.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Yeah!  I reckon getting a dart board with his mug on it is a great idea.  You can vent in a simulated environment without hurting anybody in the process (well just don't tell him he's got his mug pinned up on a dartboard).<br>  <br>  I can understand your anger, breaking up does make a person angry, but it's how we deal with our anger that makes all the difference.  Grab that dartboard or the punching bag and have a blast.|`|RPhla0R7aa	Maybe the punching bag will help. You can work out and at the same time exhaust yourself from wanting to punch him :).|`|YMgm99gdaa	Wow...I guess I won't be surprised to hear on the news next week that you murdered him with a chainsaw and then took a dump on his remains.  Take a deep breath and move on.  It'll be okay.|`|IpWTMetHaa	I know exactly how you feel.  My ex would really not want ot be in a dark alley with me!!!

9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	If they are making fun of you for not wearing enough clothes and they are 16 years old then they are saying that to cover their little boners.  Don't worry, just be yourself and worry about your real friends.  Next year one of them will find the courage to ask you out instead of fighting it.  Ignore them -|`|b8e7225eb1b9214f4836b0310368ade6aa	I can offer no advice as to hwo to stop them, but you definetely do not want them to "be your friends again". they are certainly poison,
fdee9f2f8c3353271f559676ca2a4337aa	Please don't get me wrong...there is never ANY excuse for a man to break his wedding vows and cheat on his wife.  Any man who hires prostitutes when he has a wife at home is nasty, and I don't blame you for being disappointed.  Having said that, however, I need to remind you that you really don't know what is going on within the dynamics of their marriage---and you really don't want to know, either.  Could your father be doing this because your mother is shutting him out of her life, being cold and indifferent toward him, or treating him with contempt?  Again, that's not an excuse, but it may explain why he's making these awful choices.  <br>  <br>  You said that this is not the first time this has happened, and that your father is a jerk.  Yet your mother has stayed with him all these years.  Could it be that she already knows?  Is it possible that if you get involved, she'll end up turning on you?  Depending on the family values that are the norm for your home, this could actually end your parent's marriage---but perhaps that needs to happen while your mother is still young enough to start over.<br>  <br>  If you really feel the need to let your mother know, then do NOT tell her directly, but arrange for her to "find out" about this by asking her to use the computer.  Have it rigged so she will run across the information (maybe ask her to find a web site you previously visited by going to the history).  That way, they won't be turning on you.|`|ZqDvQprCaa	yes you need to tell her before it gets worse|`|L1FUcmb0aa	Get to your dad first, if you have enough confidence in him. Otherwise, bust him to your mom. Maybe he can be headed in a right direction. I don't know where this relationship is headed, and I can't tell you what to really do. I'm sorry. I have a strong feeling this relationship may be headed to a divorce if he cheated again. If you have problems, I am here for you. I may not be able to help much, but I may be able to at least get you in some direction.|`|uUWjOh9Paa	Confront your dad. Tell him that you know and either way she's gonna find out so he might as well tell her. Or to keep your mom out of being upset tell him that if you ever catch him again you'll tell and you'll be "watching him." Hope I helped :).|`|Xo91SKP1aa	I think you should get involved and tell your dad what you know...sooner or later your mom will find out & if she found out you knew and didn't tell her anything she will be even more hurt.|`|xrEIAD2aaa	Why not confront your dad and give him a chance to tell your mother himself.|`|TprxRZeXaa	get involved, definitely. you can't just ignore something like that.|`|5kKkENvwaa	Go to him first see what he says.. tell him its disgusting and your mom doesnt deserve this and that he should give the respect your mom deserves.. men and their doodles never can think straight! makes me mad!
NqWl2qlPaa	Seems like you are talking about childish girls.  Don't worry it'll get better, there are plenty of good ones out there.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	I had women do me like this in the relationship. It's like, "O.K. you were Superman in my eyes when I met you now that I know what you're all about and I know what made me in awe of you is over...you're Clark Kent now...Bye!" Yeah, the coolest man of all time, once she lived with him and there's no holiday in everyday for her...she's bored with him and wants to leave. You have to pull tricks out your hat to keep these females entertained as if they're children so that they don't lose focus. Females are like children on ADD. LOL Love em' and leave em!....Before they leave you! LOL|`|fyyfPEemaa	guys are the samee =]|`|By1DJAUOaa	r u talking about me behind my back<br>  **gasp** "middle finger"<br>  maybe you r the type of guy that duz get boring ya know, u cood but i don't think i'm that type of girl, i just continue to b yur friend:)|`|RRTDRSw1aa	you are learning. no use trying. not only the attitude, you can catch something bad.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	Now if you were wearing the pants in the relation and smacking her around she wouldn't be so  Bord of you.........Kidding about the smacking around part but you get it right|`|1UZMBxpeaa	girls need to be kept on their toes. meaning they always need to be entertained or at least i do. just make sure you aren't boring and you guys have good communication.|`|6189eb32b22c80a45f5eee28efde7072aa	like u said all girls r not like that , just ones that usually like someone else ,and don't know how to be honest to u ,or them selves so they leave all mad , they need to grow up and stop the heart breaking its not cool at all , anyways u will find some one there not all sneaky and lie just don't think its u its not . reality is freedom!!! tell them to kick rocks when they start that stuff                                 sincerely  me|`|rSjXvsb3aa	Well, maybe you bore them out? if u do bore them, try talking about funny things more often, or surprise them with nice things. if that's not the case then they are just that way, not much u can do bout that.|`|pvhQ69fdaa	In my country, the woman eats the man during pregnancy for nutrition.

I was shocked since he wasn't the bored type at all! He went out of his way to make her feel important and loved... So I know where you're coming from. The girl either didn't like you to begin with, liked someone else, or is just plain bored. Period. Also, some girls take the littlest things their bf does and they turn it in to a huge issue. But not all girls are like this. If I was had a bf and I was bored with him, I wouldn't just "drop him like he's hot" lol. I would want to try to work things out. But that's just me. SO if you're looking for that "one special girl", don't rush. Things in life don't come easy...Sometimes you have to stumble a few times to reach the finish line...<br>  <br>  That's just my opinion though. Hope it helped! =D
gBvD0fJAaa	Oh my god<br>  what the hell? she had to go with someone didnt she? <br>  why dont you just trust her. <br>  now tell her how pathetically stupid you were and how dreadfully sorry you are and tell her you want her back so bad<br>  <br>  jesus man its only a school dance. <br>  <br>  gd luck

Cheer up you'll get a date. Don't stress about it to much, you'll find a girl.|`|3aeBqLORaa	not at all<br>  sry <br>  try a dif look|`|FJswVeqbaa	not in the picture...wow i feel bad now|`|vGkiQuDyaa	bro to bro your good. no homo.

LDBlXyjqaa	Yeah, seems snobby.  When I was 14 or 15, I wrote a stupid song about a girl named Lisa.  Never sang it for her though.  Just ignore her for a while, and if she says anything to you, just acknowledge her, but don't start conversation with her.  It will keep her wondering, drive her crazy, and you will her focus of attention.  Or, she just won't ever acknowledge you, either.  Girls are very confusing, but don't let it bother you.|`|fG50fL91aa	honestly.....the giggling at your song was probably nothing to do with your preformance....she was probably just embaracedby the attention. as for her and her friend talking about you calling you creepy really doesnt mean anything....she could be trying to hide the fact that she likes you too.<br>  the only way to know for sure is if you ask her out, its ur best bet so go for it :D and good luck|`|onny0Rgtaa	shes playing love games dont get sucked in to that spider web. ive been there its not fun. you wake up without socks and you dont know why. then you remember you werent wearing socks. but more to the subject: shes messing with you so just move on theres gotta be hotter girls or at least semi hot. your the new kid fresh meat.|`|rtTgkO4Naa	i think, based on the note, that she may just be messing around.<br>  <br>  you should try and talk to her and based on that reaction<br>  decide whether or not you should ask her out.|`|RPpHLXKWaa	shes messin w/ ya. dont ask her out. shed reject u. im the smokin hot 8th grade girl of my mini jr high school of freaking 80. i would no. ive been there|`|iOmYtUDtaa	GO 4 IT|`|93BCmFm2aa	Just ask her. pretty simple.|`|OyEEyIpdaa	dont be a *****, grow a pair and ask her out!|`|f40a460f56112f9fa78af1bbce2582c2aa	I'd hate to say it but it doesnt seem that she likes you. i may be wrong so dont take my word for it.|`|CT64FYrvaa	1. she might, girls don't always say what they mean, she might just be saying that so that her friends won't think she's weird or she might have meant creepy in a cute way<br>  <br>  2. it depends on how you feel about her, do you like her that much? does she like you? only one way to find out, ask her<br>  <br>  3. if she does feel the same way you do, ask her out, find out her interests or get her flowers, some romantic, and you can ask her by just being yourself, how would you do it? if she does really feel the same way, she won't care about how you do it, so good luck~|`|GmGEGqn8aa	just ask her!|`|7hZLgQOMaa	She sounds like a snob to me... she is basically being all flirty and nice to your face and then being a b!+ch behind your back. Do you really want that for a GF? It was really sweet of you to write a song for her and she acted ungrateful and immature about it... the things she does shows a lot about her character and it's not looking very good.|`|rNE7XAmgaa	She probably likes you but doesn't want to let her friend Ella know just yet.  Ask her out when her friends not around. She's probably been feeding things into her head that your ugly or something. Lisa must be embarrassed to tell Ella because of the way she'll react. If you guys end up going out though, it'll be different.|`|tpioRQHkaa	i have never gotten over the girl of my dreams. i loved her but she just thought of me as a freind. dont ask her out your just asking for heartbreak. thats what really hurt me. just listen to me and don't . i asked the girl of my dreams if she would go out with me sometime and she said no. let me tell ya i feels like a steel frame train hitting you going a hundred. and you cant die you just keep going.|`|UuSmemr7aa	Well...she might not be interested if shes "smokin hot."<br>  but i would think thats sweet she just might not be interested in you !|`|iOa7rriGaa	Well at first I was going to say go for it but after reading the part about the note no don't or at least ask her about it. When you see her alone go up to her and say I just was wondering why you said I was creepy. Now don't sound mad or like your accusing her but just ask politely and if she denies it forget her but if she gives you an answer base your decision on her answer.I mean she could of just be telling her friend that to seem cool or something but it could just mean she doesn't like you.

84sZpVwaaa	Don't worry, let people think as they may. I'm older than you and I've really never been in a serious relationship. Just small things here and there. I'm sure there are people that have asked if I'm gay, but I don't really care what they think. Just do some public flirting with some guys and they will see that you really do like guys. I love to flirt with girls, so I think this leads many believe I am straight. I am 100% attracted to girls, I just haven't been in relationships for other reasons. But I do have more masculine features. Sometimes if you have that hippie outdoor personality, guys may think you are lesbian. I might think that if I'm picturing you. But every once in a while just try to act feminine to attract attention from the guys even if doesn't feel right. I'm not trying to say don't be yourself, but it's ok to put on makeup every once in a while, wear a sexy outfit, do up your hair, etc. That will definitely attract the attention of the guys. And just so you know, there are guys out there that like the outdoor type girls. I'm kind of curious what you really look like in person...|`|1ZExFF5Daa	That happened to me my freshman year of High School. I had lesbian after lesbian hitting on me because I didn't have a boyfriend. Needless to say, it was awkward. But I dated a few people, and now I've found a guy who I've been with for about a year. :] He's fantastic and I didn't look for him, he found me. I say wait for a guy to come to you. Don't go looking for him.|`|f4sKk8Ytaa	just let them be. those are the kind of people who have nothing better to do in their life.<br>  you are not going to change just for someone like that. stay yoursefl. beside there are a lot of thing apart from falling in love.<br>  trust me, I am 24 and still single. it is not like we will stay lke this forever, right? ;-)<br>  take your time in looking for THE guy.|`|NXodF671aa	I'm usually pretty crass in my answers, but in this case, I'll be honest.<br>  What if people are asking because they are interested in you? Or know someone who might be? I think you're jumping to a conclusion that could be fear based - You are so worried about people thinking you're gay that it really stands out when you hear someone ask/mention it which gives an awful lot of power to your fear.<br>  If you are secure in yourself, then you KNOW the right person is out there for you and whether they are male or female, who cares? It's your life, your business. Whether you look like Barbie, or the Cable Guy, it's nobody's call what you're looking for in a significant other, and that includes body parts.<br>  <br>  As a side note, if it really gets to you, get a can of bear spray and keep it with you at all times...|`|e5SsSMTbaa	yeah<br>  f**k them all.<br>  be you. they're the shallow ones who base judgment by appearance<br>  they need a reality check, not you.<br>  i'm a total believer in being with the right person because they are the right person, not because i need i prove anything to anybody,<br>  if you are sure and happy about your self, that's all that matter.<br>  stop caring what they say, all that matters is that you know the truth.<br>  you don't owe anybody explanations and you don't need to measure up to people's standards. the time will come when its right for you to have a boyfriend. maybe you're alone for self-discovery and who is anybody to disturb that?|`|PLtU5AuYaa	I will date you for your mind and cooking.|`|37c233fdcf66a7d0f3a3f1d9528d7a4caa	Surprising that college stundents can be as brain dead as a teen in high school, no?<br>  <br>  Anyways, appearances are what give first impressions. However, appearances don't give the whole story, which is a shame, since you formulate a biased cockusion. For example, you might get the impression that I'm a brooding loner at first sight of me. However, if you got to know me more, you'd find out I'm actually quite a likeable guy who enjoys various activities who just enjoys the bliss of silence, always there to lend an ear.<br>  <br>  To sum it up, the best people are those who like you for who you are.
AA11091315	By the time you get to college you will have forgotten about this guy that you like as you will meet several young men over the course of the next four years. Yeah, I know it will rub you the wrong way to see the guy you like with your friend but at least you have a guy nice enough to ask you. Be glad you have a date. Not so many girls are that lucky. Besides, it's all about how cute you look in your picture with your DATE (emphasis). It doesn't matter if you aren't into him. Just go and have fun with your friends and enjoy this once in a lifetime occasion.  Congrats! :)|`|k4dAtVazaa	just go<br>  enjoy your time with your other friends<br>  highschool isnt just about lovers its also about having a good time with your friends.|`|8Ifm5ohkaa	I don't think you should go to prom with someone that you don't think you'll have fun with, but don't skip out on prom because your friend has a date and you don't, even though you like him. My sister went to her prom with a bunch of her girlfriends and still had a ton of fun. So I'd say, grab a bunch of friends, go; you'll probably have so much fun you won't notice your friend and that guy.|`|85YtzzKraa	Is there another guy that you like or always have a good time with? Like a friend maybe?<br>  And about this guy that you don't like maybe you should give him a chance because you could go out with him and have a really good time! Give him a chance! Or ask a frined that you love spending time with!<br>  Good luck and I hope that everything works out!<br>  <br>  Not to be rude or insconsiderate but will you help me please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306213740AAvhAbX&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|FlSLNhsoaa	you should definetly still go, just go and hav fun, prom is the best, you could even just go with that guy as a friend, and just try not to worry so much and have fun prom only comes along once, dont miss it!!!|`|defeBgqdaa	ill go with you:)
9UCvu7RYaa	Please tell me this question was a joke so I can laugh!! I don't want to laugh yet if your serious! But if it is true than It sounds like there are more issues going on with you guys than just bad sex. Because in relationships we tend to over look flaws IF we want them to work. You have NOT overlooked ANYTHING. So you have some deep rooted animosity that causes you to feel this way. Work it out with a therapist or walk away so someone else can appreciate this LOVE MAKING IN THE JUNGLE :))|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	who's got the most points? U or him?|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	if you hate him, get a divorce.|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	Way to waste your life feeling miserable. You are hurting him when you do this too you know. He may think that you absolutely hate him and he's worthless. None of you are getting anything out of this marriage except for life wasted, for both of you if you truly feel this way you should get a divorce.|`|VOAyAhsSaa	Your second to last line should've answered the question for you.<br>  ..Why waste 18 good years of your life anyway?|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Simple Leave...|`|j6RDbnl6aa	divorce him and get a dildo.<br>  :)|`|qxgkhN8aaa	hi blonde wife and husband,<br>  i don't know whether the 2 of you made this up,<br>  or is it the both of you just starts to fight recently,<br>  cuz i never happen to see your names appear before,<br>  but whatever happens,<br>  i just want to give 1 advice to the both of you,<br>  <br>  do you both want another 18 miserable years ?<br>  or another excellent 18 lovelier years together ?<br>  you both make the pick.<br>  don't waste your times at the site anymore.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	Sounds like YOU wasted 18 years of your AND his life. Leave the poor dead elephant where it lays and go find a tiger. OR... TEACH HIM how to make love to you. Get him in the shower with you and soap up his body til he's clean then show him how to make love.. If my husband was bad in bed I would show him how I wanted it. Thank God he's good.<br>  <br>  If there's no chance of you working it out with him give the poor guy a chance to find real love. You are to cold hearted to ever truely love someone.|`|Z4PxfObXaa	I think there's more to it than the fact that he isn't good in bed.<br>  You said you hate him.<br>  What are your reasons?<br>  Do you hate him because he's bad in bed?<br>  Or do you hate him for other reasons, making your mood affect your sex life?<br>  If you've really been so 'miserable' these past 18 years, then why the heck haven't you done something about it?<br>  In all that time, you could've seeked professional help--counselors?|`|lGdrvXMdaa	LOL, first of all, I have to say you have a great since of humor.<br>  <br>  Have you told him how you feel?<br>  One thing is for sure, you can't continue on this way.<br>  Aside from rotten sex, is he good to you? <br>  18 years is a long time, but  if you honestly feel it's over, with no hope of saving anything, then  maybe you could try a separation.<br>  I wish you the very best.|`|9087c63bf667d25bf1ebbecfe37cae22aa	I think you need a better sex life. Period.<br>  You have to make the options for yourself on what YOU think would be best. Just dont be too selfish.<br>  Maybe instead of just complaining about it, look into ways how it can be better. I know there are books that are out there to help people with sexual performance and all that jazz.|`|wCjjBdzUaa	if its only the sex then get him sex lessons for his birthday <br>  or <br>  if you actually "hate" him then i guess get a divorce..|`|koXcq0l1aa	You need to try marital counseling.  Btw, why did you marry him in the first place?  If he smells now, he probably smelled then and sex probably sucked then as well...|`|sGoEj6qsaa	Wow!  Why are you staying with him?  Just get divorced and be done with it.  Also... why are you having sex with him?|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I agree with you, my husband is horrible in bed too. If you hate him, then divorce him. But if you still love him, then do something to spice it up, buy some porn or some toys. That's what I finally did because for God's sake he couldn't get me off. If he is truly trying to please you and make you happy, then maybe you have a sour vision of the whole situation. Try to take a step back into his shoes for a minute. How would you feel if you wife didn't want you to touch her, and she was disgusted by the meer site of you. How would that make you feel as a person. You married this man for a reason, try and think why you did. If you just can't bring yourself to try and enjoy the love making session then divorce him, because you're not only hurting yourself, you're hurting him worse.|`|Yfgf47lBaa	Does he know what you like?!<br>  i mean what makes you reach the big "O"?<br>  <br>  why don't you try going on top?! maybe it will be better for you if you're in control?!<br>  <br>  i know men want it all the time, sometimes you just have to do it... even if you aren't in the mood, just enjoy it, and get that mind set that its good, even if you have to imagine its someone else?!<br>  <br>  it seems to me that you need some marriage counselling... if you hate it so much, then why do it?! i mean i know its more than 50% of a marriage, but the nigh-mares are not healthy...<br>  <br>  do you love him?!<br>  i mean i read that you said you hate him, sometimes i hate my partner too, but deep down i still love him...<br>  <br>  you need to speak to your gp and get a referral to see a psychologist or at very least some marriage counselling.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|gkThLcf2aa	I bet you're a catch eh? Sex is only as good as the other person is bad, meaning, your not putting any effort in either it seems. Seems like you just lay there waiting for it to end. Thats very appealing.

5iQO45ZNaa	try talking to her and get to know her better and see what type of guys shes interested in.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	you can't force feelings<br>  <br>  become a friend of hers first|`|b5e24df36afb7022e7ac23c2fca5affeaa	well....first u have to know a little more about her what she like and what she doesn't...maybe u can do this by getting to talk to her more BUT DONT BE PUSHY....girls love hard to get guys....and maybe u can get to know more by knowing her friends and asking them,...bit by bit...just tak it slow...show her that u r what she wants and have always dremt of....;) and by knowing her friends and being good to them u gain even more than knowing..because girls talk ALOT between eachother when it comes to guys...so if u r good to them they r goin to tell her he is nice and go for it...<br>  and about flirting...maybe a nice sweet decent compliment wont hurt..compliment the way she looks today or she was amazing when she did this or that....<br>  most of all good luck:)|`|LiWtUCHLaa	Well I can see that you like her.  Some ways to get her to "notice you in that way".  Compliment her when you see her " I like your shirt it brings out  your eyes" things like that to make her know that your into her.  Another thing is ask her for her number if you dont already have it.  Text her once in a blue to ask how shes doing , ask to hang out in a group first than maybe move to alone only you and her.  Also flirt like when she talks look her straight in the eye , compliment her , make her laugh.  Goodluck Hope I helped|`|4TD4xg5Xaa	Begin by getting to know her. Ask her questions about her interests, like, sports or music or animals. Things that are nonintrusive. Especially not questions like Do you like sex or do you want to get drunk... Girls get offered love and sex all the time but a guy has to be cool and calculated and smooth... I know it really is a sick world... Girls have one baby at a time so they must be extremely selective...|`|GXeA6cBRaa	im in like the exact same situation as you. just talk to her about stuff and definatly make her laugh. dont say anything mean to her and dont lie...i know everyone says that but its actually true. other than that just have confidence and stuff and she'll probably like u back.|`|29hxVukYaa	become friends. Then tell her you like her, and see what happens from there. If you need more help email or im me|`|Voq6D4a1aa	Just try to flirt with her a lot. Make jokes about what your learning, tap her on the shoulder when shes not looking. If she looks pretty one day, tell her, really, don't be afraid to. Say it in a normal charming way, its the best feeling in the world when a guy tells you your pretty, trust me im a girl. Just flirt your way to her, ask her questions about herself begin to let her know you are interested little  by little. GOOD LUCK, i think that it is so sweet that you are asking for help on this because it shows you are, and i think i am your age since you take gym, yeah im in high school so anyway, good luck|`|7GHrB84baa	the most important thing u need to do right now is to tel one of ur best buddie to help u ( some one u can trust, cause the guy that helped me back fired on me) and make her laugh, and be really nice to her. act like that ur really caring for her. find that u guys hav in common. and when u think itz the right time. tel her how much u like her, and the next day ask her out with somthing romantic. dont be SHY, girls hate that.  good luck, may ur dream come true.|`|W20xtX5oaa	don't force it on her, she probably won't like it if you do.<br>  just let thing happen naturally, be nice to her.<br>  try to make conversation, find interest between you guys. if she's kinda shy, be even more friendly like when you see her in the halls or something say hi|`|T8sM6RRDaa	you can ask questions about herself and maybe scooch a little closer and once you no a little about her you can ask her out for a snack after school. maybe at that snack you can ask her out|`|bfqkcWCKaa	dude u cant make anyone like u, be urself, let her know ur interested, and if she likes u, she likes u. if not, im sorry but theres other girls out there. just dont be shy man. give it a shot.|`|gRXH3tpgaa	Just be yourself, maybe be try to be funny. Become friends with her and let her get over her shyness then have her talk to her and then ask her out.|`|wyWz6LYHaa	smile and look at her a lot but not over the top<br>  smiling is a good one to let her know tht u lke her or are interstd<br>  however if shes really shy she might act a bit weird at frst bout it <br>  good luck : )
CVWizvy6aa	What is wrong with him loving you more? What is wrong with a good guy? He's a keeper. I think you are looking for a playboy, instead of a goodboy. You should appreciate that he is a good boyfriend who is charming and sweet. <br>  <br>  You either appreciate what he has to offer or go find an ***.

And find a fun person to be around .

NO one is to be treated like that|`|LJ0fRcMGaa	sorry to tell you this..but get the hint!! and by the way he's a pussy for not telling you!
mjyK0lAbaa	Yes ad her on facebook. Try talking to her when you have a chance dont check her out thats creepy as hell thats pretty much stalking her.Dont be shy try give talking to her.
6qzg5AzWaa	Awww, I totally went through the same thing recently with a guy who admitted to having a crush on me, but he had a girlfriend too! Its hard to get involved with a guy like that, because you might just get hurt and may not always be able to trust him since he likes other girls too. Turns out, that his girlfriend dumped him and I'm really close to not having a crush on him anymore, even though he still flirts with me like hell. But anywhoo, back to the situation. Usually though, if the guy really likes you, diets, hair, make-up, all that stuff won't help. Just try to talk to him alot, prove to him that you can be an awesome girlfriend, and show him how cool your personality really is. It sounds so cliche, but if the connection and relationship is based on looks more then chemistry, the relationship might just fall apart (depending on each person of course.) I really hope this helps at all =)

Now I can lie myself out of a paper bag :o)  I would personally say don't try to flirt with boys, Interact with them, make conversation, see how it goes, try and be more social than flirtatious, you'll more about them that way than flirting.  I regret never doing that with girls when I was your age :op<br>  <br>  If it all goes sour, you can learn to flirt when you're 18 or so :o)  you'll enjoy it more then too :o)<br>  <br>  Edit: PS: don't listen to these girls, they're probably all easy slappers :op
0ktcvglRaa	It's a nice note. I like it because you (assuming you wrote it) are telling him how you feel.|`|2QuGuphYaa	It's a pathetic note.|`|uTQCKQQ9aa	its nice its not mean its just letting them know you need to talk to them. but i wouldn't send them a note it want work anyway. just move on if they don't want to talk to You then sorry they don't want to be with you so move on find some new. and also maybe you'll luck up and they will call you when they noticed you stopped. think about everyone likes a toy when someone else wants it|`|MFMFIqhpaa	It's really sweet and honest, but this guy sounds like a total jerk.|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	Nice|`|th2wbIhuaa	Nicer than i'd be.|`|soFzO7C2aa	it's perfectly reasonable. i am glad you addressed your feelings. too many times women just give in to men. if he freaks out when he reads it, i assure you it's normal. explain to him that you wanted him to know how you felt so you know where this relationship is going and that you want to work it out. good luck|`|Gx9xDkZ5aa	its not nice, but not mean.<br>  its honset.<br>  and thats important in a relationship.<br>  you need to tell him what you feel, it will make your relationship stronger if your honset.|`|uLyBjMonaa	its not a mean note its just how you feel <br>  <br>  PLEASE ANSWER!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ante5XjV1pqAY79Js1z9If_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306190011AA6rXkQ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|HlJPUwHwaa	It way nicer than I'd evr b so yah i guess its a nice note.

cMzA8qTMaa	I'm pretty quiet too and when people ask me why im so quiet I just say, "yeah" It's not a big deal some people are louder than others.|`|RKC36n9Naa	yes i am shy around new people, but once they get to know me i'm loyal and a true friend...unfortunatley most people don't have that kind of patience. most are attracted to the loud types because they are upfront, fun, and interseting, but often times they make terrible friends (b/c friends are a dime a dozen to them). i find it offensive when people say that i'm quiet to my face (as if i didn't already know). it feels like they think of you as a lesser person  just because you aren't loud all time...that saying does piss me off. being obnoxiously loud isn't everything though, so don't let it get you down.|`|9nOhhIiCaa	I'm SUPER shy, and people tell me that all the time<br>  They actually add, "You should be more outgoing! You'd have more fun, if you did!"<br>  But truth be told, I'm way too introverted to do that kind of stuff.<br>  I get embarrassed extremely easily, and I regret doing anything to seem like I'm outgoing.<br>  <br>  So, all-in-all, it bugs me when people say that, BUT it's just the way I am, and I have to live with it<br>  /:<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

People are always saying stuff like that to me too, to join drama classes etc etc. It's so irritating.
XopRCJX9aa	Try talking to him first about only general things . Try to make him comfortable with u . Have a sweet , kind and soft talk with him.
ajDXNeibaa	For me, they tend not too.<br>  <br>  I dated this girl 2 years ago, she lives in Wisconsin, and I live in Maine. We met online and hit it off.... until jealousy got in the wway, and things fizzled.<br>  <br>  However, that's just me. I have seen iother couples pull it off really well, like a few of my best friends.<br>  <br>  So yes, sometimes they do work.<br>  If you guys talk alot, you should be all set.|`|e8vnFhi0aa	lol thats not even truly considered "long distance." Long distance relationships truly mean they live out of state. Also, you are in 8th grade. Well, if you are able to see him more than 6 times a year, then it might work. If not, i dont believe it does. hope i helped|`|83820c362a39e9d2c3167c932921d967aa	Sure they do.  But (sorry) 8th grade relationships hardly ever do.|`|DkEITXltaa	i dont think they work but my best friend dated some guy for 2 years that lived like 4 hours away and they got married and she is having his baby. it might work for you if you love him.|`|XNGUomnFaa	They can sometimes work but <br>  in my opinion long distance relationships are a problem and the boy could be possibly cheating on you with who knows but its all on you.<br>  <br>  just keep that in mind.|`|ghISlqExaa	if you love someone a lot your heart will ache and ache.
DcrI9zmkaa	You may be best friends with him, but he sees you as his girlfriend...otherwise he wouldn't be saying he loves and wants to marry you.<br>  <br>  Yes, he's as for real as a 15-year-old can be.  It's called "Puppy Love".|`|um8s6agzaa	you are both really young.... I know people usually hate to be told that they are too young but it's true <br>  You'll both grow up, date other person, and have a better idea of what you're looking for in a mate<br>  right know you're both too young to know, and marriage, don't think about that know!|`|cMzA8qTMaa	hes 15 he doesnt know what he wants.

You can test him by making him do certain tasks if he truly loves you. For example say to him "If you truly love you would get down on one knee and sing to me in front of a crowd" if he does that means hes head over heels for you so you got yourself a really good man.|`|F8wzcKntaa	Think about how long you've been together. Also think of how you feel about him. Is it the same way. Put your age in as a factor if you are teenagers it's puppy-love he probably say anything to get in your pants. If you are older then think about how life would be with him and without that should help.|`|DkEITXltaa	yes it s cute but don't fall to fast because he might not turn out that way. be careful|`|w4l8NajJaa	if he is why not say it in person instead<br>  of miles away on a text document<br>  ever think of that one<br>  : )|`|gGmvFSV7aa	no.<br>  <br>  if he meant it, he's say it to your face, not hide behind a text|`|7gpHfFwUaa	umm duh itz cute lol.. sounds like he is=]|`|CvWp7PZ2aa	it is and you know it|`|LFwtv0soaa	awww of course! <33|`|mYX1fVduaa	well, if he only says this in a text, sweetie, he could be texting other girls that too. he may say he doesn't but trust no one lol|`|aMBEcziBaa	I think its just creepy thats just too much thats something u say when you're engaged. talk to him in person and just see if he is for real
UpHGcyZyaa	well i would say wait until next time he leans in and then when he gets <br>  pretty close lean the rest of the way in and just aim for his lower lip.<br>  once its happening you can usually just go with the flow and it will come naturally, just aim for the lower lip and give it a little squeeze with your lips, you'll do fine.<br>  and put your arms around his neck, if you dont know what to do with them. if you are nervous about the kiss close your eyes but dont close them until you touch lips or else you could end up kissing his nose, hah. afterwards just pull away, and give him a shy smile, or giggle, to leave him wanting more.<br>  <br>  if you want to practice, and i know this sounds weird but it works, just make your hand into a loose fist and use the crook where your thumb goes under your finger as practice "lips"|`|dvgj6q6xaa	What happens after? You get pregnant!|`|JDJ6ofTUaa	ok so how i did it with my boyfriend (were only a year older than you) was this: he asked first if it was ok then i nodded then he hugged me and put his arms around my waist and held me there and then he pulled back from the hug but kept holding me (by my waist) close and leaned down and kissed me. i sorta kinda kissed back...it wasnt a long one but ya that was our first kiss. it wasnt awkward at all k dont worry! it was never awkward when i saw him lol...it only gets awkward for me when he looks into my eyes....haha!<br>  good luck!!!|`|mXiTX0Hoaa	aww. thts so cute i got my first kiss when i was 13.<br>  u just hav to let it happen<br>  my first one- he kept asking for it and it was awkward and he was terrible anywyas<br>  the next one- was with a dif guy and it was so much better...he let if hapen and didnt ask for it<br>  so it seems like this guy does like u...prolly not in love but u never no<br>  btw im 14 and i believe that i am in love now and that my bf is in love with me<br>  dont worry it wont get awkward...if he gets a funny look on his face well hes a jerk<br>  just let it happen and everything wil be fine<br>  good luck!
zzaScg0haa	Ask him to hang out, just the two of you
aMBEcziBaa	i think you got him mad or he heard something he wasn't supposed to hear. Just ask him whats wrong. also he could be tired of waiting for you to hint a lil more in the relationship.

Just because a girl has her period, doesnt mean she changes her mind...Have you ever thought that maybe she wanted some space, or was too busy to call? It is true that girls can switch moods, but that doesnt necessarily mean she doesnt have the same feeling for you as before...She's probably stressed and needs a break.

DcrI9zmkaa	She broke up with you yesterday and you're already wanting to ask her about getting back together?!?<br>  <br>  She broke up with you because she wanted *space*.  Give it to her.  Pushing her to get back with you will do nothing but push her out of your reach.|`|eXRyCdvwaa	Dude!!!!! CALM THE HECK DOWN. If smthing happens, it happens, i know how u feel because my girlfriend i have now, months ago and sometime ago, she broke up wit me, then came back to me, then left me again, then we're finally together again. And i didn't even do a single thing. I just waited 4 her to come back, and she did. Wen she broke up wit me, she said she wanted her life to be simpler 2, but i figured out she was going out wit the other guy again. Then she realized again, that she really loved me more than that the other guy. Wen u like som1, then u figure out u love someone, u take the one u love, not the one u like. So, dude, she's probably, (1)with another guy and lied to u, or u can get her back. So whatcha gonna do now?? All i did was wait 4 her to come back, it was a miracle. I didn't talk to her for a week. Made me cry 2. So don't let urself down. Don't let anything get in the way of u. Make a move dude. So....... whatcha gonna do??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! HUH? Break the ice!!!!!!  GET IT CRACK"N!!!!!             AND F.Y.I. i'm only in the 5th grade just to let u know. But i know how to deal with relationships. Even though she's my first girlfriend. (I've heard a lot from my cuzins and they practically taught me most of the things i know)
bYakT177aa	Yeah, maybe. I would compliment her back. Just try to relax. And try flirting; if she flirts back, she probably likes you, and/or is realizing that she likes you.|`|D3zmTOKQaa	if she is your friend then she probably does. just ask her out. if she looks at you in a weird way sometimes then she likes you.
Sl4Vtxwiaa	no I don't think you're overacting. you have the right because you're his gf. He shouldn't be telling her stuff like she's cute. he should only be telling you that. He probably wouldn't like it if you did it to him.
lb8KlzFRaa	sex chat<br>  it can go as follows-<br>  hey sexy babe<br>  hows life<br>  description of a movie where sex scenes r intimidate.<br>  ask her over to ur place.<br>  get champagne<br>  n start it off|`|JO3HiGfHaa	People really do this? I always thought it was a joke.|`|HxXduL1maa	Get Comfortable<br>  Part of the lure of sex chat lines is that callers are safely ensconced in their own environments, which puts them at ease and helps them open up about their fantasies. <br>  <br>  Find a place where you can talk -- or do other things, wink wink -- in privacy. Turn out the lights, or fill the bathtub with bubbles -- whatever makes you feel less vulnerable and more relaxed.<br>  <br>  Sex Up Your Voice<br>  To ante up the seduction factor, lower your register, and speak a bit more slowly than usual -- think breathy and husky. This will help you get in the mood, and it keeps your nosy roommate from overhearing. A glass of wine or whiskey may help, but don't overindulge. You want to sound sultry, not slurred. <br>  <br>  Always Embellish<br>  So you're sitting around in sweats, a holey T-shirt and an avocado mask. But as far as he's concerned, you're wearing head-to-toe Agent Provocateur. <br>  <br>  always want to know what she's wearing, so she offers detailed descriptions, whether it's patent leather boots on a dominatrix or a sexy schoolgirl uniform (a good place to start if the thought makes you nervous). <br>  <br>  Be Enthusiastic<br>  "Enthusiasm goes a long way, girl want to feel like you're enjoying the sexy talk as much as they are, and that you're into their fantasy. Just go along for the ride." <br>  <br>  If you're too shy to share, keep the momentum going by lowering your voice and asking, "And then what would you do to me?" Moaning, lustful sighing, saying her name and compliments also work wonders.<br>  <br>  Don't Freak<br>  She wants to do what?!? Not everything shhe whispers into the phone will be something you're totally up for. But even when she's careful to not sound shocked or mocking. <br>  <br>  She recommends "chuckling knowingly" rather than laughing if something takes you by surprise. "Try to be as natural as possible, and react normally to things." Just go with the flow (those moans we mentioned) so he won't feel judged. <br>  <br>  However, if you are really uncomfortable with what he's saying, it's more than fine to end the conversation or change topics to something you enjoy. <br>  <br>  Get Graphic<br>   the language is no-holds-barred ("There's no room for coyness). Using, ahem, colorful euphemisms can heighten the down-and-dirty factor of your conversation. <br>  <br>  If you're not the potty-mouth type, do try to find "grown-up" words that you're comfortable with. Even penis is better than the ego-deflating "weenie." Another trick? Have him describe each step first, then coo it back to him -- letting him steer the language can take the pressure off you to perform orally.<br>  <br>  Don't Be Afraid to Take the Lead<br>  Want to share a fantasy of your own?

Also I have a weakness for freckles, especially on other parts of the body like shoulders and hands.  Cleavage is a guarantee winner for any guy I think!  And short skirts.  Oh I also have a thing for cute stuff like girl shoes and socks and little hats and gloves cute lingere.

otTMXJvRaa	Hi Alexis,<br>  <br>  Different guys like different things in girls, so just be yourself.  As far as kisses and love goes, don't start too young or move too fast.  But you can't go wrong with a nice smile.<br>  <br>  I must assume that you’re asking the question because you want to be able to attract guys… and you’d probably like to find a steady BF. Completely healthy desire. So, a related question to ask yourself is… exactly what kind of BF do you want to attract? <br>  <br>  Let’s call your future BF “Romeo”, OK?<br>  <br>  The best way to find a decent guy is to be a decent young lady yourself… and expect all of the guys you date to treat you with dignity and respect. You don’t need to act nor dress like a sl*t, so don’t follow that crowd.<br>  <br>  It’s advisable to try and attract decent guys that you already know in school, your neighborhood, or church. Otherwise, you’ll probably just attract creeps and players… because those are the types of guys who won’t hesitate asking out a pretty girl they don’t even know. Creeps and players also would not hesitate trying to get into your pants.<br>  <br>  Just be nice to a bunch of different guys. Don’t overlook the quiet shy types. Smile, ask some questions (homework, music, hobbies, pets, etc), and make good eye contact. Have a sense of humor.<br>  <br>  If you’re lucky and a nice guy seems to be getting interested over a few weeks time and you like him too, perhaps you could drop a not-so-subtle-hint ("Gee Romeo, it really wouldn't take much for me to get a crush on you… because you are always so nice to me!"). Note the statement is a gentle open door, not a smothering declaration of undying love.<br>  <br>  That'll leave the ball in his court. Give Romeo a few days to think about the possibilities (i.e., don't expect an immediate answer). He'll take the bait if interested. If not, big deal!!! You'll be able to find another good guy later on.<br>  <br>  Now, let's assume for a moment you manage to snag Romeo as a BF... what then? That's something you need to start thinking about. Getting a BF isn’t the end of your journey... it’s only the beginning.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a general crash course all about guys, BF's, crushes, dating, love, etc. would be helpful for you to think about while dreaming about how to find a nice Romeo to date.<br>  <br>  Alexis... crushes, dating, and love can be confusing... extremely confusing... for adults as well as young people. That's why it is a good idea not to start dating too early.  Age 16 or 17 is a good age to start dating.<br>  <br>  Your parents should say OK and meet the guy first. And stay a virgin (i.e., no premarital sex) until you get married. Keep in mind that the decisions you'll be making from now on will have a large effect on how the rest of your life will turn out.<br>  <br>  In High School, young guys and young girls can be pretty unpredictable, and change their minds very quickly... for no reason whatsoever. That can lead to hurt feelings and heartache. You and some guy might both agree that you like each other one day, and literally the next day either one of you could call it quits. Just remember that.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the purpose of dating is generally to determine if a person will make a potentially good future spouse. Therefore, don't ever date someone that you know would not be good for you in the long term.<br>  <br>  Don't assume that you will marry your first crush or your first serious BF... it won't happen. The odds are literally 100-to-1 against it. Sorry! <br>  <br>  As a decent and trusting young lady, you will need to be aware of a few of the potential hazards of dating. These hazards certainly apply to young people as well as adults. That's also why you need to not start kissing or making out too early with guys (even though you might want to).<br>  <br>  Alexis, here are two major dating hazards for you to consider:<br>  <br>  1. There are some guys out there (the smooth players) who will tell a nice girl that he loves her, just to see how far she will let him go with her body. There are guys out there who are ready and willing to use you and your body for their own selfish pleasure... and then leave... breaking your heart in the process, and possibly leaving you pregnant... or with an STD (a nasty disease in your private parts). Hopefully, you will be mature enough when dating to recognize these losers, and say "No".<br>  <br>  2. You could meet a genuinely nice and decent guy, and you both really do think that you love each other. After a few weeks or months, you both might be tempted to take off your clothes together. That would be a good way to mess up both of your young lives. It's happened to a lot of nice girls and decent guys out there. Hopefully, you will be mature enough to resist this type of temptation... and the temptation can be very strong.<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid getting into trouble from either hazard listed above is for you to never be alone with your guy... anywhere. Not his house, not your house, not a friend's house, or anywhere else. A responsible (and awake) adult should always be nearby.<br>  <br>  You should also never attend a party where no adults are present... ever. Nor any events with drugs or alcohol abuse.<br>  <br>  Ideally, before you start dating, you need to make a conscious decision to remain a virgin until you are happily married. That means no premarital sex. Having sex too early will make you feel sad, cheap, and make it less special (same thing with kissing in case you do it too early with the wrong guy... but kissing is much less dangerous).<br>  <br>  OK, why no premarital sex? <br>  <br>  Because having sex without marriage is going outside of the laws of man and God that civilizations on this planet have lived by for thousands of years.<br>  <br>  Because there's the unnecessary risk of excessive heartache (any break-up will cause heartache... virgin or not... but heartache will be less if you are still a virgin... that's just the way human brains are wired).<br>  <br>  Because there's also the genuine danger of an unwanted Baby... or an STD.<br>  <br>  Because your parents would very likely be extremely disappointed.<br>  <br>  Because your "no sex" rule will pretty much eliminate the players, the losers, the creeps, the clods, and the selfish manipulators. <br>  <br>  By refusing to participate in premarital sex, you'll find out pretty quickly if the guy you are dating just wants to get into your pants… or if he truly respects you, your body, your heart, your soul, your feelings, your values… and your family. <br>  <br>  Alexis, just take a look at a random selection of the questions from girls in this category... a significant number of problems here directly involve premarital sex... coupled with immaturity, foolish expectations, and invalid assumptions.<br>  <br>  You need to date nice guys who will treat you with dignity and respect while you are having innocent fun together during your youth. Trustworthy guys who would not ask you to do anything inappropriate.<br>  <br>  Long term, you need to find a special guy who will be honorable and be very good to you as you grow into a decent young woman. He may not be the hottest-looking guy around, but you will love him just the way he is. He should be a guy who is proud to take you home to meet his parents and his family. A guy that you would be pleased to take home to be introduced to your parents and family. A guy who will ask for your hand in marriage. A guy who is willing to stand together with you in a wedding ceremony before both of your families in church.<br>  <br>  You don't want a guy who is not honorable and just wants your body... for a while... and then he would be gone. A problem like that is much more likely to happen if you give away your body without the commitment of marriage.<br>  <br>  Keep yourself out of trouble by thinking smart. Don't believe everything a guy tells you... watch him carefully, and evaluate whether or not his words are consistent with his actions. See if he respects you and your values.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid or embarrassed to talk to your parents or your family about dating and boy issues as you are growing up. They know you, love you, and will certainly give you good advice.<br>  <br>  Meeting guys you don't know via the internet is a bad idea. Stick with guys you know in real life.<br>  <br>  You will be really happy when you are older, and you look back over your life... happy that you made the right decisions about finding, dating, and evaluating guys when you were young.<br>  <br>  That's pretty much the big picture for you to look at, Alexis.<br>  <br>  Someday, you'll make a lucky guy a fine wife.<br>  <br>  Take care, and God bless.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  - Charlie|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Their sexy legs!|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	it varies for different people, just like some girls are into jock guys, while others are into hardcore musicians.<br>  <br>  But I'm pretty sure most guys would like a girl who they can just be themselves around, who are intelligent AND hot.<br>  Then again I wouldn't really know, I'm not a guy.
yTAXDL5Jaa	maybe, when i was mormon, I couldn't say "piss, gosh,(too close ot God) gees (too close to jesus) screw (too close to a sexual term), darn (too close to D#$ it)," ect.|`|FjA3jGs4aa	no, and that probably isnt the reason shes mad at you, unless your like 10 or she interpreted the word to mean something about sex then shes mad about something else.
RDgyb7W8aa	He wants you back definitely.  Give him one chance and make it clear to him that this was his only chance|`|R2hbZi1Faa	well I'm not a guy but it looks to me that he does want you back so that he can finally sleep with you.If u want him back you'll have the upper hand. But, once you forgive cheating, he'll know that you're ready and willing to forgive some more drunken escapades in the future...|`|rHqe7oMoaa	Once a cheater always a cheater. <br>  <br>  Also +1 for the first answer|`|gAhHCpRNaa	dont take him back. he screwed up so its his loss and hes gonna have to live with it. they are ex's for a reason so stick to that reason|`|0ktcvglRaa	He obviously wants you back; he pretty much told you that. DON'T GO BACK OUT WITH HIM! You're not ready for sex, and he clearly is. Ex's are ex's for a reason.
AA10665398	Anthropologically speaking, a woman's armpit is a site of fermion production. This turns on the male gender. This may be a reason for his odd behavior. =)|`|ajKJcoBFaa	ha ha ha lol im 16 and my girlfriend is 15 and one night when i was with her i was attracted to her armpit and it was good at the moment but they wert sweaty!!!lol<br>  <br>  dont woory its normal!|`|JajEhcsUaa	This guy is definitely a keeper. Stay with him or he will worship some other lucky womans armpits.|`|mC1MMximaa	WOW!<br>  ummm just wow...<br>  i can't tell if your making this up and trying to be funny or you are serious...if you are..tell him he needs help...immediately...unless of course u like it.|`|jQROkWUuaa	ummm....that's really weird. maybe he should get some help for that one.|`|7gpHfFwUaa	lmfao!|`|yROLq2l1aa	omg! that is really really creepy> wtf?|`|bxXaA2TEaa	Humans, animals and bugs put off a specific odor called ferons. It is used to attract one to another. When attracted to a person, the body odors and very stimulating, and arouse us at certain times. This is a normal thing for most people if they are really in touch with their feelings, but, I feel you and your boufriend are too young to be experimenting with these feelings at this time, it may lead you into a situation you can not control. You are young and have plenty of time to experience sex to the fullest. Just enjoy being young, and find safer ways of enjoying each others times till you are in the position to share your self with a life long partner. I waited till I was married at 19, and wish I would have put more energy in my education before I did. Kids now a days grown up too fast, then you wish you had slowed down. Once you have made the move, it is too late. And God will bless you for being strong. I hope this will help you, don't waste your life for a cheap thrill, it is not worth it. The reason I have taken this so far is because it sounds like you are taking it too far. Think SMART.|`|qVEGwLbwaa	i think... he's gone mad. my stomach hurts. ewww|`|2uxaGUNqaa	Uh, I'd love to help you, but I believe I'd be asking the same question as you? |:<br>  My boyfriend loves my armpits as well, he loves to feel how smooth they are and loves the way they smell, the deodorant. But he doesn't suck on them, or anything like that. But he does love them. And he has a foot fetish and loves to suck on my toes, no matter how dirty my feet may be. But still, I guess a foot fetish is nowhere as odd as an armpit fetish. I guess maybe do something different with them to see if he quits? Just make sure they're clean though, so he isn'y completely disgusted. Or just in case he keeps doing it. Hm, that's kind of strange.|`|f1Unp3fBaa	Many people have this fetish. Many, many, MANY people have all kinds of fetishes. If something were wrong with him then something would be wrong with everyone that loved feet, legs, hands, etc.<br>  <br>  Everyone has their own preferences, like myself. I love girls with large natural E+ cup racks, dose this makes me weird? I don't think so. But, I guess if you don't like it, you can just tell him.|`|OiUiEMr0aa	LMAO and then u kiss him right?|`|5iOHJHUzaa	Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...<br>  That's nasty.|`|chZFmJOPaa	He has an armpit fetish like you said.

cn5ecUmEaa	Well to tell you the truth he probably has a lot on his mind already he just moved and left the girl he really like (witch is you) and he probably wondering how is this relationship going to work out like are you going to stay faithful are is he going to stay faithful..and when you text him does he loves you ..he cant give u a honest answer because he        dosent want to break your heart if he start cheating... are liking another girl..|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	i think it was something that happened in San Antonio Lake righht..??<br>  But anyways you should tell him that you can be there for him, that you guys could talk it out and everything you know support him..<br>  You know everyone has there ups and downs, support him, and let him know your there to help him not be all up in his face you know what i mean..?<br>  good luckk.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Establish a more-than-just-friends relationship. Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier. <br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on. <br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go. <br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. <br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner. <br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself. <br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions. <br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope. <br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. <br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. <br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. <br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk. <br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."|`|mMi19s7Vaa	just walk up and start a conversation with her<br>  and ask her out from there =]<br>  <br>  best of luck =]|`|MuSYw7m3aa	well, if youre in school(e.g.high school, like i am) then you should ask her to play a game of hangman, and she has to guess the letters. Have it spell out something like "(her name) do you want to go out with me?" She COULD NOT say no, it would be so sweet, shy but still forward and adorable. If a guy did that to me i would probably kiss him right there and then.<br>  good luck!|`|Hc16k31qaa	It depends on the girl.<br>  <br>  If she likes the direct approach, you should just ask her.<br>  <br>  If she likes a great deal of planning, you should set something special up, like a small dinner with flowers, or asking her in front of her friends or something like that.|`|MHfT0EiRaa	Be direct and sweet.<br>  Don't beat around the bush.|`|b0f0iiqwaa	1st off learn how to spell|`|8HtMzalIaa	start up a conversation<br>  um get to no her a bit<br>  tell her how u feel<br>  then ask her owt<br>  <br>  BAM! there you have it!

UzMcNOCRaa	just call her, <br>  tell her you'd like to go some place casual, like for a cofee, and talk. <br>  explain to her, everything and apologize, saying you know you were stupid to believe your friend, and you just want her to know how sorry you are.|`|HqoOjAHVaa	yes somtimes u have to bite the hags nose to get it moving|`|AA10278534	Reread your last sentence, it says it all. Just apologize. Don't go into a really long explanation, just say "I'm sorry I was such an a$$, I don't know what I was thinking. Please accept my apology." Be sure to say HI when you see her and smile at her. If you are really sincere, she'll know it, and maybe she'll forgive you.<br>  <br>  Don't write a note, e-mail, call or other impersonal method. If it's that important to you, you need to make it that important to her. Go in person, show her you are really sorry, and tell her so.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Why don't get some flowers give them to her and at the same time say you are sorry and you want to be friends.|`|lQR9fYGhaa	"S-o-r-r-y"|`|9cPNA4nKaa	go to McDonalds and get her a big mac and say, "To my greasy girlfriend.."|`|ETV7yvNbaa	Just go up to her at school, get her to talk to you alone, where there isn't a crowd of people.

She may actually forgive you, and maybe you guys could even be friends. In the end, you will feel better. Good luck! =]]|`|jQROkWUuaa	well you screwed up pretty big on this one.<br>  <br>  most likely she'll forgive you if you're really sincere when you apologize. do something that really means a lot to her...even if it's just flowers. if she sees that you are really sorry and that you care about her, then things will be fine in no time.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|F8wzcKntaa	Write her a letter and tell her exactly what happen and when you see her give it to her and say please read it I'm sorry.

Some people simply instigate for fun or because they learn it as a means for attention.  <br>  <br>  I would simply talk to her and say you are sorry.  As basically as you can, explain you were having a rough time with your other friend and some bad information, and you really did not know who to trust, and that you were being overly sensitive.  It really sounds like your other "friend" was jealous.  <br>  <br>  For the future - you can ask your real friends anything, and they will explain the best they can.  It sounds like this guy is a real tool and tried to make you to be the jerk in all of this.|`|rA7v08TGaa	girls do tend to overeact and treat u how u are treating them i guess u could say but u should either like make it so she has to listen somehow, and let her know what happened before its too late, if it isnt already, and try and tell her as soon as possible. just either go up to her and pull her aside and tell her, clal her, message her, SOMETHING fast. and about the best friend thing.. good luck :/ im going through the same thing about the like.. not talking anymore and stuff. its pretty tough, butjust find someone else that can actually be there for you, that u can trust, or tell them you think they're being... yeah.. hope i helped in some way ^_^
R0U4qy6haa	i feel you boo|`|JajEhcsUaa	Ay girl I dun know bout dis foo. He be trippin or somethin' like dat knawmean?
BKr3y30maa	I think that regardless of whether he would take you back or not,  apologizing is the right thing to do.  Tell him that you are sorry that you overreacted and that you would like another chance with him.  If he tells you he doesn't want to get back together, bow out gracefully and move on.  Yes, it's going to hurt....but there is nothing you can do about it.  If he does agree to get back together, don't be so quick to jump to conclusions and think he is cheating.  You seem like you are probably young and rumors fly high in school.  People love starting problems for those that are happy in a relationship.  One more thing....I know you love your friends, but them cussing him out was wrong.  I would make sure they don't interfere in that way again by having a talk with them about the way they handled the situation.  There are appropriate ways to go about things. Good luck and I hope he takes you back.|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	Tell him youre sorry and that you made a mistake.  tell him you will make it up to him any way he wants.  if he likes you he'll go back out with you
pZA16dloaa	Do you know that he wouldn't date you? Maybe he's getting attached. It's possible|`|cwsYM2F4aa	Perhaps his conscience finally got to him.

How do you think you will build a good relationship with some guy that comes along.  are you going to be there or looking around for a friend with beenies.|`|PeJnA85Raa	It's possible he feels awkward about the whole friends with benefits thing. In my experience, most friends with benefits types things don't end well, because one person usually gets attached, while the other has no interest in a relationship. He may have felt an attachment forming with you, and wanted to stop things before they went any further and he got hurt.|`|dJrJYLBFaa	well hes obviously not interested in you anymore.|`|fPnWvLv3aa	then only be friends dont hold him back from a girl who wants to be in a real relationship with him

OXKF0jbtaa	Ah, this issue will always come up, but good question anyways!<br>  I am a broke 18 year old college girl with an even broker 19 year old boyfriend. We pay for our own stuff separately, or take turns treating each other to meals so it works out evenly in the end.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	at least offer, but since you're broke if she insists on paying for herself maybe let her.. she'll still remember the gesture.|`|R0U4qy6haa	no-break them in the right way-make her pay for yours|`|X757qR26aa	well the rule that is normally set is whom ever asks the other person out pays<br>  so if you asked this girl out you would pay<br>  and vice versa
AA11420581	it's common to feel that way. give kid a toy.... and after the kid gets tired of it stops playing with it.... take the top away and the kids wants it back....<br>  <br>  just move on or date me. lol jk
skSzDIlwaa	well i think when they are in middle school so around 12 to 13|`|QUPQzjGfaa	18 years old.
Jmi1rZeEaa	i would tell him,<br>  but at the same time be careful. im not saying your boy is a player but since you are a virgin thats special and make sure that you dont rush into it and then have him leave you cuz he got what he wanted|`|e44119010390a00af9488defd455d797aa	Ditto I agree
0ktcvglRaa	You just need to make out more often or masturbate more often.|`|CBa9G4j4aa	I don't think so. You probably get excited too easily.|`|MQVmh5hiaa	What does this mean? ***?|`|CFjFaKBzaa	I believe so, you do that because you are "ready" and you don't know how to control it. Where I'm from, you'll get a bad rap for that. But that's gross so you need to get that that problem under control.|`|CLbd1LfPaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pXfHLUlZf4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pXfHLUlZ...</a><br>  <br>  here you will find the answer|`|nJ9lGMmQaa	Hmmmm. Ask your doctor.|`|2v6I81Vdaa	I don't think so... Maybe you don't jack off enough? haha! seriously though, you won't *** as much if you don't have a lot in you.
8lah0hu0aa	yeah its possible. get one of your friends to tell him taht u like him and go sit in the corner or something and pretend like u dnt know what they're doing....OR u can go up and actually talk to him and it doesnt matter if u make a complete idiot of yourself, your only human and no ones perfect, maybe he likes the quirkiness in u. who cars about his ex, she got jumped because she hated life. <br>  <br>  u could also make the biggest mistake and let him get away and sit there wondering what couldve been all your life.|`|fJQFH3Woaa	no you have to talk to him...<br>  talk to him while your both at your locker<br>  just say hi atleast..<br>  <br>  EDIT: you can't expect everyone to always make the first move. i doubt you gained all your friends because they approached you, suck it up and do it.
FZKFLTyLaa	That being the case, I'm unsure if your emotionally mature enough to begin having romances. Give it another year or so.

Q0ExafZzaa	You can't. What you can do is reevaluate your friendship with these people. If "the secret" is none of your business, you need to respect their privacy. I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck.

yhEDUN6qaa	Find a way to make some income and pay off your bills. Plan out your finances and save. Make a plan with a certain amount of time (like six months, a year, whatever) to get out of there.

I used to think I had to stay in a bad marriage for the same reason, and I did for a couple of years longer than I should have. Finally I had enough and decided to take the risk. I asked him to leave knowing he was the main provider. I didn't have a job, I then had a rent of $1300 which I had no idea how I could pay and 2 kids to support. Within a week I was offered a job, and I stayed with my Mom for awhile until I go back on my feet. But I will tell u it is the BEST decision I ever made. I would much rather deal with some financial stress then the stress that came from that marriage every minute of the day. At least I knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel. Now it is 5 years later and I have a wonderful man in my life that I am engaged to. When u do something to better your life the people that love u are usually more than then willing to help in any way they can. Don't waste time like I did, stay strong and now it is time to start living life for u and happiness will be the reward in the end........good luck.|`|DYJOpfvraa	I'd create a plan. I'd get a short education get a part-time job and device timeline to leave him.|`|KUCbqaeGaa	you have 2 options ask him to leave or live separate in the house until you can leave. good luck.|`|Cpwedckvaa	Get a job and support yourself so you can leave if that is what you want to do|`|KtDUx4Cuaa	You should stop making excuses to stay. He isn't going to change, so get it together and leave.

I am now in a stable job, relationship and home where I am happy.|`|2ME9uRZIaa	um......................................... screwed now! HAHAHA
ESRIk8fnaa	You can't blame your boyfriend for wanting to be with his friends. But yeah it seems like he spends way more time with them that is needed. Tell him how you feel, but don't yell. Say it normally, && slowly, && tell him it hurts you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  =/.

AA10478339	Here is some homework... Watch "Stand by Me" then you will understand that friendships sadly do come to pass.  Often times those friends last as much as they can and then we have to move on.  By no means am I telling to let your cousin go but understand that he is different spot in his life right now.  Right now his interests are a little different from you.  At some point and this maybe later, that those bonds of friendship will return naturally.  Right now the only thing you can do is invite him now and then not as regularly as you used too.  Keep the friendship up now and then and at some point he will understand the loyality that you have for him.  Trust me, I am sure he would take one for you in any given time but that does not mean at this point his thinking/interests are different.  You need find others to fill in the gap of the friendship you once had.  <br>  <br>  Hang back and trust me there will be a time that he will need you, and at that moment be there for him, he will understand your loyality, he may not right now or even then but trust me life always seems to bring those important people back into our lives.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your Bestfriend & Cousin.<br>  <br>  ADAM
5z72s9Z2aa	ok well u can NOT put him down. try to encourage him. Talk to him..kindley over dinner, just keep on trying doing the best u can. my friend has been straying off and i just kept on inviting her places over and over again being as nice as a can...eventully she and i were best friends......u got to let him make choices and choose his own path...be supportive, kind, and DON'T  be jugdementall....last thing....try not to be his mom.<br>  hope this helps<br>  good luck and hopefully everything will work out like my friendship did :)
6In638rbaa	Yes, you are wrong. Just because she has you as a boyfriend does not mean she should exclude any guy friend she has. There's a difference between hanging out with your boyfriend and hanging out with your guy friends. Let her hang out with whoever she wants to because if you don't she might end up leaving you.|`|j1k8qGd6aa	If the guys she is hanging out with are just friends than it's perfectly fine especially if it's just platonic (no romantic feelings involved and definitely no flirting). I'm sure she would allow you to have friends that are girls to and allow you to go out with them just to chill one on one like you would a guy friend. Just because you're exclusive to each other, it doesn't mean you can't have friends, or opposite sex friends and hang out with them one on one. It's all about trust. You must be young, because as you get older, you don't necessarily always need or want to hang out with your gf/bf/wife/husband all the time...they are allowed friends and it's up to the other to trust that nothing romantic will go on.|`|4tDTQOgNaa	I see nothing wrong with her wanting to hang out or have 1 on 1 time with other guys because maybe to her this relationship that you all may have isn't really committed to just yet. Unless commitment has been established then there needs to be some discussion started. Yes you are wrong because it ain't like you all are married.|`|ziw77iuPaa	You are absouletly not wrong in my opinion. My boyfriend is like that. He feels the need to have a bunch of girlfriends when he has me. I ask him like why cant we all hang out and he gives me some lame *** excuse of why not... Its good to have space and time apart but not when its always wit the other sex. I would kind of be worried about that. But if u trust her then dont worry. tell her how u feel and see where it goes from there. Good Luck to you sweetie...|`|S2xWbrgpaa	you arent wrong at all. In fact I agree with you Nobody feels comfortable when their significant other hangs out with the opposite sex, no matter what the circumstances. I used to have all guy friends, but when my bf told me he didnt like that i gave them up for him, and I do not regret that decision.

55b8fb502d696b2763b1fa2013c036b6aa	Here's the deal. High school girls are sometimes mean because they think it makes them seem cool. You don't want to like these kinds of girls, because all they care about is themselves.<br>  <br>  And, I know people say it all the time, but what happens in high school doesn't mean anything once you grow up. I know that doesn't help anything right now, but that shallow evil girl will probably end up marrying someone who she doesn't even love. <br>  <br>  Follow your heart, and someday you will meet someone who loves you for you.<br>  <br>  And by the way, chubby guys are cute - they are better to hug, and make girls feel safe.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Ouch.  That's not harsh, its cruel.  I'm really sorry.  High school is very cruel though.  Don't take it so hard.  Life after high school is much better.  Girls only act like that because they can get away with it.  You let her get away with it.  You sound too lovey dovey anyways.  Why are you going around hugging girls?  I'd be weirded out by that and try to find any possible means to keep you away from me too and I don't even know you.|`|FOWQ8d0Qaa	coz thats what the worlds coming too :(<br>  <br>  a bad time to be living in, not the worst...yet|`|Dob2OhIYaa	haaaaa its because were bitchy in nature during our highschool years<br>  the chick you were talking to was pmsing or something, <br>  a lot of the time us girls dont even know what we really want and were just mean to be mean and like what not, i would say just go find a girl that like you for you and you like her for her|`|t0fg5uAqaa	cuz theyre all crazy, cold-hearted ***** slunts.<br>  <br>  help<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq9icsPay5RHb0M6BSPGrAfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306215511AAQMvgd">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

dY6HroZ3aa	it really depends upon the kind of people u are living with and let me tell u one thing from my experience of living with friends....<br>  <br>  people are different from what actually they are. i mean they might be good friends but u know them only for a maximum of 8hrs per day in college or school etc.  Living with the same people for 24 hrs a day is completely different and u might initially encounter some problems.  Since when u r living with someone 24x7 u will know them in and out.  And there is also a possibility of encountering problems.<br>  <br>  also if u have never been with roommates, then i would suggest think again before shifting.

He's putting your health and that of your children at serious risk.  Smoking outside doesn't eliminate that risk but it certainly cuts down on it.  As for the verbal abuse...think very carefully about this....it will only get worse, not better.  Ask yourself if this is the environment that you want your kids brought up in....do you want your kids to grow up thinking it's OK for a woman to be treated as a second class citizen?  Do you want them growing up thinking verbal abuse is acceptable?|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	"Besides all the negative, He is a deacent man"<br>  The problem is the negative overpowers the decency on him, which I don′t see it very much in the picture.<br>  I don′t have much faith on him changing, he was raised like that and that is so hard to take away. You aren′t crazy, but like any other woman who′s mistreated by a "decent" man, you need to be a little more respected and deserve, of course, better. I don′t think he changes, unless he′s touched by divine power...not bad idea at all...That′s the only times I′ve seen people have a real change in their lives,,no joking.|`|DVQ7cKxeaa	you know what i really appreciate your attitude your so humble. we mothers are really know the right ways in terms of our kids and family we longed for a better future and has a good family.  few years ago after i got married i felt like what you felt.  It is so embarrassment of my life i regrets why i marry him.  I don't felt that even a little moments to show me that he loves me because of all the attitudes the way he treat me and my kids. he felt that his still a single he goes so lucky anytime.  even i still reminding him what is right and good but nothing to works. it all worse. you know what i did, i do my diet and balance at home so that i can be sexy dressed well and feeling im beautiful with my kids. i did not anymore worry about him, no more asking him i let go him all he wanted to do.all i can do is for myself and my kids go out with my kids  go malling and be happy even without him. until he realized that he lucked of time for us and he has no time for his kids. and now there are some changes of his life, he did it as a father of his kids.  and now i looked sexy, i cared so much of my health and my beauty. he cared me and worrying the future of his kids.he got jealous now because maybe i can find the right guy that i wanted too because i looked sexy.|`|XuoT57Idaa	Read "The Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands" This will give you an insight as to your part of the problem here. There are things you can do to change your behavior that will effect his. <br>  <br>  Men typically react to positive comments, not negative ones. We are only hearing your side of the story. Do you nag him day and night? Would he prefer to be gone to being at home? Our home is the soft place for my husband to land at the end of the day.<br>  <br>  Smoking in the house and verbally abusing you could be HIS ways to get back at you for your behaviors.<br>  <br>   Your hubby could just be a giant jerk, but YOU married him. I would give the book a try and see what happens. For sure, this is not a healthy marriage or healthy role model for your children. Things have to change drastically. Good luck!
831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I had  a "past" with the sister of the girlfriend of my wife. She was the love of my life, I even had dreams about her.<br>       When I met my wife it all stopped, the girlfriend knew this, she met another guy too. So our parting was amicable.<br>  <br>        We've met between the years and said "hi" that was it. My wife is not jealous. She had her relationships too. Some where she spent the night. One guy, a bartender was still after her every time we stopped at that certain bar, he wouldn't leave her alone or take "no" for an answer. I had to have a "talk" with him. <br>  <br>       What do you base your jealousy on ? is there reason you don't trust her ?|`|c07v7O80aa	Anything you DO that reacts to it will just show her you're an insecure twit, and she just might start thinking about what it would have been like with the man she knew in school instead of the boy she's with. Not that she would do anything about it, but you just look like a doofus. Of course, what you would be showing her would actually be you the way you are now, so spend some time working on YOU, and quit worrying about her. Jealousy = Fear. Not too pretty. Not too manly.|`|SckWdjnVaa	'Old flames die hard' . <br>  <br>  U should just talk & tell her that though its alrite for her to keep in touch with an old fren, it hurts u when he also happens to be her 'Ex'.<br>  <br>  Ask her to put herself in your shoes....im sure no lady would like her hubby mingling with his Ex-GFs !|`|nYmeNbkTaa	just dont waste your time in thinking such non sense because that was her past and past never comes in present untill u want to comes in present so love your wife and beleive that she is yours and only of yours|`|t3JpgI1Paa	if this guy is an old boy friend she shouldn't be hanging around him out of respect of you|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Stop being silly.

Have your mom get a good lawyer.  If she can't afford one, she can find a lawyer that will take her case on "pro bono" - meaning he/she won't charged her initially.  He will take some of the final settlement.

God created men and women for purpose and reasons. Marriage vows: for better or for worst, for good health or sickness, for riches or poors, and until death do us apart. All these means no matter what they should stay unti the day they died, dust covers their eyes. Your father has had not been a faithful, royal, loving care, compassion husband and father. Sex is a big deal and important to him than anything else. <br>  I understand your pain and your angers toward him. Yes, I would rather live a life without a father than have a father like that in my life. Do your family go to church or believe in God? Your father fell into temptation and needs prayer. Only God can changes him and turn him into a good loving husband and father. I think that you need to stand up and confronting him. In your situation is not healthy and you and your mother deserve a better life. I am so very sorry that your father put you and your mom thru this terrible situation.

b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	You can contact your nearet sheriffs dept to see if there is a warrant out for his arrest as a deadbeat Father. If there was ever a court order from back then there would surely be a warrant for his arrest for non payment and they will tell him or contact a family law attorney and have them do it. But chances are theres not as he would have at least ant tax refunds confiscated for back pay or the law would have caught up with him. Now she could sue him now in court for money owed but chances are it wouldnt do her any good due to the length of time. I wouldnt worry about it now.|`|ob9oJpKbaa	Doesn't sound like she claimed child support, otherwise he would have heard by now.He should call the Child Support Agency just to make sure though. <br>  <br>  If she intended on claiming child support, she would have called the Child Support Agency and had to give them all of your brother-in-laws details, and even if she didn't have a phone number or an address for him, they would have found him as soon as he did a tax return.<br>  <br>  Its a shame he didn't get to see his daughter grow up because of the selfish acts of his ex. Good luck.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	If, in 19 years, she hasn't come after him for child support, I don't think she will. <br>  <br>  He should be ready if his child ever comes looking for him. If it were me, I would have been looking for my child as soon as she left and insisting on joint custody and regular visitation.|`|YMgm99gdaa	So what's the problem here?  :P|`|lJPKjVqIaa	If he owed child support and has worked a regular job, they would have found him by now. Every ligitimate employer has to report every new hire by their social security number to the state. The state then runs the social to see if their are any wage garnishments from any state. Its a nation wide program.|`|yL3Qxsmaaa	well it depends, if she was ever on any kind of public assistance he most likely will have back child support but if she never filed for support through a county office or through the child support courts then he probably doesn't .  if he knows where she lives he could call the local child support office and talk with someone who can help him.|`|2Vl6I4Praa	The women should go to the state. They will order a blood test and be able to tell if the child is his and if it is, he should pay child support.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	No, he knows that he owes child support either to her, the man who has raised his child, or any one of 50 states  He can go to any social services department and give them his social security number and the name of the child and he can find out.|`|AA11280073	There are many sources to trace people online. Google USA People Search  It would help if he has her soc sec. number. Is he sure the child is his?
LRbcznGxaa	Sorry, but If you like him, I suggest letting him go (how do I put it; lover wise?) For your sake. Plus, if he can do that to you, he's not worth it. That's universal for boys AND girls. but you want to still remain his brother that's all up to you. If you want, confront him too and maybe solve it directly. it seems that reconciling with your feelings are the hardest to cope with. I'd find friends who I can trust to help heal as well. Good luck!|`|MFDV9FHSaa	You sound like one of my classmate desperate for friends. Eventually you just scare all your friends away. You have to learn and make new friends instead of hanging around with the same friend. I know is tough but then there is the solution. Or maybe you try talking to him. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3reHk4I1aa	i think that you should confront him and tell him that you feel left out and that you though that you guys were like brothers. sit down and talk to him about how you are feeling about this whole situation.|`|0VqXYmiTaa	Have you tried to go up to him and say hi and start a convo?<br>  Dont wait for him, you should talk first.|`|wiDW2Dtbaa	omg<br>  this is serious<br>  hurmm my suggestion<br>  go and talk to him<br>  you guys have been a good friend for a longer time before B right<br>  so you must hv known each other better<br>  if i were at yr place<br>  i probably just ignored him n try to make other friends<br>  although its kinda hard<br>  but if he can do it<br>  so why cant u??<br>  its better you go n talk to him first<br>  you will become much stressful if you keeping this by yourself<br>  try to talk to someone
b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	In todays society, what was once viewed as rare but happens occurs all the time now and nobody cares anymore.

I would say the it would bother the couple more than it does society|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	the story of my mum and her sugar boy!<br>  <br>  It's ok, as long as they love each other, why care what others think anyway??? <br>  <br>  You can never ever never ever ever ever satisfy everybody!|`|c07v7O80aa	The ones who aren't useless twits with nothing better to do will see someone who, like them, doesn't walk around worrying what people will think.|`|KwNpyp3saa	I think it is more common nowadays. It depends on the individual. Some 26 year old men can be very mature and ready to settle down. They both can bring something to the relationship.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	It's always weirder at a younger age, but when you're older, you adapt to whoever you're with. My dad's mom is like 67ish and her husband is 50 (young enough to be my dad's brother). But he acts like he's as old as her, so I guess that age doesn't matter hugely once you're older.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	TO EACH THEIR OWN. There are plenty of couples with age gaps...regardless if it's the man or woman who is older.<br>  <br>  My personal thoughts are....it would be weird if the age gap was more than 10-15 years, just because common interests can't be all that great between say a 26 year old and a 46 year old.|`|SckWdjnVaa	When the couple failed to see anything wrong in their relationship before tying the knot, why should they bother now about the society.....its too late now, dont u think?|`|UYTdVcDkaa	I prefer older women.

I don't know about society, but I am 42 and I don't have anything in common with a 26 year old male.  <br>  <br>  I can trade experience for energy and be perfectly content in every way--I like my man to be close in age to me.
e6Kyqb22aa	That's horrible! She's just like my ex-friend. We made up a word at this camp and I used the word, just like normal and then she was all like "What? I made that up when I was little!" but I know she didn't because...well we made it up...anyhoo just ditch the fool. She doesn't need to trouble and depress you.. she doesn't even see you for who you are. be a strong person and move on WITHOUT her. She doesn't see how valuable friendship is.|`|3EM66IWFaa	keep away from that girl
WKBVrHhbaa	You should really appreciate that your brother is looking out for you, thats real sweet.<br>  <br>  You can talk to this boy through email or text without your brother seeing|`|AA10757358	You should be obeying your parents.  If they say no talking to boys then why are you doing it?  If your brother knows you are talking to boys and not telling your parents he is an accomplice to your breaking the rules therefore is as guilty as you.|`|25sTuyULaa	Well, you're not going to like my answer, but if you're only 14, you really should be minding your parents and not worrying about boys just yet.  I know that sounds harsh, but believe me, the boys will still be there in a couple of years, and you'll be better able to deal with them-and your brother-then.  As for your brother being overly protective, be glad you only have one.  I had two older brothers, and I thought I would never have a life.  It all worked out in the end, though, and only one of them still cares about what I do.  Give yourself some time, okay?  Don't be so anxious to grow up.  It happens quickly enough as it is.
dHYVE076aa	Yes he is my best friend, and my neighbor =). He is the best friend I have ever had and my only friend right now. I see him more than I see my parents. And I live with my parents lol. Its nice to know that I will never have to be alone again, that I found someone to spend the rest of my life with. I'm lucky because I am 16, so I have a lot more time to spend with him.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	Yes. I don't think you should seriously date someone who isn't your best friend. If you can't tell them everything, the relationship won't go very well. And why would you not want your husband (or wife) to also be your best friend?|`|ptActoJ7aa	NO! get some friends freak!!!!!!|`|3EM66IWFaa	why not? a boy friend or girl friend can be good friends sure.|`|Kpg5i1LUaa	Yep, he sure is!|`|WKBVrHhbaa	he should be|`|Iv9Y8lb0aa	of course i do!! i consider my best friend the first person who i go to when i cry, when im confused about something, when i need advice, someone who i can call at 3 in the morning about something important the person who i have the most fun with, ect<br>  <br>  yeah hes definatly my best friend <br>  <br>  =)|`|cf08c84d09564bf808d82fdf04701107aa	yes i do. like you said i tell him everything and anything..so why not? i mean it's pretty cool isn't it?? lol <br>  <br>  i love it. :]|`|ldA4V0TZaa	of couse because when your dating you have to learn to trust each other so you might as well cosider yourselves best friends|`|ayOWrkNtaa	yes and it is so much easier to do things with him, not one of us studders from saying something to one another.|`|CT64FYrvaa	yeah, we share laughs and love to be around each other, at else i do, i'm not so sure about him tho,lol

d0WQ2pZNaa	After sex guys may seem a little distant, but its all part of the ride hun.<br>  he'll come around again.<br>  <br>  <br>  OR, you're just that girl he goes to for sex, although listen to your intuition, trust your instincts and do what you think is best.<br>  Maybe he's just new at all this, and he needs sometime to get away and find himself after all of it.<br>  Also with the IM thing, maybe he was busy or not at the computer and then came back and logged off, don't be to demanding for him or he'll lose interest.|`|FE8XfvEYaa	don't see him any more he is not taking you seriously im sorry to tell you this but it looks like he just wants you to be his **** up body.....try to see other people|`|OyEEyIpdaa	sorry hun but it sounds like youre a booty call!|`|NCQSOIHSaa	yes, i think that was not your love, that was only an infatuation , an attraction between you nd him. that was a moment when you nd he were in a situation that made a mistake . but this is not necessary  for u , because u should have to grow up in your life. may be it makes u mentally depress, but its true. other side i think that u loves him , u like him. but if he don't try to understand u then why u r trying to understand him friend? i want to say some thing , we often love those people who leaves us, but we leaves people who loves us. if u really love him then he must comeback to u. so just give a time for your relation ship, and see where your relation going on.|`|qvUFVgiVaa	seems like he was out for a lay|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Why would you give yourself up so easily? Why are you doing those things with someone you don't know very well? If you can't trust someone, you shouldn't be having sex with them.|`|ACNECiZAaa	One of two things has happened. 1) You have been put into that unfortunate category of friends with benefits or 2) he's afraid to ruin your friendship with sex. Either way talk to him.
nbfxnw9Yaa	definately definately DEFINATELY CHEATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|XTBlOf9baa	I would think he's cheating. He obviously has something to hide. I'd like to dismiss this as a matter of him wanting privacy, but I highly doubt it. Most spouses are open and honest enough with their other spouse that they wouldn't care if they looked at their phone. My husband was just home on leave, and we have the same exact phone, so we were constantly switching up our phones, and we never care because we have nothing to hide. Regardless, if it were just a matter of privacy, he would have just shown it to you after you made a fuss in order to end the argument. Nope, he's got something to hide, I assure you of it. He's probably cheating.|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	NOT: low battery<br>  <br>  SO: Other women's photos and/or text messages|`|Fx77zYhWaa	He's up to no good.  Look his phone records up online since he's probably deleting them since he thinks you're on to him.  If it was really a low battery he'd tell you to put it on the charger or warn you that it might die.   Did he ever put it on the charger during your discussion or was it beeping like it was about to die?|`|RPhla0R7aa	Maybe he is cheating there shouldn't be a problem for your spouse to make a quick call with their cell phone unless they are hiding something.|`|dFUqPcWKaa	Yeeeeeah. Not cool. Would definitely have a talk with him, and go to couples counseling.|`|WItKOQh7aa	What happens to women when they get married? Do they drill a hole in your head, and your brains leak out?<br>  <br>  If your husband is hiding his phone, it's because he didn't delete the texts his girlfriend sent him, or he's afraid she's going to call while you're snooping through it.<br>  <br>  Are you this naive with respect to raising your children?  If you find rolling papers and sticky bud in your kids room, are you gonna get on line to Answers and ask if he's smoking pot?<br>  <br>  What is it? Do you get retarded AFTER you get married, or do you have to be retarded to get married in the first place?|`|DVQ7cKxeaa	yah. i countered so much of embarrassment in terms of behavior of my husband.i caught it in text messaging some more cares and friendship messages really angry and i nagged my husband because i want it to tell me the truth but nothing it works.  he said don't touch my phone and don't open any messages because he don't want me to got hurts and it just a text.  he never wants that im lose her as his wife just because of text and phone.because many of there friends are just joking and kidding in text. now i understand his side. i keep my own cellphone for not seeing him and i don't want to touch his phone also  if without permission him.I just repect him  so that no more troubles can happen.|`|aCMkyR3saa	hes hiding something  battery low yeah get real your not making a big deal hes hiding something he doesnt want you to find out   id get the phone when hes in the shower or call the phone company and get a record of his call list|`|KtDUx4Cuaa	He has something to hide|`|AnrWevtGaa	It sounds a bit suspicious. You have to ask yourself some questions here though. Have you had a reason to not trust your husband before? And if so, Why is he your husband if you can't  trust him? I've been dating someone for over 2 years now and they don't like me to use there phone when they are not around - I respect that. I trust them. When I asked them why, the response was, "I don't want you to violate my privacy". I respect that, and as I said, I trust the person so I don't push it too much. But in the back if my head I sometimes think, "well if I trust this person, shouldn't they also not trust me to violate their privacy?". Then again, I have not made the ultimate commitment to this person by marrying them. Have another sit down with your husband as this is obviously bothering you. You guys are married - "you" and "I" is now "we" and "us", there should be no secrets and no hiding of anything. I'm sort of in the same boat as you now, but if I were engaged or close to marriage this would be a problem for me - I like everything to be in the open. I would definelty have to get on my significant other if were thinking of marraige and work that issue out beforehand. And if we were married and suddenly having this problem I'd sit down and let them know how I feel and as them to please do me a favor and help reassure me by showing me that there is nothing in their phone.

I think you would be really upset if you didn't get it.|`|b9Hl0ITnaa	I think it is very flattering and it has nice straps where you can hide very supportive undergarments underneath, wich for me (being a 40DD and a size 16/18) is a very important thing.   It is a very pretty, modern and elegant gown.  It will be wonderful. Good luck.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	A lot of answers like this dress. I have to disagree. I dont think the sparkle/beading at the waist is flattering. With the fabric wrapping, it is creating way "too much" going on in the waist area. Ive seen other dresses that I liked much better for a curvy girl. Look for one that elongates the waist, not shortens it.|`|SoRLHQeRaa	Beautiful, it flatters in all the right places|`|jbcX0LPWaa	Omg!

Nice choice - it would be very flattering to a curvy silhouette.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Wow, it's beautiful. I love the detail on the bodice.<br>  And good on that designer for using plus sized models rather than the stick thin ones you see everywhere else.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	Clean lines, feminine-- very nice and classy|`|B24W8w43aa	Perfect.|`|cd962e52b53659b6dacb1df7cbdf7a87aa	the trim around the waist makes the model look very fat  I do not like that dress|`|AaoclPYCaa	I love it.

Let him know he has a chance and flirt with him.|`|H4BdOPelaa	Wounded
AA12346188	It is next to impossible - because everyone has their own individual brain.<br>  There is no other go, but to accept them as they are and with required compromising attitude (without foregoing your individuality).<br>  You can only make friendship with a Computer (without brain) as it works as per your commands as a faithful slave.
g2QUNwZzaa	oh, to be young....<br>  <br>  your friends are all just jealous. it makes me hella-jealous when i see a girl i like even breathe on another guy. tell ur friends to grow up and stop being behotches. if they want these guys tell them to go get them, or you could do the same. cuz if ur friends bad mouth you to someone whose actually ur boyfriend then they arent friends worth keeping|`|w8Fdk02maa	1st because you just want to keep your friends I would suggest opening up to those girls that seem jealous. Tell them that you only want to be friends with those boys and let them try to get them. If the guys don't like them and like you, then they have to swallow that and move on lol.the problem is, teenage girls you are friends with are very insecure and will put others down to build them up... even if it is a close friend... why is this? Because their pride was hurt. Pride gets nothing out of having something, but rather having more than the next person.|`|2Mu7ZcpDaa	Try still being friends with them, but make sure it's all friendly.<br>  Don't go past borders, & be sure they don't like you back or your bound to find more drama.<br>  Make sure your not flirting with them without notice, it happens.<br>  I hope I helped?
BKr3y30maa	I understand you're frustrated, you want to be able to kiss your girlfriend whenever you want.  Maybe you should talk to her about it.  Tell her that you enjoy kissing her.  Don't be pushy about it though.  Just tell her "I am going to respect what you ask, I was just wondering why you feel that way about us kissing"? Then see what she says.  Maybe she is scared that you will want to advance the relationship to other things more intimate than kissing.  So you may want to tell her that those aren't your intentions, you just enjoy kissing her.  Email me if you have anymore questions.|`|b5c7f6bef65d4f3c4f8ebc309eccc08aaa	study a dictionary|`|n01WYIl3aa	well just dont kiss her on the lips. give her little kisses here && there on the forhead or ont he cheek. NOT TOO MUCH. NOT ALL AT ONCE.|`|j2FGbecYaa	Make her feel comfortable and rather not think about kissing, all the time... Stay cool n calm. Good Luck!|`|nj1LZcImaa	yeah, you should slow down and keep patience until she feel comfortable.  Try to understand your girlfriend more.
PNrJS4OKaa	Because this has happened before (stating it's a habit now) i suggest you leave him alone for awhile. If he wants to hang with you, he will have to reach out to you, that way things become clear. Giving him time to explain, when it has happened many times before, also gives him time to come up with excuses, but that's just my take on it.|`|XENd8mNhaa	My answer is to do unto others as you would have them do unto you.You rethink your priorities and make your decision,basically friends will be friends.So I would suggest you two talk and then you can make your decision.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Leave him be, whatever it is he's going through he'll be in touch with you if he's really your friend. You can only be you and can't make him or anyone else treat you well. But you can control what kind of treatment you'll tolerate from other people. If this is a reoccurring problem then be good to yourself and stand up like you would if this was happening to your best friend and he/she asked you for advice. You know you deserve better so demand it of yourself.|`|juSJrU4waa	hey, I would just let him be the douche-bag he is and leave him alone. Good friends will always let you know whats going on, and the TRUE friends will text you once an hour to see where you're at and tell you to call back or whatnot.<br>  <br>  I just had an episode where I ran into an old friend and talked with her for half-hour and the pack I was going around with (bar hopping)just left me there without saying anything, so I'm more hurt than you are :.....(
0VT3kH0Haa	Boys can be hard to understand.<br>  I think he wants to be your boyfriend now, but maybe wanted to give you, essentially, an excuse to say 'no' if you needed to. I think he was scared of rejection.<br>  <br>  But yes, I think he likes you and wants to date you now.<br>  <br>  Have fun! (:
bSmAc23Baa	The only way that you can stop this wedding is by . . <br>  <br>  Proving this person is not mentally competent<br>  <br>  Proving this person is not 18 years old or did not receive parental permission to marry<br>  <br>  Proving this person is a first cousin<br>  <br>  Proving this couple does not have a VALID Marriage License<br>  <br>  You are not the first person to dislike a new person coming into the family, and you will not be the last.  If you wish to clearly show your disapproval about this couple then do not attend the wedding or any of the pre-wedding activities.  There is no reason to scream or holler or shout about this situation to other people, they will get the message that you disapprove by not attending any activities or the wedding.  And if you wish to continue showing your disapproval of your brother's choice in a wife then do not go to family dinners or birthday parties or holiday dinners where the couple will be in attendance.<br>  <br>  Answered by:  A Certified wedding specialist / A Professional bridal consultant / A Wedding ceremony officiant|`|3foSwZpWaa	No. <br>  You can try talking to your brother, in private if you want, but that probably won't do any good. <br>  If you do anything to try to stop the wedding, or if you are just always a jerk to his fiance', you're likely to lose any relationship with your brother too. <br>  You're going to have to deal with it, like it or not. We all have family we hate. :)|`|n3Agaj6naa	Legally there is nothing you can do.  <br>  And if you offer up an ultimatum he'll most certainly pick his fiance.<br>  <br>  You're very brattish if you think her as your SIL affects you all that much.  So you see her on holidays, and maybe for dinner now and then.  The way I see it, she's got the worse half of the deal by gaining you into her family, as her SIL.  Get over yourself.|`|zNuZm4K6aa	Unless you can prove she has committed a crime and have her arrested, or unless she is currently still married to someone else, you are out of luck. Sorry.  Sometimes people have to make their own mistakes and live with them!|`|dc500182581d351f03c845444a3479f5aa	Do your brother a favor and GROW UP.|`|zll28kQ1aa	try to put him off her or put her off him.<br>  <br>  if that don't work. do something to the bride ;)|`|gpCjrJFcaa	U can show ur brother that she is not a decent girl or try this with ur parents|`|NaKW0E5Baa	No you can't.<br>  And your pretty cold for even thinking it.<br>  <br>  My future MIL hates me. When I started dating my now  fiance, she told him how she felt, for about 6 months I felt terrible because I was causing strife within his family. Eventually, he told her that he loved me, and that it wasn't going to end in the near future and she kicked him out of home for that. He was 17.<br>  He worked full time in a supermarket for about a year, before he found a job as a farm hand. I felt terrible that whole year. I felt that he'd thrown away his life for me, and dealt with terrible depression that year, because of my guilt.<br>  The whole time, his mother kept in contact with him. Sending him elaborate birthday gifts, making him feel guilty about being with me not her.<br>  Still, he stayed with me because he loved me. Even when our relationship was long distance, because his farm was away from my university, he stayed with me.<br>  3 years after he was kicked out of home (He was 20, I was 19) he moved closer to me, having got a better job offer, and his mothers hopes  of a breakup were dashed.<br>  <br>  <br>  He proposed 3 weeks ago. We haven't decided on much about the wedding yet, though it is stressful already. How does that even work???<br>  One of the few things we have decided about it, is that his mother shant be invited.<br>  <br>  Don't you dare hurt your brother and his fiancee the way my fiance's Mum hurt us.<br>  <br>  It's selfish, and honestly, all it means is that your a heartless b*tch. I can assure you, if you cause a scene, he won't choose you.|`|cX5ctGSNaa	how old are you? this just sounds like teenage angst. Wait until your hormones settle down then you might look back and understand just how childish you sound right now<br>  <br>  And there is no way to legally stop a wedding. Its going ahead no matter what. Yes you can talk to him. Yes you can disrupt the wedding. Yes you can stand up and say "I object". But none of that is a sure-fire way to stop the wedding (although it may be a sure fire way to lose a great relationship with your brother). The only thing you can do is talk to him in a MATURE, ADULT way, and not like  ""well i don't want her as my SIL, i won't accept it at all"". I mean come on, how old are you??|`|8bDtrCJRaa	I need to know the same thing, my moms marrying this moroccan man that she met over the internet and he just moved in about a month ago and all hes done is start trouble, and hes breaking the family apart, and my moms a whole different person for the worse and there getting married next sunday! I need all the help i can get too. :(|`|iDfRTLklaa	The short answer to that is NO.  <br>  <br>  I think its time for you to grow up, and realise that people can make their own lives, and own mistakes.|`|0zkjSoVtaa	there's nothing legal<br>  i suppose you could try talking to him but if he loves her then you're pretty much s o l|`|EZTIwHMkaa	ask.if not...well your out of luck.|`|9XJZB0Emaa	Mind your own business trouble maker.  You have heard that before because it is true.  Do this and they will get married anyway, YOU will just not be a part of it and believe me she will make sure that your trouble making little butt is not a part of his life.  She will win, no doubt so you had better back off.  Anything you do WILL back fire on you.   You are starting a war that you will not win and will piss off a lot of people.  I cannot stand my MIL or my SIL....wheeeewwww I would rather sit in the dentist chair for hours than deal with either one of them. but I have to bite my tounge and bear it.  Anytime I have voiced my opinion...no matter how correct or in the right I was...I was always looked at as a total trouble maker and told to shut the hell up by MANY members of the family...even though they all said the same things behind their backs that I was saying to their faces.  You will be labled a crap starter and a little brat because you are the one voicing up.  Belive me...been there.     If it is not meant to be, it will fall apart on its own, stay out of it for your own good.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	If you try, you will most likely loose your brother and your family. Is it really worth it? Do you really want to NEVER see your family again? You can object and that is all. You legally cannot stop it so don't waist your breath.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	What you have mentioned is not a legal reason, thus you can't legally stop the wedding. Simply not liking someone isn't enough to stop it from happening. Just don't attend if you feel that strongly...and grow up while you're at it.|`|2kl0vQjVaa	How old are you? 12?  Why do you dislike her so much that you are willing to hurt your brother for your own satisfaction?  I am really curious to get an answer to that!  Unless you have a legitimate reason (which there are very few) for wanting to do this, you will most certainly alienate yourself from your family!!!!  You need to grow up and stop being a selfish little b****!|`|2PDBxlYDaa	Okay hon even if you say you object when the priest asks if anyone objects, they'll listen to you and then they will escort you out and they will proceed with the wedding.  I know you don't like her but there's not much that you can do.|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	No. In fact, you can be arrested and charged (and sued) if you do anything to disrupt the wedding.<br>  <br>  Maybe think about the fact that she isn't the problem here.|`|AaoclPYCaa	NO.  Stop being a selfish child and let your brother have his life.
aNlT1NRqaa	I like it trimmed neatly. Bald makes women look like they're trying to look prepubescent. It wouldn't stop me or turn me off, but not my first choice.<br>  <br>  If you're sleeping with someone, you better be able to tell each other what you like. Otherwise it will become monotonous and someone will look elsewhere or end the relationship out of boredom.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you both know what the other wants before you spend a ton of $$$ on bondage gear.  :)|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Most guys like it either completely shaved or a landing strip.|`|AA10347643	Neatly trimmed.|`|8K3IucU3aa	my boyfriend likes it shaved but with a little bit of hair. basically trimmed.|`|xKNjvVLXaa	now what are you guys talking?|`|AA12354369	I'll be completely, utterly, painfully honest.  I HATE hair between the legs.  ANY HAIR AT ALL between the legs turns me off.  I will literally go limp if I see it.  BUT I have to point out that I'm not a normal guy.  Some guys like it to be very hairy, some like it to be lightly trimmed, some like it shaped, others like it bald.  Try different styles with your boyfriend, from letting it grow to trimming it short, to shaping to bald and see which one gets him most excited.  try a "racing stripe", shaving the lips and everything bald, but leaving a strip of hair an inch or two wide at the top of your slit going up to your pantie line.<br>  <br>  No, I have no problem telling my girlfriend this.  We have talked, in very great detail, about things we want to do during sex, because it doesn't bother us to talk about it.<br>  <br>  And for the record, she didn't ask me what I prefered, I requested that she shave it smooth.  After she did, she kept it that way, partly because I like it, partly because she thinks it feels really good<br>  <br>  And by the way, I wouldn't mind shaving myself down there, but a couple things stop me.  The fact that I have a LOT of THICK hair all over my body, and the fact that my girlfriend won't let me.  She LIKES all my hair, so I keep it.|`|9cBAUMnNaa	Yeah this is an awkward question to ask and to answer. My husband likes completely bare the best. He thinks it looks the sexiest. I have to admit, I got him to shave and it was pretty awesome too. You get a lot more skin on skin and friction where it counts. That being said I feel most comfortable at any time not just sex with a little growth, I shave all clean and then let it go a week or two and do it again. That's just me. If your boyfriend doesn't really have an opinion do what makes you feel sexy and comfortable.|`|vJNPEzjdaa	Mhh depends on who see's it haha :) with this Q ur gonna get different answers smooth,bush,trimmed etc. But if ur trying to make it right for the ur nether regions first apperance lol  trim it not to bushy but not shaved, so then eventuly the person will hint a little. Shape it a lil dont have blob but i do recomend (sorry if nasty) towards the top of ur nether region shave or clean it, so that if the guy its u (again sorry) and hes concentrating on ur clit, he will not worry about getting hair in his mouth haha G-Luk|`|AA11546221	I personally like it when a guy shaves every bit of hair on his body because I prefer new hair to grow back...out with the old & in with the new. The body really does feel refreshed when the hair is shaved off. In my opinion, he looks squeeky clean without the hair.|`|lTsONvwQaa	actually some guys dont care some like bush some like bald i personally like it just trimmed|`|lrVbZdSDaa	I'd say I prefer it either trimmed down or shaved, don't have too much of a preference over either one.|`|d36OrpbDaa	my boyfriend likes shaved completely.  but he won't even touch his bush! haha|`|DCzSBPUjaa	100% NO HAIR!<br>  <br>  I'm a guy and I HATE hair. I stay shaved myself and I even shave my head(no, not down low, the head that covers the skull).|`|FkUkKXJZaa	it doesnt matter|`|aWZP3JJlaa	Bush ? it doesnt matter . u will see guys with bushes, and guys wont want to shave it off . soo keep ur bush, but shave ur legs and thighs, stop at ur nether region .|`|skDPEcc8aa	DON'T BELIEVE HIM AND I AGREE WITH DREAM G LANDING STRIP R COMPLETELY BALD|`|TF9hZZxYaa	Im a guy and i would prefer that u shave everything ;)|`|prTLJnXFaa	uh, i prefer shaved and also labia reduction and uh clitoral circumcision ok?|`|myco8rTZaa	i like mine completely smooth.|`|J97E3wBjaa	all of the men that I know like it all shaved.|`|b0Q6ecqzaa	I am a strong believer in the less hair the better when it comes to that.  It might be tough to say that to someone's face, though - I can see how I might feel that if I came up with something other than what my partner did, I could easily fear that I might not get to inspect it at all.<br>  <br>  More importantly than that, though, is hair in other places.  I have actually had to stop when my g/f had a wad of underarm hair or a mustache.  It's just such a turnoff, because it tells me that she didn't bother to take care of herself.  If she can't even take care of yourself, how can I expect you to take care of me properly?

469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	They are insecure and use money as a way to judge others - and make themselves feel superior. Men can be just as materialistic with respect to cars, clothes, gadgets, and computers.<br>  <br>  Insecurity is at the heart of all superficial judgments. Some judge others by what they own; others by how much they weigh; others by skin colour. And each of them will have what sounds at first hearing to be a reasonable reason for doing so. But it's all insecurity and a desperate need to be thought of as better than others.|`|9nygTkHZaa	I dig unmaterialistic girls.<br>  <br>  it's just the way things are I guess. look at your strong values and beleifs. There always are people opposite you i guess|`|W0AK2Lumaa	Society<br>  And trust.<br>  They feel they can trust YOU more if you have what they have....<br>  Its dumb but hey so are most people LOL...|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Materialistic girls are insecure. Stand up for your beliefs and don't let them get to you.|`|l43NSgHyaa	Our society has, and will always have, people of different income levels.<br>  <br>  Those people tend to stay together.  I am not rich and I'm middle class.   But, let the truth be told, more than likely, my friends are going to have similar social status as me.   I'll still talk to people who wealthier than me or less stable than me.<br>  <br>  But, that doesn't mean I'm going to be friends with them.   I've been lucky enough to recieve many nice items as gifts.  Including, Tiffany's jewerly,. two pairs of UGGS, a Burberry Scarf, diamond earrings,  two Coach bags and a Louis Vuttion wallet.<br>  <br>  Yes, sometimes when I'm wearing that stuff, people assume I'm from a higher class and yes, they might give me more attention.   But, I take it as a sign that they assume I have similar interests, similar background, similar experiences, similar education level, similar income........etc, etc.<br>  <br>  I understand it, they are seeing me as someone new, that might be exactly like them and that might fit well with their friends and lifestyle.<br>  <br>  I'm never offended by it.  I understand where they're coming from.   In the end, I know I don't belong with the more wealthy people, because I can't maintain that status of living.  I'm not upset by it and it would be wrong of me to try to pretend to be like them.   In the end, it's not going to work out.<br>  <br>  When they ask me to an expensive day trip or shopping at a store where the cheapest item is $500, it's going to be clear there is a difference.  So, more than likely, the friendship will be short lived.<br>  <br>  So, it's not wrong for people to assess others like this, it's a way of knowing if people have similar interests and ways of living as we do.   Yes, people might not talk to you with your Target gag, but that doesn't mean they think you're scum.   They just realize, your two different people, from two different ways of living and that in the end, your friend is probably not made in heaven.<br>  <br>  So, stop feeling slighted and stop feeling like you're above these people, because you feel they judged you because you had a nice bag.    Truthfully, you've probably judged someone based on their appearance at least once in your lifetime and you've also probably based your friendships around individuals with similar social levels as you. <br>  <br>  People do it everyday.  So, don't assume that everyone is a materialistic jerk.   But, everyone does judge (to a certain extent) on appearance.   It's a fact of life.   If a poor person had said, to you, "Hey Miss, I feel like you're treating me badly, because you have a nice bag."   How would you feel?  You'd probably be like,  "No I didn't.  I just didn't think to talk to you, because we didn't have anything in common."   <br>  <br>  Trust me, you're judging someone because they thought you had money.  But, someone with no money, probably saw you with that bag and thought you were being a snot to them.   <br>  <br>  It's just the way stuff works.
88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Absolutely,  I eventually felt that with every guy I ever dated before my husband.  Sometimes I felt it very early on, sometimes later.  Knowing who is not "the one" eventually leads you to discovering who is "the one".  It's a good learning experience.|`|kHEFi3ttaa	Definitely. I'd actually given up on love. I figured I'd just get old and have a little fun dating now and then and just be the crazy cat lady. So when I found "the one" it made it that much sweeter to realize that my dreams as a little girl of living a life like my parents have (successful happy marriage of 35 years and going)|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	Do you think it's possible that you would feel that way about all men that you were involved with? Are you always going to be looking for something else, no matter what you have? Do you think that you may be afraid of commitment? Do you feel the same way when you are with him, or only when you are separate?<br>  <br>  These are the questions that I ask myself when in doubt. I hope that they help you.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	I have had a few guys they were definately more a big warning sign, as in danger keep away. Does that count as feeling they were 'not the one'? <br>  And then there have been others that were more possibilties, but didn't work out in the end...|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Sure. I dated a guy for 11 months who was perfect for me on paper. We met through a church group. He was a nice guy, but I wasn't happy, even though I was ready to get married. I broke up with him. I met my husband about 3 years later.|`|chZFmJOPaa	I felt that with all my ex's lol.|`|DT4PHmukaa	This is the wedding section. Postpone the wedding honey. Not to be rude but you don't want to enter into this life of marriage unsure. Tell him you need some time to think. He may be a little upset(within reason) but hopefully he will understand. Don't be nervous about postponing the wedding-It is better to postpone than to enter into an unhappy marriage. Take time to think. He might not be your knight in shining armor. Just take time to think for now and make the big decision " I Do" or "I Don't" later after taking some time to think.|`|LtVXBZ1baa	yea. But stuff like that happens you cant stop it. you can only be reliable for the outcome. Sometimes that even makes you stop and think|`|LvWgMLEGaa	Yes. I've SOO felt that, once.<br>  This guy once asked me out,<br>  and in the back of my mind,<br>  it was screaming, "No, he's<br>  not the right one, say no."|`|k57Kvgn8aa	jaiime. some people find true love<br>  some just settle down<br>  you can either take the long road or the easy road
ml2FDYECaa	A woman who knows what she wants, and if she doesn't she's discovering herself and not giving up in the process.<br>  Goal oriented...achieving those goals. Humor is a bonus. One who is open, and learning about new things. Easy going. Opposites attract. Spontaneous moments are the best, so if a woman can do that when it's not in her character...then there you go. A funny laugh. No drama...I can go on, and on, but there you go.|`|QBWiPLVnaa	I'm not a guy, so I wouldn't know. But, I don't think there's anything more to it than for the girl to be herself.

9wDVW6ntaa	yes i do! my grades aren't the best but their mine. the worst thing of all im Gay and the only person who knows is my girlfriend and bff they don't mind but im afraid others wont accept me. i know im only 11 but in know im gay i get this tingly feeling when i get around other boys and i hope u dont mind it .<br>  <br>  but the worst part is me and a couple of my friends were sexualy abused there were only 3 of us and 5 of them we were in a graveyard and they got out and asked us where a place was and grabbed me joey and isaiah. the people said if we told anyone about it they would find us again do the same thing then slowly torture us to death. but before we were even let free they decided to drop us in a pit of  sticks and leave us to die but luckily there was a stick sharp enough to cut loose and we made it home
sbeoF50gaa	It sounds like she can't decide what she wants. Yall are still young :) and NEVER wait for a girl. You meet someone you like take a chance. I can't tell you how SHE feels about you cuz I've never seen her around you, but from what you say either she doesn't want people to know she likes you, or she just can't decide. Either way it's not worth waiting for :)<br>  <br>  <br>  HEY Madmans gotta point! You could just ask her!|`|jL9myhmqaa	nah|`|wAaBOnYXaa	no you shouldn't, never waste a chance|`|8hvCSfDKaa	Man this is going on too crazy just ask her what she is upto?<br>  does she want to make you feel jealous or is she just playing with you<br>  do ask her out <br>  ask her what is all this about|`|N8DxgAD7aa	She got fed up with your long posts..|`|Ac68qzGcaa	i think she likes you|`|YyWhUkDYaa	You got to remember that if something is hard to get its value goes up....gold ect, it works the same with your time.....ignore her a bit.|`|sqnvZmSkaa	u waited too long bro u shoulda ask her out|`|FEYN650gaa	time you both grew up and went on a date. you ask her to her face in front of her friends to show you have some balls|`|okXvWN5haa	she is obviously showing you that you had a chance with her, and i think with all the different guys she is just trying to make you jealous.i think that you should talk to her about it if you wee such good friends before. and if your are not able to approach her about it, then i think that you just need to move on. good luck|`|CNSGz12zaa	Yep give up, she sounds like a flirt and who wants that. She is probably already used goods anyway.|`|rsdU9QmNaa	Dude im a girl and i know that she didnt really like you. But she may have liked you on one point but then she prabally gave up and decided to toy with you.but you know what it doesnt matter what other people do or say it may hurt but you have to keep moving on and you will definetly find someone better
mkshF2Pfaa	Definitely, and for several reasons. If you've had the time to fall in love with whoever you're with, you've likely had time to learn his/her body, and s/he has had time to learn yours. This means better sex for both parties. Another factor is the security being with someone you care about brings. You aren't nearly as self-conscious, as you know that the other person will not completely discard you if you do something wrong. Emotions also fall into the mix, but I'm not going to attempt to describe it, as it's more of an undercurrent in the whole event, one which can't exactly be pinpointed.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Yes, it's more emotions..so it's beautiful.|`|Gv6UW2p2aa	What does sex have to do with love?  <br>  Love is emotional where as sex is physical.<br>  Most girls associate sex with love, but that's where they differ from guys.  You can get your emotional needs satisfied by being together, holding hands, talking, cuddling, etc.  but when it's sex time, it's all about getting naughty.|`|jTV6rLX3aa	Anything you do with someone you love is much better than with someone you don't care much about. Sex is no exception.|`|CwXe7OgIaa	Hell yes, would've said no a couple of years back, and I know it sounds corny, but it really is!|`|AA10997134	I think yes cause in my opinion sex and love belong together<br>  What do u think?|`|K3Kop7l9aa	Yes, it really is...Its so much more meaningful to both partners and so much more passion and happiness when you are in love with each other. I didn't wait until I was married but I know that if I did I'm not sure I would have known the beauty of making love to my Husband. I love him very much and our sex is so much more passionate than I've ever had with anyone.|`|VxySsVbwaa	yes it is. The more you care about each other, the more you want to make the other feel good. Extra motivation=much better sex.|`|PNrJS4OKaa	Yes, it helps having strong feelings for the other person. It's much more satisfying knowing they're there for other reasons than just sex.|`|7mxCMfYKaa	Sex was intended for marriage. All the diseases and crap would pretty much cease if everyone would wait till they had the one they want forever to have sex. And yes it is so much better.|`|FUyAN0aLaa	Love is emotional where as sex is physical
XrzrSD4Iaa	Don't look for it.<br>  <br>  Wait for it<br>  Wait for it.<br>  <br>  And it will come.

9cBAUMnNaa	You may be overly concerned. If her drinking doesn't affect her life outside her home and she is not hurting herself besides the possible liver damage or whatever then it doesn't seem like a big problem. Also there are people they call functional alcoholics that can live perfectly normal lives and have a drinking problem. I could probably drink a whole bottle of wine from 5-10pm. I probably wouldn't have that much by myself but just drinking that much at once isn't an addiction. <br>  <br>  If she is drinking like that everyday and cannot go without it, that is an addiction. If she is drinking while at work, or driving, that is a problem. <br>  <br>  I don't know what the guy above was thinking about the children. If they are grown then who cares if she drinks around them. They are adults that don't live with her.<br>  <br>  Bottom line I wouldn't worry too much unless it becomes a health problem or she becomes dangerous by driving or injuring herself etc. and like others said she has to make the choice herself to stop drinking if she has a problem.|`|efTvaFFFaa	unfortunately, you are not really able to control her, maybe you could say, that you are going to cut down on wine and alcohol and ask her if you want to do it together, although this IS a pretty colossal hint... If she seems fine and looks fine she's probably doing ok but eventually it might get to be too much for her system to handle so keep an eye out for that and offer support if she needs it. Good Luck :)|`|gT1Ger8faa	I think that you should help her.I mean if you really care about her then you"d do the right thing and help.Drinking is an addiction, but I"m sure with the help of a special friend, she"ll be alright...Do whats right and worry about the rest later...You should be a good friend when needed and now she needs you...|`|3EM66IWFaa	you can't do any thing to stop her drinking until she wishes to stop it her self.|`|AA11292270	Sure, a bottle of wine a night is too much, but why on earth would you ever want a friend to go to AA?  It's full of sexual predators and freakish religion...not someplace a friend would send a friend in my book.|`|peybb4Foaa	Well you really shouldn't care but the kids is what makes me worried.<br>  As long as you live alone drink what ever you want and how much you want but with kids...<br>  Well tell her to not drink when kids are around and all will be fine.<br>  If it gets worse then yes...AA.

Iv9Y8lb0aa	in your situation no way!!! a real good girl should not care about that!!!! if a guy is completely lazy and is like 20 and just hasnt "gotten around to it" yeah thats in my opinion a problem but dont worry about it, if you cant drive because of something serious such as that hunny no, girls shouldnt care that your not driving<br>  <br>  =)|`|OHTeRwSuaa	I wouldn't care. It's really not that big of a deal. And it's not like it's your fault. It would bother me if, say, you got your license suspended for some stupid reason. But because of a tumor?

7u8ZOWnqaa	his bros trying to do something?.. like what, hookup with you? idk, these guys seem not to care at all about your feelings and your virginity which is a big deal so save it for someone who deserves it and treats you better. or atleast someone who is really hot and doesn't act trashy like this. and usually people who overreact over what you're accusing them of are the ones that are guilty after all. but you never know and can't make someone tell the truth and just have to go with ur gut sometimes. how inconsiderate he just doesn't wanna talk when it;s ur virginity ur talking about. move on|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Accusing someone of something he didn`t do is a form of betrayal.<br>  <br>  I`m afraid that he is serious - and to be honest, i would probably have done the same.<br>  <br>  But, considering his scary brother, i would stay away from both of them.
Z3W8t5QJaa	Yeah, well if your friends arent really into the partying scene, you could try to persuade them to just go to one club or something. But, strike up a conversation with that guy. It will lead to new friends who are into partying. Then you can enjoy your life a bit more.
2P2K0rl2aa	Yes many of them do.  Whether it does or not depends on how much restraint you have, or how much love/respect either person has for their husband/wife.|`|QtaPF83iaa	It is very likely it will.  Once you've opened your self to having an emotional affair you've made a weak spot in your relationship and makes it harder to resist temptation.|`|Njgof6hNaa	Emotional affairs have that potential, but if there's no attraction then you're ok. Attraction on either side could mean a potential physical affair. Otherwise, you're just very good friends. Good friendships are rare and mean to be treasured. You're lucky if it's a great friendship. Otherwise, you're both fooling yourself and wanting to have that extra on the side. That's just as bad as a physical affair, because you're cheating yourself and the people in your lives.|`|xoDfbfBNaa	That would depend on the people involved and their circumstances. I think, in many ways, an emotional affair is far more damaging than a physical one. I would even go so far as to say I would prefer my man to have a physical affair over an emotional one if I had to choose.|`|AA12095455	most of the time - yes<br>  emotional or physical - an affair is an affair, hearts get broken.<br>  all affairs do NOT end badly, but most do.<br>  be careful....|`|Bv0v2nV0aa	It can....
FJyLVazVaa	First off keep your money in the bank. If they are that spoiled they'll find the money else where. Second, you need some friends that are better at sharing. Making friends is hard at any age, but if you put the effort into, you just might find some one really cool.  You don't have to drop these two completely but I would start to back away some.|`|rQ7dI88Maa	Sounds like they don't care about you or your feelings.Move on without them.

AA11239811	Find out what he enjoys and is good at, then ask them a question about it.  This does a few things...<br>  <br>  First, it gives him the impression that you have common interests.  This may or may not be true and hopefully, you will choose something that DOES interest you. =)<br>  <br>  Second, it gives you both something to talk about and something that he knows well so you can do more listening and less talking - which makes it less likely you will say something that - as you said - would make a fool out of yourself.<br>  <br>  Third, it gives him a chance to be a hero.  Every guy enjoys being a hero and loves to "fix" things.  Give him that chance and you are off to a good start.<br>  <br>  And lastly, it gives you an innocent "in" to talking with him.  Approach him and say "Hi John (or whatever), I heard you were really good with cars... my car has been making this noise and I was wondering if you had any idea what it might be?"  Or something along those lines with the subject he likes.<br>  <br>  During the conversation.... watch eye contact and body language.  If he maintains eye contact and smiles, that's good.  If he touches you at any time during the interaction, that's better.  Open body language good... closed body language... bad.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SHYvkRxWaa	Well if hes looking at you maybe he's interested<br>  Why don't you smile at him one day or even better: wink, that'll get him wondering!<br>  <br>  For tips & tricks on flirting, dating etc visit<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/heart_x_surgery" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/heart_x_surgery</a>|`|209e41f141cbbdc316ab56170c3c421eaa	1.learn how to talk 2. just be urself|`|ijSRV9p8aa	Talk to him and see what happens.

Esiste invece il problema del riconoscimento della società di diritti essenziali dell'individuo sanciti dalla Costituzione, che mi risulta ancora in vigore. Come eterosessuale non vedo minimamente intaccata l'istituzione della famiglia dal riconoscimento della società di coppie non eterosessuali, e paradossalmente non sono favorevole alla modificazione del diritto di famiglia per le coppie etero di fatto visto che hanno gia il matrimonio e se non intendo usufruirne avranno i loro motivi.

o0JOTzj0aa	What I'd do is talk to the guy you think you'll end up dating about it.  Does he know his bro likes you?  And have oyu had an honest conversation with the one you won't be dating?  Tell him that while you liek him as a friend, your feelings for him don't go any further than that.  Be prepared for the two of them to have a bit of a falling out though - when two mates/siblings like the same person and one of them wins that person, the other one is naturally going to be a bit fed up and there's not much can be done about that.  But it's up to them to sort it out, not you.  All you're doing is dating a guy - it isn't your fault that the other one likes you too, so don't feel guilty, but DO try to be tactful and don't rub his face in it...keep your PDAs to yourselves and don't stop being mates with the other brother, if you were mates in the first place that is.  Just treat his feelings delicately for a while and he'll get over it.|`|b8qTjTBQaa	Its better to date with man that you loves and say the reason to his bro|`|CHmFbRz7aa	if you dont like his brother in that way, then theres no problem in dating the guy you really like.

dfh5XamRaa	He sounds very immature to me. You probably were fine to begin with. First. why is he telling all of his friends your troubles. I could see telling maybe his best friend for advice but it sounds like he told multiple ppl. Second, if he is that easily influenced, he is immature and you might be better off finding someone who can think and act for themselves. Third, if he let his friends call you such a name he had no respect for you. YOU CAN DO BETTER!|`|5636ed341c138c06d26806f900d3d39eaa	that's because the guys stick together and will take his side all the time|`|hiJXETeRaa	Possibly, but his friends may have caused him to see things in a way he didn't before, & it irritated him.  Depending on the topic of the fight, they may also have berated him for being whipped or something.  Finally, it could be that he held things in, but after consulting his friends, decided to change his position.  In any case, you may need to sit down, & try to find out what's bothering him, & what you to can do to work things out, if anything.  Good luck.
AKaxLa2Qaa	when people are drunk the truth comes out unprotected. i was drunk recently and told off a guy i have hated for so long. my boyfriend was drunk and called me and told me that he had been with me because he did not want to leave me because he would be out on the street. when people drink they get really gutsy and are thinking about things. they think too hard about things they have let alone for too long and then as they think about them they want to do something about them and then they make the famous drunken phone calls that everyone has either recieved or made before. but keep in mind that the truth is the raw truth when people are drinking. usually people dont have the coherence to come up with a lie when drunk so they tell you how they really feel. so it is the cold hard unprotected truth. but sometimes its ok to forgive them if they are drunk because sometimes when people think about these things while drunk they over-analyze them and then they call you with suspicion not fact. i.e. a cheating accusation or something else that they are thinking too deeply about and want you to comfort them.|`|41u67CsKaa	He is drunk but he cares abot you.|`|C96MpsKVaa	he was drunk and his mind was telling him to check if you are home, or he was drunk and in the mood for sum luvin and he phoned you, told you the story, tried to make you feel sorry for him and he wanted you to invite him to come to you.|`|EY032yfbaa	He is drunk. Do not take the call too seriously. He may not even remember the conversation tomorrow. Hate to say it, but I have made some of these calls to girls I used to or want to have things with. It's just a weird thing some guys and girls do when drunk. T|`|EhlT9Ozfaa	CAN U SAY BOOTY CALL!!!|`|IRZ2dvQEaa	when u are under the influece of any substance u will do stupid things like call an asshole at 430 in the morning|`|PRaJkjvqaa	he probably wasn't successful at hooking up with a chick at a club and decided that he would call you to see if he could get a booty call! next time if he calls just say that you will have to call him back and make sex noises and moan, tell him that you are busy as you are moaning and have company over, and then hang up! it will leave him with a jealous feeling and you will feel better!|`|e5jNtvIXaa	And why is this guy your ex? There has to be a reason for that. The question is what do you want from him? Do you want him back or do you just want friendship. I wouldn't read too much into the call though, alcohol fuelled as it was. If he sobers up and still says it then you might be more inclined to believe the feelings he says he's confused about. As for why did he call you and not someone else, it's probably because he was annoyed at his friend and he knew you'd side with him cos u don't like that friend anyway. He thought his friend was an asshole for not showing up and he needed to speak to someone who was going to confirm his friend was an asshole.........and he knew you would offer that confirmation.|`|5636ed341c138c06d26806f900d3d39eaa	he was frunk and usually the truth comes out when a person is drunk.
NkiahIABaa	I agree with you on one end but disagree on another. Maybe he shouldn't be soooo judgemental but I had a CFO of a huge company answer that same question for me. His answer was "How many highly successfull people in business have tatoos or earrings?" Now that I'm in a long, steady job...he is right. Should a person want to look the best and be the best? Your chances of real success will go up. Also, ask most people who have tatoos for a couple of years...if they could change their decision...they would.|`|AA12346188	You have to take it as his personal and individual comments.<br>  Stop listening and reacting to such comments.<br>  Either take him as he is till you stay with him (as a dependant) and until you become independent economically and ready to stay away from him.<br>  Till such time, stop sharing your views with him. In that way you can avoid argument.<br>  (As it is said: Argument is the worst sort of conversation)|`|bgtNYOp5aa	yeah tattoos are cool form of expression.

Can't teach an old dog though so let him wallow in his ways and you just make sure you dont grow up to be just like him<br>  <br>  I say that because I know if he act that way towards people with tattoos, he's not tolerant of other habits people have and is probably a very standoffish guy...poor guy|`|8K3IucU3aa	tell him that you know and that he's made that point millions of times. you can also tell him that god says not to judge others.|`|OEZ57OUZaa	Get a tattoo. I have 3 tattoos, soon 4, and I am not a bad person. As a matter of fact, I work my *** off at school.|`|cOce5YbRaa	When I was younger I used to think that tattoos looked repulsive on females but always liked most of the tattoos on men except for evil ones or things like skulls. My best friend had some tattoos and I really loved her tattoos. I went for my first tattoo when I was nearly 40 years old and I am a woman and don't see anything wrong with them at all. It doesn't mean that people are cheap or bad people just because they have tattoos. I love butterflies and I have a tattoo going up each one of my legs from a little ways up my ankles to about 4 inches away from my knees with butterflies, flowers, and doves. I even had a tattoo done around my right ankle of a broken heart that has some small flowers like a bracelet. But my first tattoo was one of my nicknames which is Tigger and I have it tattooed on my left shoulder. My last tattoo is a huge Guardian Angel with a cross and banner that has my parents names and when they was born and when they passed away and it also has a dove that looks like it is coming from Heaven above it and that tattoo is on my left thigh on the top. My Parents was alot older than all of my friends parents because I was a late child and of course I am the baby and my Dad didn't get to see my tattoos since he passed away in 1993. My parents was very old fashioned too but my Mom didn't say that much when I showed her. She just said it was my body but she had to admit that they was really pretty. I consider my tattoos as my way of showing art where other people draw or paint. I don't know how old your Dad is but he needs to quit judging people by tattoos because it doesn't mean like I said that the people are bad, cheap or have poor judgement at all. I don't care for evil things or skulls and I do consider those kind of tattoos bad judgement but not all people are wrong. He shouldn't judge anyone especially if he is a true supposed to be Christian. I am a full pledged counselor and have a wonderful family and wonderful friends. They didn't think I was cheap or whatever just because I had gotten tattoos and as I said, I didn't get my first one until I was nearly 40 years old. I want to get another one of my Parents. It is a picture of them when they got engaged right before they married. I don't know if I will ever do it or not though. I don't want to put it on my shoulder or back or anywhere like that. I like to see my tattoos and not have to look in a mirror. Just tell your Dad that not all people are idiots and he shouldn't judge people that he doesn't even know. One of my best friends was pregnant with twins and the babies died at nearly 6 months old. They both wasn't developed enough and died from heart complications. She and her husband both got tattoos of their babies and where we go to have our tattoos, this lady can draw something just like it was a picture taken and put on your skin. She is amazing. Tell your Dad that some people get them so they can have someone or something from their past with them forever. Tell him maybe it doesn't make sense to him but there are good reasons in some cases. Tell him this story that I just told you and see if he thinks they are stupid for getting tattoos of their twins that passed away because they can't ever have kids again. Maybe he will think about it again before he goes off and mouths bad things about us people that does have tattoos. As far as I am concerned, he is the one that is showing poor judgement. Sorry my answer was so long. I was trying to think of anything I could to try to help you in what you could say to your Dad. He needs to quit worrying so much about what other people do and look in the mirror because he isn't perfect either. Sometimes I wish I hadn't gotten a tattoo because they are there for life unless you have the money for laser surgery but that leaves scars and I rather have my tattoos than scars but I won't ever remove mine for anyone or anything. And everyone that has seen my tattoos has said they are absolutely georgeous. Even old people have made compliments on mine. Your Dad needs to get a little more open and quit being so closed and downing people he knows nothing about. Good luck.|`|uDZZLH0Uaa	hes set in his old school ways dear. there is nothing that you can do to change his way of thinking. <br>  when your 18 (best to be older) and your ready to settle down and get married never mind what your dad thinks about your hubby to be it only matters how you two feel about each other. <br>  but <br>  don't get together with someone with a tattoo out of spite as this would hurt your dad and you too.<br>  cheers<br>  mystic|`|bpzvw4qwaa	i wanna get many and my dad thinks their the ugliest thing <br>  on earth<br>  <br>  .....try giving him examples of succesful people who have tatoos<br>  ex.kat von d<br>  <br>  or any other person <br>  <br>  this will make him see that theri not losers and to not <br>  judge a book from its cover :DDD|`|AA11440402	Judge not less ye shall be judged? doesnt christianity preach acceptance and forgiveness for mistakes.<br>  <br>  I guess everything is always different in practice..|`|9MoytEURaa	Tell him GEORGE BUSH had a tattoo .<br>  and also tell him that in some cultures its normal .<br>  <br>  <br>  "ONLY GOD SHALL JUDGE ME"|`|AA11377195	Your father is right|`|DUjr9tNUaa	Wow...|`|hTa8aIwWaa	My brother is a tattoo artist and i hang out in his shop a lot and just about every person that has walked in was really nice.

Im 15 and my mom doesnt want me getting a tattoo till im 22 (dumbest rule in the world) so im driving out to my brothers shop on my 18th birthday and getting the first part of my sleeve done.  But maybe if your dad would actually talk to some of these people and get to know them maybe he can change is views. my 72 yr. old grandma got a tattoo last summer by my brother haha and shes the nicest person you'll ever meet.

25eef247372ea872ddad186582a839f3aa	Someone needs to be the one to make the final decision; but it should be pretty equal.  The man should definitely listen and takes his woman's opinions seriously, but he should make the final call on it.  If it's love, he will not deny her of things that are going to fulfill her needs and desires.  A man may not be near as sensitive to things and does tend to be a little more hard headed, but that's not such a bad thing.  A woman feels and senses things more (woman's intuition) and is more easily persuaded.  I would NOT want a leader who was constantly changing their mind...but neither would I want one who is not going to take the opinions of others, weigh the facts carefully, and stick to his decision.  Not to say you can NOT ever change your mind.  Situations change too...and we are ALL wrong on occasion.

I happen to be of the school that thinks that a woman should follow her man as LONG AS he is doing the right thing by their relationship/household, and as long as he is being a GOOD man. So, it's perfectly okay for him to take the lead most times. However, there may be times where I have more information or experience than him in a certain area, and I NEED to take the lead...I will do so at this point. However, I would prefer for us to be on equal footing, so it's not really a control issue, it just becomes the way our relationship flows.

Dos millones de pesos, y ella cambia y te trata de maravilla, o tienes un hijo, y esto aminora las fricciones y mejoran tu relación, o enferma y tu como hija política la cuidas muchos mejor que las sobrinas y es cuando se da cuenta quien eres y te los corresponde positivamente como ves al faltarme mucha información sobre como es la comunicación entre tu suegra y tu, me obligo a realizar un ensayo que te de a saber un diferente punto de vista, y tengo que utilizar mi intuición que me dice que la respuesta es que presiones a tu esposo para que se de cuenta que el como tu hombre de la casa! Te da tu lugar! Y que tiene que hablar con su madre para que se conciente, pero ponte alerte porquew aquí muchas mujeres se dan cuenta verdaderamente que tanto control tienen las mamas sobre sus hijos, es entonces que hay dos situaciones, lo inteligente o prudente que sea tu suegra para llevar la fiesta en paz y de que tu esposo por comodidad te deje a ti el problema! Porque puede ser que entonces te debes preguntas que quiere tu esposo como una esposa ideal una persona sumisa para que el comodito no se vea en la necesidad de tenerse que fajar los pantalones?

I'm really thinking hard about this one.  I would say that yes, it will pass somewhat, but I think it sits there in the mental hard drive just waiting for some poor unsuspecting female to say or so something that triggers that memory about that evil ex.  And I also think that the older I get, with more crap in the hidden files, it takes less to access that data bank.  But I do tell myself that the truth is always somewhere in the middle.  So besides the instant-access-bad-data bank, I am also less critical or judgmental of other people, because  I know it is so difficult to have a relationship, and we all want to be happy, and so much other crap and interference can get in the way, and people really do change over time, everybody, and how do you work around that too?   I think it may help to know that everybody is carrying around with them that same-but-different data bank because no body is lucky enough to have always had perfect relationships.  My friends and I discussed a time line once and we all agreed that although you seem to be  over someone and getting on with things, that it seems to take 2 years to really get back to normal, back to your pre-last-ex happy attitude again.

The ones who aren't trying to push you into bed right away.  Sometimes it makes it easier to see better if one takes  a time out from dating.  You step back and let your head clear a little, especially if you have been dating one guy after another.  Trying to fit a guy into your life is a mistake.

You know deep down inside why  you have these feelings.  Trust your instincts.  Most people that break up with someone and use the excuse they are depressed or have anxiety issues are using that as an excuse for their decision.  Do not be afraid to have these feelings.  They are warning signs of impending doom.  This feeling is what has kept people alive for hundreds of years.  If you sense danger, run.   If someone makes you uncomfortable, run.  Don't feel sorry for them or afraid to hurt their feelings.  Trust your gut and it will keep you alive for many years to come.  It will never let you down.  you are young and have not yet used this special skill so it is new to you.  Be thankful you have it.  Some people don't seem to possess this radar that could keep them alive.  Use this to YOUR advantage.  Let the guy go.  It is better not to have someone in your life for a short while than to risk thinking you have to hold on to him or "I won't have anyone!"  You will be happier and healthier by yourself.  Learn to like yourself.

It's hard for people to stay interested in sex after being together for a length of time.

GQJbOblQaa	You need all the attention and sympathy.  This is the scenario in most of our Indian families.  Why do women like MIL or SIL take pleasure in troubling the daughter in law?  <br>  <br>  Being an employed woman, it is advantageous to live in a joint family inspite of these problems.  But, this does not mean you must allow your peace of mind to be disturbed.  <br>  <br>  Talk to your husband, reassure him that you are equally interested to live in the joint family but you only need his help on how to check MIL/SIL.  You can think of following:<br>  <br>  1.  Meet both MIL & SIL together and make it clear that in spite of all their taunts and complaints, you have decided to live in the same house.  <br>  <br>  2.  Tell them that you have lodged a complaint with Police for mental torture by motherinlaw AND you will activate this complaint if they do not stop harassing you.<br>  <br>  3.  Keep praising your MIL/SIL in front of your husband always.  <br>  <br>  4.  Never cry in front of your MIL/SIL.  Never complain to your husband in fromt of MIL/SIL.  <br>  <br>  5.  Request your husband to cooperate and show love/care for you, in fromt of MIL/SIL.  Let your husband tell MIL/SIL how much you praise them.  <br>  <br>  6.  Don't do any work that is forced upon you.  Become fearless.  This is your life, your son and your husband and you have a right to stay happy.  <br>  <br>  7.  Happiness is a mental attitude.  Don't run away from problems.  Whenever your MIL/SIL complaints, take out a book and start noting down.  Ask your MIL/SIL to narate their problems for you to note down.  <br>  <br>  8.  Whenever your MIL/SIL asks you to do any work, don't do it properly.  Tell them you can never be perfect like them.  That way, they will be forced to do the household chores leaving you with leisure.<br>  <br>  9.  Buy gifts for your MIL/SIL frequently.<br>  <br>  People like your MIL/SIL have to be treated in their own way and you must never show your true emotions.  A little bit of cunningness is required to tackle them.<br>  <br>  I am sure you have the capabilities to handle them.  Take it as a challenge.  This is called relationship management.  When you can handle so many people in office, handling two adamant relatives should pose no problem for you.  <br>  <br>  You can do it.  Please try.  Please enjoy life - the most precious gift of God to full time.  Wish you all the very best.|`|9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	Well, first of all.  This whole talk about you ending your life needs to stop.  Your life isn't as bad as it seems and there are people with much bigger problems than you so stop talking that way.  You knew before you married this guy that he was devoted to taking care of MIL and SIL, but you still went and married him so now you have to deal with that.  You really need to move out with him on your own, your marriage will never be happy until you do because MIL and SIL will always be interfering and butting into your life, marriage and mothering.  It's not good for your kid to grow up under all this tension.  It's not your kids fault they don't like you and you have to think about what is best for your child.  Tell your husband that he either needs to move out with you to save the marriage or you will have to end the relationship.  You are clearly unhappy and he need to know how serious you feel about this.  If he loves you he will do what he can to make your family work.  I think that if he does not comply you should move out on your own and take your son with you.  Don't leave your son behind, that's not being a good mother and he doesn't deserve that.  My fiancees mother left him when he was young and it was traumatic.  Also, i find your excuses to be very weak.  You say you cannot leave the home.  YES you can.  You have a job- I am a single mother myself many women like this that do it on their own.  Part of the reason that they treat you bad is because they know you are depending on them,  that is wrong.  They are using that against you.  You need to be strong and do what makes your life better, this is not good for your emotional and mental health.  Get out.  It is possible and if you don't leave then don't complain about it because it is your choice.|`|XQWInrsBaa	Just chill. Just don't response to what they say. I mean if they say something to disturb don't think them as ur biggest enemies, think them as funny people who don't know how to live in this world. Do one thing when they say something disturbingly smile inside and close ur eyes and start seeing them in funny way like see them like jokers and they both are a part of a circus.  Don't response to what they say. As far as ur husband is concerned only u can make ur husband feel like happy at home. Just try to make him understand that u r happy and the stupid type of things don't bother u and so why ur husband is bothered.  Try these things. Best of luck.|`|bjqe7PVPaa	YOu need to talk to that husband of yours because it is not you him the mother nd the sister.it Should be JUST him and you oh and the kid....nah.you should not take that at all...and HE shouldn't let that happen to you...Man up.I have major issues with the inlaws too and with my husbands sister..but they would never ever do all that.that is too much..you dont take that.speak up|`|wz8gx3gaaa	Hey curious.  You have to loin your girdle against this MIL/SIL gang.  If they give you one taunt, you should give them a two taunts.  You have got a tongue which you have to sharpen and a mind which you should use with clear thoughts.  You said your husband is a nice guy.  I am sure if you retiliate your MIL/SIL, he will not go against you so adversely.  <br>  <br>  You say you are very successful in your workplace.  As far as I think, there is not much different in office politics and domestic politics.  Use your experience to overcome and win over in your home.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	tell him that his family comes first and his mother and sister have to take a back seat because your marriage is in trouble get some marriage counseling and they need to move out of your house if that is where they are living
U4ek1lCLaa	Just even asking makes you more of a man because it shows you care and want to be a better man but honestly a man puts others before him and looks out for the well-being of those he loves and cares for even if it means he doesn't come out on top.|`|sopAuW7Zaa	Hey...there's nothing wrong with being a boy trapped in a man's body...just so long as you don't let those child-like tendencies overpower your intellect.<br>  <br>  I've always believed that a true man is the one guy who will stand up for those who cannot defend themselves.

cOce5YbRaa	First off sweetie, your Mom was wrong by slapping you unless you got really smart mouthed with her but then I have to say I don't agree with slapping one of my kids. Maybe your Mom was just having a really bad day and she took it out on you. We all make mistakes sweetie. That's what makes us all human. I'm sure you have probably done things that was wrong and said things that was wrong but your Mom didn't stop loving you and never would. Parents aren't perfect either. Your Mom has forgiven you before many times probably so forgive her. We all do stupid things and say stupid things when we are mad or maybe just having a bad day. Give her another chance like she has given you before. All of us deserve to get another chance and sometimes deserve to get more than just one more chance. Just remember that your Mom loves you and doesn't want anything to happen to you or your friends. I know it is a pain in the you know where at times but as I said, forgive her. She knows she did wrong and hopefully she will never do that again. I wish you the very best and just remember sweetie, none of us are perfect. We all make wrong and sometimes even bad mistakes. We are just human.|`|EgUxu5kjaa	forgive her!<br>  she's just concerned about your safety!|`|snZ7z3DLaa	Good Lord, if I acted that way I wouldn't even be able to stabilize myself and gain enough balance to even consider whether or not to "forgive" her. She is your mom, she is part of your family, she is a person you will live with for a while, and she is a person that you can't go around hating because she slapped you. And the fact that she said she was sorry to you...

You would be the one who was sorry if someone beat you to a pulp out there in the dark?! she is just a loving kind mother concerned about her child as any mother should be. I think you maybe over obsessing with this a bit too much! Please forgive her she is your mum for god sake. You were nagging her a bit when she must have been stressed or something!<br>  <br>  Regarding flowery 1's answer i don't agree. You don't need to call child line that is so over obsessing. Your mum probably didn't mean to hit you hard. She was probably under pressure  and having a bad day have an open mind. Your mum would be extremely upset if you called child line. She did ask and plead for your forgiveness after all, didn't she?|`|piHRjwvdaa	forgive her shes your mum she was just trying to protect you! and your friends are under her supervision. <br>  <br>  if you want to forget her: do the silent treatment a quick and easy way! just don't talk to her! he he!|`|gpCjrJFcaa	What do u mean forgive her... look dont mind but it is really bad of u to think that ur mother has done something wrong bcauz parents have the right to scold or slap their children AND YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED OF URSELF WHEN UR MOTHER WA PLEADING WITH U TO FORGIVE HER|`|ajSQYvINaa	she's  your mom and she's just looking out for your safety . plus she has the right to tell you what to do and what not to do since she brought you into this world. think about it. so forgive her|`|VnK2sqcjaa	If she said sorry you should do what you feel.  She is your mom and she does love you, sometimes people have bad days.  Sorry :(|`|AA12108445	Good Heavens, if I had acted that way I would have gotten another slap<br>  and harder! But that was years ago when Mothers could slap older children.|`|c2b0c54ac5bc43be413eb1675d56c4ffaa	forgive her!  Shes your mom.  She obviously feels bad.
Bv0v2nV0aa	58you and 41her<br>  <br>  You guys don't look weird together. I think you look nice together.|`|OhiNV9a4aa	I am 4 years younger than my horrible excuse for a husband, and our union has been all sorts of wrong. (due to him)|`|y21VcTjDaa	I think you make a nice couple and actually look around the same age.<br>  <br>  Why would you care what other people think?  If you love each other nothing else should matter!<br>  <br>  Note to chopzs..   Did you read the actual question or just decide to spout off?  It asks "Is there anything wrong "|`|c07v7O80aa	Nope. Same 50+ dumpling body on her as she had when you posted this photo asking the same question - when was it? - last year or the year before? Does she know you feel compelled to keep begging for people to tell you you did good? She ought to be seriously wondering why you see her as unattractive and have to keep asking people to say it ain't so. She really ought to have someone who thinks she's the best there ever could be. (Or maybe you need someone who doesn't need you to solicit compliments for her.)|`|szVvf7Nkaa	Yes, your wife looks younger then you. The only reason I answered your question was to let you know that you guys make such a lovely couple. You both look so happy. And if your wife is younger then you then there is nothing wrong with marrying a younger woman.|`|za2IxgALaa	To A Canadian: He's not asking that it's wrong or not, he simply wants an idea about what WE think--if they want our opinions, JUST GIVE IT TO HIM, WOMAN.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  She does look younger! SHE"S BEAUTIFUL!! :)!!! Haha, what a fine couple you look!|`|AA10232243	You, late 50's, your wife, mid 40's.<br>  <br>  My best guess is 57 for you and 43 for your wife. This is a normal age distribution.|`|zAfKvhW4aa	she looks nice, but she also looks as old as you.
1qTNn8qnaa	I wouldnt like it...but he's a guy and some guys do have that type of stuff...not ALL men do...but yea if ur highly uncomfortable talk to him abt it..|`|QVQBDqHNaa	grow up|`|U6FFI7jcaa	theres nothing wrong with him having max.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	He's a man, married man have them..it's nothing wrong with that and no you shouldn't be worried at all.
1qTNn8qnaa	Tell him straight out how u feel...ask him why his friends are not aware of you....<br>  But i dont think its a big deal...my bf didnt tell his friends at all about me...they found out from his facebook page cos he changed his status....<br>  If it makes u highly uncomfortable...then have a chat to him...explain that u dont feel like u r in a r/ship and that maybe u would like a random hug or to hold his hands while u walk along a road...(thats a fair request...i would be totally pissed if my bf didnt hold my hand when we walked)|`|q0Ju2pO2aa	um if his friends don't know about you then that's pretty bad you should leave him??<br>  because either hes hiding something from you or hes embarrassed of you|`|xHem3Hq8aa	if u like him or love him u start holding his hand.do masti with him.<br>  see his response then.if he response well then its good.if not response<br>  well dont waste your time with him.because he is living with u like a <br>  brother not as a boy friend yarr..<br>                                          rajeev 9837125150.|`|a462e85e6714bf6d5302f1d9a4596e8daa	Just ask him WHY he's hiding U & c what he says! Good luck 2 U!
GGAgxzJNaa	Not the ones who who think of marriage as being "tied down".|`|0792099af4d32f715881d4a39d91aee9aa	Well I know a few men who do and it's not really called tied down... that's just another word for losers who's never found the right one or have been hurt a lot to call it that. Some men are lucky to have the right girl in their lives and some aren't so lucky, that's life but if your friend doesn't want to be tied down then he should leave her if it's worth it. No one is holding him back not even her even though it may seem like it but why would he allow himself to continue in such misery? Plus what he probably needs is some growing up to do and stop looking at his single friends as a reason to say he's "tied down." Which many men do. lol what matters is what you want and not pay attention to what your friends want.|`|PqG7ZPX1aa	hmm..well it all depends on the girl really, if shes tour perfect 10 then yes, and if she doesnt meet those needs than hell no we dont wanna be with her for our entire life lol..|`|VWILDaYPaa	SUPRISINGLY YES.my freind actually wants to get tied down to this 1 girl n shes the 1 hu doesnt want to be on lockdown|`|ml2FDYECaa	I've been married for almost ten years. 12 years ago I was like "no way" buy it has been great. The respect, and life that I've experienced has been the greatest thing. Love comes when you don't expect it, and what comes out of it is "LIFE" and all that it has to offer. Yeah, it's tough, but when you get what you give in return...I can go on, and on, but to each is own.|`|xp4mhkqgaa	Some do, and some don't.  Every man is different.  <br>  <br>  And, you can stay with one person for life, but just not get married.  <br>  <br>  I have no interest in getting married, as I don't see any need for it.  But that doesn't mean that I'm not commited.  I'm with someone because I want to be, and don't need a piece of paper to prove it to anyone.|`|zOU5fNHWaa	Iv always wanted that. But 28 years later and im so F'd up and twisted...I dont care anymore.. Last three woman iv dated just so happened to be adult virgins. I havent have relations in over 6 years. <br>  Im hoping to demanifest my existance on earth. Just waiting to see what we find with the LHC.|`|peybb4Foaa	Sometimes...It depends on the man.<br>  Some want to have many girls and f**k everything what moves and some want to live a peaceful life with one woman|`|PTKiTblZaa	no,. im a girl and idk if i want that. i mean i do, if i can find the right guy.|`|M1J4xDJgaa	most guys say they don't want to, but it happens. Me personally, i want to stay free lol.|`|sTZQWiGlaa	Aren't you a guy? Uhhhh....|`|sHvPBMKwaa	No way! haha.<br>  You have to each have your own time apart though, x|`|AA10250918	Have you noticed that more women have answered this question than men? HA! Maybe that's why there's a stereotype about women being controlling...hmm, food for thought?|`|eDps9SjUaa	If she is the right one. I MEAN RIGHT ONE! Then yeah I have been with the same woman, no cheating for 9 yrs and it is good!!! Work could be better though lol!|`|WItKOQh7aa	Absolutely!<br>  <br>  All those men that "won't" get married are just playing hard to get.|`|GW1PzzdSaa	Yeah, of course. Not all guys are the same when it comes to marriage and lifetime commitment....My parents, for one is married for almost 38 years now....And they are still happy....|`|kUA21UKFaa	??? You do not get tied up when you get married...you free yourself from wondering what if? Who? When? <br>  The trick is to marry your best friend....|`|uLlwcUbsaa	No waite until your 75.|`|pkNYlFubaa	umm they better! haha|`|y21VcTjDaa	If they don't, then perhaps they should stop proposing! lol
nNfAeHgfaa	If they are standard cuffs and the double lock isn't in place you can use a paperclip to unlock them. There is a only a retention spring that keeps the lock in place soo bend the paperclip and turn it the best you can your will feel it give. <br>  The best one to use I have seen is the bigger black paperclips.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	Bolt cutters!<br>  This happened to me when my husband and i went away for a weekend. He cuffed me and could not find the keys. The hotel manager looked shocked when my husband asked him for bolt cutters *LOL*|`|U3qTwOOIaa	call the emergency services and give them a good laugh - they will free her|`|yyJo3ybBaa	Why would you want to? You could always oil up her wrists and let her slip through, if she deserved to be uncuffed that is|`|rQFNivhNaa	Hahahahahahaha. You'd better get going with the file it's going to take some time..........|`|aSs0tfjUaa	Dream on!|`|kmNm27JAaa	Chew off her wrists!!!|`|rj004nrlaa	Well you can either get the saw out, bolt cutters etc or call 999 for fire service and get them to cut her out whie you have a giggle!!|`|uuh9VEhcaa	Chainsaw, knife, teeth, fire brigade|`|tlxG2q04aa	Pics or it didn't happen.|`|448d8047868dad85a78f45806967142eaa	plyers?
AA11901352	He told you he loved you when he was drinking?  Perhaps he just isn't that good at expressing himself without a shot of courage.  I know a few people like that.  they are afraid to fully express themselves or are just not sure how.  Alchahol has a way of loosening lips.  I don't think things have changed (his feelings) however when you saw him he wasn't drinking.  You ignored him as well and perhaps he was embarrassed that you perhaps rejected him?  the two of you need to talk.|`|6lfm228eaa	:) hes just a bit shy :) x|`|YE0baNYRaa	maybe you were wanting him to approach you and he was wanting you to approach him. dont be silly. leave egoes behind and talk to him about it.|`|0qspJSt9aa	well you can ask this advice at jamrie<br>  its more of a personal advice website.<br>  people over there might be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Drink!!!!  And a lot of shyness
wlSD6Ccgaa	aww that's sweet, just relax and enjoy your night!<br>  a few tips would be wear lip balm so your lips are soft but not going to leave him covered in gloss and make sure you have nice fresh breath, also drink water instead of fizzy so you don't accidentally burp at him! lol|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	Sweetheart   Just be yourself.  That's why you have the bf in the first place.  He likes you for you.  And if you think the kiss is coming, just relax, and enjoy.    This is a wonderful time in your life.  One you will always remember.  Let it be natural, and true.<br>  <br>  Have a WONDERFUL time, and just be who you are.<br>  <br>  PS  great movie choice|`|vb6nB7ANaa	Just be yourself and have a good time don't be shy there is no need to be and if you don't kiss don't be disappointed there is always another time.|`|be4housuaa	take it slow, relax and enjoy yourself!
xoDfbfBNaa	I can't tell you what to do...but I will tell you what NOT to do: Don't overthink it! Just go with the flow right now, enjoy your time with her, and don't try to analyze it too much.|`|WchGezIAaa	*envy*<br>  I hate you<br>  =.=<br>  <br>  lol~|`|8OREBeRdaa	I'm glad you had a good time.  What do you want to do? Do you want to hang out with her Monday night? If so, then just ask her!  It's as simple as that.  You say that she doesn't play games, so don't play games back.  Don't play hard to get but don't bet in her face so much that she can't breathe.  Don't wait for another weekend.  <br>  <br>  If you hang out with her again on Monday then that may help you set a pace that's good for both of you.|`|weAllUAQaa	well why don't u ask her out on a date or something give her choclates and flowers and then i guess if she like you it will be happy endings<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: take her on alot of dates to really nice resteraunts and stuff like that|`|3zxVzPBxaa	was  it really vital to write that much?<br>  <br>  do what you want.. do what feels right. you are making too much of it, and honestly you sound waaaaaaaaaay anxious. just chill out, one day at a time.|`|JjoLo4e1aa	MARRY HER|`|za2IxgALaa	go steady!! alllllllllrighhhhhhttttt ;) .... ;) .... <br>  <br>  be friends, or .. chase her already will ya?! lol XD
v7ffW5Xvaa	Listen girlfriend... You need to put your guy on check.  From the very first time he mentioned this chick you should have let him know that it made you uncomfortable and that its totally unacceptable to even ask about her.  Since you have not, he thinks your probably ok with it.  Ask him what the hell is he doing!|`|eR3cNjJfaa	I would get rid of this guy even if you have a kid together.|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	confront him, if u love him listen to what he has to say, before u boot him out. It appears his defences r very weak.|`|DTN6Vg8caa	dont answer other ppls questions. u love him rite then stay with him
4WVbjbWxaa	hmm... is it lack of communication...?<br>  <br>  tell him instead of asking the question here...
PRjvY6Vgaa	Omg, this has been happening to me since I was just sixteen. back then I was really skinny and I've always been tall, had a figure and etc. It was so completely creepy, and I would always get so angry like WTF, I'm only sixteen. They would stare at my legs when I wore shorts, drive down the street when I was walking and slow down to look at me and all that. Now, they still kind of do it and I'm 24, so I know how to ignore it better and just put it into it's place. But one day when I was working I had an old man like in his sixty's ask me "where did you get those breasts?" Ugh! disgusting!|`|4WC2TXlsaa	I usually take it as a compliment no matter there age that they are hitting on me and just go on about my way. Yeah some guys are a little grosser than others but just because they hit on you doesn't me that you are going to fall at there feet. Enjoy the attention and then walk away|`|8OrOBQXJaa	That's not a question. That's more of a statement.|`|HMzUeqTmaa	Yea i am a guy and thats pretty sick|`|0QeCiROYaa	I'm a guy and i just want to add, that when your old you get tired of the same woman that you married so you just want to spice some things up a bit, now yes when there in the teens and twenty's that's just being a pervert but when the woman's in their 30's and up i think that's OK. i think so at least.|`|iOa7rriGaa	Yes I know exactly what you mean I just turned 18 on Feb.23 and literally two days later I was getting emails and being asked out by guys from early 30's to late 50's it's pissing me off. What makes them think I would want to go out with someone whose older than my dad someone who could be my grandfather. Perverts I tell ya I'm truly disgusted by it all.|`|bMLdEkncaa	i dunno if it's gross or offensive.....it's flattering actually but that's really it....the 50+ guys are only trying to compensate for what they no longer have, such as youthful skin, a full set of hair, and for lacking in the "up" department in their lower region....just ignore them and theyll move on|`|QBWiPLVnaa	So, what you're saying is ..<br>  a 50 year old man, is trying to<br>  get with you ? Oh my gosh, that's gross.|`|elw3QEZOaa	Oh yeah, it's gross. I'm 15 and my mom's friend is always trying to flirt with me and get close to me. 50 year old guys cannot flirt.|`|AA12354369	I think its uncalled for.  Thats practically pedophilia.....30 years difference?  bull crap.|`|qpb8l4Mkaa	Yes i suppose that is...<br>  <br>  obviously, isnt this a bit of a retorical question?|`|Q3vY0r8yaa	oh gosh yes it is so nasty..they act as if we will get with them cuz they have money..and thats not true..well for me it isnt..soem girls do like that..i wish they wouldnt do that..|`|o4fykobbaa	Is this really bothering you?!?!? I would just laugh, and find it really funny, but i think that you should use it more as a ego booster rather than a way of making yourself feel any lower than what you should, bc that is exactly what they are trying to use it for.|`|BddRfJ2caa	it is gross, btw if if they do use money to get someone, that someone is that dudes property of a while, image what he could do. (gag)|`|Q7WUMQ0Raa	Not at all|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Yes, i hate it..it happens to me all the time.I guess they call themselves trying to be suga daddies, which is gross because they're so old, i mean old enough to be my grandad.|`|AA11263103	Yes, i am only15/16 and this one old old sub hits on me. Its gross! I am only freshmen in high school! Next time he does. I can report a sexual report. Finally.
fP46meSmaa	I would be flattered and say either,"thank you" or "I like you too" depending on the girl.**
hgaNxhoaaa	It's possible that your boyfriend feels terrible about what he did to this girl and feels the need to make up for it in some way. Other than that, I can think of no valid reason he should leave her a house that the two of you have worked on together, especially when it's been such a long time.<br>  <br>  It just doesn't add up. I would ask him about it in a gentle way. Ask him why he feels the need to leave her his house, of all things. Did he really hurt her that bad? If they're still friends, it doesn't seem like that much damage was done. It's possible he still has feelings for her as well.<br>  <br>  It's best not to jump to conclusions before you've spoken with him about it, though. It'll drive you crazy to worry about it until you do.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|AHEFXgE7aa	He is still in love with her, and is not really gay.|`|eth48m7Iaa	that is weird. did u ask him? maybe he is not serious about your relationship. I mean are they best friends? I would still choose my significant other over my best friend.|`|G4qnqBvoaa	you werent very clear. so, hes leaving his ex gf his house in his will, yet youve known him for 4yrs and dated him? but he left her bc hes gay? <br>  maybe he just trusts her most and feels she deserves it. maybe you should tell him it bothers u and see where it goes.<br>  <br>  its hard to be helpful, when ur post was all over the place|`|Ai1uZU3Jaa	omg. that sucks, i feel for you. yes it should bother u! big time! it should raise heaps of questions....i mean if it was a 1 yr relationship then maybe u could understand it a bit more....but 4 yrs...ud think that would be long enough for him to feel more serious about u.<br>  <br>  but how do u know this is true?? maybe he is testing u to see if ur with him for his money....or maybe making sure u wont kill him to take it all haha. sorry bad joke. but seriously, have u seen this for yourself?<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: can u please answer mine? bf problems too :( <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtwhcaxtOufHavgKeH8UIr3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227040725AAfJ0l7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

More and more people are doing it everyday.<br>  <br>  If you think about it, the odds of finding someone compatible with you dramatically increases because thousands of people can view your profile and vis versa.  If you rely on meeting people in real life or in bars/clubs, you're only exposed to a small fraction of that.

Cualquier persona puede perder dinero pero nadie se puede dar el lujo de perder a su hermano, pero que te sirva de experiencia no le vuelva a prestar y si te pide nuevamente di le no puedo prestarte dinero porque no pagas y ahí tu decides si se lo regalas o no.

Pero la genética pesa mucho y la convivencia, sobre todo en la infancia, también. Piensa que cuando te falte, os separéis o dejéis de veros y comunicaros echarás en falta esa sensación de asco que ahora te produce. Mientras no exista indiferencia cualquier relación puede mejorarse. Además el asco no es tan asqueroso, no siempre tenemos que experimentar sensaciones positivas con los demás sino la vida sería muy aburrida y vacía.

71VRvldJaa	I agree with your boyfriend.  It's important in every relationship that both partners have their own space, their own friends and their own interests.  .....even in a marriage it's important!<br>  In new relationships it's natural that you'd want to spend all you time with him, but that's what kids do and they overdo it and next thing you know they've broken up.  Don't try to smother him.  You'll scare him off.<br>  A healthy relationship respects boundaries.|`|hoBREUGLaa	If it was healthier to see eachother less why do people move in with eachother? I love seeing my girlfriend everyday that I can, but her parents have a habit of not letting her see me unless it's every other day. I don't like her parents for it but when we do get to hang out it seems alot better because of how much we missed eachother on the time that we spent away, which I don't think her parents realize or they would let us hang out everyday :].|`|RCfc9hMKaa	Well, if he's telling you that he doesn't want to see you every night, that's a good hint to back off a little. It's normal to want to see someone you're falling in love with all the time... Personally, I think relationships should be natural and if you feel like spending every day with each other, then go for it. If one of you needs space, give some space. It's not a chess game with moves you have to make to keep the other person around...|`|YE0baNYRaa	if you see him every night it will become monotonuos and you will start taking each other for franted. why dont you meet him once a week. this way you will give him time to miss you and he will value you more.that spark in the relationship will be alive. best of luck|`|U0WMFNC3aa	No its perfectly okay you want to be with him so much. A few times a week is "okay", but if he feels that way i think you should give him some space. i can understand from his view every night.... that's a lot try to tone it down. =)|`|Sn42Qw8qaa	Ya, a guy wants his space, give him space.|`|Yna4nQyPaa	I've been through the same thing. I was with this guy that I saw everyday for a month . . . he broke up with me! Take your time with this guy. Don't see each other everyday or he'll get tired of you, or may even find you annoying. I wanted to be with my ex all the time too, but don't rush things. See each other like maybe 3 or 4 times a week. Believe me, you'll be better off if you do. I learned the hard way. Good luck! ?|`|Q1RoK76laa	It isn't abnormal . I did the same thing , even after 6 months of Dating my g-f . <br>  People do say the less you go without seeing each other is better , it makes you miss each other more.. Some quote " makes the heart grow fonder " So take it how you can , Maybe just lay off for a few , ever other day isn't that bad is it ?|`|cdRkqG5Caa	from personal experience..give tha boy his space!! no, its not unhealthy for you to want to spend so much time with him..but, spending everyday together is unhealthy. you will get tired of each other, and begin to get tired of the relationship.  the same thing happened w. me and my ex... accept, we saw eachother everyday for 6 months, he got tired of the relationship, and we ended up breaking up. if he's already asking for space.. you need to give it to him asap. go out and have fun w. your girls, and let him have fun with his guys. and when he's with his guys, dont call or text him all night..|`|NbH03tHSaa	No that's normal- but it's best to give each other space to prevent smoothering each other. after a while it will become a problem|`|vxBbiltIaa	No, it just means, dat u hv strong feelns 4 him, & u h8 2 not b around him. It's, not unheathly... But, it could get on his nerves. Sum guys dn't, lyk clingy gurls.
jEC8Ctp5aa	You won't regret it as long as you keep to the path you are on.<br>  <br>  Every day, if both of you think of the other FIRST, and if you both wake up thinking, "What can I do today to make his/her day a little easier, to make him/her feel loved, needed, and wanted, and what can I do so that he/she goes to sleep GLAD that they married me" ... if BOTH of you start and end each day like that, you'll do just fine.<br>  <br>  Usually, younger marriages end because one or both of them weren't prepared for the sacrifices needed in order for it to work. It sounds like you two have a better chance than most, and those chances will only get better if you stick to what I suggested above.<br>  <br>  Between you and me (and this is something you might not know yet), women have ALL the power in a relationship. Men behave badly because we LET THEM. They get away with whatever WE LET THEM get away with. As long as you raise the bar, he will respect you all the more. It will help if you can keep the home fires burning and your oven always on "warm", if you know what I mean. Send him a text message every day or two telling him what you're going to do to/for/with him that night, and follow thru. Tell him how happy you are to be his wife. Tell him how much you appreciate all that he does for you and your little girl. Walk up to him and give him a big slurpy kiss that lasts longer than 5 or 10 seconds (kiss him so he FEELS it), at least once a day. Hijack his shower and wash his hair for him (but do this when neither of you is in a hurry to go anywhere after the shower :D). Men need to feel like they're the dragon slayer every day, taming the wild beast, even if all he does is crunch numbers or wash windows or whatever. He needs for you to make him feel like he's your hero, like you admire him, respect him, and can't keep your hands off him.<br>  <br>  If you can do all that (which should be easy, mostly ... if you're in love), and sustain it over time, you'll do just fine. All that stuff is designed to keep him happy, and happy husbands would walk over broken glass and thru rings of fire just to bring you a lemonade. That's the kind of devotion you'll get from him, if you treat him like I described.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, hon.<br>  <br>  P.S. Just keep reminding him of all that mushy stuff from time to time.  They never get tired of hearing it, as long as you don't lay it on too thick. *big hug*|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Chances are good that will happen and your marrying at a young age shoots your marriage ending soon sky high. 24-25 is the best age with the highest success rate. But there are always exceptions to everything so you may be an exception rather than a majority to a rule. Good luck|`|R62BrdISaa	Look at it this way, if you are as mature as you say, then you were ahead of your time, mentaly, when you made the decision to marry.<br>  So, as I see it, you weren't 18, you were 21, therfore putting you at an age that is not considered too young to marry ! Look at it that way, and dont look back, Stay Happy, and find something else to think about while in the shower, maybe try singing. Good luck !|`|NB4h4jTyaa	My best friend married her husband at 19 (he was 21). They've been married for 20 years now and are more in love than ever (even if they drive each other crazy sometimes.)<br>  <br>  Don't borrow trouble. Be happy in your marriage and your daughter.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	I met my husband one fine day when I was 19. I married him exactly 1 week later. Everyone said we were crazy, that it would never last, that we would surely be divorced within a couple years. That was 20 years ago. <br>  <br>  Statistics have nothing to do with your marriage. The only thing that determines if your marriage will last is the two of you. As long as you treat one another with love and respect, there's no reason to worry about your marriage not being one that lasts. It is senseless to worry about a future problem that may never happen, and spending too much time thinking in such a negative way could cause problems in and of itself. <br>  <br>  You say you're in love, that you believe in your marriage....so why question it? Live in the present, love and enjoy your family, and stop worrying. It will never do you any good, and it can end up doing harm if you let it eat at you. Senseless, that.|`|vRc7ktcsaa	your marriage depends on many things so it depends on how both of you carry your relationship and the factors that affects both of you personally that may affect your relationship. the problem is you maturing so early and not living the normal teenage life. the risk is that when you grow old, maybe in your 30's or late 20's, you may, and this happen most of the time, become childish because you would want to experience the things that you should have experienced in teenage life. so my advice, do your best in taking care of your relationship and your self. loosen for a while and do the things that you want in control and consideration.|`|fswPWFswaa	don't regret anything. you married him because you love him! you have a baby with him. what is there to regret? think of the good things that have come out of being married to him! divorce rate is so high because people don't keep commitments. be selfless just as christ gave up everything for you ya'll give up everything for each other and you'll make it. i believe most couples go through times where divorce seems good, but that's the easy way out. if you get to a point in your life where you want a divorce pray about it and see a christian marriage counselor. work through it! that's what marriage is. work! it takes work to keep a relationship together through so many ups and downs. good luck!|`|GW1PzzdSaa	You are the only one who can answer that. Do you really love him that much to be willing to spend the rest of your life with him? <br>  If you love him, married at a very young age or not, you will still be firm with the promise you made before God. Good luck! Don't think of it. Just think that you and your husband will still very much in love with each other until you're both gray and winkled...(",)|`|xoDfbfBNaa	No one can predict your future, hon. But I know plenty of people who married young and they're still together, and still happy about it, so don't worry so much! Take it one day at a time, relax, and enjoy being in love. Why worry about it? It doesn't do any good, and it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy if you put too much into it. Just live in the now.|`|EjB6zJdEaa	Marriage is something that you have to work at every day.  Both of you.  I was married at 22 and she was 20 and I consider that young.  Plus, I'm in the military too and being gone a lot can put even more of a strain on any relationship.<br>  <br>  But, my parents were married young (17 and 16) and my dad was also a career military guy and they're still together after 32 years.  Just have to keep it going if that makes since.  Through the deployments and the great times and the bad times, never quit.  Plus, your only 20 you can still be young even with a kid trust me, never stopped us, it just goes back to working at it.|`|qzPLTvdvaa	Hey I am in the Military and for the most part you guys have a bumpy road for a while if he decides to stay in the military but its worth it. I have decided to ETS and so this is my last tour. My wife hates me away and I hate to be away from her but ignore the whole age thing, its irrelevant. Its the love you have for each other and the whole reason you guys got together that have you together now. Will you regret it, its like asking will you have another fight, those ideas will pass in your mind but you will then remember something that you love about the man you married. The only threat I see is you guys getting too comfortable and not showing enough romance. So either he is not getting what he wants or your not getting what you want. Love and support for 50 years is going to pay off in the long run, just remember to say I love you every day that you can and then reflect on your conversations and make sure you mean it. If not then use that to figure out why. Another piece of advice if things do get tough then talk it out, get a Marriage councilor if you need to but dont let conversation die out<br>  <br>  <br>  Either way good luck to you

Love is crazy it can make your heart skip a beat and other times it can make you cry. You get a sensation in your tummy called butterflies. It can make you go insane when you can't stop thinkng about that person. You wish you could be with them all the time but most of all you get the best feelng when you see them,hug, or kiss them is like going to heaven and back lOl<br>  ...lOvE iS cRAZy...<br>  <br>  Me and my boyfriend been together for 1year and 2 months this sunday coming up. and were engaged..

KtdlJbrOaa	She cheated, move on & have no further contact with her.  Sounds like she clearly wants to break up anyway.|`|FyhzmgRUaa	Are you still together? if not then let it go, if she cheated on you; then most likely she will cheat on the next guy. Go look for some more wholesome chicks.|`|UlT5dByaaa	Call her when she's not sick.|`|0imjbygmaa	You deserve better than that. Let her be because she is going to do it again, and I bet you anything she is doing right now to whoever she is with. She's not worth it dude. You are going to find someone better that is faithful and won't break your heart. Good luck.|`|kCbJ89nXaa	Just treat her like a person.  You care or did care for her.  Since she is ill you can call to see how she's doing and let her know you're a good guy.  Leave it at that.|`|B7ILefOtaa	well friends is good but hoping that shell be back or change is impossible. she breaks your trust.|`|JgTQh90kaa	well,<br>  if she didn't answer your call in the first place,<br>  she may not want you to call.<br>  but if you text her maybe,<br>  email or message,<br>  say "hey i heard you were sick, i just wanna let you know i want you to get better and im here for you. you dont have to answer, i just wanted you to know i care for you"<br>  <br>  and shell know you dont mean care as in you miss her,,<br>  <br>  and you dont have to say everything i just said,<br>  if you want use your own words.<br>  <br>  goodluck(:|`|tr5ig7eXaa	You can always call her. just because she cheated doesn't mean you have to sever all connections with her. you can still be friends unless she has clearly expressed that she doesn't want to be friends any more. calling her when she is sick just shows that you want to make sure she is OK.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  =~D|`|n0jJc7hFaa	u have to understand that its over..who wants a girl who doesnt love you and cheats on you. Move on man and dont let her think that you still love her after all that she has done to you. A woman should respect the male, so when she doesnt respect you why waste the effort to do things for her..aka: its over move on show her your doing perfectly fine and its her lose.<br>  <br>  gwd luk X]|`|AD5cue8Waa	i believe if you really love something you dont let it go. whoever said real love means letting go is a big pussy. you cant seriously think a girl who cheats on you loves you. yeah sure you probly TRIED to love her but its pointless unless she returns your love. which she didnt. you can be her friend...but you better keep your distance or she'll have you eating **** out of her hands again. nothing wrong with being nice just dont be stupid. dont worry about her that much you'll be much happier with someone who loves you back. trust me
Td4ythtoaa	No but I would like her to :)
17fc2b122418131f22f55073029bb3b5aa	Just feel it<br>  You do not need to be Columbus or Einstein to discover love.<br>  You will feel it provided you have a MIND.|`|7CF1WKjMaa	dig it up where you see a X|`|V1R48qJaaa	when you sing love songs not only because you like the melody<br>  but because you can also relate to the lyrics.|`|JmIohxGfaa	Quit looking for it and it will happen.|`|Gq1PVHHyaa	ignore everybody
f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	You hit the nail on the head:<br>  <br>  He's insecure or has cheated on you. <br>  <br>  I am an optimist so I'll say he's insecure. <br>  <br>  But it's a known fact too that sometimes when someone is cheating, they start thinking that their partner is, too. It's like a karmic double whammy that takes over their conscious.<br>  <br>  Talk to him about it and let him know if he doesn't stop badgering you, you'll leave.|`|2AAhiwgnaa	Sounds to me like both. He may just be feeling the guilt of having cheated on you. I think you have to confront him!|`|pJcbV2cnaa	To be honest, he might be cheating. I had a boyfriend who use to do the same s**t, always accusing me of cheating and blah blah blah. Turns out he was the one who had been cheating on me and got caught. So i suggest sitting down with him and telling him how you feel, tell him to stop accusing you of something that is not true and that its making you think that he is the one who is cheating. Then see what happens because it can only be two things. Either he is cheating or he is just VERY insecure.|`|wpiWiWFiaa	Honestly from this I can not tell if he is cheating or not.  People do say that if someone constantly accuses you of cheating that they in turn are cheating on you and are worried because they are getting away with it so why can't you.  I would not worry though it sounds like he is a little insecure.  Reassure him that you care about him and only him. Tell him you care about him and want him to be happy but he can't be happy if he is constantly worrying about you cheating on him.  Good luck girl.  Honestly talking about it is always the best thing to do.
xA1fdVimaa	appearance is the first thing i notice, so if i find them attractive, then i start trying to get to know them.  the thing about "being attractive" ISN'T looking like a damn supermodel ... you just need to take care of yourself & take pride in the way you look.  if they have a good heart & a good head on their shoulders, then i become more interested.  if they share some of the same views & values as i do, then they're pretty much golden.<br>  <br>  to stay (it's simple) ... don't lie, don't cheat, don't nag, & don't try to change me.  be there for me as i would for them.  treat me the way they want to be treated.  simple, right ;)<br>  <br>  turn-offs = bad attitude, poor hygiene, & irresponsibility|`|cYgJQDQSaa	Hmmm, something just "clicks". <br>  <br>  However, I like witty women, someone who isn't worried about looking an idiot every now and then for a laugh.|`|Lb0sZmYgaa	if i luk at a girl and we both luk at each other and we smile den dats wa i luk at den wen we dancin i tend 2 say lets go 2 da bar so i can chat 2 dem|`|p1BLbINuaa	Personality.

Looks are valuable, but if you're a ***** then they don't mean ****.|`|kXIPlN4naa	very simple her/his face not for only beautiful but also for a smile or charm on the face....now on date u want 2 stay bcoz u want 2 spent as much time as u can with her/him|`|7e4jxj3Daa	I notice her legs first and if they're really great, she's got me for sure.|`|DW5Eqc8vaa	For me, personally Id say, I am highly attracted to somebody who shares my interests and likes my humor, jokes<br>  <br>  Looks can be valuable but the inside is more important
xA1fdVimaa	my ex wife's affair - it was one of the worst feelings.  betrayed on a level that hurt so deep, it felt as if i'd never recover (like my whole world just collapsed around me).  i loved her with everything in me.  i did anything she ever asked of me, & would have done anything just to see her safe & happy.  i thought we had a good marriage ... & found out i was just a means to an end.  i wanted to rip my heart out it hurt so bad.  i was angry, wondering why & how she could have done that to me.  i hated her.  i regretted ever knowing her.  i began questioning my own worth & asking myself what did i do wrong.  i even had to question whether or not my son was actually mine.  i stopped believing in the concept of love & happily ever after.  i didn't date for a long time ... figured no one could hurt me if i just stayed on my own.<br>  <br>  like all things in life, i got over it (took a while, but i did).  but it did affect me in future relationships ... because i become far more cautious (& honestly, aren't as quick to give my heart to anyone ... if at all).  i have been cheated one other time in my life - but the lesson learned from my ex wife definately helped me deal with it (i recovered within a month ready to get back out there and see other people).<br>  <br>  having your trust broken, on an intimate level, is the worse.  but, in time, you do move on from it.  you learn from it.  it makes you stronger (maybe a little "colder").  but it doesn't keep you from living & loving.|`|eeHgm5hGaa	IT sucks it feels like you just been stabbed in your heart and you can't pull the knife out.But eventually you will get over it and that will make that person so mad and they will come back running to you and then what you do is up to you after that|`|iOa7rriGaa	Well I had been dating this guy for about 2 and a half years (13-16) and I felt so betrayed and pissed off and hurt when I found out he was cheating. To make it worse he cheated on me with my cousin because we hadn't become sexual yet but it was a good thing in the end because I was so young and I wasn't trying to become sexually active at that age I was too scared to. And I'm glad I didn't because if I had it wouldn't of made a difference that's all he really wanted and sooner or later he would of hooked up with her regardless. But it makes you feel like killing the a** whole and it can really mess with you it can make you feel bad about yourself and like you will never find someone.|`|w0lflDbQaa	Well...the only girlfriend I have ever had decided to cheat on me after 16 months together...with one of my "friends" from home.  It wasn't the greatest feeling in the world pouring your love, time, and money into someone that you treated like a goddess...only to fool around with one of your friends.  Needless to say I have absolutely no self-confidence in myself after that.  Which is why I haven't had a girlfriend in over a year.  *sigh*  It sucks big time.|`|AuthyG9Qaa	Hey Cute Girl,<br>  I am pretty open about cheatng.  I have cheated on gf and girls have cheated on me. Too bad you dont have e-mail or I'd tell you more.<br>  <br>  It was exciting to try somebody new and it was HOT listening to my gf explain what she'd done.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mat|`|yv7qSugfaa	its  sucks BALLLLLLLS!<br>  but eventually u will get over it :)|`|ezHivPoUaa	I was with my Girlfriend for 7 months and she cheated on me once with her ex. But to her surprise I knew it and never called her out on it. I ended getting with 7 girls in that time 2 of them being in her bed. When we broke up she pulled the whole I cheated with my ex and I laughed her off and told her the truth and she flipped. Just keep your street smarts up and you can easily read the opposite sex.|`|HbWMeRbVaa	For me personally it was one of the worst feelings you could ever have. Its basically gut wrentching. I found out 1 month after me and my partner broke up that he had cheated on me 3 times while we were dating. I would never have beleived it. It makes you start thinking of the things you missed and how you could have been so blind. I hope you personally never have to experience it.|`|jAPvUSeEaa	u feel very depressed and angry. i felt shocked becaue my x was such an angle. but after she left me, her new bf got her pregnant and left her. and she came back crying and asking for help. but i didn't help her|`|272b5cb57acd716ffcf6e01fc79e6f29aa	I felt really jealous and i dumped him right away. It felt terrible and i wanted revenge like no other. My friends told me that he wasn't worth it and i agreed.|`|Lsv1pWGcaa	its a horrible experience. You feel crappy about yourself.  and start to question about other relationships your going into. This is even more so when the person lies about it for quite some time.|`|aIb7HdpMaa	i hate being cheated on. i went out with this boy cole for about 6 months and he ruined it. he cheated on me twice! my heart felt like it was being stabbed by a knife. it sucked :P
lJf6pSbaaa	of course.. we're all human. we all judge each other. im sure his friend is saying the same thing about you.|`|wUQG3lZDaa	Yes. By the way they walk, talk, and act, people think that that's all there is to someone and judge them right away. There are these people who are my friends' friends, but I think of them as snobby and annoying. I thought it was just me until I had to talk to them for a project cause we were in the same class, and then I talked about it to my friends. They had the same opinion, so it really depends on the person, cause lots of people seem to be something, but when you really know them, they're something else.<br>  <br>  And that group of people I hate? I still can't stand them for my 3 years in middle school. I can just barely MANAGE to walk right next to them when we're passing each other.
i6Ix28IPaa	Your excellent writing skills tell me that you are a mature, intelligent person.  It's hard to believe that you're only 11 years old!<br>  <br>  First, none of this is your fault.  I hope you understand that.  <br>  <br>  Second, you mother sounds bitter over her broken relationship.  This is a common reaction when parents divorce.  It's too bad that she's not behaving like a mature adult.  It sounds like she's trying to poison your mind against your father, which is unfair to you.  Just know that she's hurting over the divorce and her hurtful, slanderous outbursts are a reflection of that pain.  <br>  <br>  Try to ignore or separate the "sticks and stones" that she throws at your father from the part of her that cares for you.  If you have to, be firm and tell her, "Mom, I love you because you are my mom, and I love Dad because he's my dad.  I not on your side, nor am I on his side.  Stop bad-mouthing him in front of me; I don't want to hear it anymore.  Discuss your issues privately with him and leave me out of it.  You're only making this situation worse and more painful for us all.  It's time we all begin to put this behind us and heal.  Grow up!"<br>  <br>  In the meantime, draw your own conclusions about your father, based on how he treats you.<br>  <br>  Your brother seems to have withdrawn.  That's his chosen method of defense; it's how he avoids getting mixed up in the drama.  That's not necessarily healthy either.<br>  <br>  You turn to cutting yourself.  Please don't.  Since your mom is not in a position to see beyond her own pain in order to help you, please go to one of your school counselors.  That's what they're there for.  You need to talk this out with a trained professional.  Believe me, you are not alone; this happens more often than you realize.  See your counselor now, before your negative actions toward yourself become ingrained in your personality.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless you.|`|dPxcoeP0aa	im 20, my mom has gone through 2 divorces. its hard, trust me i know, i was 18 and had to help out with everything. the best thing for you to do is to talk to somebody. hurting yourself wont help. its not good, listen to music, it helped me. i still need someone to talk to. and i was about 8 when my real dad cheated on my mom, so i have been through some what, what you have. my mom always said your father never did things, or doesn't do this. it was even harder the second time. i do recommend if you need someone to talk to. im here, mess. me my yahoo is www.cynthiaanthony5489@yahoo.com, and if you need someone to actually talk to i will give you my number, but only though my email ( for privacy) . and please dont think about suicide, its not the right thing to do. i have lost a few friends and i tell you the truth its hard to know someone will just give up, so please dont. life gets better|`|5pNmzbOpaa	Alana, I am so sorry that you are struggling with this dilemma.<br>  Well, your parents could use some counseling for sure!<br>  and about those flashbacks, I have had those too. Any traumatic<br>  experience in childhood, is normal to have these flashbacks.<br>  I see how painful this is for you! My parents were always fighting<br>  in front of me, and even through stuff at each other. I would have flashbacks all time until my early 20's. I went to seek help.<br>  The Phychiatrist was great, and he really helped me get to comes to term with what I was feeling. Maybe you seek some therapy to help you deal with this, or I think another good idea<br>  would be to go with your parents for family therapy.<br>  In terms of the anxiety attacks, I also get them from time to time.<br>  I am on medicine for my attacks. But my therapist taught me this technique of breathing that helps the anxiety go away.<br>  When you have the anxiety attack, first say to yourself, I am o.k,<br>  nothing is going to happen to me, I am not going to die, then<br>  take a deep breathe from your lower chest hold your breath for 4 seconds, and exhale, slowly, making sure you breath out from you lower chest, THEN upper chest. Do this several times, until you feel calm and your breathing comes back to normal.

If you try to contact them they do not respond. It's a way of breaking up with someone with out saying hurtful things like "I don't want to be with you" or "I don't like you".

5agXk9ldaa	i vote for natural hair ;)|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Awww, your pretty and have a beautiful smile.Don't let anyone tell you different.But i like the natrual hair, it really bring out your looks.|`|qy07K2k5aa	You look better with straight hair.|`|iWMvrCFNaa	Both are pretty, but natural looks more like you. Curly hair is very rare and a load of ppl love it! You look good with both.|`|0917sYkqaa	wich ever you chose you look cool just don't be one of those girls who are full of them selfs just cuz they are cute.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rock on:)|`|ZLTx3LF5aa	happy go lucky bouncy kid.|`|l2XtZlPUaa	I think that you look pretty young, have an amazingly beautiful smile that completes your pretty face. Based on two impressions, I surmise and hypothesize that you are rather sociable with little or no inhibitions or questions about what a lovely and complete person you are [You are probably right too i might add]. <br>  <br>  And yes, I do think you look exceedingly gorgeous because your smile shows that your personality beautifies your looks.<br>  <br>  Additionally, I am probably living too far away to even want to flirt with you and have no reason to lie.|`|s564PQUHaa	honestly, i would use a light touch of masking powder since there are a couple noticeable freckles. the first photo doesn't show but the second one does. you look good. just use some making powder. whatever it's called where you take a brush and put this lotion on your face with. i use it all the time, and i'm a guy. it's really awesome and chicks don't even know|`|AA12354369	you're cute.  Not my type, and you seem to have maybe a little acne, if I saw it right, but cute.  And nice hair!  I prefer it straight lol|`|AA11080680	my first impression was I love your smile and I like your hair straight. However the photo with your natural hair was not as good as the other one. However I do not judge a book by its cover.|`|vRc7ktcsaa	yeah you are beautiful but you need to start growing some muscles so when you reach 16, you are hot one already. both style is good.|`|jF94WiDnaa	you look better with natural hair and innocent smile. wish you always smile.|`|OXKF0jbtaa	Fun loving flower child|`|urQnRQ4jaa	Cute and out going...I like the natural hair better...but that's just my opinion...it makes you look older|`|o4fykobbaa	haha, i remember this age<br>  <br>  i don't think there is no right or wrong anwer to this question. It all depends on the guy u are trying to attract, and what they are interested in. For example, i see the straight hair attracting a more reserved and i guess you would say, the average person, rather than the more outgoing and spontaneous person, whom would probably be more interested in you if you had curly hair. idk, this is just my opinion|`|6ESUnzQjaa	You look sooo pretty with your natural hair! The straight hair is pretty hair, but i  would go for natural! Then maybe switch it up every couple days!|`|Bu2dwNwkaa	You look like a fun girl to hang out with, very bubbly. YOUR PRETTY. And i'm jealous. If you don't have a boyfriend, i'm suprised!|`|ja7kdPIGaa	cute - nothing out of the ordinary<br>  (which can be a good thing) lol<br>  <br>  i like your curly hair a lot!!|`|1UjfvxU8aa	lolz teen trying to be cute X3 not an insult cuz ima teen too
0htb0QMDaa	shes is jealous and it probably has something to do with her past or youth all you can do is ignore her and keep succeeding as for her she has to realize she has a problem them help herself out anyhow im glad your not rotting away because mainly when young people go through these situations  they give up on life instead of dealing with it and accomplishing their dreams so ya make sure you find a good wife and give your chlldren all the love you ever wanted , good luck and god bless<br>  <br>   lots of people believe in you even if your mom doesent and -thats hard  to take in but Rise against it  :)|`|Kl4kv5khaa	Please do not think badly of me, but it seems she is the only reason you have to being the way you are. But I also understand that to rise up against adverse people are sometimes fun. You have to tell her, perhaps she could make it up to you. My father did. I had always felt the same way. That I could succeed and he would be there telling me otherwise. But approximately a couple of weeks before he died he finally talked to me the way I felt I deserved. So see what happens.|`|7qloglmjaa	YOU my dear friend answered your own question.she probably thinks you remind her of her own father and of your own father.i am a firm believer that a woman will marry a man similar to her father and a man will marry a woman similar to his mother.a child lives what they learn and the best learning experiences are taught  at home.|`|BtxQogSzaa	firstly, well done for getting thru it, it sounds like youve had a hard time with having a mother like her.<br>  Well done for buliding up your life. <br>  its a hard one to ask why she is like this.<br>  the most popular answer would probably be because shes jelous....? when people are jelous of someone they often put them down that way it makes them feel like they're not better than them.<br>  Its hard to try and understand why someone would act like this towards their child, and not just be proud of them, but its sad to actually think ere are people like this.<br>  Well done anyway for getting on with your life and goodluck for the future. just remember you are better that she is and thats all that matters :)|`|41S75G5Eaa	shes probably jealous that you have opportunity's shes never had|`|TZMBn5z7aa	well if she is unhappy than yea I would say she is just trying to spread it around    misery loves company LOL<br>  <br>  but I would say that maybe she feels powerless in her own life so she tries to control you   lots of people who feel like this tend to be angry towards people they see as able to take care of them selves and so they lash out <br>  <br>  just try to know that you are a good person and that you don't need  anyone's approval  even though it would be nice to gain her respect  you simply don't need it <br>  <br>  but I would also try and not think of her or your father as weak or evil just unhappy people who you don't have to follow in their foot steps <br>  try just thanking her for your life in your heart and know that you are fine as is|`|AA12346188	Never mind your Mother. <br>  Just treat her as another senseless but infatuated human being. This happens with any mother because of their unwanted infatuation and possessiveness. This happens to all. <br>  Start minding your life and your own business.<br>  the life is very short to waste time on unwanted thinking and which has no solution.<br>  First you have to live your life for your sake and not for somebody's sake.<br>  Nobody follows anybody in death.<br>  You came alone to this world without your asking - in the same way you are leaving this world alone without a trace and to a place from where there is no return.<br>  This is not a bull s-h-i-t philosophy.<br>  This is practical statements by a seasoned and experienced person of 61 years old, widower who have undergone all trials and tribulations and waiting for the death to strike ASAP.<br>  The life is UNWANTED BIRTH - UNAVOIDABLE DEATH.|`|8zgFyfibaa	How old are you by the way???????<br>  <br>  From the looks of it your some 35 year old mamas boy. Man you're a grown @ss man stop whining about your mommy being mad at u
BwGOjB1Raa	Well, you won't get one asking dumb questions like that.|`|4WVbjbWxaa	go to the college :D<br>  <br>  <br>  talk to the girl you love<br>  <br>  <br>  communicate well what u feel....
aZSVc0eHaa	first of all this is really cute like from a movie. lol sorry i had to say it<br>  but i reckon u tell her how u feel buddy. she is never goin to know if u dont tell her. And ur never going to find out if the feelins are mutual or not? ur never going to know any of what u want to know unless u find out for yourself. its a really hard thing to do telling someone who u already love as a best friend that ur in love with them and want to be with them is hard. but i reckon once u have done it u will feel so much better. but i really hope it doesnt reck ur current relationship.. if ur that gr8 friends im sure it wont but be true to ur heart and tell her how u feel<br>  goodluck u sound like a gr8 guy she would be lucky to have u|`|ReaD6u4paa	i am in love with my best friend too.i had sex with her and she is avoiding me now.it is a great dilema.i understand your fears.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtxaKydcYbEJIv0.frkUG0Psy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227021900AAIBS5o">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  talk to her as soon as possible or you might end up like me|`|1836a40209adf3c11cc7c5b61284b41faa	I married my best friend and it is the best thing I ever did. We can talk about anything or not talk at all and feel comfortable. You must find out if she has romantic feelings for you?  The only way is to take her out. If things don't work out then you go always still be friends? If you don't take her out then you may never know? Life is too short to not go for the gold.
lFQiiR0Baa	I think when a relationship is not pleasant for someone, it's best to end it. So, yes, you did the right thing.|`|v398Qalyaa	it does sound as though this friendship wasn't one of the best, so i do think it's for the best, however, as you live next door, it's better all round if you can just be pleasant and say 'hello'

0LEFco9xaa	I dated a guy who liked a married women. He was dating me too but he never could let go of her because she always said she was going to leave her husband. That along with other reasons made me break up with him. Then a year latter he came back and apologized to me and realize he wanted me. But it was too late. I would never do that myself with a guy because they will never leave no matter how bad or unhappy they are.|`|P8HLuz5Zaa	ilove you|`|FzFSzilmaa	i wouldn't date her... would have sex with her... (and have done in the past)... :D|`|ze4Gt1araa	Hell no! I will never date a guy that is attached no kids, no wife, no nothing! That will just complicate the situation.
71VRvldJaa	Why don't you stop thinking about him as a prospective boyfriend and get to know him better as a person and a friend.  Let nature take it's course!  <br>  If you're both too shy to even communicate, how would a relationship between you ever work.  <br>  Just be friendly and outgoing with him....don't discuss anything about dating or feelings just yet.  Who knows, by the time you get to know him better, you might decide he's not what you want!|`|yMUCJO2xaa	Just be yourself.....have fun and start out with something that is humourous....And you really dont need to say anything,,,Just smile,,that will say it all!!!!!|`|b1d33a0f7a675cbafecffe22b2423782aa	Yes it would be wierd. If a female asks a male on a date, expect to get used.<br>  <br>  Find out who he hangs out with and see if any of your friends are dating his friends. Going out as a group keeps you safe and will open him up to conversations since both your/his friends will be there too. <br>  <br>  Talk about him. People love to talk about themselves.|`|pid8uVfoaa	umm...just go up to him and ask if he's got a girlfriend and stuff...kid believe me it'll let you know what kind of guy he is....and he should kinda get a strong hint...<br>  <br>  be like" hey so whats up? what do you do for fun? what music you listen too?" and don't lie about things to impress him...if he already does like you there isnt no need to impress more hun...best wishes...|`|lgcjxNpSaa	You don't have to ask him out out for a start. Maybe you could invite him to come out with you and some friends for starts and just hang out. I would just act yourself and approach him like you would a friend.|`|seO0kwGVaa	No, it wouldn't be weird to ask him out <br>  but, give him a deadline so he doesn't spend forever  thinking about answering your question :)
Gt8NoO2waa	Sounds like he tired of hearing you vent your problems, I know I get sick of hearing my gfs problems. Its not that we don't care, its mainly because there is nothing we could do to fix your problems. And I'm sure you listen to his problems, but the thing is women love to talk about those subjects, guys not so much. I wouldn't worry about it though.|`|4WVbjbWxaa	may be is is thinking about something else .. his exams .. or any other personal problem...<br>  <br>  i think you should ask open questions... to him.. like try to find out how is everything else going on in his life...<br>  <br>  talk a lil more about him... with him.. and his concerns... just try to help him if he is in need|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I don't think that being his first girlfriend has anything to do with it. Every guy I have ever been with hated talking on the phone. Phones are more for girls alot of guys would rather communicate a different way. Don't worry about it.
EatzEjhiaa	you do not want to be that close with your boyfriend's best friend. you are his bf's gf. that's trouble waiting to happen. why are you chatting online with him?
AA11219671	love can happen at first sight or love cant happen when a couple sees each other even 10000 times . i do believe in love at first sight . it doesnt happen to everyone ... few of em get tht chance ...|`|LS8LcuRaaa	I don't believe in love at first sight. You might instantly really like a person, but you still have to get to know each other...<br>  <br>  Guys saying stuff like that quite often just want to get you into bed as quickly as possible. So, while it's possible that he never felt like that before, make sure you don't rush things.|`|CsBvnpkSaa	No, it's just a myth. Go watch the movie "he's just not that into you", it will infulence your beliefs.|`|inyDyWKxaa	I do not believe in love at first sight.  I believe in infatuation at first sight.  How can you fall in love with someone you do not know.  You have to know someone in order to be in love with them.  Otherwise the honeymoon will be over very soon and you will see the real person.|`|ySqErfn1aa	Yes I do.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it's lust,but you'll know when it is & when it isn't.<br>  (:|`|wZyRPutYaa	i'm sorry to tell you this but that is bull, he just wants some thats all
fP46meSmaa	Even if his cousin stopped sending them type of emails, he probably would still look at porn on the internet.It's your right to tell him to stop, and you can find naked men all over the internet, just google it.**
FZKFLTyLaa	Perhaps nice falls under the same heading as considerate.
hp8Q5j9Oaa	Im Zac Drinkwater, anyone, realize that this guy that posted this message about me is going to jail for all this harassment. My uncle is a police prosecuter. He put cops away for a job, this will just be fun for him. Anyone else want to listen to this criminal, Jason Carpenter is 40 year old and gay, anyone else feel sorry for him?|`|uLuoDmcnaa	wow. that really sucks.<br>  who is he ..<br>  tell us more<br>  did that happen to you|`|tlxG2q04aa	Someone's bitter.
hzMpdFFBaa	If that is how you see the world, "date" men instead of women and spare us your neurotic nonsense. Or I guess you can just invest in the services of prostitutes.|`|FzFSzilmaa	cos women are told by other women that men should respect them and that they shouldn't want sex... cos sex is "dirty" and men are pigs... and "good" men will want to know more about the woman...<br>  <br>  which is wrong, we just want the sex... :D otherwise what is the point of being with the women???|`|0lwGsRNqaa	Women like to think men are deeper then that. They just don't realize that all we want is sex.
5DLxtZSDaa	ask her if u can get her for a dessert.|`|FLPRFTccaa	slap her on the **** when she walks by.|`|oMr0S3Wdaa	smile a lot. try to make her laugh. that's how my BF  got me I love a man with sense of humor. Be yourself! never pushy
nmiXLhwCaa	Maybe it is time to seriously think about whether or not you want to be with someone who makes you feel like that anymore.|`|4WVbjbWxaa	Hmm may be he is not feeling well..<br>  <br>  i think you should avoid any confusion and ask him what is wrong with him...<br>  <br>  there might be something he is worried about and hence showing the anger on you...<br>  <br>  just talk to him.. that should help
sopAuW7Zaa	yeah...i have this same kind of struggle. I try to be understanding and crap, but when it comes right down to it, they always find a way to take full advantage of me.<br>  <br>  I have come to a theory...it's the I-couldn't-care-less theory. <br>  <br>  I've often thought that women(more specifically, the ones you're talking about) are a lot like cats. you can treat them nice and **** and they'll just push you away. On the other hand, if you sling em up against the wall, they'll just come runnin right back for more. (mind you, there are some guys like that as well, so don't think i'm being chauvinistic.).<br>  <br>  But, i do admire your desire to take a stance against this vile treatment. My hat's off to you, sir.|`|0xGtNdveaa	Hey man take it from me, a nice guy. I know exactly how you feel, but you see that is what makes us different. In the end we do finish. Those who are idiots and think they are all that will end up by themselves. and even if girls dont seem like it, they actually want the nice guy, no girl wants a guy whos a douche. So be patient. Be different. Be yourself. Dont worry about what others think and just focus on being the nice guy you are bro. Trust me, it all pays off in the end. Dont treat others how you dont want to be treated. Thats the rule to live by, especially when everyone knows you are nice already dont change that just to get attention. Its the wrong kind of attention. Just take it easy and be nice trust me.|`|XIhGx6dvaa	People won't like you if you say "go f**k yourself." That's the Columbine mentality. They'll like you if your attitude is: "I don't give a f**k what you think, but I have your back no matter what." Your problem isn't that people don't respect you but that you actually give a sh*t what people think about you.|`|urQnRQ4jaa	I love nice guys I date nice guys...don't worry you just haven't found that one person for you yet...just wait and sit it out your time will come...don't worry...|`|iwckOLB9aa	Its very true Nice guys finish LAST !!<br>  <br>  if you are too nice then they will only see you as a friend and only call you when they have guy problems.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	I would think you were a moron and just completely avoid you.<br>  Maybe that's just me though.<br>  <br>  Well I guess I'm not like 99% of the population than, so sue me.|`|8b1f5a61d96bdbd24c4cdb756cf6fbbbaa	I agree i am really honest on this but I am a really nice guy and majority of my friends are A**holes to girls and they get all the girls i am left to Comfort  the girls after or talk to them during and its bull s**t it just doesn't end and it sucks i feel you but I'm not changing who i am for anyone F*** that I'm me if someone has a problem with that they can F*** off|`|7CPRTQSTaa	You need to surround yourself with the right people. If you continue to be nice then other people who are nice will be drawn to you. If you start acting like a jerk then the people who are drawn to jerks will love you. But they're jerks too? Birds of a feather flock together, so the "cool guy" may look good now, but true coolness is the inner confidence. It's a person that can know their worth regardless of who else will acknowledge it.|`|imEV2iKGaa	Well, im almost like you. Really got sick and tired of being a "nice" person. I agree with you, it's hard trying to be nice. But the advantage to it is that you don't get into conflict easily. Well, maybe you are trying too hard to be nice, then people saw through you and feel like you are just Acting. Just be yourself, follow your heart and do whatever you feel like doing. OKay? Then it's more real, then people will appreciate you more. Hope it helps.|`|d36OrpbDaa	the reason people like "jerks" isn't BECAUSE they're jerks.  it's because they're charming and interesting and confident.<br>  <br>  you can still be a nice guy (and you SHOULD be respectful).  just try to spice it up a little.|`|LAbQy9d4aa	I am the same type.<br>  Trust me, it's better to be different and better, than average idiot.
djUMvICoaa	It must be summer?  How would you know she's not wearing panties?|`|lGSUToFQaa	i think brit, seriously she is trying too hard to get attention or she is a major ****, then again she could have just ran out of undies that morning, should have worn jeans though, i have a large chest, i don't wear low cut shirts constantly to call attention to it, i think women should always dress like a lady so they are treated with respect and like a lady|`|asxqampCaa	If people know she is not wearing panties she is sitting inappropriately and spreading her legs for the entire world to see.<br>  <br>  That means:<br>  <br>  [a] she is a major attention whore, <br>  <br>  [b] there have been a lots of other catchers who have pounded their fist into that leathery old mitt before I got there<br>  <br>  [c] she doesn't understand that genitals are to be used, not stared at like this is an ob/gyn exam or an anatomy class. Very few women (or men) have genitals that rate them actually being LOOKED AT. 99.999%? Blecch. They are't there as visual attractions.|`|CCXMW0HYaa	I'm not into women that are so insecure that they need to dress slutty just to get my attention. So, I'd think you must be desperate.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	I think "Oh boy, I'm gettin' some"
zgQZJUHwaa	You are ugly on the inside so it really doesn't matter<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|ykPN1GCPaa	a pic would help...... but id say you have outer beauty (hot) but your inner beauty is nonexistent.|`|7CF1WKjMaa	ummmm, a picture would definitely help with the judging|`|AA10845576	lol. we don't know. but don't worry that much. and you shouldn't ask these types of questions online. people lie. I was just browsing and this girl asked if she was pretty the truth is she was pretty.. ugly. but everyone said she was really pretty and so on and so fourth to make her feel better. So i think you should rely on those "lots of people" that tell you ur good looking. And asking this question doesn't not make you a bad person like some random lowlifes keep on saying. :)|`|A94u2In8aa	Picture please!<br>  Why do you stare at yourself 24/7?You know, no matter how hot you are being conceited and self absorbed does not have any appeal.
rNmekxLcaa	He thinks you are moderately attractive.|`|eQVD090Xaa	he`s just waiting for your boobs to pop out|`|kt6iljK0aa	He likes you. Unless he doesn't. Boys are a weird breed so don't go over there and say 'You fancy me, don't ya?' Won't help. You could talk to him, maybe he wants to join in. If you are popular you could be his ticket into the group.|`|PvlpJ1IFaa	Yea, he thinks you are good looking. Wants you to notice him. He prolly wants you to talk to him cuz he either 1) thinks he's too cool to talk to you, which isn't this one,  or 2) he's fridgid and doesn't know how to make first move.  I'd ignore him unless you want a short meaningless relationship.|`|jMKDH07naa	i think he likes you. something that he is up to you and planning to court you. well, when a person looks at you once, it is considered to be accidentally. but if not only once, not twice but how many times, it is obviously intentionally.. good luck! i love this game!|`|Kg8OJnfmaa	He's a stalker. soon you will see him outside your window sitting on that tree with binoculars and a camera. yep you get a full blown case of stalker on your hands.|`|KkjOXRRWaa	He thinks you're ugly.|`|WTWSyqXgaa	I think that you should talk to him, confront him maybe. Tell him about your feelings for him. I know that guys aren't very talkative, but maybe he'll share his thoughts and feelings for you as well. I also think that you guys could meet up, maybe at a mall or something and see a movie or just enjoy some coffee.|`|kSlxXQcsaa	i think he likes you. if you like him start talking to him and you'll know by the way he talks to you or if he's shy around you there could be a sign of him liking you there|`|tLBjsrEFaa	most guys will stare at girls bouncing on Trampolines<br>  <br>  you tube has lots of videos<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvHnzWaRAZc&feature=PlayList&p=4B4EB317C9AFC99A&playnext=1&index=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvHnzWaRA...</a>|`|UxCsAc3baa	I think he is giving you some mixed signals.|`|vLQ5sPJ9aa	He loves you.|`|C3XX5WWSaa	Did he ever jump on u while ur jumping, if so then he's in love.|`|NeH6c1bHaa	he may like you, or think you are attractive|`|odaI00hxaa	well if you think he likes you try and talk to him and show off a bit back but if he really does like you then he will talk to you eventually or maybe you try talking to him he might just need a bit of a push!!!|`|hbcITsIbaa	guys stare at girls... i learned long ago that usually means they are imagining me naked or something worse... get used to it, because its not going to change... like yeah its creepy but you get used to it and its not so bad.|`|aYQtyYfxaa	i KNOW ITS ME|`|0ZNur15Laa	sorry. i won't do it again

xVecKF26aa	He is a loser.  You are right about how he should not be keeping tabs on you- he is married for goodness sake!  Plus he has a baby!?<br>  Wow, what a complete LOSER. He is just not over you.  But he needs to move on.<br>  <br>  I am proud of you, that you will not get involved with a married man. (:<br>  I wish their were more women out there like you!<br>  <br>  Just stay clear of him.  If he persists, I would walk up to him and say LEAVE ME ALONE.  Go back to your wife and baby and leave me alone.  If he doesn't, and if I was his wife...I would want to know about it.  I would want to know that my husband is a total jackass.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope he leaves you alone.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	He's looking for sex but doesn't have the nerve to act on it.<br>  <br>  Ignore him completely.  Take out stalking charges if you feel unsafe or if he steps up the behavior.  Let him figure out his brain, because it isn't your problem.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	either he is a creeper or you are imagining that he is keeping tabs on you, is it possible that he just happens to drive by a store (or whatever) where you happen to be and your ego leads you to believe that he is only there because of you?  If he was truly keeping tabs on you don't you think he would have spoken to you at least a few times?|`|zu10q3Qyaa	Sounds like he's obsessive....and probably controlling.  He really needs to get over you and pay attention to his family.  Maybe you should tell him that he has a problem and needs to forget about you or your going to discuss it with his wife.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	He feels like a dolt and wishes he had his old life back?

X6C6kZKKaa	just tell them you have to pee.|`|QTxaVUaPaa	Find a woman who isn't interested in cuddling after sex.<br>  <br>  They do exist. We're not a hive mind.|`|tlxG2q04aa	Set the alarm on your cell phone so it sounds like someone is calling you.  Pretend to have a conversation and make out like there is a family emergency.  <br>  <br>  Alternatively, if it's a one night stand, just go.  Who cares if she gets mad?  Plenty more pussy where that came from.|`|MVJdwyIkaa	Well, first you have to understand that women are emotional creatures and guys well..not so much. If you really loved the girl you were sleeping with you wouldn't mind cuddling with her at all and letting her know she wasn't just a piece of meat.|`|NAwWqDMAaa	its a sign of affection really.<br>  girls like tZ..yEJWllTV88.FJpQSBG_hs0FERxwulvb2U5Un... yanswers=d=Mg1QDSka6xWG_Y4kVXs_46mf2oQA0...|`|QQv8f1vRaa	haha well im a gurl and i hate to cuddle but my bf does...so i just go take a shower right after were done lol
lJf6pSbaaa	you might want to be careful of who gets word of the party .. i can almost bet my life that someone will try to sneak in alcohol or anything else. good for you! im straight edge too!!! i agree. drugs is for boring people who don't know how to have fun!<br>  <br>  i suggest just making flyers... but make it sound like its going to be the best thing ever.|`|u5Ioj6aaaa	I totally agree. Straight Edge is the way to go. Maybe facebook/myspace too but flyers sounds good. Facebook is good because its easy to invite everyone and put all the info you need to on there. Im having a alcohol free pool party over the summer, and were getting an inflatable obstacle course haha and watching a movie with a projector on a sheet. Good luck though!|`|PNrJS4OKaa	If you have a myspace, post several bulletins.<br>  Mostly, flyers will get the word out.<br>  Make them colorful! =]|`|WgqRMfCPaa	Send them personalized e mails.. or IM them.. Much more effective and fast!
4T9fZzITaa	flyers are a good way to start<br>  if you have a myspace post a bulletin out informing them<br>  or if you dont want certain pple to go text them or msg them and let them know. tell them to bring ppl who do not drink or do drugs.<br>  you should definitely make it clear [and in the flyers] that its a drug free kind of party. great idea btw! you should only hand em out in your school cuz if you hand em out in the street then random ppl will go and some ppl tend to go already boozed up. but if you insist then go by a church and hand em out there.. thats all i can come up with now goodluck & have fun :]]
121bf7421c6e2471d7a187d525e9abb1aa	WOW! You sent a girl that you have never met money for her Visa so she can come to the U.S. I don't know if that was such a smart idea. She might be playing you and now she has some cash thanks to you. But if she's not and she really is into you then you've just made a great investment. Well I think once she gets here, if she gets here, then you guys should start going out and see how that goes and see how the living together is gonna work out and if you think everything will be all fine and dandy then pop the question! Good luck man, I think you'll need it...|`|hLWGMdEmaa	Um its a scam mate|`|prTLJnXFaa	LuLz JIM U R 2 MuCh!!|`|AA11391968	I hate to be a pessimist, but if it sounds to good to be true.....it probably is.  Do some research on the computer about all of these scams (like mail order brides).  Do a check on her physical address to see if her last name is associated with it.  How about if she happened to be married in Russia and is looking for a way out?  Same with her phone number.  If it is true, I would wait at least 6mths before marrying her to get a good picture of what she is really like and wants.  Good luck.|`|AA10415165	inb4 Scam Artist.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	If eventually she comes, you need to understudy her for sometime before getting married. It's very unfortunate that bad guys/girls have made people not to trust any one.  But however there are some good guys and girls.  More also there's this girl I liked on Y/A the brief period we communicated I wanted to send some gift to her, but it was herself that declined the gift.  But before we trust any one, we really need to be cautious.|`|8K3IucU3aa	that sounds like a scam. what a lot of people do in other countries is they get close to people here and when they get married to a U.S. citizen they become a citizen and they just divorce us and go on. have you seen her on some kind of a webcam? are you sure that it's her picture? don't send your money off you someone that you don't know because you never know who you're talking to on the internet.|`|eTO0ZIGvaa	This is either a joke or you really got conned into sending someone money.|`|x1FzJLwZaa	she just wants green card then you are in the dumps next
aWZP3JJlaa	It means that the girl likes you, and she wants you and her to be like no cheating on each other, You spend time with her. and like Just keep it Normal. Like she really likes u .|`|zWo03iLNaa	it means you guys are completely together. No dates with other girls or anything like that.|`|41S75G5Eaa	it means she wants to take things nice and slow<br>  no pressure|`|F6SilA1Faa	like you guys arent seeing anyone else.<br>  <br>  if you guys do something with another person sexually its cheating because you guys are def. full on dating
i6Ix28IPaa	You seem to have serious trust issues with him, and that is not a good sign.  You cannot control what he does, of course, and it sounds like suspicion over his inner desires and ultimate action is something that will continue to haunt you.  It would bother me, too.<br>  <br>  Whether he cheats or not, whether he's even tempted to cheat or not, you are still going to worry--if not over this situation about others that will undoubtedly occur in the future.   It will never end for you because he's already cheated once.  <br>  <br>  Are you prepared to wonder and worry as you are now for the rest of your life?|`|b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	Read your question as if you are a stranger. What advice would you give this person. Give your fiance an ultimatum. He cheats, he goes and he pays..|`|slM9uHmnaa	It is really sad that you feel so insecure, but I can totally see where you are coming from. You say that there have been 'issues' in the past, so he has done the dirty on more than 1 occasion? If that is the case, as much as you love him, he will do it again and again so I know that I would be saying goodbye. If though he has had one little indiscretion, I believe that everyone deserves a 2nd chance. He may have changed, only you know that......|`|r21PZteRaa	Yes, WORRY.  I do not know any guys that don't mess around with an ex.  AT ALL.  Even my married friends have done inappropriate things with an ex.  Her being at his work is just giving him more of an access to the availability of p***y. Yes, be worried.  "We are not married now" is a rationalization we have used in our own head.|`|F6SilA1Faa	you totally have a right to be pissed. <br>  <br>  i wouldnt tolerate it for a second if i were in your place.<br>  <br>  you shouldve dumped him when he cheated.<br>  <br>  once a cheater always a cheater.
sPvhK9eLaa	i think the whole dvd thing is really cute and personal. and i like the whole idea put together, but try to cut the cost by a lot, you don't want to make her feel that her gift is inadequate.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|8AqePkCqaa	write her a cute little poem. maybe something that goes along with what you bought. or a little note telling why you thought she'd like. or plain make her a card|`|Q1nQ0Jszaa	just tell her i love you and present ur gift of a bresslate|`|5wvg0sLLaa	the one extra thing i think you should add that will make her sooo happy is get a small simple and cute photo book and little stickers and things of that sort that remind you of the good times with her, like inside jokes or sweet things she does or says. and fill the book with pictures of you two together and have little quotes on each page of things maybe relating to the stickers or the picture or how she makes you feel....trust it will be really cute even though its so simple its really thoughtful.|`|d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	Sounds as if you are trying to go OTT in impressing her.<br>  Just be your normal self and buy a small gift.
qMnuRO50aa	Because we feel like we have more important things to do, when we really don't. Sleep is what keeps us going more than anything.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	You have prioritized other things ahead of sleep.  But sleep really is important, so you should plan to go to bed at the same hour every night so you don't feel so drowsy during the day.

I always thought that once a couple was together for more than four months, they would just say I love you and it would be so romantic.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend and I were together for a year and two months before we said it to one another. It just happens when you're ready for it to happen.|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	just remember......once the big "L" word is out there, you can't take it back.....and if the person does not reciprocate the same feelings then you will definitely be hurt............goodluck|`|UlT5dByaaa	When you feel it's the right time.|`|AA12382330	after he's said it.|`|dV2DFXi6aa	it depends upon the situation girl, are you saying that you want to say i love you too? or just want to tell the guy "i love you"? then if you just to tell i love you to a guy just wait for a right time, girls are always be girls, if a guy doesn't have any move unto you then really you don't have nothing to do with it but to wait until the guy aproach and propose you that he has feeling on you and thats the time that you tell him "i love you"..|`|AA11842750	When you are sureeeeee you love him...if he doesnt love you bk doesnt mean he never will.|`|xVecKF26aa	When you truly feel that you love him.|`|PlDiJFi0aa	Just go and kiss him and say it.|`|DibzbnVhaa	Wait for him to say it first.|`|P2v5ZtAbaa	when you truly know he is the right guy for you

efXc2xYyaa	I know exactly how you feel, I'm REALLY shy also. I really don't have too many friends, and no boy friend. But I don't let that bother me. No, I don't think you should change yourself for a boy! You're special the way you are, and when you do meet someone, it'll be awesome, because you'll know that he loves you for who you are.|`|RvhGD7SNaa	dont worry you will for sure meet new people...and much better people. just be yourself. dont let others to influence you to change. have more confidence in yourself. <br>  <br>  and about your shy crush, if you two are in same classes, just go ask him out to like the movies. but if you two are compelte strangers, it would be awkward. get to know him first by maybe online or wave and say hi to him in hallways.|`|hXODrxgfaa	Well, it's always good to have a second chance like going to a new school, a clean slate. Well, if your shy now, you will always be shy even if you don't show it. For the other guy, if you are still going to see him since you are going to a new school, then you need to get introduced with him before you can ask him or perferably he ask you out to do something.|`|09PU7gp8aa	when you move, get involved in activities and everything and just try to maybe plan things b4 you say them.<br>  when u pass that shy guy in the hallways, say hi to him and ask him how his day has been or sumthing like that<br>  after you see him a couple times ask him if he's interrested in going to the movies and he can bring along a friend(s) of his...tell him ure friends could *** 2--and it'd be fun<br>  if he says no dont flip out, just tell him maybe that u guys should hang out another time<br>  && you don't have to change 4 guys, unless YOU think you should|`|G8GjJxEuaa	dont you push these things! it takes time to find the right guy... but never try to change yourself to get a guy because if and when it works, it wont be the real you he likes. i had the same problem, and i found my guy recently, outside of school. look everywhere, there's bound to be a great guy for you. speaking of which, do you have any guy friends (or girl friends)? maybe they can give you tips to get over your shyness.|`|Ip9COh1Naa	I have the same problem as you do, execpt im a couple years older, and my advice would be to start talking to new people(mostly guys) and dont stay shy because your not changing yourself for guys your doing it for yourself! you should push yourself a little every day to become less shy, it will just get worse if you dont. it didnt bother me that much when I was your age, i just kept saying next year will be the year i get a boyfriend, but you cant get a bf if you dont talk to boys. So basically go and talk to as many boys as you can!<br>  <br>  And for your other question first get to know your crush and after that ask him out cause chances are he will like you to. dont just think about him, talk to him or else you will end up liking the same guy for 7 years with out even getting to know him, which makes no scence.<br>  <br>  Start next school year as a new year to change for YOUR benefit .<br>  <br>  <br>  i should really listen to my own advice! lol|`|l1w8kcogaa	well u need to hav confidence and do wat u want to do not wat ur friends want....i'm 13 and i hav never really had a true gf....but i read some of ur other questions about animals and u sound pretty cool.....u should email me<br>  <br>  j.papelbon58@yahoo.com|`|sgfLDeBfaa	ok first of all im sure guys have liked you and you just haven't known about it!!second of all when i was 14 i didnt have any guy friends either and now (3 years later) i have tonnes.<br>  going to a new school will be a great opportunity to meet new people and while i dont think you should change yourself try and be a bit less shy.for example start a convo about music or films that everyone can join in.<br>  same goes for talking to the guy you like.if you could start a convo with him about films you could talk for a while then mention a really great film that you want to see in the cinema....great way of casually dropping the invitation into the convo:)<br>  good luck!

7CXVSa23aa	i'd like to speak in behalf of the women. :D<br>  <br>  when we cheat, we say we're confused because it is really how we feel. most of the time, we still love the person we're with, but we no longer feel as happy and satisfied with the relationship. our partner might be turning cold and are not as affectionate as before. we feel sad and often we look for someone to lean on and someone to share our feelings with. someone who can understand and appreciate us. then in the event that we find that person, whom most probably is a male friend, it is when we are tempted to cheat.<br>  <br>  technically, we are caught choosing between the one we love, or the one who loves us.<br>  <br>  i know cheating is always wrong whether done by a man or a woman. unfortunately, we are not perfect and i think that would always be a sad and painful part of life that we have to accept.<br>  <br>  <br>  -gg-|`|6tn8DJajaa	very often the women are "confused" because they love the man they are with, but he isnt giving them the proper affection and making them feel like they are appreciated..... when another starts showering them with affection and appreciating them, all the sudden they start having feelings for this person..<br>  <br>  prob is, they still lvoe the first perosn and want them to be doing the things the new person is doing... <br>  <br>  this is not an excuse for cheaters, but it is why it happens most of the time... and this is what confused can mean in that context|`|FsyVcVWdaa	It's not just women who put on the act of confusion when caught red-handed<br>  <br>  In any situation where a person is put under sudden pressure or fear...<br>  It's easy for any and all people to reach out and grab the 'confused' response as the best defense-<br>  If they appear uncertain, it distracts and infects everyone else for a moment-  <br>  Acting uncertain or surprised creates a possible get-away and a quick window is all they usually need in order to escape judgment|`|SbdWqDCGaa	It's very confusing for their small minds to grasp which schlong they are supposed to have in their mouth.

My mom called up the girl's house who had called me and she wasn't even there.<br>  <br>  When I came back to the kitchen, my mom was crying and told me that it had all been a prank. <br>  <br>  It was awful.|`|mDq4Mf9zaa	right now im in a bad situation i like my current but i also have feelings for my ex whom still likes me, but i dont know if hes just saying that because he wants to have sex with me or if its real compassion, but with my current im a little jealous because he constantly talks to his ex in front of me <br>  well thats my situation and its pretty damn sukish<br>  ya<br>  Sarah.V|`|RgbARcJTaa	friend a Likes a guy and friend b called her slut (in a sly way) and said she was making it out that shes avalible<br>  becasue she was flirting with him and talking to him online<br>  in the end :<br>  friend a went out with the guy and broke up the same day<br>  me nd my other friend said to friend a just do what ever u want|`|oAfbZBMjaa	when the two friends are speaking in different languages and talking about topics which you're not familiar with. <br>  <br>  it's the worst feeling to be left out.|`|rvSrjNeQaa	Have two mares is the guarantee for falling down !!

You don't owe him anything and you don't have to keep returning his calls if you don't like him. You've gone far out of your way to be polite and "not burn bridges"... Bridges are only useful to help you go somewhere and if this isn't going anywhere, let it burn.|`|RgbARcJTaa	wow <br>  what a jerk!<br>  just be friends nd txt dnt vist him anymore <br>  though|`|HEDKbHKlaa	Thats long... :)|`|MZMe2Ub9aa	That  isss longggg....... wow!|`|mjfllOFUaa	I dont think it would be wrong to never speak to him again but one day eventually you are going to get over it and want to tell him about hisself so that would be the day you speak to him and because you havent talked to him in a while it will have allowed you to have gotten over it and wont look bak

gRXy66dOaa	WOW.. most women would be angry after they kiss the guy and found out he has a GF<br>  <br>  To be honest with you, and just think about this:  If he is making out with you behind his GF's back, what makes you think that if you were his GF, he won't do the same thing to you?? What he has done, I call that cheating. Those type of guys are not worth it. He prob thinks that you are easy.<br>  <br>  Jbut yeah, ust think about that and if your still fine with it then go ahead and become his BF

And I'm glad he didn't tell me because he was a jerk. I mean he's really a lunatic with a mental disorder!!!<br>  I just found out that he has this crush on me when he told all of my friends abt it.

ze4Gt1araa	Well you should sit him down and tell him how you feel, that ever since you guys have had sex you guys don't communicate as before he should be able to understand. Just tell him the way you feel.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Get a Cosmo magazine and do the quiz with him.  Make it a joke.   A funny ha ha.  Do not take it seriously.

NAwWqDMAaa	obviously he has feelings for her , they went out for ages . feelings dont just come and go they stay for a while untill they move on to someone else. he wil still love her and untill he finds someone else who he loves he will always love this girl no matter how many times she cheated :) x xx
tPRRUs4Jaa	i think that you should be yourself because if you're planning on being with him for a long time, it's better to let them see who you really are now then to be some happy-go-lucky fake person now, then be yourself later. so they'll know that you're real and genuine and that you aren't some kind of hoe or anything. <br>  just have confidence in the way you present yourself and be smart about the things that you say. being shy is okay--just think about your answers to the questions they ask you before you just blurt something out. && also don't wear anything slutty. dressing somewhat conservative but still in something you would wear (like if you're a hollister girl, wear a nice henley shirt and some cute jeans or khakis--unless it's a more formal event, then dress slacks and a cute blouse will do..stuff like that). <br>  anyway, i'm sure you'll do fine if you just act like the good person you are. good luck!!
xarKlp0Oaa	Everybody feels like this from time to time. It may take some time to snap out of it but just try to get out and have a little fun afterall you deserve it.|`|bI7yzhkTaa	You're probably depressed. First you should find out what's at the root of it and take baby steps to change it. Maybe you should consider seeing a therapist as well. Sometimes we find ourselves in ruts like these and almost always there's an underlying reason why we feel this way|`|ze4Gt1araa	Go out with friends to a restaurant, go to a club, ect.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your life and move on life is too short. :)|`|DFSHoO4uaa	well first you should see what may cause thing problem and try and get rid of it you should push yourself to do things you enjoy if it is because of someone you shouldn't be the one hurting because they properly haven't even thought about you it's something i learnt in life just do what you think is best and stay positive hope i helped and all goes well take care!|`|WFP46Ek9aa	rustygirl_90210@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  you can email me! : - )
AA10959572	Sadly, the fact is... you need to get over it.<br>  <br>  I was with someone abusive for 9 years until I had to decide between leaving and suicide.  Seriously!<br>  <br>  But the kids kept me there for the last 2 years, and I wanted to be there for them as I knew that she'd mess their lives up.<br>  <br>  I finally get out, rebuilt my life, gained full custody of the kids, was a single dad for a few years and then I met someone good.<br>  <br>  Been with her and married almost 10 years now.<br>  <br>  The fact is, I didn't have a good family at all (still don't, to the point where I've cut them ALL out of my life), and lived many years feeling like I had to settle for anyone and ended up making a lot of mistakes.<br>  <br>  You're still very young, and need to think about yourself.  Life is too short, and if only I knew then what I know now, I'd NEVER would have been abused or lived the hell I did.|`|AA10266072	Just forget about him.  If he is violent then that's a situation you do not want to be a part of.  The good thing is that you have friends.  Hang out with them and just completely stop talking to him.  You need to move on.  This time by yourself, even though it will hurt, will be good for you.  You need to learn to become more independent.  Nothing is worse than becoming dependent on someone.  You're still young and you have plenty of time.|`|FHi0v36eaa	Aww, my bf broke up with me last night too. But in your situation I think you should be happy its over. He sounded pretty abusive, you need someone who won't hit you. <br>  <br>  Hang out with your friends, go out, have a girls night. Keep busy with a new hobby or a class. Yoga, writing, cooking class, whatever will keep you from thinking about it.|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Yeah, stay busy.  And try to remember this is a good thing, he sounds like he was horrible to you and you WILL find someone who will treat you so much better.|`|8nFATCClaa	Im sorry girl.<br>  Its sounds like it is a good thing that this relationship has been layed to rest. You never want to put yourself in harms way or even deserve to be told hateful things. I say today. Grab some of your supporting friends, get a tube of cookie dough and ice cream and watch some movies. I dont think it is a good idea to make this relationship work. <br>  Trust me, they never change.|`|iWhduaB3aa	spend time with ur friends<br>  keep urself busy|`|dV2DFXi6aa	sorry to hear that gurl... but i would just say that as early as now and the damage is not that big yet then maybe its time to say goodbye to the almost 2 years relationship that nothing brought you but only the hurtful things (also experienced that).. don't waste your time to that person that doesn't know your importance at all, after all that is not your lost.<br>  <br>  I know that really hurts and take time or a lot of time to recover the pain but prefer to have it rather than keeping the person for the rest of your life which only makes you nothing but a TRASH, he doesn't respect you at all! <br>  <br>  Just help yourself too. Make your life busy. Go out with your friends and have fun. Life is very wonderful! And most important don't ever forget to pray and ask guidance for our LORD JESUS CHRIST, surely HE is the only one who would help you easing the pain right now..|`|BbT3DCHvaa	Keep yourself busy. Answer questions on Yahoo, go out with friends and family, take up a new hobby or spend time on your favorite hobby. Time is going to be the only thing that will truly help. In the mean time stay busy. Good luck!|`|rvSrjNeQaa	Tell him all the things and say that ....if he will not do right all the things !!

TJezsCkHaa	don't think about it.Let him go and try to find the right guy.
FIMGjA4Waa	i think u should give them another chance....maybe they really did try to find u but couldn't...don't always jump to conclusions...since they couldn't find u, maybe they thought u went home or something.|`|chcTruKDaa	When u say u join the group...does that mean uninvited or did they call u to go along?....Also, were they trying to lose u...???<br>  This all depends if they were sincere or are u just paranoid & insecure about your friendship with them.<br>  And...would your frat bros called u when they realised u were not with them...????
CkzY5TzQaa	Honestly, sit him down and talk to him.  Pour your heart out to him. Let him know how you feel!  Be rational about it.  Be prepared for him telling you how he feels when you treat his GF this way or that way, which is fine, because you want to talk to your father about his feelings...it's only right for him to talk to you about his.<br>  <br>  You only have one father, don't let his GF take away yours and his relationship.<br>  <br>  My dad passed away 6 years ago...I could only wish I had the problems your having with your dad.<br>  <br>  Be the strong and good person and just be open and honest with your dad about everything.  It will work out just fine. Trust me!|`|ise05jjUaa	Well if I were to make my decision based on this story just from what you said I would suggest moving in with your mother.  On the other hand there's 3 sides to a story, yours, theirs & the truth so I can't really make a judgment as to who's wrong & who's right.  Just from what you've said & based solely on your statement I'd say to move in with your mom.|`|XN0sRoqpaa	your dad doesnt seem fit to be a dad...|`|08ecd8b76e95de5e722d935f06309747aa	i don't know. i was never in that type of situation but my fiance has been and friends I know have. they either would never get along, some found ways to reconcile, and some just had to move somewhere they thought would be best for them. if your dad did that, I'm sorry to say, that act was just as pathetic as what she's doing. it is obvious that you see that she seperating you and your sister from her two kids, which is the first no-no when it comes to dating people with outside children, let alone marrying them. this is why so many people have problems with most of those types of relationships. your dad needs 2 see if she is disrespecting his kids that she is not respecting him. hopefully they will not get married to the woman. If so, and if she and your dad plan on being together for a long time, I would suggest you try and sit down and have a mature conversation with your dad and his girlfriend. just because he is your dad and she's old enough to be your mother, doesn't mean that the child cannot play the bigger person in the matter. play the bigger person and try to talk it out first, and if that doesn't work, like I said, I hope he see's the light and doesn't marry her. you need people who have kids from other people to be supportive of one another and treat each other equally, and she doesn't fit that requirements. If u can get along with your mother I would suggest trying to live with her if you feel she is best for you|`|nOrWOZU4aa	Men (dads) tend to side with the girlfriends for a number of reasons, one is the woman tends to do all the cooking and cleaning and child care and the men are so glad to hand all those jobs over and not have to anymore, so they aren't going to screw that up.  Two, is that if he doesn't side with her, then she won't be happy,and she'll make his life miserable and not have sex with him (besides the cooking and cleaning). There will be no easy solution, can you just stay with your mom.  Hey, if she is really nasty when dad is not home, get that on video tape somehow.|`|DImdZYs6aa	record the last time she was talking any kind of bad thing about your dad or about the whole family (if he cares about u guys) and don't show it to her and give the recorder or the mobile to your dad when she is not there or don't care about them you and your sister go and live with your mom somewhere else like your best friend's house or you mom's sister's house or something like that.|`|3reHk4I1aa	i think that you should confront your dad and tell him how you feel and if he says its not true then bring evidence that it is true. like say how his girlfriends kids never do chores and how you think that is unfair. say that they should be at least split (the chore list) JUST TRY AND IGNORE THE EVIL GIRLFRIEND thats what i would do|`|M6s3jNw6aa	You could..<br>  1.) Talk to him.<br>  2.) bomb their house.<br>  or 3.) have his girlfriend mysteriously disappear.. heh..

After a month or so, she might leave and you'll never have too see her again.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	I feel for you, and if you can just stay with your mom. I really do not want to say it like this, but it is apparent that your father has chosen who to care about and has taken sides. Again I am sorry for the loss of a father.
8b1f5a61d96bdbd24c4cdb756cf6fbbbaa	yes very i sat in my basement sharpening a knife while my sister sat next to her boyfriend then i saw her and her boyfriend walking and i saw she had a hicky i threatened to kill him many times now that i tink about it i had to have my friends hold me back a few times|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	f____________uck yea...she better not be dating no mexicans or big lipped black dudes....white or asian is all she can...**** the rest of those losers...my sister dates dudes with a future...and not in prison.....|`|shpzCyU3aa	i do when it comes to her safety and knowing that she is not with some dumb loser because i always tell her if the guy she is with is a *** because i dont want that fool at my house if he is going to be a loser. also i make sure they do anything bad and that my sister knows i always have her back if she ever needs help.|`|0xGtNdveaa	I dont have a sister, but i would answer yes anyway.

Your ex bestfriend could have only hooked up with all those other girls because he was just lonely and needed comfort. There is no way of knowing wheter he does love you or just needs somone to comfort him again. In my opinion you can be supportive to him as he is going through a rough time, however i wouldnt leave my boyfriend just because my ex wanted me back. follow your heart. Remember god is love and god loves you anyway.|`|AA12346188	Either join him and share love.<br>  or<br>  ignore the ex and continue your present love.|`|csBvaXjiaa	He got angry because what you told him was the truth and he knew it.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your boyfriend and don't give your ex another thought.
iOa7rriGaa	Well it shouldn't matter unless your superficial which you seem to be but when you really really like someone none of that matters because none of it's important. If you like her go for it fu*k what people say as long as your happy that's what's important.

I'll rather watch Star Wars movies or repeats of Buffy the Vampire Slayer than go out every week to a party.If you like her, you'll be real tempted to date her. If you don't have the temptation to be her boyfriend, then don't worry about it till another girl does.|`|TF9hZZxYaa	Ask her out and get to know her for few times, and if u dont know if she is cute take a picture of her next to u and ask the opinion of ur friends. don't forget to smell her maybe u wont like what she smells in the first place ;)<br>  <br>  gooood luk|`|LvWgMLEGaa	Okay so your question is....|`|9cBAUMnNaa	Sounds like you like her and the rest doesn't matter unless you're a shallow prick.

It is a very rare happening, but when it happens, other people come in and it becomes a gang rape. Gang rapes have been known to cure Alzheimers, arthritis, and super colds. Super colds have been known to tear a person apart inside out. Now super colds have also been known to cause new age cancer. New age cancer once tore a mans arm off.|`|rFxLHqQFaa	Yup a couple of them in fact.<br>  <br>  The fun part is when they realized it happened to both of them.|`|0QeCiROYaa	i wish i could do that, umm take that shower again.|`|bG5OYjqfaa	fapfapfapfapfap|`|qpb8l4Mkaa	Ok.... dont go into too much detail please.<br>  <br>  And was this a question? <br>  <br>  Or a sick statement?|`|K8wDgNwbaa	nice. cant say that i have though|`|yv7qSugfaa	WOW.<br>  ahahahah that would SUCK<br>  if ur mom found out...<br>  bwahaha|`|s564PQUHaa	damn that is pretty good my bro. niiiiiiiiiiiiiiceeeeeeeee. 3 pts from full court|`|9u9ys7g9aa	Lucky..

ZqFzJ2L8aa	Here are exmples of Asian men and Hispanic/Latin girls:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-qBNPYWKrU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-qBNPYWK...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this gives you an idea of who Asian men are dating?<br>  <br>  I'm Asian and I think you're very pretty! :) <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7e4jxj3Daa	I feel the same about Asian women. I know how you feel.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Why??|`|UY4P6UFxaa	It depends.. although i always see asian guys with an asian girl..|`|8SRjELNBaa	im half asian, if it matters... <br>  <br>  smart girls will usually do... and you've got to be able to impress our Asian mother's... that's about it.|`|b91d5a63816ce3a9cce952ee2d7b3cf6aa	All Asian guys love Latina girls.|`|9977764272d89791dbe653655d661597aa	Uh, no matter what everyone's tastes are different. <br>  I'm an Asian so I can give my view, but that's about it<br>  <br>  Caucasian, with a little paler skin than usual, not tiny eyes, average body weight and build (not too muscular or fat, but not anorexic or bony..)<br>  long dark hair, shorter than me, cleavage, smaller than average butt ;o<br>  <br>  <br>  So those are my preferences. Though, I think I've noticed that, going with the commercials i see on TV and most couples, I would put it very generally at:<br>  Shorter than the guy, dark hair, white/very pale skin, pretty skinny, petite, cute personality, and that's all i can think up.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever this is for!<br>  <br>  <br>  And, yes take into account Amar's suggestion.<br>  Very traditional chinese guys will be shy and listen to their parents and so be traditional and only date chinese girls. Even go as far as to say the same minority group within chinese.|`|Qzhb7zYEaa	our parents would kill us if they found out we were dating outside of our race. Sorry, but we need to wait for the older generation to die off before we can begin interracial dating because parents are too tied to traditions.<br>  <br>  <br>  Trusssst, its not just pure 'outside-of-race' we're talking small variations within our own kind. Example: Vietnamese and Korean. HUGE diff<br>  <br>  <br>  idk, i just dont think you would understand.|`|ZvT8kEk2aa	i like skinny girls. long arms long legs. long narrow nose. dark skin like mestisas, indians, egyptians, greek, middle eastners. brunette. arabian eyes (many hispanic people gots the arabian thing going on around their eyes so yous hotts). big eyes. toned abs is ok but a little chub is hott too.|`|G9ROTb9eaa	not trying to sterotype or anything but i have a lot of asian friends ( korean, chinese )and they do have a specific type they like.<br>  no specific race, but they defintely like skinny girls with pale skin. <br>  also big eyes! they like the innocent doe eyed look. lol|`|sZ2CDOdwaa	OK I'll answer this question for you too then<br>  <br>  I don't really have high standards I'm attracted to nice, sweet girls. She doesn't have to be the prettiest girl alive but I'm a sucker for brunettes.|`|MmjGvTSfaa	As an asian guy, I really like white/hispanic girls.  I think cuban counts as white.  Then again, it depends on how you look like, not your ethnicity.|`|t6azk5sUaa	Asian girls not white girls!!|`|T2NK9u9maa	im not going to waste my time answering you... or am i????|`|fBJ89X7yaa	Hey Asians will like more genuine relationships. To asian men the vital fact is they will wish you love them alone or if you did love someone else too previously it should be a matter of the past and you should be repenting for your actions and keep saying you feel hurt and that you should have met this guy in the first place!! Oohh and all!<br>  <br>  Simple they want woman to be genuine with them and love them alone.<br>  Well they expect their woman to be someone any man of equal status or the guy next down will also fall in love with. That is you are someone who everyone else also feels "Kaash she marries me!"<br>  <br>  However villianic or negative in character an Asian will always have in some corner of his heart a desire to marry his woman for sure! The problem is he is too choosy of his woman!<br>  <br>  Well very few asians will marry or be interested in white because of the obvious skin colour that becomes an automatic unwanted attention that invades his privacy. Well any other skin tone cuban. mexican upto negro or even french is ok for them. They have the emotional card that is more important.<br>  <br>  They will prefer you only thing is being a virgin will be a top priority! Next they wont run after love unless they know its genuine!<br>  Next if financial status is a matter of concern you should be able to travel to meet them in the first place! These chaps are good in the soul but feel hurt when they are not able to earn, they are not necessarily materialistic or money mined they are realistic.<br>  <br>  An asian also has western influence and tendency to cheat but they often fall for sentiments! But if they are unruly they are the devils.<br>  <br>  An Asian male is more concerned of his family. Its about how much you could woo him and how much he is attached to the family. And if you can win his heart the next thing is how genuinely and caringly will you be able to handle his family and win their praise. Especially the Asian Mother In laws are tough to accept someone new.  Its the affection between the mother and his grown up son that could be envious and irritating yet you will love marrying an Asian just because when you have a girl or a boy you can see that love in reflection its too good! Only thing never let western influence it kills the spirit and mind.|`|nn23p1pSaa	well, a hot girl is a hot girl regardless of race, however, i do prefer:<br>  Latina girls: especially with a Spanish accent, great body, chocolaty eyes, nice booty, great hair, etc.<br>  Black girls: especially with a great face<br>  it all depends on the girl and definitely depends on personality. if she's a b****, then she wouldn't be THAT attractive. i just like any girl regardless of race ....... and you're sexy too!|`|C3cH7RALaa	almost every asian guy from any country wish for white skin<br>  but the most importnat things abt them they don't care<br>  any race<br>  any color<br>  any language<br>  any religion<br>  any country<br>  any size<br>  any figure<br>  any nature<br>  BUT THEY PREFER ANY RELATION INCLUDING SEX TOO WITH EMOTIONS KEEPING FAMILY THINGS IN MIND.|`|VN3R0I5Oaa	Asian Girls.|`|Pfv67jMQaa	haiii,,please go to www.aspirasicyber.com/percuma/index.php?...|`|6pu9jNZ1aa	having a bigger penis|`|Yl0sWkaDaa	white skin,big boobs,pretty face|`|ls5uUgx8aa	whats wrong with some white guys
hLSIRDtZaa	You've got testosterone in you. You have the male gene. Which means you're not down with the emotions that women generate and you don't deal with them because women compete amongst themselves and talk behind each other's backs and have jealousies. You are a rare woman, you should be very proud. You do not have the evil female spirit that most females have...jealousies, bitterness, fighting, no confidence in themselves, not feeling pretty. You have a rare spirit, you have the male gene, or masculine spirit! That's great, you have peace with yourself. You should be very proud I wish more women could be like us men.|`|bgtNYOp5aa	yeah, well you just hang out with guys, you need to hang out with girls and guys, because the only thing those guys care about is getting into your pants, and you don't see it.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's how you look, dress and act - you should look at yourself.|`|vjqXsVRnaa	Hi <br>  yep I've had the same thing since thirteen their just jealous so learn to laugh at them<br>  most of my friend are male and I have seen every single one of them naked so imagine how much of a sl*t I must appear, truth is I am a naturist I don't have a permanent partner because I'm always on the move so do I have to re-frame from sex to avoid being called a sl*t <br>  <br>  laugh at them their jealousy is showing|`|6vgTVPtEaa	who cares what the others say as long as u kno who u r then ur fine and yea i agree guys are alot easier to hang out with cuz they wont start anything with u and they are maybe jealous that u hang out with more guys then girls|`|bacgwHhOaa	ignore them....|`|Rj7L1Rc6aa	who cares what they think|`|vTXwiaFZaa	It's natural for most girls to think that. I used to hang out with only guys in Intermediate (but one girl) but I've never been called a "slut".<br>  <br>  Just ignore what everyone is saying about you because you have a boyfriend who loves you, guy friends and family. Who could ask for more?<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with having guy as friends only.|`|BddRfJ2caa	its totally natural to hang with guys, who the hell cares about what they think. Besides, guys are way easier to talk to, there isn't that much gossip and when you tell then your secrets to them and they won't tell anyone else, big difference between guys and gals.|`|HbWMeRbVaa	I beleive they are just jealous that they cant get that many guys to hang around them.|`|A91tV4P5aa	they all wish they were YOU|`|EatzEjhiaa	it bothers them because you get along with the guys. their problem. That whole men from mars women from venus thing, maybe true for many people, but some of us are from pluto and jupiter i think. As a guy, I'm usually attracted to the girls like you, speak the same language, less hidden meaning, don't think everything i say has a hidden meaning, less drama. As long as your boy friend is cool with you being one of the guys (and he prob'ly likes you because of it), then let the other girls be jealous, they'll grow up one day. And his friends' girls need to be woman enough not to think you're stealing their man.<br>  <br>  and that comment about look at yourself and how you dress, don't date that guy.
szVvf7Nkaa	Yes, you are too young. You need to finish your education and then  get a job. You need to do this so you can be an independent woman. You need to be able to support you and not have someone support you. You were very young when you met this guy and you are still too young to marry him. He also needs to finish his education and then get a good job. You have plenty of time to get married. If your relationship is that serious then you will still be together in a few years from now.|`|32QCv0l1aa	yeah, I think it's really too young! I'm only a year older than you, so I can relate. Plus I've been in a long term relationship that lasted four years, and we were infatuated with each other REALLY badly, thought we were going to get married, have kids and the perfect family, live the perfect life and be the happiest people in the world!!! <br>  <br>  But it ended when I was 17 because we both began growing up! It seems so simple yet hard to understand, but it's the truth! Our lives were actually about to begin. We were off to college, got to know amazing new people, and just starting living our lives to the full!<br>  <br>  So bottom line is... I think it's too young for you to marry, even if it's getting quite serious because you both still have a lot of growing up to do and as much as you might believe that it's true love (it MIGHT be), it still might not be. Either way though, WAIT until you're both in yout MID TO LATE TWENTIES (ideally) to get married, but some people do it in their early twenties as well. But overall, I really think you should wait.|`|0cfba6ec58258d9277443cf769413b9eaa	YES YES YES if you love each other then wait a couple of years it will make a world of difference|`|8IfePMa3aa	Of course. People that get married under the age of 25 have a 95% divorce rate for a reason.|`|c6cd26c5768fb4905d753985f39626fdaa	way too young|`|t6azk5sUaa	YES!|`|AKc8EaKTaa	well hass he proposed? have both of you talked about the prospect of marriage and how you two would go about living the live of a married couple? would you two be able to support and talk finances on common ground? im 17 and engaged to be married next year, and there are alot of factors you must consider. the majority of young marriages dont end well, but of course there is always the exception. but if you are questioning your age too much and being accepted by society and your parents, dont get married. you prolly arent ready if you are not ready for financial and emotional commitment to be able to support eachother.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Sorry this is going to be a long answer, but hopefully you take the time to read it and let it sink in. <br>  <br>  What foods to you love to eat? Well, say goodbye to them because your new favorites will be cheap mac n cheese out of the box or ramen noodles every day. See those nice teeth you have? Well, you don't be able to afford a dentist, so enjoy watching them rot out. Enjoy wearing nice clothes? You better get used to shopping at the Salvation Army if you can even afford that. Like heat in the winter and air conditioning when it's hot? Well, there will be times when you'll be wearing layers to keep from freezing and other times when you'll have to live with the 90 some degree weather without air conditioning. Like a variety of tv channels? Well, you won't be able to afford cable. <br>  <br>  Love alone doesn't make for a happy married life. It's about being mature enough to accept each others faults and cope with annoying habits 24/7. Not only that but you need to be able to financially support yourselves.....and God forbid children if you plan to have them at an early age, which I sure hope you don't and that you're smart enough to use two forms of birth control. Marriage is A LOT of work just like you always hear us adults say, no matter what age you are when you get married or how "perfect" of a couple you think you are. The dynamics of a relationship change as soon as you say I do, even if you say you're not going to be like other married couples who lose the romance, nag each other, stress out and argue over little things, end up hating each other because of built up resentments and don't even like each other in the end. This is why there is a high divorce rate among people who marry young. Heck, the divorce rate is high at just about every age these days. Marriage is a serious step and not one to be taken at 17. Sorry. You are WAY too young.<br>  <br>  PLEASE WAIT and save yourself the torment that some of us have experienced from having to live and learn, instead of listen to good advice and taking our time to grown up!|`|508607ab41c5f2849e90ee5b3de45dd6aa	unfortunately caitlin, u r quite young. marriage isnt only abt white gowns, flowers, cake and living togetehr in one house. it mans lots of responsibilities on ur part- emotional, pysical and financial.do u think u r ready for all that commitment? also this is the time u should be thinking abt ur studies and college. because tahts a must for ur career and for the financial stability of ur future family.why dont u wait for atleast two more years before u think abt it.all the best to u.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I got married 4 months after I turned 18. I also got pregnant really quickly too which I don't advice. If you love one another, and you think you're adult enough to work out some serious issues, that I don't think so. Marriage is hard work, you can just leave whenever things get rough. Marriage tends to make things alot tougher too. Just make sure you keep your self up, finish high school, and enroll in college. Make sure you always keep your self in your mind. Don't just give up and be the housewife barefoot and pregnant.|`|QPVEL0NLaa	yes it is. A good age to marry is 50. Have as much fun as you can until 49 and then get engaged.|`|9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	Let me put it to you simply- YES|`|za2IxgALaa	marriage isn't fun as it all seems in the media, kid.|`|RPhla0R7aa	yes.|`|AA10250918	Seriously, what's the rush? It's just a legal document. Which isn't even necessary for most things. Think about this...it is VERY easy to get married, but if things don't work out in the long run it is very hard to get divorced. Plus, you're not even going to be the same person in 3 years. I promise you, you won't be. Grow together for now, and if you still want to get married in a few years, go for it. I suggest living together for awhile first to see how it works out. You NEVER really know a person until you live with them.|`|WKBVrHhbaa	I was engaged when I was 17, and then we broke up. Now that I look back, I'm really happy I didn't go through with it because he wasn't the right person for me, at the time I thought he was, but now I realize that we would've gotton divorced by now.<br>  <br>  If you two are meant to be, then waiting is ok. There's no need to rush. Wait it out, and see how you feel in a couple of years..you go through a lot of changes and your mind may change.|`|IRZWz2HIaa	Well depending on what state you live in your fine. In south carolina you can get married at age 15 w/o parent consent. And in Ga. Its 15 or 16 with parent consent. I am pretty sure 17 is fine though. In most states you are tried in court as and adult at age 17. So go get hitched, but i am not necessarily saying its a good idea, you are still pretty young.|`|3d77448e24819209feaeb0dc57c9dee4aa	I got married at 20 and now at 28 in the process of divorce ... Heck ya thats too young.  You don't even know whats out there.  Go live life have fun see whats out there. Then settle down if thats what you want.|`|Bv0v2nV0aa	Uh yeah...... who get's married at 17.. me and my bf were serious too at 17... guess what.... he started cheating on me in college... but I know, I know  yours would never do that.

6bQ8UX1eaa	hello :]<br>  well, i dont see any reason why he'd stop trusting you. unless something happened, but either way your going to have to find out and gain that trust back. maybe if you have his number randomly ring him and have a chat making it seem like you havent even noticed, this will make him a bit confused therefore trying to spend more time with you :] or just ask him have you lost the trust or if he's mad at you then if he isnt, he will feel bad so he will try and make it up to you. thats just how guys work xD.<br>  sorry i couldnt be much help as you could see on my question btw thanks for answering that ;D.<br>  goodluck [:|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	guess he didn't think you liked him as a boyfriend...<br>  <br>  sounds like he's looking to greener pastures...
n46fsdNZaa	Well it sounds like you have a problem if both do that stuff cuz they both really seem to like you.  I mean it couldn't hurt to ask them what they really think of you and depending on what they say you can change your response to why do you ask when they do|`|PKIZNeDfaa	Smash HIM..<br>  <br>  Simple, easy, fun, solves all your problems.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	maybe he just is messing around with you.
vTXwiaFZaa	I think it's nice that you're trying to help your friend and leaning more towards her disorder.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can talk to her parents? Pills to help her calm down and refrain from doing those things. I mean, I'm sure her parents should know what's going on in school if she is being disruptively to people in class.<br>  <br>  Hope that help! <3|`|pBnO8rDcaa	your in a tough spot..maybe you could talk to a teacher or school counselor about how to communicate with your friend considering her situation..Good luck.
7mxCMfYKaa	Who cares if they look down on you? Your suppose to be you because that who you are. Why change for other people? Ask whoever to chill or go do something and if they want to go drink tell them you dont drink. I dont either its pretty stupid IMO. I can have just as much fun being sober I dont need to be brought down to a level of retardation to have fun. But if they wont accept you for that they arent worth your time. And as for the girl why not talk to her whats the worst that could happen? I dont know if i can help with what to say..Complement her attire if you like it..ask for help if you need it. ask a random questions about a movie you want to see or something..tell her you think the teacher is a *** lol...It shouldnt be too hard.
EatzEjhiaa	wow. you can really tell what other peoples' past relationships were like by how they answered this. Don't know how to see the previous question, but just from what you wrote here, I think it's a huge leap to assume he's cheating, and a really big one to assume he's gay. He doesn't sound arrogant to me. sounds like he loves you very much, but thinks you can forget him easily. That may or may not be true, but sounds like it's what he was feeling when he said that. Don't know what went on with your inlaws, or if that is part of the problem. Sounds like you are having financial problems, maybe disagreements on the kid. Sounds like he might be depressed. Let him know you love him as much as he loves you. Let him know he can talk to you about anything and you will still love him that much.|`|vRc7ktcsaa	the reason maybe is:<br>  - he is giving up the marriage because of a problem that he does not want you to get involved<br>  - he is giving up the marriage because of a deal with someone that concerns you.<br>  <br>  saying the time 6 months or one year is very undesirable. that only means one thing, it is planned. there is a high possibility. that prediction is false in natural actions but it is possible if it is planned.|`|dFUqPcWKaa	I don't think he sounds arrogant at all.. I think it's his way of saying that he's loved you with everything he has, and he doesn't think there's another man out there who will mirror that. It sounds to me like he's put his all into your relationship and doesn't feel like he's received as much from you.|`|78U2kCuJaa	I told my ex ,I love you and you are special baby,but,Im out this house, the reason I was tired, of her so be ready before he leaves you hit the road, adios amigo|`|OhiNV9a4aa	Well then don't ask my worthless husband because he is a sorry excuse for one.|`|5PAP1hpSaa	Seems like your husbands a real asshole and hes messing with your head.Get away from this guy and his abbusive ways.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=374732" rel="nofollow">http://swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb...</a>|`|fjCxv2I4aa	Sounds like he is about to come out of the closet on you.im sorry you're having to go through this.|`|awzXuJMDaa	Don't know anything about your previous question but, he sounds to be a bit full of himself and that he thinks that he can never be replaced with someone else 'they'll never make you feel the same love that I make you feel' (and he's sad because he feels sorry for you)...com'on man you've GOT TO BE KIDDING...get over yourself. He thinks he's all that and a Rolls Royce. <br>  'they'll never love you the way I do and they'll never make you feel the same love that I make you feel'...Unless you have cheated on or hurt him and gave him reason to feel this way, sounds to me like he makes you feel like sh1t, what are you gonna miss?  If your lucky no one else will make you feel like he does. Get a good lawyer and move on.|`|r21PZteRaa	Well, my wife had suspected me of cheating, so she prosed the same proposition.  I didn't want to let her go but for the sake of the child, I knew it was the best for him.  My wife didn't know for sure but gave up on me anyway.  Only when I came to a soul searching conflict, I took the offer.  No, I haven't found anyone special, but I don't mind now.  The thought of doing things for my son keeps me busy.  We are friends now and I still care a lot for her.  My divorce saved my friendship.|`|krd8tq3Iaa	You do not need a man's answer.What u nees is some one who can relate to you.<br>  From what you said, I believe he does love you but there is something he isn't telling you. I believe that he is gay but he can't find it in him to tell you The truth. He loves you but not in the way you want him 2. Either way he doesn't seem faithful.

He sounds like a class act and I am really sorry you two are going through this tough time.|`|HCf73ZsEaa	You have failed him and he sees that giving up is the only answer.

I have so much Going on and i feel i am on a loosing battle with my whole life. And when i feel like that i just break down to a Boiling point where every littl ething bothers me.<br>  The other day I had a younf femal come into a store i was working at. She must have been around 18 at least real close maybe young. She came in with her bad attitude and asked for a pack of Cigerets. I asked for Her ID, She said she didn't have it but said I ID'd her the other day. I had informed if she didn't have her ID that i cant sell her her cigertes that i didn't remeber her and i don't know her so i can't sell them. She then started Cursing and i asked her with kindness to please calm down and quit with the perfanity i am only obey the law for tobaco sells. She then told be to ring up her F'ing pop i told her i will be happy to she started cursing keep in mind i ahd already asked her to stop currising and she continued to carry on. I told her That she can leave my register and but her Pop at another one or she can leave the store.. she chose to leave the store all while calling me a F'ing bucktooth B&*C%... And said i should be fired.... i then told her she needs to leave again and told her to take her attitude else where it isn't welcome here...<br>  I am wrong to refuse her the sale of her cig....Especialy if she looked maybe at the age of 18,, But yet acted like a rebelious 14 year old that need to be whiped and have her mouth washed out with soap.<br>  I think the Part that upset me the most was the Bucktooth part..<br>  Then today although this child was baby 6 if that asked me why my teet are so funny looking.. I kindly told him it was because everyone is made diferently and i was formed from a special mold...<br>  Where in al actuality in my mind i just wanted to go in the Bathroom and cry...<br>  I am so upset my blood preasure is sky rocketed i can't see straight, and my eyes can hardly focus.<br>  I just wish i new Why people have to point out people differnce wether it be someone to tall or skiiny fat or short buckteeth or no teet and just except people for who they are an pick out a feature in the person that is good compliment them make them feel better instead of make people feel like crap...<br>  What is weird was becuase of yesterdays cigeret girl today i dressed up to make my self feel better about myself and yet though a kid can point that same feature that mde me feel bad and just tear me up on the outside to make me feel no matter how i dress or do myelf up to look good i will always be an ugly buck tooth.<br>  I am sorry to be negative. I know God has made me this way for a reson. I just wish poeple could just accept me for my personality and abilities and not for what i look like.<br>  I know i am rambling and i am going to close with this thought,<br>  I know it is in the Scripture of the bible...

Good luck in life with not being able to stand up for yourself, I'm sure you'll need it.|`|hD5WSYbpaa	Judging is something that everyone does, I mean everyone. But there are some people that don't let it affect how the act. The others are just plain rude. I know what you are going through. I have these huge eyes that make people stare, you either love em' or hate em'. I used to get teased a lot about it. But then it sort of became who I was. I accepted it and eventually even began to like my eyes. Now I wouldn't change them for the world :]<br>  <br>  I think you are going through something similar. There will ALWAYS be people who judge you. You should accept your teeth and be confident about them. They are probably your best feature :] Other people just can't see the beauty in being individual.<br>  <br>  Cheer up, It will get better.
HqSmCLLsaa	No you aren't doing anything wrong by waiting, by waiting and respecting what she says you are showing trust and loyalty.  Just wait and if she doesn't come around like she says then well sadly she would have been lying to you but if she is what she says she is it should all work out.  Just have faith that she will be with you and it should work out fine. If you truly love her like you say then you'll wait and respect what she says, I would says you really don't want to push her to do anything she doesn't want to.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA10776535	Your a fool if you wait...sorry being honest here.

f31691c7cb556d0d74c032f9da6c3696aa	I think guys have the misconception that all women want kids, and generally I think most guys are more laid back then women are.  They'd rather just agree then argue. Plus they don't do any of the hard work (pregnancy, childbirth), and most of the time, the woman is the one who stays at home and raises the kids. <br>  <br>  Of course I'm just generalizing because personally I know a lot of friends who are also female who do not want kids.  I myself cannot ever imagine having one of those things!  Oy.|`|JqfIJtvYaa	I think it is all about sex, and they do or agree to whatever a woman wants to get it.

When most of us think of kids, we think of playing sports with them, or hobbies and things like that.   What we do not think of is taking care of them, such as feeding them, changing the diapers, or trying to get them to sleep, or cleaning up after them.   This is why I think it is important for kids to have both a father and a mother.|`|VN3R0I5Oaa	SEX, them seeing u naked will make them say anything.|`|U7ngD9kuaa	Because some men are f@#$king idiots!|`|Q16N9eQXaa	mostly because they love you and they want to show you that how much he loves you|`|pwcEvd4taa	because they dont care as long as they get in your pants|`|D3rw1C8faa	It's simple:  If they say they want kids too, then it means sex for them.  Girls can be so stupid when it comes to this.

Make sure there is somewhat of chance she will say yes<br>  Step 2. Start conversation with her, that can lead into the asking out (ex. do not talk about basketball, then suddenly say want t go out with me)<br>  Step 3. Transition into the asking out part (ex. You know, you are really pretty or something like that. Sorry its cheesy, but its late but you get the point of what to say)<br>  Step 4. Ask if you want to do something, then ask if you want to go. (ex. hey, i was wondering if you wanted to hang with me later this week, i was just wondering if you wanted to go out with me) This avoids your problem of having to make plans.

Getting to know someone, letting them into "you", just always be YOU and speak from your heart. sometimes you will tell them right then and there how you feel. sometimes it takes weeks.<br>  <br>  Don't calculate.

It's just that us women want them to prove it like they do in the movies.|`|vSAQqGa8aa	wwwhhhaaaattt???|`|uAZlvHgiaa	What are you talking about ?|`|Y9Hm6fYWaa	The girls obsess over it more and overanalyze everything. If I was on here when I was 14, I probably would have been doing the same thing. Too bad all these kids won't believe the people that tell them to stop worrying about it because nothing is going to last when you are 13, 14, or 15 years old. Probably would save them a lot of heartbreak lol.|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	go to university for 7 years studying psychology.<br>  <br>  <br>  but basically, girls generally know or can tell what the answer is just want back up and people to agree with them, INCASE they are wrong.'<br>  Guys on the other hand, generally keep to themselves with those sort of things|`|GokA3YGkaa	A perfect example... you pick up a Men's Fitness magazine and you see muscle stuff... articles about worksouts and reviews on things.. health technical talk....all about pumping iron and putting time into the gym<br>  <br>  You pick up a Women's Fitness magazine and you get some articles about workouts.. and some reviews.. but LOTS of makeup, and other cosmetic type products.. and tips on how to do nails.. etc.. totally not a hardcore health fitness magazine.<br>  <br>  I know a lot of women who get the men's fitness magazine for that reason.|`|JAUOeQZwaa	because girls like getting advice. and guys well they are not into this stuff. i mean you don't see guys looking at gossip magazines for advice on this love info.|`|gpCjrJFcaa	Because this 'HE' is a boy (i think) and boys only love girls.|`|SptqxavQaa	Huh?<br>  Who did that?|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Because we do the chasing so we either get the gold of get flat our rejected on the spot lol|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Because they're insecure and can't trust their boyfriends so they think random people on the internet can comfort them.. or something.
NB4h4jTyaa	Yes, you can get pregnant. Similar to the Rhythm Method (the only method of birth control sanctioned by the Catholic Church) and how people joke about Irish Catholics having so many kids due to it.<br>  <br>  He needs to get over it about the condoms. Get some Lifestyle Ultra-thin and he'll hardly know the difference.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Yes you can get pregnant this way. Pre-*** contains sperm so it doesn't matter where he ejaculates. You need to look up how your cycle works to understand when you are most fertile. Certain parts of the month are more fertile than others. If you don't want to get pregnant, keep using the condoms, he'll get over it!!|`|sGoEj6qsaa	No, that is not a good birth control method as you can still get pregnant doing that.|`|R62BrdISaa	Yes, pregnant you can be, it only takes one good swimmer. This is by far, one of the least effective forms of birth control. about the same odds as leaving it in, while ejaculating.|`|tEy9hvebaa	stop breastfeeding, go on the pill... say it's "Doctor's Orders"|`|HCf73ZsEaa	That's no big deal. We always have sex without a condom until I feel close to the moment. Normally I make my wife O first and then when it is my turn, I throw on the condom. Never have had any problems. And I can tell you, if I was to have an accident she would get preggy. We planned our son and it only took ONE cycle (month) for her to get preggy. Been doing this technique for 2 1/2 years and no problem!|`|1fp5edReaa	you can, because there's always pre-***...|`|AA10250918	I got pregnant with my daughter using the "pullout method". In other words, it does NOT work. I think the statistics are around 50% for the chance of getting pregnant from pulling out. Which is close the the percentage for not using any form of BC at all!!! <br>  <br>  If you don't want to have another baby right now, DON'T. Otherwise you may have resentment towards your BF or even your baby!|`|OojlfDlBaa	There is a risk of getting pregnant with the pull-out method. My best advice to you is to monitor your ovulation and completely avoid having sex during that week. Also, I would talk to your OBGYN about Mirena. I don't know if it is best when breastfeeding but I had it and it worked wonderfully for me (no period either which is always a plus! lol). It works for up to five years and can be removed at anytime. It's painless and if you want another baby again one day it takes about a year for you to get pregnant again.|`|aCMkyR3saa	yep you can definatley get pregnant but i have a 3 years old and never been on birth control and we dont use condoms never have he pulls out  when we wanted to have a baby we did(which was 3years ago) but i better shut up before i jinks myself lol <br>  <br>  you let him have it without a condom men HATE condoms now hes going to try to slip in without one every time|`|twlqaZSmaa	have you told your boyfriend you don't want to have another child? in my opinion, the pull out method leaves it completely up the the guy (he knows when he's about to come, he pulls out before). the fact that your boyfriend WANTS you to get pregnant doesn't leave you much control in the situation. in addition to that, it's hard for a guy to pull out without ejaculating to some extent.<br>  <br>  bottom line, if he loves you, he should wear a condom, no question. and he should respect your decision to not want another baby. you should be thinking about how to strengthen your relationship with your baby, not how to make your partner who won't respect your wishes feel pleasure. do something for you, not him.
sSEy6KYiaa	If you are going to have unprotected sex then there is a VERY HIGH chance you will get pregnant. Pulling out prior to ejaculation is NOT a guaranteed way of avoiding pregnancy.<br>  <br>  If you don't want another kid just yet DON'T HAVE SEX.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Indeed, you can get pregnant using the "pull out quick" - method. Some semen arrives well ahead of the full ejaculation.  Why not get the "morning after pill"? How is that the BF has so much say? If he wants to have a say then let him say:  Will you marry me? If not then dump him.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Yes, you can still become pregnant..although you mad him pull out, there's a such thing as pre *** that can still end up getting you pregnant.The best thing to do, is to talk to him and let him know how you feel so hopefully he'll respect what you want and wait and stop making it be all about what he wants..good luck|`|ZzGLotRVaa	it is not safe. There are so many things that could happen during this that could easily get you pregnant. He could not pull out in time or mess up there is no guarantee with it. Condoms however are much better. They prevent it for the most part.|`|DUMYQ3Sgaa	ok well u can most def still get pregnant by pre *** sometimes the man dose not know that he is pre cumming and that pullout thing dose not prevent u from still getting pregnant i would still make him use a condom or you will have another kid on the way|`|2PDBxlYDaa	I'm an only child and let me just say  that I didn't need siblings growing up. My parents made sure that I was a social child and I always had plenty of friends growing up. Don't buy into the stereotype of the lonely only child. Its your body. Your child will make his/her own friends and they will be fine. A child does not always need a sibling.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I do wonder what it would have been like to have had a sibling but I don't cry over it. My parents made sure to spend time with me, I always had friends growing up, and things were generally pleasant. I don't want kids but if I ever did, I would have just one. I feel one child is enough work.<br>  <br>  Plus you as a person need your own identity apart from being a mother and a partner to your boyfriend. Your boyfriend also needs his own time and his own identity apart from being a father and from being your boyfriend. If you and your boyfriend can't agree on long-term life goals then go to counseling and if worst comes to worst then break up.<br>  <br>  Its best to break up than have a 2nd child that will be too much for the both of you to handle. Also you don't want to have children that end up resenting you. Be strong and stick to your guns.|`|U1yKUVbTaa	HI,<br>  Dont listen to your boyfriend, let him use a condom untill the baby is around 3 years old, if he has no sense of humor and doesnt think about how you feel then dump him he doesnt deserve you.<br>  You made a big mistake having not protected sex. Wait till your old enough and tlk to your boyfreind about having babies.|`|ed2eaa664004508e17d06df55367f0f7aa	Absolutely not safe !!!!!!!!!! figure out another way be smart just wanting a baby is not a good reason to have one be strong stay with your beliefs there is plenty of time to have another child if you decide to have one|`|lTsONvwQaa	yes you can still get pregnant this way you should keep using condoms till you can take the pill again... tell him your just not ready for another child|`|VN3R0I5Oaa	yes u can get pregnant he might not pull out in time or little may come out without him knowing ANYTHING is possible when ur not safe.|`|nktIqi6raa	you can still get prego from the withdraw method.|`|iF6ThEw8aa	you can still get pregnant. Im 100% on that|`|LF7UnoOhaa	try a coat hanger and a chopstick when ever my girl gets preggers i hop her up on meth, push er down some stairs and beat her stomach!|`|7XjCbcRCaa	i dont really know what to say about the staying not pregnant thing but as for pulling out being effective this is what ive heard/researched as it is my method of choice...it is still possible to become pregnant but it is slim. basically, if the male has ejaculated within the last 72 hours than some sperm (not many) may still remain and end up in you during sex because of the precum. i dont know if that made any sense, but basically as long as he pulls out in time, your chances are pretty slim.|`|5RhY95Jnaa	the pull out method does not work all the time.<br>  I also have a daughter. She's two.<br>  I know how you feel.<br>  I want another baby, but not quite yet.<br>  If you don't want another baby, he shouldn't pressure you into it. But you should go on the pill when you daughter is no longer being breastfed.<br>  But if it's just that you don't want to carry another baby, or go through pregnancy again, Adoption can be an option, if you and your boyfriend agree.<br>  But i don't know if thats what is how you feel.<br>  I hope this helped you.<33<br>  Goodluck sweetheart.|`|ARjxwkHSaa	Ugh, most of these people's answers are useless...Yes, you can get pregnant by pre-***; just because he pulls out doesn't mean that he already put sperm inside you. Chances are slimmer, but there is still a chance.<br>  <br>  Try talking it over with him, or if you still don't see eye to eye, make him wear condoms. They too, are not 100% effective, but they are better than pulling out.|`|kTIV6To3aa	This is not safe. Though the probability of getting pregnant this way is low, the risk is still a LOT higher than using condoms. Several problems is if he does not pull out in time, he risks ejaculating inside of you and that is the point of not return. Another risk is that pre-ejaculatory fluid (pre-***) is excreted from his penis even before he ejaculates and even though it is a drop or two of fluid, it contains millions of potential fertile sperm that could find their way to your unfertilized egg.<br>  -JM
AA11263103	how about study and get off the PS3 and then your grades are up your dad will let play more !! Gasp!! duh|`|UmtOV8mRaa	Instead of thinking of ways on how to play, think of ways on how to stop yourself. It would be better for you to study than to play. He is doing so since he cares about you and also because he doesn't want the money he worked hard for go to waste. He's developing self-control in you. I have the same case with my mom and we made a deal. Our deal was that I can't play or watch TV during school days and on weekends if I have lots of homework. But, I can if my grades were good and only on Friday nights. That's about 3 hrs on Friday and a few at weekends w/o homework.<br>  <br>  My point is, gain a control of yourself, not on your dad and understand him. <br>  <br>  On your sister, make her stop by telling her on your parents. Tell them the mistakes your sister did and tell them it's unfair for you that they treat you differently from her.|`|xutAEx7Faa	get a social life..  go out with your friends on the weekend and party and have fun, your still young so take advantage of it, dont stay home and waste your youthfull teen years away playing a video game.|`|5OxqWaGjaa	your dad just wants whats best for you. believe me i hav a similar situation as i am doing yr12 atm.<br>  but the best way is to ignore him. say for like a week you do what ur suppose to like no games mon-fri and then surprise him and then be like since i did well can i....and ask whateve it is you want and use it as a barginning tool. but if you wanna get back at your sister...try and catch her doing something bad then blackmail her !<br>  i always use to do it ;P<br>  <br>  anyway goodluck<br>  hope it all works out:)|`|CkzY5TzQaa	Your 14, you don't understand where your dad is coming from.<br>  <br>  I'm 29, used to be 14, been in your position.  My dad always wanted me to study, study, study. I wasn't allowed to go out mon-fri, nor talk on the phone.  I had to study for at least 2 hours a night.  Honestly, I didn't really study for 2-3 hours, I pretty much just sat there and stared off into space...LOL.  But honestly, your dad is looking out for your own best interest.  He wants you to be the best that you can be.  He figures if you spent as much time studying as you do playing video games....that you will excell more in your life. <br>  <br>  My brother's were both video game freaks, my dad got on the two of them all the time about it.  My one brother failed out of college, he's 34 and works full time at a grocery store stocking shelves and his free time devotes to video games.  My other brother has an associates degree, masters degree and has an awesome job working for the government.  His free time...he actually is an online professor for an online school, and does other things to pre occupy his time...he does play video games...but certainly not as much as my other brother.<br>  <br>  Point being:  Which one of my brother's would you rather be?  <br>  <br>  Is it worth putting more time into video games than studying when looking into the future?<br>  <br>  Your dad is looking out for you and only you.  Strive to be the best that you can be.<br>  <br>  Love you dad now while you got him to love. My dad passed away 6 years ago...I wish he was here now to push me to be my best....
XuoT57Idaa	You are dying to give it to him so I would just go ahead. Tell him you thought of waiting for your 6mo anniversary but wanted him to know how much you love him.<br>  <br>  Stay away from your mother. She sounds toxic, plus when you marry, your loyalty is to each other first before anyone else. The gift sounds great!|`|508607ab41c5f2849e90ee5b3de45dd6aa	its another 6 months to go before ur aniversary. since u r soo creative, u can easily come up with better ideas then. what i feel is why dont u give the gift to him in two days.give him the gift tmrw itself if he is not still reeling from the fight with ur mother. if possible send it to his workplace or leave it by it bedside where he will find it waiting for him.That  will be the prefect way of telling him taht in spite of all the troubles u love him and his love for u is what makes ur marriage click.once again, i really loved ur gift. keep it up.|`|OhiNV9a4aa	You're giving your husband a 6 month anniversary gift?<br>  I feel really sorry for him.<br>  By the way my own husband sucks royally and I wouldn't buy him something if it was our 50th anniversary.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	Since an anniversary is 'annual', I see no reason not to give it to him now. <br>  <br>  Your mom will always be your mom, but you and your husband chose each other. As long as you stand by each other, you will be successful. Your mom may or may not come to appreciate him, but let her know that you will not tolerate her disrespecting him. <br>  <br>  Good for you!
dba6798daedd01dcb233c8a115096ed5aa	Yeah, I think that was quite rude of them to do that. How old are you? It doesn't matter though because that's invasion of privacy. I'd feel just as upset.|`|Wt3t6rUPaa	Yes i think that is pretty rude and an invasion of your privacy!  Have they got a genuine reason to be worried about you?  If  you have not given them a reason to worry then they should give you the benefit of the doubt and trust you!!!  That is the same as you opening and reading their mail.  You are a human being and even if they are your parents they should respect you!!    And if they don't like it you should let them read some of the answers to this question...I'm sure you will have some support here.|`|eVubSKcEaa	Tell them coolly that you are now not a kid. U are responsible.. Tell them not to worry.<br>  When they feel that you are mature they won't keep a check on you..<br>  Till then, tolerate them...|`|3EM66IWFaa	Nothing wrong in your parents. I think your parents checking daily news papers and TV news and aware of recent happenings here and there. So they are all ways anxious about their kid whether he is moving in the right path or not.|`|DZvhiX8Raa	tell them your responsible enogh to have a myspace if your a good kid they would say yes|`|nHoMzYQ3aa	I am a mother of 2 little girls under 5. I'm also a young mother (25) and have always been a very independent, private person, especially when I was coming into my own as a teenager.<br>  <br>  So coming from both perspectives, I do agree that its very hurtful when parents invade your space, even when they have good intensions. Tell them exactly how your feel about it. Show them that you are mature and responsible, and tell them exactly what you plan to do with a Myspace, and exactly what you will NOT do with a Myspace.<br>  <br>  I know that if my daughters approached me in this way, not only would I be proud but I would have more respect for them and their personal life.<br>  Good luck sweetie!
5agXk9ldaa	i thin your question is related to trust!?<br>  if yea i think every body lies to their bosses to go for a party or something, so don't worry. Ask her but be sure first that she is not dating or something<br>  good luck|`|htpxHZTPaa	Ask her out, i mean she really did nothing wrong to you. Uuuh and her skiping work is between her and her boss or whatever. It all depends on if you can deel with that and her using you like that, or the fact that you "really like" her. <br>  <br>  ~Heir Music|`|YnsG3pXraa	First in these hard times protect your job and your integrity.  Lay back, don't bring it up at all, don't ask other people about it!  Do your job and treat her like everyone else.  Eventually through the grape vine you will get the truth.  Keep your ears open and your mouth shut about the whole thing.  Be fair to her about work related things. If you do find out she lied WITHOUT confronting her, the next time she tries it beware and let her know that U know what she did.  Tell her about her responsibilities with the job and that you will take action if it happens again.  Getting involved w/co-workers doesn't usually pay.|`|Qv1zeDFvaa	Is this work related?<br>  Are you her manager?<br>  Do you not want to ask her cause she lied to go to a party?<br>  Sorry but the question is a little confusing my friend...|`|racnq84Vaa	I think that he made an assumption based on what he thought and not what he knew.

By definition, a hero is: a man of distinguished courage or ability, admired for his brave deeds and noble qualities. <br>  <br>  I think the key thing here is 'noble qualities'.  Things like chivalry, honesty, integrity and having the strength to do the right thing even though it's the harder thing to do in a situation are what you should be aiming for.  So many people think that it's about saving people from drowning planes but it's not.  Heroes are people that do things for NO recognition.  It's the act of good that motivates them to do so. <br>  <br>  If you REALLY want to be a hero, then volunteer for a charity.

Personally, I would be upset if my fiancee fantasized about other guys during sex, and it WOULD bother me if she fantasized about girls, because I'd feel like she thinks I'm not good enough.  But it would also turn me on.  NO its NOT like cheating.  its only thoughts, and you don't intend or WANT to act on them, so its perfectly fine.  There's nothing wrong with you.<br>  <br>  Try this: ask him if its okay to have a 3some with another girl and watch his face.  I am the strongest believer in STRICTLY MONOGAMOUS lifetimes, but I would say yes so fast if she asked me that.  Really though, its fine, and if your boyfriend gets mad at you for it, he's an idiot.  Even guys do that.  Fantasize about others I mean.  Its natural.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	No, we all do it, it's nothing wrong with having fantasies..just don't call out her name while your doing it or you might have some problems.|`|aVGnsATJaa	first off you gave me a ***** while reading this, second i think it is  just normal becaue i mean when you think about or have sex everyone kinda wonders with there thoughts. it happens with me too but i dont imagine about guys but i imagine about different things with girls i dont know if that helped or not but i tried ....lolz|`|AA10347643	Its your age which is carrying you away. Keep your mind in control. What are you studying??? Pay attention towards your studies too. Dont involve too much in such activities because you need to work also for yourself.|`|qpb8l4Mkaa	You need to seriously contemplate your sexuality|`|urQnRQ4jaa	At least to me its cheating of the mind...on another note there is nothing wrong with you its actually common for girls to think about girls when they are having sex...in your case you are use to thinking about it and is doesn't help that you have experimented also because you know what it feels like when a girl goes down on you...I would just say if you want to change that about yourself train yourself to think about your boyfriend...you can do that through self pleasure...hope that helps...|`|NRXL5fP5aa	I personally don't think there is anything wrong with what you're doing. Everyone fantasizes. It doesn't necessarily mean you want a physical relationship with a girl. The thought of it just happens to excite you and as a result heightens your sexual pleasure with your boyfriend. Stop worrying so much you're fine and enjoy!!|`|Q3vY0r8yaa	its totally normal..i think..idk..i think you kinda want to be a lil more kinky again..am i wrong? maybe u need to experment with sex with ur boyfriend..ask him if he is interested..maybe he will be up for it...u never know..but dnt worry in my opinon i dnt think its cheating if u think of someone else while doing it with someone else..just dont call out there name while hooking up|`|TzbFaj8caa	You might want to reconsider your sexuality! You sound bi or lesbian to me!|`|o4fykobbaa	ha.....ha...........ha..........no comment. Personally, thats nasty, lol.|`|0QeCiROYaa	just have sex with her and get it over with so you don't have to fantasizing about it every time your having sex with bf.|`|yv7qSugfaa	wow. <br>  THATS ODD|`|K8wDgNwbaa	just like fat bitches... sluts need love too|`|s564PQUHaa	well ask him if he wants to do a 3 some|`|Y0NALNzyaa	Don't bring it up!!  There's nothing wrong with you; it might be association out of habit.  If it's what you were used to thinking about when you're having sex then that might be why you're thinking of it now.  Just focus on the task at hand.  When other thoughts pop in your head like that...push it out by thinking of him and how much you love him and how nice he treats you.  Eventually you'll stop having those thoughts.
YyP5tarFaa	For a one night stand or a meaningless fling.....a hot body and a big D**k.<br>  For a real woman......the list could be long but I will try to make it short. I think a woman is looking for the same thing a man looks for in a "real" relationship. Someone that will love her, support her (not financially but emotionally), stand by her, be there for her, and no matter what think she is the sexiest thing on earth. Show her you appreciate her, you don't have to buy her things, just little things like helping out when she is tired or maybe a back rub etc. If that isn't enough for her then she really doesn't love you and you would be better off without her.<br>  <br>  My husband and I have been together for 14 years. This week I had to travel about 100 miles round trip for work in very bad traffic ....long days for me. My husband made sure that dinner was made for the kids, when I walked in the door he stopped whatever he was doing to hug me kiss me and tell me to relax because he had it under control....even if he had to ask a few questions about how to cook something he did it and told me "you don't need to do it for me just tell me what to do. That made him GOD in my eyes. After 14 years and 3 kids I know I'm not the hottest thing on this earth but he makes me feel like I am. <br>  <br>  What it comes down to is that it is the small everyday things you can do for her that matter. How you treat her is number 1, not what you can buy for her.|`|Njgof6hNaa	Those of us who have grown up want a good guy, but an interesting one. It helps if you share an interest. Chemistry is good too. Attraction is what tilts the scales. Physical appearance also can work for or against you. You don't have to be handsome, but you do need to dress moderately well and be clean. Women also like a guy who happens to make them laugh, but not forced laughter. Women aren't looking for a comedian or someone who could do stand-up. They're just looking for someone who is sweet and every now and then makes them laugh. And yeah, sticking through the good and bad times makes a guy worthwhile.|`|azE51WGRaa	Ok, now that we know some other users on here are a little angry at the female species...<br>  I actually happen to have what I was looking for in a man in my Husband:<br>  We're dirt poor...I'll be the first one to admit it. But doesn't mean we don't love each other less. We pay our bills and take care of our kids together. He puts up with my PMS and my psychotic breakdowns (I am 9 months pregnant...so yes, I am psychotic right now...soon to be normal again :D) He tells me my meals taste good even when they aren't. He listens, even if he doesn't know how to respond. He's honest and can tell me when I'm bothering him. He knows how to let me vent to him and I do the same in return. We're both honest with each other and we try to communicate well (which I think is the big one). He can make me laugh when I'm sad and comforts me when I cry (which is a lot lately...I broke down over watching "Big Fish"..it's a movie..pretty good one too). To me, these are the most important qualities a man could have. I would also hope that women can find it within themselves to possess some of the same qualities themselves as what they are looking for in others.|`|2Vl6I4Praa	Caring and loving. Scratching below the surface of her looks to find the true her. Sticking with her through think and thin and letting her know that she can always count on you.|`|xoDfbfBNaa	Someone who is confident without being arrogant. <br>  Kind without being a pushover.<br>  Caring, and considerate of her feelings.<br>  Good sense of humor, that's important. <br>  Someone who can listen even when he doesn't understand, who can offer a shoulder when it's needed, who treats her with respect and expects everyone else in his life to treat her with respect as well. <br>  Someone who will appreciate her for the things she does.<br>  Someone who will treat her as his equal, not in the social justice type of way, but in the "I value your opinion and realize you're intelligent and can think for yourself" kind of way.|`|QRl8oUzqaa	i think most woman like guys that are confident and dont walk around with there noses stuck up in the air. not to pushy when if comes to sexual contact, atleast in the begining.  be your own person. have a hobby or too. and most of all go for girls that have the same interests as you.  dont put on a show. let the girl chase you down. dont act desperate.  all woman  love romance and love when guy are sweet but dont over do it.  you can say those are the things i like in a guy.  just relaxe and be yourself!  :)|`|GW1PzzdSaa	Loving, understanding and faithful--in that particular order!|`|AA11546221	Preferably, normal & NOT CREEPY. There are creepy men out there that say something like this, "Do you want to get together? I promise I'll be good to you."  <br>  <br>  If you know how to be a "friend" to someone then surely you are likely to win her over.|`|FXZLNc1aaa	Dont let women fool you, they want 1 thing only:<br>  <br>  a bank account. They wont tell you this of course, but, they ALWAYS do. They dont want a nice guy, or guy in general, they want someone with a bank account.<br>  <br>  They want to wake up every morning, have you hand them your cc, pat 'em on the head and say "Have a nice day honey".
W2rZ44Keaa	In what way is he acting strange. What behaviors is he exhibiting. It really depends what you are classifying as "weird". Different guys act in different ways when they like a girl. This guys seems to be shy maybe. If he is always trying to talk to you that's a good sign. Some guys like to poke or tickle. Some guys like to tease. Some guys are just too afraid to even talk to you lol but they look at you from afar. Then some guys are just really direct and are pretty straight up with you but it depends. Those are just some ways that guys let you know they like you. But for this guy to get over his strangeness maybe you should just talk to him if you are friends now it should be easy even if you are not maybe just make that effort to break the ice. Either way good luck and I hope I helped some.|`|QfR8GupEaa	he IS strange
8v02IUT3aa	What a sweet idea. I disagree about being taken out. The most romantic thing is to have your man cook for you.<br>  Make it easy-something you can prepare earlier? There are so many recipes on line. What does she like?<br>  Spaghetti, crusty bread, a salad and a nice red wine is always nice.<br>  Start with a glass of champagne and an appetizer.<br>  Remember, she will love you fort this no matter what you cook.<br>  Have a special dessert.<br>  Fresh flowers and candles on the table would be great also.<br>  Get going!|`|JZgSFv4xaa	I disagree with the girl above.

She'll appreciate that more than what you actually cook. Simplicity can be more impressive than trying to cook something really fancy.

Blend together the cans of soup and the milk; heat until just boiling. Drain green beans and add to soup. Stir then put in 2 quart casserole.<br>  <br>  Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until soup starts to thicken. Add 1/2 the bag of almonds and stir. Take the remaining half and saute them in the butter until lightly brown. Sprinkle on top of beans and serve. This recipe can also be done with any vegetable.|`|c325AREXaa	wow,you are so sweet.i think cooking her favourite dishes no matter how hard they are,that will be very romantic.then you may bake her a chocolate cake,with lots of lots of heart shape chocolate inside.<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|8cN4e8Vmaa	Buy Taco Bell and put it on a platter well you are wearing silk boxers only with candles and rose pedals everywhere|`|iNE2nl5taa	It's more romantic to take her out to a nice place to eat.<br>  Not eat at home then go out..|`|LqnWk9Ilaa	Lobster bisque|`|sR4HjV9Paa	Pork chops, sauerkraut, spaetzle and carrots.|`|rULYGvz9aa	Take her out, and don't type in all caps.|`|AqeG4rw2aa	mac and cheese and cut up hot dogs with a glass of milk|`|CGhwiVwdaa	Ok whoever said its better to go out, as that is more romantic, I have to respectfully disagree with you. So check it out man, just make anything really, as long as it is not something that you put zero effort into, like say make chicken parmesan, or something that isnt to hard but will end up tasting good. Make sure you make it at least once ahead of time to see how it turns out, I cannot stress that enough. Try buying some candles to decorate the table with, a table cloth, and a small vase with a rose or something to put by her. Anyways, hope my advice helps, good luck.|`|j1yLZ7ozaa	That's really sweet that you actually want to. Just make her something she's never had before. Like exotic but not hard to find? Or home-made soup, I think that would be really sweet. Spaghetti is the easy route. Most Italian/French food.<br>  <br>  Get a baguette and some soup or something? and put flowers on the table and light candles. Make sure the room smells good, maybe some jewelry so she can remember your 1 year anniversary. <br>  <br>  I wish my boyfriend would have done something like that! =D|`|0VTTk2vOaa	Blueberry Waffles with whipcream and berry topping (or syrup if she prefers that) and serve it to her in bed with a rose in a vase and chilled juice to drink.<br>  <br>  Or were you thinking for later in the day.<br>  <br>  Cuz that is the most romantic thing in the first year... breakfast in bed.<br>  <br>  Luv it!|`|CUKkN3ZRaa	try a nice pasta dinner.. fettucine w/ lobster and sauce.. <br>  some bread.. and wine<br>  and for dessert a big warm brownie srved in a big glass topped with ice cream and a lilttle whip cream<br>  <br>  i could reccomend something fancier, but i figure your trying to be practical and not over the top|`|kuFAx4ymaa	Don't cook pasta...<br>  <br>  Be prepared to buy a whole bunch of **** you dont have sitting in your kitchen already...<br>  <br>  Do a test run first...  meaning cook it once before you try to cook it for her...<br>  <br>  As far as what, I dunno, maybe some fancy fish.

But ur life is More important!<br>  Protect ur self.|`|zfzKupZoaa	why don't you try oral right before you have sexual intercourse it might just do the trick.

6DmsiLGbaa	It won't really be any different than any other open house, except that there won't be any alcohol served and you should probably not wear anything terribly revealing.  Most open houses, however, require at least dressy casual.  You probably shouldn't wear ripped or worn jeans, but you don't really need to go all out, either.  Just wear a nice dress shirt and slacks or a casual skirt (I'm assuming you're a girl.  If not, well, please don't wear a skirt!).  <br>  <br>  And it doesn't really matter when you take the gift, though I think most will bring theirs to the reception.  Still, either way is socially acceptable (and I know, because I've catered way too many of these things).|`|mJiO0LYyaa	never, ever bring a gift to the reception. you mail it or bring it to the bride's house before the wedding.|`|OEYy1TY8aa	You probably shouldn't wear jeans, but a nice, casual dress or some nice pants with a blouse should do it. Mormons are big on dressing modestly, which basically means no tube-tops or really short skirts. Since it's at a house, I definitely think dressy-casual is the way to go. I would take the gift to the open house. If you wait until the reception, you might get stuck carrying it around for a while. I'm sure most people are bringing their gifts to the celebration rather than the ceremony.<br>  <br>  Have fun!

Two things to think about: I got married at 21 and I'm still married 11 years later with a great wife and two kiddos. But saying that, I was so young looking back and you have time. Have fun, finish school, and keep working on the relationship. Secondly, many guys I know have gone to Iraq as one person, and came back as another. Be cautiously optimistic and see where it goes when he gets back. Best of luck!|`|J97E3wBjaa	I have a friend whose in a similar situation to this one. I think that you should stay together, finish your schooling and you can always get married when hes on a leave. He might feel the need to take care of you. If you know in ur heart its not the right time then you owe it to you & him to not rush into it with him. Take your time, you got the rest of your lives to be together.|`|TF9hZZxYaa	Its either u love him or u don't<br>  <br>  if u are thinking that much it means ur not in love with him...<br>  don't marry him cos after a while u will feel alone and start searching for another guy|`|ptyBSoGjaa	Just let him know that you will marry him, but when your steady|`|hw84xPRPaa	Just follow your heart.|`|FkUkKXJZaa	That is not all u planned before it all depends what time brought for both of you you should accept his decision if you really love him or he will get hurt|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	Hun you need to understand his thinking...he wants to get married now, in order to have a reason to fight impossible odds he will be facing, perhaps he is a little afraid he may not come home, unless something great gives him a reason to live.<br>  On a battle field love is an amazing miracle that gives the guy a reason to live, to survive impossible odds....and he not only asked you to marry him, he asked you to be that miracle for him.<br>  It boils down to "do you love him enough?" why are you not ready if you do?...you need to be brutally honest with the both of you, but most of all do everything in your power to spare him heartbreak before he leaves,as what you do now can make a life and death difference to him|`|fEvXSuctaa	if you dont accept now, you guys may not be together in the future. if you love him you should marry him. whatever feels right to you|`|YOrRafZoaa	Ok, heres what I think. You both are very young. But, you have been together for five years. I think that it was very honerable for him to ask you to marry him now. He is being proactive and thinking ahead. If something was to happen to him while he is deployed (God forbid), he is making sure that you will be taken care of. It gives him a sense of purpose, and as one other person said, a new chapter of his life to come home to. I honestly think that if you are planning on marrying him anyway, then you should go ahead and do it now. Your family should understand that although you may have a responsibility to them, this is the man that you are planning on spending your life with. And if he is going to be gone anyway, how will this take away from what you are doing currently?<br>  I think the real question is are you sure that He is the one? Are you sure you really want to spend the rest of your life with this person? Think really hard about that one, and even pray about it. If you really love him and want to be with him, then I say don't wait until he gets back. Be like Nike and Just Do It. I know that sounds corny, but it is what you should do. <br>  Best of luck to you.
4730f63171a75d70e37097828a42d695aa	I think that the movie about Frida Kahlo is the best example of Fidelity vs Loyalty.  In the begining she marries her soon to be husband because he said he would be loyal, then he had an affair, they split and later got back together.  He was loyal, but was definetly lurking in infedelity!|`|r21PZteRaa	Loyalty can exist with or with out fidelity. If you set ground rules about your marriage such as that of swingers, then yes, you can be loyal with open relationships.  You just have to trust each others judgments. <br>   Fidelity will not exist without loyalty.  If he is willing to go outside the marriage without your approval, he's broken the loyalty.  With your approval isn't fidelity.

Instead, take the higher road.
062dcebc0cae227b915e6808bf0dcd18aa	Believe me, you know nothing at only 14 years of age. <br>  Believe me when I say you - at 14 - know nothing about what is right or wrong; so when you say "You feel like the right person", it is wrong.<br>  <br>  WAIT till at least a few years older. <br>  But don't wait until you are married - no way - at least until you are 16.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Uh.. well it isn't good.|`|qy07K2k5aa	That's a really stupid and foolish thing to do. You'll live to regret it. Everyone should and must wait until after marriage.|`|iOa7rriGaa	Well it wouldn't be smart I mean your so young at what you feel is right now you could later see as something you should of thought about more. I'm not saying don't go through with it but think it over as much as possible and try to look at it from different perspectives because I mean I was seventeen when I lost mine and at the time it felt right with that person but it later became one of my biggest regrets just make sure you know what your getting into. And remember no matter what you do to prevent it there is still a chance she could become pregnant and think about it are you ready for that. I don't think any fourteen is or should be.

Studies show that when asked as adults, majority of those who had sex when they were teens regretted having sex too soon.<br>  <br>  Sex is not just a physical act. It requires a psychological and emotional maturity to be ready to connect with another human being in so many different levels. You touch, hear, smell, taste, and feel the person with your senses as well as feel that person with your heart, mind and soul ~ if your connection is right.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is, just be emotionally and psychologically prepared when the day comes... and I hope it doesn't come anytime soon... Allow yourself to grow-up so that your first experience will be more meaningful.<br>  <br>  If you truly love each other, give each other the gift of getting to know each other better and at a deeper level; without the distraction of sex. If you do this, you won't regret it.|`|lrVbZdSDaa	While I agree with a lot of the other posters, and yes, I can pretty much guarantee you that that won't be the right person, time, or place; if you're both ready, and you both ACCEPT the REAL possibilities and REAL consequences and realize that, and this is the big one:<br>  <br>  YOU ARE NOT INVINCIBLE.  YOU ARE JUST AS SUSCEPTIBLE TO ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS.<br>  <br>  Apologies, but even with my saying that I'm almost positive that it didn't get through.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Anyways, just use a condom.  I don't care what she uses or if you pull out or what, but USE A CONDOM.  A male one.  If you want to use extra protection go for it (As long as it's not negating each other), but use a condom no matter what you do.  If you're too nervous or don't have the resources to buy one, then you're not ready.|`|sopAuW7Zaa	Zach...it's perfectly normal to have these urges. The curiosity is, in fact, overwhelming sometimes. I know. I was 14 once myself. However, the decision to not act on these urges will prove to be very rewarding and educational for both you and your girlfriend, brother. I know a lot of your buddies are probably trying to pressure you into "gettin one under your belt", but you don't need to fall into that trap.<br>  <br>  I agree with *hello*. Can you see yourself raising a child at the age of 14? There are just too many negative consequences with this kind of activity, my friend. Not just pregnancy, but STD's as well. The wisest thing you could possibly do is to wait. I know for a fact that you're not financially or emotionally ready for that kind of weight to bear on your shoulders. Let alone the fact that maturity is a strong factor in this particular situation.<br>  <br>  Just because something might feel right, and all the right things are in place doesn't make it right. Things aren't always as they seem.|`|S5HQP65Eaa	You know, I think it really depends on the person. I have only had sex with one person in my life and I hold that really close to my heart. I lost my virginity to my boyfriend at the age of 14 after making him wait a year. And to this day we're still together and are planning to get married. You will only know when the time is right for you and if It's with the right person. Nobody can make that decision for you.|`|xcJwxyRRaa	opinions are only that,  an opinion. <br>  only you can make that choice at the time and place it happens.<br>  you're gonna do what you wanna do no matter what anyone says anyhow once you get with that hot li'l thing..<br>  i know I would'ev|`|PvyzPnEAaa	no, it's fine as long as you are BOTH ready. i lost mine at fourteen i don't think it's a big deal, but you'll get heaps of anal people on here who do.|`|TF9hZZxYaa	Its very wrong to loose ur virginity at 14! u still don't know whats right or wrong at that age... in the future u will regret it|`|121bf7421c6e2471d7a187d525e9abb1aa	Bad idea. You'll regret it after.
HqFtaCnsaa	Don't worry its not posion or anything it won't kill him.<br>  It's almost the same as like licking pee or something, around the same.<br>  I wouldn't worry about it. <br>  Sorry for the awkward moment though,<br>  That must have been bad.|`|41S75G5Eaa	wow, how old are you??|`|121bf7421c6e2471d7a187d525e9abb1aa	Nothing to worry bout. I've eaten out and it's not toxic.
rsIycgvbaa	Okay, I have had male friends who have discussed this with me what they eventually did to get the hang of it is you have to play with your own penis and learn to control right before you *** hold back.   her vagina you say is tight this might be the issue the friction you need to losen her up a bit get it nice a wet then try its looser less friction just a little more lubbier, but try to jerk off and right before you *** just chill and hold your breath and dont, then go at it again you will get use to this trust me, i hope this helps good luck!!|`|AA10347643	See a doctor.|`|ISbCiVjGaa	Have you tried having sex twice in a row...? My bf always used to come in 2min the first time, the second time after like 20min he would last alot longer...and so on lol|`|uAZlvHgiaa	Obviously she loves the sex you are having other wise she wouldn't be having it for 3 years. I like to *** while giving oral. Not during intercourse. Different women have  different preferences. You are both satisfied so forget about it.If she wanted you to last longer for intercourse she wouldn't be playing with herself. Maybe what you think is fore play she thinks is sex.|`|d36OrpbDaa	think of fat chicks or cute little bunnies or something.  or don't watch her masturbate all the time.  instead try giving her foreplay, and then don't go straight to positions that turn you on.  try positions or speeds that don't turn you on as much first.<br>  <br>  or try getting her to orgasm before you have sex.  then it won't matter as much if you come soon.|`|urQnRQ4jaa	eat her out and finish her yourself next time...|`|njGKabPuaa	They have numbing condoms that help last longer, great for virgins(so I've heard) but sounds like your past the idea of protection. <br>  So as far as pleasing her, you could try giving her oral sex, and get her off first. <br>  Taking your time with her, standing up actually makes you less prone to a quickihe, because the blood doesn't just flow to you 2nd head, it flows to your arm, and leg muscels. <br>  Also different postions can help too, being able to stop and go can extend at least a couple of minutes, hint the importance of foreplay. <br>  Also instead of just in and out, you could try up and down(that might help her out with her delima too) because reduction in friction. <br>  But really to just please her, listen to her body, the heart rate, her breathing, being able to read the blood flow to her face or her skin, seeing if she's perky(big clue!). <br>  One thing I've also been told don't focus on her at all, put your mind somewhere else, because if you get aniousx alot then it increases your blood flow, and your heart rate, stimulation, senses and all that stuff that leads to an orgasam! <br>  Plus using a condom, and water based lubricants can also help out with her because it is prelubircated, which is especialy usefull if she has a problem. Maybe she's dryer than usual and not producing enough fluid for such activity, which can cause friction and heat which doesn't help you lol. And it could be from a number of things from diet to genes that could cause that to be in her court(not saying it is, just from what you told not alot to go off of). <br>  But either way best of luck.|`|pbyw2EYZaa	Are you on prescription medication, do you use drugs? They could be part of the problem.  If your concerned about sex hurting her use lube and take it slow.  Give her lots of attention- you can do more than watch- you have a mouth dont you!/?  You can try the African herb Yohimbe- it takes about 30 minutes and it will stave off ejaculation longer.<br>  <br>  Also intergrating fresh oats, nettle leaves and seaweed into your diet supposedly helps.|`|b0Q6ecqzaa	two suggestions:<br>  1. try wearing a c*ck ring (not the vibrating type)<br>  <br>  2. masturbate before sex.  a lot.  i used this technique (which i like to call "leetching" if you know anything about early 20th century medicine lol) through high school.  do it until it actually hurts to come.|`|fO5wQiYzaa	You should be getting better with practice. It always helps if you strap up everytime. Also have her ride you and let her do the work with her hips, dont be clinchin. Start really slow and take your time.

You should last longer the second time. You can try pulling out a little before you feel it coming then use your tongue for a little then put it back in. Flexing kinda works too. There are a lot if different things you can do to last longer. And relax your breathing, deep breaths in and out.|`|EdQfe0k3aa	be careful what u ask here... i asked a similiar question, and some pathetic jelous soul reported me, and suspended me... so watch out..<br>  <br>  but here is to your question...<br>  <br>  let her suck you until you explode.. and therafter jump on top of her and get going... dont stop inbetween...<br>  <br>  enjoy it!!!|`|1m3Cjgmsaa	well you already know the answer. get high and drunk ! and try to jerk off before sex. the best advice for you is to control your breathing when you feel like cumming.|`|eUMc2PbNaa	Say the Pledge of Allegiance in your head. Wear a condom. Stop being so selfish!!!!|`|dM5u6UyHaa	I don't know.  Viagra?|`|lAhJG74taa	yes, wear a condom.. that help with what u feel on your stuff.. itll decrease the sensitivity.. also you can choose one of two options. either get trojan extended pleasure condoms which are lubricated on the inside with a desensitizing agent, thatll make ur penis a little numb.. this will stop the feeling you have and wont make you so sensitive to sex.. or you can buy trojans "her pleasure" condoms.. which is lubricated with an agent thats supposed to trigger womens pleasure, that way she doesnt have to finish alone.. also, if you want to last longer, masturbate before hand

My man's from Germany and is nowhere near ready to move to the U.S. I'm in the middle of college and couldn't move there even if i could afford to. To talk on the phone is crazily expensive so we really keep a limit on it and use online stuff as much as we can. Not to mention the 7 hour time distance makes it hard to find time when we can talk without one of us being up half the night. On top of that, visiting each other is very close to out of the question. Once a year; twice a year tops. As of now i haven't seen him in over a year. <br>  <br>  It's extremely hard but think of the good side of this: this forces you to either trust him 100% or worry like something crazy. If you trust him (and it sounds that you do), just relax. He sounds like he loves you very much and is just as anxious to get to you as you are to get to him.<br>  <br>  Keep yourself busy. Idle time means you dwell on it more. If you need to take sleep medicine to get to bed, do so in the smallest amounts possible. Speak to him on the phone every night before you go to bed. It may be easier to sleep once you're reassured that he loves you and nothing's changed.|`|d0JZTbasaa	emotions usually cause irrational actions... calm yourself down and don't htink about it too much.

I don't know how you are communicating, phone, email, etc. A webcam like skype might help you feel better if you can see each other and not just talk even if you aren't physically together. Whether you are with him or not anything could happen to either one of you and that will never change. You have to be secure in the fact that you both know how the other feels and that they know how you feel. I remember before I got married even being ten minutes away seemed too far from my husband. It will pass and once you are closer you will feel better so try to make the best of right now. Make your plans for moving and the wedding and just try to stay busy till you can be together.

Antihistamines use either diphenhydramine hydrochloride (brands include: Sominex, Compoz, Tylenol PM, and Unisom SleepGels) or doxylamine succinate (Unisom tablets, Equate). The two ingredients are pretty interchangeable. Each inhibits the same neurotransmitter to depress your central nervous system. These antihistamines are the same stuff you might take for allergies, which is why allergy medications make you so drowsy.<br>  <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2062791/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2062791/</a>|`|TF9hZZxYaa	Tell him u cannot stand that he is so far... if he loves u for real he should find a solution... if he didn't find a solution u have to relax and give the relation time and don't think about him that much...u never know what will happen maybe u will love another guy after some time and maybe he will love someone else|`|QB9szNYMaa	A.

I am too :) lol<br>  Congrats and don't worry he loves you just think about how wonderful it is that you're going to be with him soon.<br>  I miss my bf so much every day but I get through it by phone calls before bed and just thinking about how it's going to be once we're married.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|YOrRafZoaa	Wow! this question hits very close to home for me. My fiance is in another state too. We have only been apart for three months now, and its been two months since i saw him last. I am moving to where he is very very soon and i cant wait to be near him again. Our relationship is similar too. We are very close, have a lot in common, and very similar views on most everything. I really hope that everything works out for your relationship with your bf. <br>  However, I hope you are planning your move soon. I say this because even though my fiance and i love eachother very much, the distance has put a huge strain on our relationship. Distance is not a good thing. It creates tension, trust issues, and can become lots of drama. When your guy isnt available by cell phone or im, then your mind starts wondering whats going on. Insecurity inevitably sets in. If you are having these feelings already, it doesnt mean that the realtionship is doomed. It just means that you are human. And, that my theory is right. That distance is bad in relationships. Also, I have trouble sleeping too, especially when we have an argument. One thing that helps me sleep is too talk to my guy just before bed time. Its nothing like having him next to me, but it helps. Just get there as soon as you can, and you should be sleeping better in no time. <br>  Best of luck to you!
giocJLVKaa	Why do most people assume that this would cause problems and that the man is the older one?<br>  <br>  My fiance is 10 years younger than I am and I do not see any problems, now or in the future.  I know many people who have 5-15 year age differences in their relationships who don't have any problems.  <br>  <br>  It is my opinion that problems aren't caused by the age, but by the changes in life, the attitudes of the people involved, the commitment and communication (or lack there-of) and so on.  If the couple are truly meant to be together and love each other, they can work through anything that may come.  Love is not just an emotion, but an action.  There is a quote I love that says it all- in my opinion: <br>          “No one falls in love by choice, it is by chance. No one stays in love by chance, it is by work. And no one falls out of love by chance, it is by choice."  — Author unknown<br>  <br>  As long as you love each other and are willing to work through anything that may come (whether it be age related or not) then the difference in age shouldn't matter.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I don't think age difference is really a problem.  My parents are almost 10 years apart and are about to celebrate their 25th anniversary.

Marriages fail because people are too lazy to work on their problems.  Work hard on your relationship keep it alive.|`|0e1c82c3e51c8fc7239168c6e717e201aa	Yes, there are much chances. First   of all the thinking pattern and acting pattern. Youngsters can be in a mood to a take advantage, risk and challenge and will adjust to the new environment fastly where the aged cannot not only due to age factor but also due to  their fixed ideas, experience and ideology. Younger ones attitude, way of enjoyment, behavioural pattern is entirely different comparing to the older ones. But somehow these huge age gap between the male and female were common in older days, then the life styles, actions and thinking are entirely different compared now. One can take some exception,  if  she is only a home maker, not  much interested in other life activities [ i mean only settled to the family environment] and if you are below 30 years or around 30+.  Otherwise there are chances of getting mental agony, depression, irritation, behavioural problems. Don't compare your parents or relatives of olden days.|`|rn0dxfmhaa	I am married to some one 7 years younger and some time we have problems but not because age, but a worry than in 30 year  the age difference may become a problem, so far she says she loves me and I love her too, all I try to do is work hard on this marriage and our relationship thinking it will pay off on every up coming  day of are life|`|8K3IucU3aa	it's possible. the way i see it in these relationships with big age differences is that if you're both on the same maturity level then there's something wrong. if both of you aren't acting your age now you might start doing it later. that usually causes problems and divorces happen. you can get married if you want to but don't rush it.|`|x73U0nUBaa	No me and my husband have 10 years between us, as long as you both know exactly what the other one wants and expects of each other you can both be very happy|`|NigoVXX1aa	As long as you love each other and listen to your wife/husband then age doesn't matter.|`|RD7A4NAtaa	My father was 11 years older than my mum... they had many happy years of marriage!<br>  <br>  If you're happy together, go for it!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you both.|`|eVubSKcEaa	no problem as long as you love each other..|`|OEYy1TY8aa	My parents are 14 years apart, and they never had any problems until about 5 or 6 years ago. My dad is retired, and my mom still feels young and motivated. He'd prefer to pack up and move somewhere quiet, and she can't bear to leave the hustle and bustle of the city. I hope it's just a stage, but they seem to be in two completely different stages of life.<br>  <br>  They've always had their issues, so maybe that is the cause of all these problems. However, their age difference has definitely caused a distance between them. I think it's all relative, though. My aunt and uncle are like 10 or 11 years apart and they're stronger now than ever.|`|b913c8b7c941189d314d33ad1ef6a6efaa	just about perfect, I say at least 10 years difference is the best.. <br>  girls mature so much faster than guys do..

323zNRdHaa	Depends if you like necklaces or not.  Some brides prefer earrings only but I have heard problems where if you wear a strapless dress and don't have a necklace, pictures from the neck up have too much skin showing (makes you look like you aren't wearing anything).<br>  <br>  With that said, with that type of dress since it's ornate in style, you would need simple accessories if you add a necklace. <br>  <br>  Something like this would work:  <a href="http://www.greatdaybridal.com/Lovely-Lady-3-Piece-Bridal-Jewelry-Set-p/lovely%20lady.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatdaybridal.com/Lovely-Lad...</a><br>  <br>  If you like chandelier earrings, here are some that work:<br>  <a href="http://www.greatdaybridal.com/Bridal-Earrings-s/92.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatdaybridal.com/Bridal-Ear...</a>|`|1xMTNTgkaa	Pearls real or not are beautiful with wedding gowns.

XDIQpLQWaa	I recently got my friend married through arya samaj.... they need age proof, ID proof and a affidavit from court which you can get from District court near Gandhi Hall. But in your case, the guy is NRI and I'm not very sure whether you need an extra affidavit or something. You can go to the arya samaj temple at Bhagirathpura. <br>  Marriage takes around 2 hrs only and you need to book it atleast a day in advance, they'll charge you around 1500 and you need to get few things like garland, 'mangal sutra' and few other things... which they'll tell u when you get yourself registered.... You also need two witness from both sides.<br>  Arya samaj marriages need not be registered as they are recognized as legal. You get a certificate from Arya Samaj. <br>  If you want to register yourself at court, you need parents or guardians from bride's & groom's side to be the witness and certificate from Arya Samaj and the pandit.<br>  I don't have full info for reg at court as my friend did love marrige and we were not able to reg it due to unavailability of parent or guardian from bride's side.<br>  Thats all from my side.|`|xsVvOsEqaa	I have no idea on this but hope you figure it out. <br>  <br>  Sweet Mildred sent me to help you

Find other friends, and be sensible.|`|FWIvP0fGaa	There was a time when I got revenge on someone and I really regret it. Really, just avoid them and only talk to them when you have to.|`|csyntnt7aa	You deserve a lot better, than either of these girls, just ignore them, forget revenge as they are so not worth it.|`|rwZtQo6Eaa	I know you are probably really angry and upset right now, but you should really not consider getting revenge on these girls. I know it seems like it would be worth it now, but do you really want to sink down to their immature and pathetic level? You will end up regretting whatever it is you do in the future. You will also feel bad, because these girls are just teenagers, and teenagers can be mean. What you should do is go vent your anger to a friend or family member. Get all your frustration out in the open. It will make you feel better. Just don't vent to the girls who hurt you. What you should do is then ignore them. Don't talk to them, avoid seeing them just stay away from them. Eventually you will get over that this even happened. Just keep living your life, be happy, have fun, meet new and better people. Acting as if you don't care what they did and it doesn't affect your life whatsoever is the best revenge. If you do something really horrible it will come back to haunt you. They could get you in a lot of trouble. Just avoid their game playing. There is no use trying to get revenge, especially against people who are not thinking logically or rationally. Move on with your life, forget that this even happened and don't even bother wasting your time on these girls. You are better than them. Don't act like them. You look at them now and think how stupid and mean they are. Do you really want to be like them? If not, don't retaliate. If you really do want to be seen as a rude, unkind bully, then sure, get back at them. Other girls will not find that attractive at all. So if you have your revenge, you will look like a bad guy, and it will be harder for you to find a girl to like you and move on. It is up to you in the end. Don't do anything you will regret. Don't do anything that will really hurt these girls in a bad way. And don't do anything that will end you up in jail.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  =)|`|RUUfer3maa	idk how but you should think of a way to make them feel as humiliated as u did...that could be doing nothing and letting karma get them, or thinkin of something worse than they did...but if u do try something like that make sure ur ready to pay the consequenses. karma is a *****<br>  and sometimes it choses the wrong person to come back on

Sometimes two teenagers may fall in-love and therefor it could be called "love" if it is deep and meaningful, sometimes this could be mistaken for a "fling" or "puppy love" but when you feel true love, you will know it. I hope this helps you mate.|`|AA10655386	dude... be more specific..<br>  depends really..<br>  <br>  teenage girls has a tendency to mistake infatuation with love. the butterflies in their stomach, the giggles, the fainting stares, and the big deal they make out of small talk when that guy approaches them. Those are just all silly and shallow form of likeness<br>  <br>  but though teenage girls are younger and immature because they haven't experienced the hardships of life and love, doesnt mean that they cannot bring themselves to love someone<br>  <br>  like the quote "age is only a number", that quote has several meanings to it, not just the obvious 30 dating a 21 year old or something|`|znvx2NMQaa	puppy love

I try to do my best to show how much I appreciate him and everything he does. I'm mailing him homemade cookies tomorrow and have a lot planned out for his birthday in a couple weeks even though we can't be with each other. When we do get to be together for a few weeks I do everything from message his back to get him coffee. He takes care of me and protects me in many ways, so it's the least I can do. And I enjoy it anyway! So to answer your last question, yes.. after almost 2 years I still look forward to talking to him when he gets home from work.

83t9G4gcaa	We tend to be attracted to and find comfort in things which are familiar to us, even if those things are not emotionally or physically healthy for us. Perhaps you're missing the sameness or familiarity of the relationship, but not necessarily your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Just keep busy with other things and get to know yourself as an individual.|`|71VRvldJaa	Forget him.  There's a reason why people from your past don't make it to your future.  Just re-read what you wrote.......<br>  *we clashed with opinions<br>  *we'd just fight and make up<br>  *I just feel ike I don't love him anymore<br>  *I was cold<br>  If it didn't work the first time, it sure won't work if you try it again.  You made an emotional investment into this relationship for 3 years...that's a fair bit of time.  You're bound to miss him a little bit.  Don't go backwards.....move forward.|`|YE0baNYRaa	yes. give him another chance. go back to him. best of luck.|`|0qspJSt9aa	well you can ask this advice at jamrie.com<br>  its more of a personal advice website.<br>  people over there might be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!|`|8WPpcjhCaa	I'm sure you're a wonderful person, but I just want to you realize that you can't have your cake and eat it too.  You can't just be playing around with someone's emotions like that because it will steer them away from you more and more as time goes by.  I know you're doing this unconsciously so I wanted to point it out to you.  I have a lot of friends that I have seen this from and it ended badly.  What you need to do is sit down and just think to yourself, let it be one day.  So you sit down and contemplate all the pros and cons.  You have to realize if you do want to give him a chance, that if it goes bad, it will be the last chance he got.  Because if you continue this cycle, he will become conditioned to it and realize he can always do something wrong, and that you'll always take him back;  And you don't want this to happen.  Catch my drift?  I think you're a smart girl and you can figure this out.  Just keep in mind that you can't always have it your way, people will have faults and so will you but you have to work at it in order to make the relationship better.  No relationship is perfect, so forget about the little things and look at the big picture. =]<br>  Good luck, wish you the best !

I know if she is happy why don't she leave him, because she is waiting for the right one to come along . why would she leave , if it is not worth it. I think she sees something in you that's why she calls
K6JSNQJQaa	Well Tim, I know that must be difficult working things out with someone who cheated on you.  I think it will be that much more difficult for her to continue to see the same person she cheated on you with, even if just as friends.  I can tell you the two most important qualities in a great relationship are open communication and trust.  If you don't have those two you'll never truly be happy in that relationship (of course it's only my opinion).  I find that once the trust issue has been broken there isn't much left.  <br>  <br>  In saying that, I wish you well in working things out with her.  If you both can forgive and forget and you truly love each other I hope your relationship will become even stronger than it was before.  Good luck!|`|AA11433436	no, it's definitely not fair for her to continue to be friends with that person.  it's already going to be difficult to rebuild any trust that she lost, so think how hard it's going to be if the guy is still in the picture.  i respect you for wanting to work things out, but i don't think you can do it after she's cheated...she's likely to do it again...and the other person involved is still around.|`|Ls1oc5syaa	well sometimes u get in denial that she will go and not cheat on you but no matter what you know she is gonna go and do it again...i say once a cheater always a cheater....just do whats right because i know you know she is doing it..|`|Wn0Hj7H4aa	Just friends huh ---in a pigs a** wise up jethro|`|vZj1LH16aa	To your question: Very unfair for her to continues friends with that person.  And if it was suggested by her, then it's time to move on.<br>  <br>  Base on my experience: I would of just forget her and move on. This relationship won't work, trust me. It's already over. If you are gonna try and stay with her, YOU WILL end up hurting yourself more.|`|7DSuEjUOaa	I have a rule that I don't take back cheaters but at the same time if my fiance had cheated I would have to really think about it and as far as the other no that would not be happening at all she's lucky to get you back much less you take another one in the nuts.|`|yiux97Wbaa	Tim, its really not a good idea for her to keep this person as a friend, it will always come between the two of you, and to be honest, you should probably move on, she will probably cheat on you again.|`|KoKQQ5GZaa	i wouldn't forgive someone if they cheated on me in the first place<br>  get rid of her!!!|`|5Uo9Civzaa	decide you|`|BPf1k8L6aa	why she do this ..... ask yourself  and think<br>  may she need your help ....<br>  <br>  I don't konow ....|`|71VRvldJaa	Give me a break!.....pleeeeeze!<br>  Why don't you tell her she can just continue to cheat as long as she just does it on Tuesday!<br>  <br>  You're setting yourself up for a fall my friend!  You're wasting your time trying to work things out if he's going to stay in the picture!<br>  <br>  I'm sorry but cheating is a deal breaker.  Cheating is a deliberate choice....it doesn't just happen!  With every choice is a consequence.  She knew when she cheated it could cost her the relationship she had with you!  She chose to cheat!<br>  <br>  I don't think cheaters deserve second chances.  If it was me, she'd be gone!|`|08y217Rdaa	Friends with him? This is insane. On the other hand, I'd let her stay with him. Forever.
FKQvRZhXaa	Maybe she is confused. Maybe she likes you and feels bad about it because she has a boyfriend. Maybe she just found out shes pregnant. Or like my guy friend says... maybe shes just on her period.|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	Honey, she is just working things out in her head.  You already know she is shy,  so I think it's your next move, as a friend.  I think the best way to proceed would be to find another girl that she knows, and maybe another classmate, and tell her, "Hey, we are going to go get some Coffee, or going to the "burger" place to grab a snack, want to go with us??  We will be there at 4, or  something like that.  And see if she will join you in a small group - so she wouldn't be the only one "put upon to make conversation".  That maybe what she is afraid of.  Who really knows, but there are a few things you can try, if you really like her.  Have patience with her.  It might be what she needs.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK SWEETIE.|`|igkeGdFraa	Idk sorry|`|6MHuI3NXaa	she probably likes you, (well duh)<br>  but  she may just want to avoid you<br>  because shes already got a boyfriend<br>  and doesnt want to lead you on<br>  when she already taken.... <br>  she knows that she likes you thats why<br>  she doesnt want to even take the risk<br>  of show you she likes you, cause she scared<br>  she might leave her other boyfriend....<br>  -----<br>  i dont know if this helped, but it makes sense<br>  just think about it.|`|rVL4GBdjaa	you're a jerk mistaking that she likes you. then you shamelessly tell her what you think of. she'll be really avoiding you big time.|`|2svonkw1aa	she's trying to decide between you and her boyfriend. give the girl some space and time|`|DP6UkhXjaa	this sounds a lot like my current sitiuation in luv life.... u need to <br>  give her a little time<br>  be honest with her<br>  tell her how you feel <br>  be kind <br>  <br>  ***tip i always use this<br>  Ok so it might be a little confusing but try to pretned what your about to say to her is what shes saying to you.... so here is my example <br>  <br>  when the guy i liked (who i know he kinda liked me to) talked to other girls i got sorta jealous... well i imagined i was talking to other guys and i do that all the time so i realized I was sooo stupid for being jealous!|`|emUlZaKhaa	Possibilities<br>  <br>  1. She thinks you're an egotistical moron<br>  2. She's embarassed that you caught her looking at you<br>  3. She is an imaginery peron that you thought up due to the fact that you have no friends, but in reality, she turns out to be a guy who came from a planet named Zuluk where all the Zulukians live and send guys over the universe to mess with people's heads.CURSE THE ZULUKIANS|`|VONCDGrjaa	Girls are really confusing to boys I guess. (I am a girl) Don't you see this? She likes her boyfriend but likes you too! She needs time away to think if a friendship with you might accidentally get moved into a relationship. Or, she might just not think it is alright to be doing this with you. <br>  -that is my perspective|`|IGDaE5Lkaa	It sounds like she's conflicted between liking you and liking her boyfriend. Maybe she doesn't know who she likes more. Give her time. If she likes you, she'll break up with him. But if she stays with him and sits next to you, it could mean that she just wants to be friends.|`|ei0e7RwOaa	She's staring at you because you walk around with your zipper open all the time.<br>  She wants to sit next to you because she needs someone to copy off of in school.<br>   I hope this helps.|`|q1R8BDrnaa	Probably guilt for liking you when she has a b/f! <br>  <br>  Us women act out in kindsa weird ways when we're not quite sure how to handle a situation :)|`|19CEfoLyaa	Because she wants to.|`|JSKBqjVMaa	Ok...im a girl so i know what it ment<br>  she likes you!!! she doesn't want to admit it!! maybe that *boyfriend* was fake to make you umm Jelous?? or maybe she likes you More then her bf...?

It works...but I know a few others are also compatable...It's been awhile since I looked at my Astrology books...and I forget..|`|jLaNVvp3aa	I just went to an Astrology site and it said that Virgo's best match is Pisces. Well, I'm Capricorn, and, honestly, I don't beleive in any of that stuff. I mean, seriously, how can you be sure that everyone born within a certain period of time will experience similar events every day as other born within that time period? Don't get me wrong, read your horoscope and stuff, but just remember, don't take everything seriously. You could make up making the biggest mistake of your life if you follow the advice from a Horoscope shoved into a magazine.|`|71VRvldJaa	Capricorn would be best, Taurus next.....according to what they say.<br>  I think that astrology stuff is crazy<br>  I'm Virgo and have known a few Capricorn men and I could hardly stand being in the same room with any of them!  I dated a Taurus man a couple times and we had absolutely nothing in common<br>  My soul mate was an Aries.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Lozz.....the site I've used in the past says  "Virgo with Capricorn is the BEST match for these two, so go for it!   For Pisces it says "Virgo with Pisces can get along but they really have to work at it".  I don't believe in this stuff either.  It's just fun to read sometimes.

However, I've known people with incompatable signs that were married and happy and successful.  Go figure.
Jy6n8yNNaa	You just need a new outlet.  I would either re-connect with your old friends and family and see if that works.  If that doesn't, you can always resort to another form of distraction, such as an altered state.  Have you considered picking up a drinking or drug habit?  This may be the answer.|`|iU1yT9LXaa	dont call/text/message/see her until she contacts you first! let her make the moves! make her miss you!<br>  <br>  first of, you need to start hanging out wiith friends a lot! go out and have fun! stay away from ur phone so u dont get tempted to call her..<br>  <br>  do all these ASAP or u'll lose ur girl!
X3K1fWDdaa	Get rid girl, this guy is obviously bothering you, why be with someone that cant make you happy? Every girl needs a treat once in a while and if this guy cant even feed himself, theres no chance he will ever treat you. You will happen on your birthday or christmas, what will he say, my friend will buy you a card and present?? Theres plenty more fish in the sea, maybe you should go out a catch another one coz this guy sounds like a waste of space!!|`|hDOBfBZeaa	Sounds like he's just not that into you - someone who wants to date and wants to make a good impression would get even a part time job to be able to to take you out to grab a burger.

IPS3hWweaa	No, kick him in his precious nut sack and then kick him to the curb. Make sure you get a lot of alimony because once he's divorced he can have two women and be incredibly successful.|`|pDqsFgjyaa	hell no, punch him upside the head (ok don't because that's domestic abuse) and tell him to wake up and smell the coffee... He sounds like a total douche bag|`|9sIcZwWMaa	what do u mean by "having another woman??" lady I think you exaggerated the fact, it sounds that he have a job opportunity with a woman that you dislike, you do not allow him to get that job (because you hate that woman), and you do not like it that he is jobless! ! !<br>  as a man I know that this is what usually happen, no man would go for another woman to get job, it is just your jealousy that make you to imagine that,,,,,,,|`|0psxM4o4aa	No it is not fair!  When you got married he took an oath to love and cherish you.  How is it love if he NEEDS another woman to motivate himself.  It's all a line, and he should be taken out back and put down for talk like that.<br>  <br>  Yuo are better than that, and you deserve to be treated better.  Tell him that if he wants he can go back to zero women.  It's either just you, or just PALMalla HANDerson, his choice.|`|NigoVXX1aa	Kick his ***.Tell him how would he like it if you were to have another lover.|`|08y217Rdaa	What the hell??? Kick him. And real hard.|`|9dcuaJeEaa	oh my god honey.

3Ks21ASDaa	If he tells you what she says then you should be glad about that. Atleast he's not hiding these things from you. It's showing he has nothing to hide, they are just friends. It's normal to be jealous of his girlfriends. Is he jealous of your guy friends? Let him know that it bothers you, but you will try to be better about it. Show him you are making an effort. He wouldn't be with you if he didn't love you.|`|wpiWiWFiaa	You are not being a crazy woman at all lol.  My boyfriend has many friends that are girls and he is very close with them all.  I know they are just friends but it still bothers me a little bit.  Its natural in everyone to have just a little jealousy in them.  Tell him exactly how you feel.  Ask him if he would be angry if you were doing the same thing.  Men never realize how much something like that can bother us.  Also ex's are always a touchy subject.  Just sit down and tell him your not trying to be jealous but it just bothers you a little bit.  You may know his intentions but you have no idea what the other women have in mind.
zHmZkMStaa	I've had experience in this sort of thing - this exact scenario, in fact.  I wouldn't do it.  Most times it ends up being unpleasant, when all the scores are tallied?  The odds are against the likelihood that all parties will emerge from the experience happy, satisified, and with no regrets.|`|mwEBrwlOaa	It is a decision that all three of you are going to have to make. Having had a few threesomes with my wife of nearly 20 years I can tell you that if the both of you are in agreement and follow your boundaries then there is a strong chance the two of you will come through it. In regard to your friend the thing to do is to ensure there is a plan for the friendship to return after the threesome. The two of you may have to work through the issues and ensure it is possible to go back as friends. <br>  <br>  To answer you question it may work just make sure it is workable, everyone is on board, and everyone is in agreement about the limits. Otherwise you may find yourself in a situation that you would rather not be.|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	Well, mixing preferential treatment is hard and can change your relationship drastically.  What role is your gay friend going to be taking?  Your relationship is going to change on both sides. If you still want to do this I suggest you three sit down and talk about it first and if it doesn't work out while you are talking then it is much better.  Having open relationship can do more harm than good.|`|HU4kKPaIaa	Noo way! I don't think you would get too much pleasure out of this.. Seeing you man and your best friend going at it.

Be affected after this.|`|U4Rf1rjuaa	I think both..I don't know any straight man who would do that with a gay man.You may be the problem..or maybe their way of having sex w/o you realizing they are intrested in eachother and your just the tool.

oOsGaqaLaa	This happened to me, years ago, and it made me clingy and not as confident, always asking him what was wrong.  So,  I worked quickly on my confidence (guys like confidence in a girl) and I made myself not be so available to him by not answering the phone every time (definitely a hard thing to do) and by hanging out with my friends more, instead of always trying to be with him.  It took a couple of weeks but it got easier for me and hard for him.  Soon the tables turned.  We did work it out, kept our own identities, and have now been married for many years. Good luck to you.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	It's ran it's course.|`|OS24ICPRaa	give it some space...if its ment to be, it'll be

UfGVTAKmaa	How long have you guys been together? If it seems like a significant amount of time, I would just talk to him about it. He just may not be ready to introduce you into his family, it's a big step for men. But don't be afraid to ask him, it's always better knowing than to not know and mess up. Also, you could introduce him as your friend, and then see if he says anything to you. Hope I could help|`|xNMPvgFhaa	He's just not ready to introduce you to his family or ex because of several reasons:<br>  1. He doesn't know what the future holds for you.<br>  2. He doesn't want to freak you out.<br>  3. Keeps you away from his family issues, thus giving you two less headache to think about.<br>  <br>  It is normal and you shouldn't think too much of it, just give him sometime, because he just wanna take it slow.<br>  I do the same thing with my ex, I introduce him as friend to my family & relatives, while he's "bf" to others. After we officially told everyone that we're in a relationship, the pressures were pushing in and so we broke off. I think that's why your bf did the same thing.<br>  Just don't think too much of it, afterall, everyone else knows that you two in relationship. :)|`|jMKDH07naa	if that's the case, there's something that he hides on you. i mean there's something that you never know but you're ought to know. well, i have an uncle, he and his wife have long distance relationship, so, he is fun of going night parties and fun of courting other girls and have relationship with them. by that, he is always keeping secret from his wife and to my mom for he knows that my mom will scold him if ever she will know what he was doing. <br>  i'm just concern if you will be a victim of this kind of trips... just try to ask him...good luck!|`|RCfc9hMKaa	That's sort of a red flag... I mean, it's not like he never refers to you as his girlfriend, but he doesn't do it to anyone important to him. How long have you been together?

If you are and he's with you , then not with you and then with you again, maybe it's just for the sex. Just because it rips your heart out doesn't mean it means anything at all to him. When you saw the new guy, was it just a date, or did you sleep with him. It sound like your ex is justifying to himself the way he has been treating you, by saying-look how fast she got over me-she is a slut. Don't worry about the ex, he isn't worrying about you. Move on with your life. But hold out for a while before you jump into bed with someone else. If you have recreational sex, then don't expect someone to act like it means anything.

462b78f4311608808a5064e9afb784d7aa	A Christian marriage is a bond between a man and a woman that basically means they are a family in the eyes of God.  It's when someone stops being a child and starts being the head of their own family unit.<br>  <br>  I know that sounds technical but the reasons for entering a marriage in Christianity are the same as most marriages today (except arranged marriages) - love, devotion, all that kind of thing.

Bipolar Disorder generally makes life a living hell, and often one that ends prematurely at the sufferer's own hand (15% of us kill ourselves).<br>  <br>  OK, so it's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. There are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. These drugs are heavy duty psychiatric medications and are not to be taken lightly, and most if not all of them have a range of side effects including lethargy, photosensitivity, cognitive impairment (dumb as a box of rocks), weight gain, hormone problems, hair loss and blood problems. These side effects have to be weighed against the benefits of mood stabilisation. <br>  <br>  So, I suppose it does make life 'interesting' but not in the way you might like.|`|AA10860112	someone s got bipolar obsession.....|`|5447fca5f9d4e96d552022469f83daceaa	You are better off.

It sounds to me like the two of you kind of clicked, maybe not in a relationship kind of way but maybe just as friends.  And why was it her choice to end the friendship, did you try to pop by and see her or ask her if she would like to go out one night stricktly as friends.  Or is it you wanted more then just a friendship with her and she did not?  Just remember there are differences in friends at work that is just what they are work friends not real friends.  Best of luck to you.

And she has to try too.|`|aJhlnnKsaa	it just depends on the guy and the female.........but the way i get mine that way is to be riding him with my feet under his legs and i just ride until i squirt|`|AA11474975	You need to grow up...|`|73edyKpuaa	dude,just chill out.<br>  its all about finding her clitoris.usually go in softly and then start moving in like a maniac.<br>  but if you cant,just tell her to teach you.usually turns em on too|`|7knvHmbVaa	play wit her talk sexy have confidants do nice deep strokes  use a cover up on your jimmy|`|buGwZumzaa	INSIDE THE FEMALE VAGINA  IS THE CLITORIS.

She should be home baking cookies for the grandkids but believes in having a life outside of the kitchen and is never home...At least she is coming to stay with the kids and me this next week.
rzPIO1aQaa	depends on what state you live in and because your husband is in the Marines I am sure you can do it without him there. there are certain circumstances like this one where the other partner doesn't have to be there. I live in Texas and I got my marriage license the same day with my partner but it wasn't valid for 3 days. It is only good for 30 days.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	Yes you both have to be there because they need three forms of identification and you have to take an oath before they will allow you to have your marriage license, you get the paper you sign after the wedding the same day and the 30 days is for when you return it and they send you the official license, since your fiance is in the marines you can talk to a judge to where you dont have to wait the 72 hour wait period to get married|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	I'm in NY - we both had to be present, but we also walked out with the marriage license. There was a 24 hour waiting period, and then we could get married. Call your local town/city hall and find out what the process is in your area.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	I would call the court house but my daughter and hub got theirs the same day|`|zNuZm4K6aa	You obtain the marriage license in the county in which the ceremony will take place.  You should call that county's courthouse and ask them what you need to do.  In most counties you both have to be present and show picture ID; some even require birth certificates.  Make sure and ask how long the license is good from the day it is issued until you turn it back in; usually it is anywhere from 30-60 days.|`|4IQRDtoAaa	you have to contact the court in the state where you want to get married.  I'm in CA and here, YES your husband must be present to get the license, but it's issued to you immediately.  Hope this helps.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I am from Texas, my husband is from VA.  I went by myself to get the license, because he wasn't able to fly out, but he did have to fill out some paper work that I had to take with me.  It's probably different for every state, but there should be an exception if one person can't be there.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes both of you need to be there together to apply for it. The marriage license is only valid in the area you will be marrying. So if you are marrying in CA, you have to apply for it in CA in the county where the ceremony will be taking place.
vI0WnAiOaa	you can ask for board now if he is working - my parents did from the time i was 16 and working for them in their shop. i am having the same dificulties as you now with my 16 yr old girl. she has finally decided its too hard finding a job right now and has gone back to school - 6 weeks after it started back so she will have a really hard time catching up. she also isnt living here at the moment as she would rather be near the coast and not in the country with me, so resides with my parents who are being stressed out by her attitude to life.<br>  this is hard and he sounds like a good kid who just needs a break and who knows next year he may decide that he can go back to school or may find more work. set some rules like getting up and helping around the house instead of sleeping all the time. if he is to live there then he needs to contribute to the chores and his girl friend will appriciate that too once he moves into his own place sometime.<br>  dont blame yourself as this is what a lot of teens are like and there are some much worse.|`|A9nBzN3Daa	I  think you need to give him some time to figure out what he wants to do remember he is only 17yr.   some kids take longer than others.  you can just try to stand by him.  and let him know you love him|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	The bottom line is as long as you (or anyone else) makes life easy for him he has no reason to get motivated. You say one thing but enable him to continue this lifestyle. It is like giving beer to an alcoholic and saying don't drink this. He won't "get it" until he is forced to get it thru necessity. I suggest counseling for you to find out why you can't let go and help him become a man.
Xps2hHWQaa	 HE NEEDS ANGER MANAGEMENT AND WILL BE HEADED FOR PRISON IF HE DOES NOT STOP VILLENCE!  DUMP THIS DRUG ADDICTED PUNK AND MOVE ON!!|`|piQnSMdqaa	don't pretend you know how he thinks or why he acts how he does.  foster kid issues are not the real reason.  be carful!!!|`|hAvmQqNHaa	Pretty much:/<br>  <br>  <br>  very protective type right?|`|bUncGS3Maa	he need u to be for him only....that's why<br>  it's up to you to be like ring in his hand or not.|`|KJiGI60Laa	I got three words for you. HE IS CRAZY!|`|WcvsBgLuaa	I'd back off a little bit.  You don't want to take a chance of getting beat up.|`|EfDzO9OXaa	yea he might beat you up|`|ozuvGuHRaa	yes, you are in danger|`|it0SZZFVaa	id go before he bites ur lip off when making out....but on the real he might abuse you later on break it off now|`|M3SRrddwaa	If you are afraid of him that means you should not be with him! It sounds like he may need some help. Suggest to him that the two of you take a break while he seeks some psychological help, you can even find some therapists in your area and suggest them for him. After he seeks help the two of you can then decide based on how you feel about each other whether or not you should get back together. Don't stay with him unless he gets some help though because you would be putting yourself into a bad situation!|`|funMD1Y7aa	Yeah, you need to break it off before he dumps you then tries to go back out with you. you can do better than that. Trust me, you dont wanna be with someone like that, it will only lead to being locked up and all that drama, do you seriously want to be in that mix, come on, be smart, bail out now, then lets see what he tells your best friend about being "clingy'. he need s to grow up, and you should move on. |`|AA11775891	I would definitely back off, especially since he had the NERVE to tell your best friend that he thinks you're too clingy! I don't know how old the 2 of you are, nor how long the 2 of you have been together. He doesn't sound he takes the relationship  too seriously<br>  <br>  He knows that she will tell you what he said. If not, he's a knuckle head. He sounds like one already though!!!! I think you can do better.|`|ymcsjN1Uaa	yes.<br>  unless you enjoy feeling this way and getting pushed around<br>  GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN<br>  end of story, you deserve better than that....<br>  good luck|`|BGrFXkkmaa	If he ever acts that way with you then you should get out of the real?ationship. but for now as long as he doesnt show any anger towards you........ and you love him..........stay with him.........but watch his behavior|`|MiMBQvEqaa	lol well when anyone gets ina fight they are trying to **** the other person up. that does not  mean he will be violent toward you |`|tdAIY8Xbaa	Yes! Those are the type of people you see on the news for killing there<br>  girlfriends.|`|Pzz3XNoUaa	he's just being stupid. you should probably tell him to get lost and if he tries to fight you have boiling oil prepared to throw in his eyes. no one likes when their eyes are on fire.|`|jfYlvKsuaa	i think you should be afraid..... you should probably break up with him and avoid him|`|BWsnzXA1aa	Yes. He needs help.<br>  You should never be afraid of a boyfriend.|`|NDO61nqCaa	don't be afraid if he break up with you choose an another boyfriend|`|X0TXOATWaa	I dont get it either. |`|Xp3Fp2i0aa	yes he might have anger managment and might be abusive|`|vyj8hnpFaa	get rid of that boyfriend and for long term dont be so clining |`|nKqTcn2Haa	I'm afraid of your boyfriend!|`|wfJ5tBpYaa	yes|`|SB5ynfNAaa	Yeah he seems a little aggressive, but some guys arent like that with there girlfriends. If he is alreasy saying that you seem clingy it's probably cause he's not used to having someone there by him or caring about him so it probably seems weird for him. But if you have any feeling what so ever that he might hit you or become aggressive towards you then I would leave the relationship. The last thing you want is to be abused by someone you love. So get out now that you can if you feel you might be in danger.|`|sGB1zkveaa	listen, i was abused as a child too, and i turned out fine. I wouldnt be too afraid, b/c i mean how old are  u? Judging by the sound of your writing, i'd say no older than middle skewl/ high skewl. So the odds of you being together for the rest of your lives is slim. Be less clingy or just get rid of the guy. If he does care about you then u shouldnt have anything to fear. And if he lays a hand on u beat the spit out of him and dump him. ;)|`|EI64TobVaa	confront him. make sure he knows this worries you, but also make sure he knows that this worry you have isn't you breaking up with him.  if he was through this as a child he probably is showing displacement of anger.  you need to talk to him before it gets worse.  if he cares about you as much as you think he does, he won't hurt you in the future and he will try to calm his temper down.|`|VztHyPkNaa	well any closeness would feel clingy to someone with that history.  As far as the fighting, usually, guys who fight other guys, dont fight girls.  It'd one of those things... BUT you never know.  If you feel afraid, you should probably get out of the relationship.  You can always find someone new.  ALWAYS |`|EoPZnFZlaa	Maybe you should talk to him about getting some therapy.  I don't know if he's a danger to you specifically, but anyone with that much pent up anger is a danger to someone, perhaps even himself.  Let him know that life can be peaceful when you know the correct way to deal with its stresses.  If you love him, let him know you care and are only concerned with his peace of mind.  Good luck and Blessed Be!!|`|AA10256680	When a guy says that a girl is too clingy, and when he mutilates another human being, it's a sure sign that he is very bad news.<br>  <br>  But go ahead and remain in a relationship with him.  Oh, I'm sure he'll change his ways for you.  Your love is stronger than his rage.  NOT!!<br>  <br>  If you stay with him, you're sure to get hurt.  Perhaps not right away, but not too far in the future.  And it won't be just emotional pain, he will eventually hurt you physically.<br>  <br>  DON'T BE THAT FOOL!|`|eydt3Rewaa	you should NEVER be afraid of your boyfriend, if you are then something is wronge, he sounds like a future domestic violence perpetrater , if you don't want to be hit or worse i'd think about a new B/F|`|b8Bj1sNRaa	Why was he in the fight in the first place? No, don't leave him. That's just going to piss him of and hes going to go to another girl and possibly hurt her.|`|AA11412068	The question is, are you afraid of him, not should you be... If you feel comfortable with him, then you should be fine.. But if he makes you scared or nervous, you should get out of the relationship before it gets worse.|`|bXYRPl39aa	I've been told I am clingy before, it's not a bad thing some guys think it's cute. just talk to him about it maybe he needs some space.|`|1UsK9g3Daa	no. he should be afraid of you leaving him if he gets mean with you. and clingy means you're always around him, so just give him alittle more space is all|`|cZ1kirWYaa	If he ever gets in your face, get out ASAP! But other than that if hes good to you then no. A fight is a fight.|`|AA11791082	Why would you want to be with a guy who can become so violent?  Nothing fun about that. Find a guy with a kind heart instead of ... this.|`|9hpR4BG5aa	just because he hurt a guy doesn't mean that he will hurt you. once he does hit you, if that ever happens, then leave him then and there. he might think that you are to clingy if he has never had anyone there with him for as long as you have? he might not be to used to it from being past  around form home to home|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Yes, he sounds like he has anger problems, break up with him now!|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	If you are too clingy ... that basically means you are always wanting to be with him ... or right there by his side ... it means that he's got you right where he wants you actually ....<br>  <br>  If I were you I would step back ... and make him want you more by not being clingy ..<br>  <br>  Also, he obviously has some issues due to his past.  Be very carful how he treats you ... it could lead to violence from the way this looks!  If he's already strating to call you "clingy" it may only get worse from here on out ...<br>  <br>  Never settle for less than you deserve ... sounds like you're young ... and being yourng means being naive ... i was there once ... you have plenty of time to meet guys ... the right person will come along!  |`|dnG7fhnbaa	Sounds like he has attachment disorder. Be VERY aware. My little sister has this (we adopted her and she was neglected as a baby by her biological parents.) <br>  <br>  She's only 8 but she's already poked one of my mums cats eyes out and killed him (a few weeks after poking his eye out.) by kicking him across the room.<br>  <br>  People get attachment disorder because their brain hasn't been allowed to form properly because of a lack of care in the first 8 months of their life. They usually find it impossible to feel empathy or form real, loving attachment with people.<br>  <br>  He needs a councilor and you shouldn't be it. Get rid and suggest he gets help. Good luck.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Stay with him, he will get out of that stage when he gets older because my stepdad was hell to live with at first and my mom been with him for 20 something years and he made a big change.|`|wz8gx3gaaa	He seems to be aggressive and violent.  You should mull over your relationship with such a guy.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	Yes...be very careful. Don't let yourself become his punching bag.|`|RIooDZ8zaa	very get out now and stay away for a few days til he cools off|`|iWwsOK5Baa	He told your friend, that your too....erm....idk..sorry =/|`|ldqQDwI4aa	I can be like that.<br>  <br>  I'm in the same situation as him.. I was very badly abused when i was younger, up untill i was 16 was heavy on Drugs. I have a temper, I also have alot of anger and resent for my past, so any one who annoys me has it taken out on them. Quite simple really. <br>  <br>  People say i should have anger management, But i done see i should. If he hasn't hurt you, just because he can fight doesn't mean he will hurt you!!!<br>  <br>  Maybe talk to him ask what happened, Why. Try and be as understanding as possible, You have to realise, its not easy living a life from which you have been abused. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  He may have just had a slight out burst?<br>  <br>  <br>  I think if you talk to him about it first, before you make any decision!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!! |`|AA11602010	you should see this movie if he acts the same then yes plus you should talk to him about it all the time let him know that you see it and other ppl see it you might be of some help to him if he has a problem <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_(film)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_(film)</a>|`|2qQPBDlkaa	depends on why the fight.. <br>  <br>  did he start it or was it something he was forced into.. if he was defending himself, or others and tried to avoid the fight.. why woudl you be worried...<br>  <br>  if otoh he just raged out and went psycho on the guy.. then yeahh worry.<br>  |`|qSQZD6Obaa	Yes, he sounds like he may hurt you if you do something he doesn'tlike.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApN7aJd9eEURMJXUK97RgVDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081120091106AAe5TT9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|oDqQ9n7Iaa	your boy friend went through alot which can make you understand why he would be doing this but thats not an excuse!<br>  he may have some other problems too!
IddUYNR3aa	It sounds like she is truly frightened that you will leave. She might also be a little jealous. You can't give up the job for her, or she'll just have another tantrum the next time around. You don't know if you have the job yet, so tell her that you have given her truthful information to date, that to tell her more than your potential employer allowed you would be to prove that you cannot be trusted. If she starts up again, with or without your parents present, simply tell them that you will not discuss it until you have a reason to. And print out and then delete private emails.|`|3mtDGwaZaa	I think you should write a letter to her telling her everything that is on your mind because in a letter she cant argue with you! It need to be a good letter or she wont trust you and tell her all that you said in the question! GOOD  LUCK!!|`|MRxm67DPaa	sisters have prolems and fight alot i should know but truly u can never lose ur sister shes always going to be ur sister one way or another ok well u know wat i suggest u do well write her a letter about how u feel and when u give it to her be like if u dont wanna hear me out and be there for me the way a real sister should be then atleat read this letter and the hand it to her and walk away then after shes done write in the bottem i miss how we always could talk about things please be there for me and talk to me and then put i know ill always be there for u and then if that dosent work call her phone and leave her a voicemail and tell her how u feel there. good luck hun i hope my advice helped u out|`|pQaOcS6faa	all you need to do is try to talk calmly to her or get some one else to talk calmly to her, she needs to be comfortable and if she isn't then she will get in a fight with you again, you should do what you want to do but not if it your family is more important than the job, which it sounds like it is.<br>  just do what you think is right and stuff should work out.<br>  p.s. you need to let her know that she can trust you|`|L1ROZJp5aa	Well, you shouldn't let a job come between your family. But on the other hand you can't let your sister ruin your chances of being successful, that's not fair to you at all. I think you should just try telling her(in the nicest way possible of course) that she's being ridiculous and you can't understand why she's not being more supportive of you.|`|AY0OANDPaa	I say you slap some sense into her.<br>  She should be happy for you.<br>  If she has some sort of trust issue tell her that nothing of the sort will happen.<br>  I'm not sure i can be of any help but Try to talk to her.<br>  Ask her why she feels this way and hear her out.|`|11mJ0RHhaa	I think you just say, Hey im getting a high profiled job, im not supposed to tell anyone for 4 weeks, now you think im leaving and thats not the case...<br>  <br>  It couldnt be that hard, but i dont know your sister....|`|f6fe44c4dd4dfec25bc0198c9161f1d9aa	hey Riley,<br>  <br>  wow that sounds exactly like my sister and I, except that im not working yet. Are you two like very close?? Because thats what happens..we fight over a boy that im crazy about, she thinks that i forget and ignoore her and my family, and thats 100 % not the case. we always end up figting wen it cums to him. she always says that i will choose him over her, but i always tell her that blood is thicker than water. Look, u have to sit with her, get her to come to her senses, and tell her the facts. if u have a close friend who happens to always say the right things, let her come with you. Make your sister just LISTEN to you, becasue thats all you need. and like you said, ur not going anywhere!!! so why the need to be all moody and pissy about it right??? make her UNDERSTAND that ur not allowed ot go into details, and that u were waiting for hte rite time to tell her and your parents. I have the same problems, very similar, i really know how you feel.<br>  <br>  Take care hope that helps, and everythign of the best.|`|gCy88McPaa	It's easy what i would do if i were you i would get the number from that job and have your sister talk to whoever spoke with you about the job for example a manger or something, and have that person explain the whole situation to your sister that you are not going anywhere. Make sure that it is really ligit.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|tyZskVk6aa	it sounds like the two of you are grown up enough to choose your own destinies. dont live your life for regrets! this job opporitunity sounds like it is something that you really want. i think your sister is more upset that the two of you may not be as close as you used to. she found out be email instead of a conversation with you. she is just hurt and is dealing with it the best way that she knows how. at the end of the day you girls are sisters and nothing will come betweent that. if finances are truly the issue, i would leave her the rent early to prove to her that you are not in fact leaving her. this is going to get worse before it gets better. you are going to have to argue with her again and again, but you both need to be heard. tell her how much you love her, and how much this job means to you. maybe it is time for you to branch out on your own if she is choosing to be unsupportive. only you can make these descisions, and they are al tough ones, but let her know where you stand and what your expectations are. some of us are aftaid to watch others be successfull because we ouselves havent gone down that road yet. allow your sister the time and space she needs, and the rest should fall into place. good luck|`|10f222623a1a024def2d4256b1d53ce7aa	move forward with your life to better it ..You are not your sister's keeper and really she had no right to read a e-mail address to you any way|`|001fdff241c5ac2eea5ff3e20360461faa	well do not reject the job. Accept the job offer and when you start it she'll see that you're not leaving her. Its all a matter of time. She should be happy for you, she just has some insecurities.
3MDY29gnaa	Well weddings are expensive. Idk if you are planning a big wedding or not but if so it will be time to get to work if your trying for this summer. You have a few months left (not long at all) I would say maybe if you dont want a big wedding to go down to the courthouse and get married, and then after you have the baby you can have like a party (reception/ baby shower) Celebrating everything all at once. If not i'd say wait until after you have the baby. Because planning can be very stressful and right now is the time you must stay stress free. Good Luck Hun, <br>  And congrats on both your baby and your engagement. <br>  Have a safe and healthy pregnancy!|`|RuKK1LYiaa	you shouldnt worry too much cause the dress can be altered if need be. i have also run across something i had never seen before but you should look it up, its a wedding cake topper and the bride is pregnant on it. if you havent really told anyone you could do it that way.|`|SBjV8GlFaa	Well, first of all congratulations on both counts! I think it's great you both have decided to get married, and that will be no problem with the wedding. Here in Europe, many girls are already pregnant when they get married, so you just have to find a comfortable dress for the occasion. Don't go all fluffy, find a nice outfit that will be comfy for you, and have a nice small wedding. You will need to save money for your upcoming life together. Maybe a nice family dinner type of celebration. In these difficult times, recession etc., it pays to make it as small and inexpensive as possible. Just enjoy the big day, with your love for each other, and the upcoming birth of your new baby!|`|d1TTwwUUaa	My daughter did by the time came for the wedding she was 7months. Her wedding dresswas beautiful. Just get a high waisted one or umpire. And plan your day as a regular one.She planned hers in 3 months. She had her ceremony at the resturant under a arch. It was beautiful. You can e-mail me if you need any more advise.|`|gXRz3U7Vaa	itd be better to just wait until after the baby is born. that way you will have plenty of enough time to plan things and make sure it is right for you. plus, you'll get to look great at the wedding without having to worry about the pregnancy weight.|`|61720ce500725858e4dbb880a42a20faaa	There is nothing wrong getting marry while you are pregnant.  The point is you are getting married and your child will be legitimate.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Get married next summer. <br>  It will give you an extra year to plan your special day. And you wont have to worry about finding a wedding dress while pregnant.<br>  <br>  And congratulations on your engagement!!

4IQRDtoAaa	I was married a month ago at a venue what was about 2 hours away.  Just like you, we LOVED the venue and is was soooooo cost-effective.  We also experienced the whole "omg it's so far, what a pain in the neck" etc....but you know what, if they love you and support your dreams, they will be there.  And if there are those who decide it's too much to "deal with" and don't attend, take a look at what that really says about how they feel about you and your wedding day...<br>  <br>  You cannot make everyone happy...and on your wedding day YOU have to be happy.  Do what your heart tells you to do.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	It's your day mom will come around and be excited. Get her a hotel for the weekend and a day before at a spa for the two of you.|`|EyhML4GPaa	honestly i say f that ... isnt it your wedding.. and your special day. weddings arent about pleasing anybody but yourself and your love. your the ones who are paying for the wedding and your the ones who are going to remember this for the rest of your life. you didnt tell her how to do her wedding she should not tell you. shes being very unreasonable and its not fair to you

This symbolizes that your relationship has no beginning or end.  Its usually used as an anniversary band, or wedding band.  The stones don't necessarily have to be diamonds.  An engagement ring typically has a center stone or focal point and may be accompanied by smaller stones on the shoulders.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	No, its not the same thing, a woman gets engaged, then married and then gets an eternity ring at some point in the future. It could be on the first anniversary, or the birth of their first baby or some other significant time in the marriage.<br>  Neither an engagement ring nor an eternity ring are absolutely necessary but you get married with the wedding ring so thats important.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if you were given an eternity ring as an engagement ring then it is your engagement ring.<br>  <br>  I've seen them used as engagement rings, as wedding rings and as anniversary rings.  While it's a style of ring, not a specific ring, I usually see them marketed as wedding bands and anniversary rings.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	An eternity ring is another name for an anniversary ring.|`|AA11510511	It a different ring, It states that you want to be with your partner for ETERNITY.|`|dIS08i1oaa	An eternity ring is a band with diamonds all the way around it.<br>  <br>  When the Diamond Promotion Service first introduced the design their slogan was "tell her you would marry her all over again".  So it was originally meant to be an anniversary ring, but that was many years ago.<br>  <br>  Today, eternity rings are often used as diamond bands to go with an engagement ring.  The engagement ring is given when a fellow asks you to marry him.  The band is given at the wedding ceremony.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	An eternity ring is simply a ring with diamonds that go all the way around the band.  I've seen people use them as engagement rings, wedding bands, anniversary bands, or "just because" gifts.  There's no particular "right" way to use the ring, it's entirely up to you.  My engagement ring has a center diamond and the setting is a "half eternity" setting.  The diamonds only go half way around the band.  The wedding band matches and is also "half eternity."  <br>  <br>  Basically, you can do whatever you want!  While it's not typically used as an engagement ring, you can do it if you want!  Good luck!|`|TNH8QMOaaa	The Eternity Ring and the Engagement Ring are altogether a different concept. Engagement Ring is a ring given during the time of engagement and worn as a sign of betrothal. While on the other hand, an eternity ring is a half or full circle of small diamonds set in precious metal and given by a man to his wife on anniversaries. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  B2CJewels.com<br>  <a href="http://www.b2cjewels.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.b2cjewels.com/</a>|`|4IQRDtoAaa	Eternity Ring typically refers to a ring with diamonds which encircle the entire band.  This ring is ordinarily given as an anniversary gift, but could be used as a wedding band, though I've rarely heard of it's use as an engagement ring.|`|5KcUyLFRaa	They are the same in the sense that they symbolise a lasting commitment to your relationship. <br>  But an etenity ring can be given without any commitment to a marriage.|`|Ss6MeyDYaa	No, an eternity ring is not the same as an engagement ring - not its purpose anyway. Eternity ring can look as though they are an engagement ring though|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	when I was young eternity rings were give on the first anniversary  to prove you would be together forever. or in my case 20 years and then divorce.|`|EKTdE0Kcaa	They are different, custom is that an eternity ring is bought for a wife after the birth of the first child

After spraying them you can then do this to them and everyone will do the same because it is really true. good luck to you.<br>  <br>  BTW, sounds like one or both of them like you though and this is how young guys go about getting your attention. You could also try telling them that what they smell is a girl and that they must be gay if they don't like it. Say it very loud so everyone can hear it though.|`|oT3d4Yu0aa	sue them for slander and harassment. That will show them. Then who will be the last one laughing. or just ignore them. Don't say anything to them and don't show any signs of it affecting you. While your sitting in class and they say something, just sit there and don't even move or anything when they say something. Eventually, they will get bored because they are getting no reaction from you. When you walk down the stairs and they come up and say something. Just keep walking and don't even turn aroung or say anything.|`|eVK2zZsOaa	It could be that he likes you and is going about it in a goofy way. Pull him aside and ask what is his problem. I would confront him instead of letting him continue to pick on me. If you know that you don't smell then find out why he feels the need to embarrass you. If he doesn't stop and it is bothering you that bad, you need to talk to a school administrator or get your parents involved.|`|9g2OAB8Maa	Don't let it get to you.

The best advice I can give you is to ignore them. If they realize that they are not getting to you anymore they will stop. It may take awhile, but stay true to yourself and don't let them get to you. They are only making themselves look like fools. If they are distracting you from class you may want to see if you can find another seat. Maybe talk to the teacher when there is no one else around and see if she or he can do something about the seating arrangement with out it being obvious. I know this probably isn't the answer you were looking for, but honestly, if you scream and shout at them it will only make it worse.|`|tIEpxNYpaa	this was a tuff one butt wat a do when ppl tell me that my shoes swaet i give them  the excuse that i played football for the school cause i did butt if it keeps going i just ignore it and let carma get her and soon every one will call her/'him names and they wont bother you any more i was class as a as a nerd untill 5 grade then i have got popular and the person that was messin with me he got srewed up really bad becuase  i kick his butt  i would say the a bomb butt i dont want to get reported butt jion a sport or some thing thats wat i did and then ppl stoped teasing me about my shoes and i eaither became their friend or i kicked their asses yea dont report me for swearing i hope this will help you inthe future peace out dude|`|wntdMR8caa	Tell them it's sexual harassment and go to the office to write a complaint about it.

0Z0vvvdRaa	Sounds alot like my husband before we got married actually (we only got married a week ago, so we're still in that starry-eyed honeymoon phase. lol). It sounds to me like he really takes you for granted. You have to decide whether ot not you can live with that. There's no right or wrong choice here, what matters is what you think is best. <br>  <br>  You can't change a man. That much I've learned. :) You can't make him see what he's doing to you either. I'm not saying that he won't change, but if he does it'll be because he wants to, so don't bother with ultimatums or threats or crying. Just ask yourself, "Is this how I want to spend the rest of my life? Can I be happy this way?" If, even though your fiance doesn't treat you as well as he should, you still want to be with him, then stay. If you know that in a year, or 5, or 20, that you'll be miserable and just want out, then leave. And if you leave tell him exactly why you're leaving- because he makes you feel like he doesn't value you at all. Maybe he'll realize the mistakes he's made at that point, but I doubt it. With some guys, the only way to get any respect is to leave. <br>  <br>  So far, marriage has really changed a few things about my relationship. We both are a lot more grateful for each other and we feel a little more responsible for the other's happiness. But like I said, I've only been married a week, so I don;t know that it's going to stay this way. But I knew going into this that even if he's kind of a jerk sometimes, that there's no one in the world I'd rather be with.|`|HcboXOmjaa	Leave him! You deserve better than that! Do you really want to be in a relationship like that for the rest of your life? I can't believe he is treating you like that and youarent even married yet, just think about how much worse it is going to get years down the road when you marry him!|`|5voteJLRaa	Break it off! It doesn't sound like someone you should be with let alone marry. It won't change once you say I do..so get out while you can.|`|VqilAWDGaa	I say get out of this.

It has all the classic signs of a domestic violence relationship and will only get worse if she stays. No one deserves to live like that. If you are truly a friend, help her leave whenever he isn't home.|`|dPgP28Aiaa	I'd leave him. I couldn't spend the rest of my life with a guy who treats me like crap. You should get out while you still can sweetie, you don't need to put up with his crap, you can find somone much better.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Get unengaged fast. It will only get worse in time.|`|3MDY29gnaa	I would leave. I need to be respected, and this is so not respectful at all. Sounds like he's not interested anyway!|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	He is a jerk. She should leave him.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	That is ridiculous. No one in their right mind would put up with any of that behavior. He has some serious avoidance behaviors and they need to be tackled. If this was my fiance I would ask him what the hell his problem was. There may be some bigger issues that need to be discussed. If he has always acted this way then he wouldn't be my fiance in the first place. I would find me a new fiance if this continued after talking to him.|`|RR35cmBdaa	he might have someone else i know this sounds bad but he does not seem like he whats to be there or maybe there is something on his mind try talking to him if still nothing its not worth it its hard hope everything works out|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Look for a new Man, that's pathetic your going to marry him? All his fault will multiply after you marry him. Move on to bigger and better you deserve it.|`|hHAdA9V9aa	Ask him whats up. Something must be. Sounds like he takes you for granted a bit too much...maybe you should have a weekend away with friends or family, enjoy yourself and destress and see if he misses you|`|BObu4i9saa	i would leave<br>  this is abuse and it will escalate - eventually it will become physical violence<br>  get out now|`|kyqhMuSiaa	I wouldn't be setting a wedding date thats for sure.|`|KSC9fCwOaa	he dont like u|`|HJbSHMxtaa	It sounds like you have become a doormat.  I have been married for a long time and when we were first married I used to complain all of the time when my husband got home and he would just get annoyed by me.  Try not saying anything negative and see if his attitude changes.  Read the book "the proper care and feeding of husbands" by Dr. Laura Schlessinger.  It will help you see things from another perspective.  If he still doesn't change, then you have the option to leave and end the relationship.

She probably just doesn't want to listen to what you have to say, she'll find out how it is when she gets there. I know I will too. Let her off and she will find new friends, and your a guy, remember. She's a girl, so she will probably have a different experience, so just let her off.

AA11286455	The intensity of your feelings toward your mother are understandable.  Your whole life has been totally overturned.  <br>  <br>  Just realize that you're becoming 16--and not 6.  You're not going to die over this.  <br>  <br>  Part of growing up and maturing is learning to move on with your life and not being totally rigid about other people, ideas, or things.  <br>  <br>  Now, if your mother were an axe-murderer or child pornographer, all bets are OFF.  <br>  <br>  A start would be to say you:  Want to refuse the ring, a card will do, tyvm.  A brief chat would also be respectful and in order to accept her congratulations on turning 16.  <br>  <br>  No matter what's happened or how anybody feels, the woman obviously has a heart, loves you, and wants to celebrate you.  <br>  <br>  Be graceful.  Let her.|`|GChWTGNiaa	No. You can accept it, but you have to talk to her.

BCMO8TE3aa	NO. there is no excuse or forgiveness for abuse.<br>  i'm sure you love him but its not worth it<br>  even if he says he wont do it again<br>  sweetie most of them do it again<br>  be careful.|`|Z7or8973aa	(not married but if i were) No, he would not be forgiven. He would no longer be married. Nothing could make me forgive him--love or not there is NO reason for violence. Apologizing would be something that would be nice but in that case I don't think sorry helps. He wouldn't apologize because I probably wouldn't be around long enough to hear it and or accept it. <br>  <br>  There is never a situation where a man or a woman have a right to beat eachother. Everything can be talked about--discussed calmly. If a situation gets too heated maybe you should just walk away. |`|bobaZ7uSaa	Most batterers apologize afterwards. Usually, they abuse infrequently. It doesn't matter if you would forgive the husband... what matters is your safety. In your heart you may understand that maybe he might have been abused as a child or he has some psychological issues and therefore he is hurting too. But, in the meantime while he is fixing himself, the person getting abused needs to get out of there... because he is very likely to abuse again in the future... maybe even worse the next time.|`|yKlZ0Ng7aa	To answer your first question:  NO. Hell no!!  What could make me forgive him?  Nothing.  It is an unforgivable act.    If he hasn't apologized, it's because he's not sorry!  He thinks he has the right to hit you, so it's not necessary to say he's sorry.  To him, that would be like apologizing for blinking.  If he does it once, he will do it again.<br>  <br>  This man has problems, and it will only get worse if you don't put a stop to it now.  Report him to the police, and while he's in jail, pack your things and get out.  Get a restraining order against him so he can't come near you again.  Divorce the man, and get on with your life.  No one deserves to be hit, no matter what they said or did, or didn't do.  Nothing makes that okay.  If you let him get away with it, that will let him think that you're not upset about it, and it will make it easier for him to do it again.  Please, don't do that to yourself.  You deserve better than that.  You don't deserve to be hit.  You deserve to be respected, loved, cherished, and honored.<br>  <br>  I hope that I've helped, and I wish you luck.|`|eS7aGcfcaa	No one can answer this question but yourself. It all depends on you. You married this man, you know him as a whole.  Does he have control issues, aggressive with everyone, set in his ways, realize when he's wrong (time frame) not a factor? People make mistakes and inevitably try to repair it. By the sounds of it he doesn't care. He HASN'T APOLOGIZED or TALKED TO YOU. It may be painful but you should go it's better to hurt for a little while than to hurt emotionally and physically forever. |`|w6r4U7duaa	I hope this didnt happen to you, cause i will tell you now it is wrong to phyically abuse your wife. Even a slap accross the face is wrong! pushing, swearing badly at her.<br>  He wont apologise and mean it anyway. When a man is this way, its almost like having been brought up like a spoilt bratt, and trying to change them. It ant gonna happen in a hurry. The gurl has to leave him, and teach him a damn good lesson. If he really loves you, he will stop on demand. otherwise, in some cases, they never do sorry.<br>  And  if i didnt love him, I would be gone for good!<br>  Forgive him, i guess i would have to to move on. trust him and feel safe around him,......not likely to ever again.<br>  So i gues what I am saying I would leave immedialtly, and even report him for my own safty. I would prob still love him cause thats kinda hard to stop, but I would do this because i loved him and wanted to help him. even if it meant never seeing him again.|`|ntLxRSEaaa	Hmm if my husband beat me...

If you still wanna know why then you are heading for a wrong direction.|`|OIVz7muHaa	No I wouldn't. What is stopping him from doing it again. and how do you know he won't do it again?|`|ipPjVP8Iaa	no never. if he did it once what makes you so sure he wont do it again and again ?|`|vaBEoMwCaa	I'm not a girl so y'know if I was the guy that beat my wife I could never forgive myself|`|CswhJpyfaa	F-----ING NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|PBdPD748aa	No I would definately not forgive him! If a husband loves, respects and value his wife as a person he wouldn't lay his hands on her!!! That is unacceptable!!! No woman should ever accept her partner touching them in an agressive way. It's a matter of a lack of self worth and confidence if a woman was to stay with a man that did such a terrible thing. It is not actions of one who loves their wife.<br>  <br>  If he hasn't apologised or spoken then that is a matter of greater disrespect! It shows he has no value or no care for the one he hurt. The reason for this could be simply because he does not care, has shut off his feelings or is in denial. Fact is, there is no future for a relationship that went through a situation like that. How could she say? She will be walked over and treated like dirt all her life by this man! All because she is accepting it and allowing his actions! No way, thats crazy!! Its not love!|`|5FXx0Mymaa	Apologizing means nothing to me.<br>  <br>  I'm reminded everyday. I have permanent physical damage from such a beating.|`|HivQdKgwaa	No, to me that is unforgivable . Any real man who truly loves you will never lay a hand on you .<br>  <br>  Whether he apologized or not, his *** would be out on the street .

ewDKMeJkaa	im so terribly sorry to hear that =[<br>  <br>  i think it may be a good idea for ur older kids to see some kind of specialist to help them deal with this<br>  <br>  they may begin strange behaviour that is a part of grief<br>  <br>  i think its fantastic that you're being so strong for them, but remember, hes your son so you and your husband need to grieve too<br>  <br>  perhaps you could make a scrapbook with the kids ? with all their favourite pics together and their best memories, it also may be a good idea to bring out some old home videos if you have any<br>  <br>  i would say take them to the funeral service but not the burial, seeing their brother being buried may be too much for them<br>  <br>  i would suggest you allow them to be a part of the funeral in some way. make up a slideshow or help them write a poem or something, it will make them feel they are saying a good proper goodbye. if they feel ok being involved like that.<br>  <br>  try to reassure them that declan is in a better place and he will always be with them. im sure they will have seen him suffering if it was cancer, so tell them he is no longer in any pain and he is happy. it will hopefully give them comfort. <br>  <br>  again im terribly sorry for your loss, all the best, x|`|a193b0793e7a03094639e76b99ad9e23aa	my heart goes out to you at this sad time<br>  but you need to involve them in some of the funeral <br>  i think maybe the service would be a good idea but maybe not the burial.  they may be a bit too young for that.<br>  keep talking about your son and leave it so they are free to ask you anything they need to about him and his illness<br>  <br>  good luck|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I am really sorry for your lose of your son.  It is horrible to have to go through this.  I lost my father in law and we have 3 children 11, 8 and 6.  The kids had a hard time as well and things are getting better though they have bad days.<br>  <br>  The way I approached their grand-dad's passing, is by talking about all the fun times we had together with him.  I also spoke to there teachers who also been very supportive at school.<br>  <br>  -  In regards to your children, it would be better for them to do to the service only.  Burial might be too much for them.<br>  <br>  -  There are child counsellors/psychologists who can help the kids.<br>  <br>  -  I can feel from your question that you and your husband are really working hard for keeping strong for your 3 children and I am sure you guys are doing extremely great work.  Just keep supporting your children but Please don't forget to support yourself and each other.<br>  <br>  I know it is hard to looking after yourself but you need to look after yourself.  You won't be able to look after anyone else, if you are not looking after yourself.<br>  <br>  There are charity agencies that you guys could talk to when time is tough and you need someone to talk to.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i am sorry for your loss i know u have heard this over and over..but no one can really imagine what it is to loose a child till u been there.. you 7 and 4 yr old have seen it  all and knows what has happen to their brother..they may not understand why.. but they should be told their brother has gone to a place where there is no more suffering and pain.. that might bring them some comfort.. but i think u should ask them if they want to go to either one  burial or awakening.. explain to them what they will see but also that its the last good bye for their brother.. give them the choice..but be by them at all times.. some parents and people may say dont take them ..i say talk to them let give them that choice so when they grow up ..they dont feel they were left out  on this..and yes.. do get counseling for the entire family.. u will all needed to  be able to  continue life..  i know there isnt words to take the pain away.. but just remember  god promised we would all be reunited one day.. let it be everyones comfort ..|`|h6eFkvL8aa	My condolences on your family's loss. I would recommend that the two older children be involved in your son's services and burial. The older sibling could act as a pallbearer, or read something, like a prayer at the service. The younger could be "in-charge" of having people sign the guest book. By allowing them to have duties at the service you do two things, first, they are active at the service, they are not pushed into a corner where they can get bored. Second they will be aware that they are part of the family, and are doing something important at their brother's services. This will be a hard time for all of you. You have had sometime to prepare for the death, but you all will still grieve for some time. Make sure you don't push anyone away, keep your family close. This will allow all of you to support each other. I might suggest that you have some family member to watch your youngest, this will allow you to focus on the services without a one year old running around. I would suggest that all your children write notes, or draw pictures showing the good times they had with your son. These could be placed in the casket before it is closed for the final time. Again, this will allow them to be involved. I hope that I have given you some ideas, I will keep you, and your family in my thoughts.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I am very sorry for your loss, this must be so hard for you all.<br>  <br>  Regarding your children, you can ask them if there are any little gifts they might like to give their brother, like a teddy bear or a toy that he liked, or maybe a letter or something, so that he has some company going into the next world. Perhaps they can put these into the casket as part of a private ceremony? <br>  <br>  Afterwards, you can encourage them to create a small family shrine to him, with photos and other mementoes. A family that lives near me lost a child a few years ago, they build a special place in their garden with stones and nice plants and solar lights and put up a little plaque there too. Mind you, the surviving kids in that family are older than yours, but it really helped the whole family pull together. <br>  <br>  I would definitely talk to a therapist about this, not just for them but for you and your partner also.
lV3L5ucuaa	They are so hot, esp. with<br>  skater hair.|`|4lqwMnhJaa	I think that really skinny jeans on guys is not attractive, but if it's kinda loose, then it's hot =]|`|tUSx6V0Paa	if ur emo or gay i think u can pull it off... but itd be pretty gross...<br>  but if u a skater.... UHHHH!!! SSOOOOO SEXY!|`|UP33GlBwaa	I dont like really skinny jeans on guys.  I did see a guy yesterday, probably in his thirties and he had on a pair of destroyed jeans like from American Eagle, and he looked really good.  He wasnt so young either, probably in his thirties and I thought they looked really good on him.  I guess it also depends on the guy.  All guys are built different, just like girls, and cant all wear the same styles.  So, if they look good on you, then that's what counts.|`|nqrWWOmVaa	usually - fittt (:<br>  <br>  i love the emo/skater look on guys :)<br>  <br>  hottest look everrr<br>  <br>  |`|EkCzXUM2aa	seriously THE hottest thing a guys can wear!<br>  well unless there mad chubby lol |`|FZ80qm3Eaa	I personally don't like skinny jeans on anyone, guys or girls.

I like guys that wear A&F jeans/clothes (specifically my bf looks HOT in them) ... no offense but skinny jeans, to me, seem kind of girly.

I prefer normal pants on doods, not skinny ones.|`|q6oSSToNaa	ahaha.. yesss.<br>  SEXYTIIIME<br>  no but seriously. it's obviously subjective it pretty much depends on the guy, but most of my friends and i think it's amazingly hot. |`|1yrONC7Iaa	if you can pull it off yes it alright. <br>  it all depends<br>   i mean i can thing of alot of guys who could never wear them and some that could. |`|jO3eQP5iaa	GOD THEY ARE SOOOOO FREAKIN' HOT ON GUYS, ESPECIALLY WITH CONVERSES. |`|iUbohp42aa	personally its a no no for me....If your gonna wear skinny jeans where them with a t- shirt and a scruffy jacket.<br>  Or just with a casual t-shirt|`|8Yh9vNSgaa	Ummm im not too sure about this one!

yuofu4sQaa	If your parents are having problems, you have to realize that it is completely NOT your fault. It sounds to me like your father is just on edge because he is going through some things you, I, or anyone else may not be able to understand. In this case the problem is his, not yours. I suggest you develop a means, besides crying, to release your tension. Take up an art, like painting or drawing and use that as a way to reveal your emotions deeper than words. When you feel like crying, don't, channel that energy into something positive. When you are old enough, you will understand that parents are never going to be perfect, because in a way they are just like us. What they are doing shouldn't reflect on you....you are your own little person. One day it will be so much better...and you can just get away from it all.|`|AA11286455	Your suspicions may very well be on target.  I know my dad thought we were all stupid.  Probably my mom thought us kids were too over what he was doing.  <br>  <br>  1--Realize that you are NOT responsible for your father's actions and not for your mother's lack of knowledge.  You're certainly not responsible for changing them or for making things "come out right" in THEIR marriage.  THEY are.  <br>  <br>  2--NEVER confront your father again.  You'll get nowhere and very possibly harmed--as he has already done if not worse.  <br>  <br>  3--In the meantime, the poster who said <br>  "count your blessings" is to some minimal degree correct.  Things could be worse betw. your parents or with them separating.  <br>  <br>  4--Another really, really good blessing from living in this household is that YOU get to decide what kind of wife you want to be, what kind of husband you want to have, what you will and won't tolerate in a relationship or marriage.  What kind of home life you want to create for yourself and your children.  <br>  <br>  You now definitely know and can remember what you DON'T want and can now focus on all the things you DO.  <br>  <br>  It's amazing the number of adults who marry exactly the woman like "dear old mom" or behave exactlly as "dear old dad" even after swearing on a stack fo bibles they would never.  <br>  <br>  Know that you have the will and power to remember and to do things differently.  You CAN do it better.  You just have to stay aware and make the conscious effort.  <br>  <br>  Even if you're walking down the aisle on your father's arm and you "suddenly" are counting off all the times your fiance wasn't where he said he was, with who he said he was...you have the right and the power to pry your fingers off your father's hand and march back down and out.  Feel no embarrassment or shame.  Count your blessings that you don't have to live the shame, cost, and embarrassment of divorce and, worse, that there are children involved.  <br>  <br>  5--My mom was too weak to walk away.  I thought she was a fool and vowed to never, ever be anything like her and often had a hard time respecting her bc of it.  In fact, understand in advance that you may have some degree of trouble respecting your dad, now and in the future.  That's normal.  <br>  <br>  Worse, the tension in the household bc of their relationship was unbearable.  It was very damaging to us kids.  i often prayed that they would divorce already.  The fact that they stayed together was scarring and damaging and affected my personality and emotional health.  So...., <br>  <br>  try not to "internalize" what your dad is doing, how wrong or unfair it is, or what your role or responsibility about it is.  It can severely, negatively affect you when you're dating or deciding to marry.  <br>  <br>  It did me--it was only until my 40's that I realized that I carried a lot of private shame and guilt over what my dad had done and the kind of home life it created and NONE OF IT WAS EVER MY FAULT.  <br>  <br>  That shame and fear were two of the BIG reasons why I refused to marry.  <br>  <br>  It's hard, but, again, don't take responsibility for THEM, their marriage, or for saving the family as a whole.  <br>  <br>  Concentrate on being a good big sister...and the day when you move out.  Permanently.  <br>  <br>  P.S.  And preferably AFTER your dad finishes paying for your college.  This is being crafty like him...but "in a good way" and for very good reasons.  Feel no guilt at all about this honey.  Just get yourself ready to live your life and move on the best you can.  That's YOUR job and responsibility.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	This is not your fight step back and let your mother handle this.|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Don''t do anything. If you get involved and they split up you will just end up blaming yourself. Let them work out their own marriage problems. Just do your things and plan for your own future and work on that.|`|wlqUMBZbaa	count your blessings|`|nbmpSkmsaa	i have been you except with out a little brother i know how you feel i just told my closed friend or u mite have a family menber but i cud'nt trust 1 of them i was afraid they wud say something but to be honest theres noting you can say or do 2 stop it|`|qgpXxcuGaa	Sorry love, there's nothing you can really do to help. Your dad could well be messing things up, particularly as he got so ridiculously defensive when you asked him where he was, (people who get defensive usually have a guilty conscience!) and if he is having an affair, I am really sorry. My parents broke up last year so I know how hard it is. But hopefully they'll work something out, right? It's between your mum and dad now, best not to get caught up in it or you'll end up feeling it's your fault or something when actually, it's not at all. I hope things work out ok x|`|6ZFHJ2gTaa	ok well i think you should think about wat happen last time and yes it might end badly but you just have to be there for you mom at the end of the day cause shes goin to need you more then ever. so just be there for her and thing well get easyer
ZFgjX4Hmaa	Well I am pretty much in the same situation. The best you can do right now is to try not to complain too much about what's happening...not that I'm saying that you are or anything.<br>  <br>  You might want to try sitting down and talking to your parents. Try not to use phrases and words like, "You" and "always!" and try to keep your cool. Explain to them how you're feeling...but don't bring up the sister thing right away.<br>  <br>  You also might want to talk to your sister. The thing is though, if you're nice to her, she'll eventually mature and grow up, as hard as that may seem. (Happened with me and my sister was THE WORST.) Getting even with her or complaining is not the answer. Talk to her about it, and if she doesn't change her ways, just ignore her. You don't want to do something horrible and stupid and then be embarrassed about it later on. Complaining and fighting doesn't fix anything! (Again, just saying. NOT saying that you actually do this.)<br>  <br>  Remember, your parents might not realize they are doing this! Try not to doubt me on this. They might not act on your words right away, either. Give them some time to think about things(:<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!<br>  Much love, <br>  Octavia|`|LrxTy3zLaa	This is sickeningly familiar.... & unfortunately it never ends.<br>  <br>  I never got the: "Shut up you idiot...she's talking." bit but I can relate to the rest of it.<br>  <br>  I don't think there's a thing that you can do to change the situation. I tried for more than 40 years... & nothing has ever worked.<br>  My husband's advice: "It's their loss... move on".<br>  <br>  I know it hurts but you may have to do just that.|`|bd12e48132951f215b7fe910f10580d4aa	I don't know if this will make you feel any better or not, but I always thought my sister was the favorite.  One day after we had grown up, we talked and she said she felt like I was the favorite.  We probably were treated equal and just didn't know it?|`|Q2dT5v9Baa	okay, i'm not generally the type to talk to my parents if something is wrong, but if something is DEFINITELY wrong, like your problem here, i think you should go straight up to them and talk to them.<br>  <br>  and let's face it, all little siblings are frustrating. my baby cousin bites and scratches me, and then tells his dad that i hurt him. how do you think i feel? my uncle's a darling though, he's always on my side.<br>  <br>  unfortunately, it isn't the case for you. ignore your parents. ignore your sister, she'll get the point that you're more than mad. <br>  <br>  good luck?|`|UJO8EUPGaa	Wow, next time your parents tell you to shut up,<br>  walk right up to them and slap them right on their faces.<br>  And have a cat or dog, all you have to do it piss in a cup<br>  and put it all over your sisters bed, and they will think its your cat or dog.<br>  Or You could always just tape your sister to the wall in your closet and leaver her to starve.....|`|djUMvICoaa	She must be the baby of the family and some parents have trouble letting the baby grow up.  The way they are treating her she is going to have a lot of issues to contend with when she is older.  The problem is that you are too, the burdens and lack of attention is probably going to make you do things you otherwise wouldn't have done, things to get out of the house, teen sex, wrong men and the list goes on.  Until your parents see what they are doing you don't have a chance, but I doubt that they will listen to anybody else, they didn't want to listen to you.

zG740RHuaa	no, i wouldn't worry about it. some guys hate talking on the phone, no matter who it's with. just go with the flow of your relationship...if you're happy and he's happy, don't worry about what anyone else says. never try to make a relationship follow "rules" or "go by the book." it's much healthier to just do things the way that make you both happy. |`|KmM811Qgaa	You've only been going out for 3 weeks, calling every day should definatetly not be a priority for you.

Start asking your girlfriends if they know anyone. See if any of your friend's dates have a friend, brother, etc. that might be willing to go. Group dates are always a good way to ease tension with someone you don't know that well.<br>  Is there any rule that says you absolutely have to have a date anyway? I went to my high school prom once with a date and once without, and had SO much more fun going stag. Then you can dance with everyone else's dates without the burden of keeping up with your own! I'm sure you might find a person or two in your same situation that will go with ya- keep a look out as prom gets closer.<br>  Good luck!|`|5FJYjVTqaa	Go fight for yo man!!!

4IQRDtoAaa	My father-in-law did wear a tux in our wedding...matched my father's. It was perfect, as we had a pretty formal wedding...but it'll depend on how formal your wedding is as well as what role the groom's father will play.  My father-in-law read a poem during our ceremony and was "on stage"...but if your future father-in-law will just be sitting in the pews, he should be allowed to decide what it is he'd like to wear.|`|iDfRTLklaa	That would depend on whether or not it is a formal wedding.  Also if the father of the bride is dressed in a tux, I would think the father of the groom would wear one as well.|`|whmkGDG8aa	Yes if the Father of the Bride and groomsmen do.  If the Groomsmen do and and the father of the bride wears a suit then no he doesn't have to.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	My father in law wore a tux that matched my dad's at my wedding.  It was almost the same as the groomsmen except the vest and tie were a different color.  He doesn't have to wear a tux, only if you want him to.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  YES, where I live the father of the groom always wears a tux.  Why should the father of the groom be different from the father of the bride?  I have never seen it any other way....but I suppose, if he chose to wear a suit, then that would be OK too.

VG2X9Ihkaa	Hi Gilian,<br>  <br>  Have you tried to talk to your mum, how she makes you feel when she talks to you about your weight and how she puts you down?<br>  <br>  It seems that your mum is more concern about her reputation then about you.  I would suggest for you to go out with your mum to a neutral ground and discuss how she makes you feel but make sure you don't come across agressive and not to bring in your sister in to your conversation.<br>  <br>  This chat should be all about your own feelings and not to be compared with your sister.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good luck.|`|6sqxrlIlaa	just ask her straight. if you corner her and ask her, she has to answer. then you'll figure out.|`|va8GJAJDaa	Slap her in her f u ck iiing arrrrrssssss e!!!
2hcA3VP9aa	i think you should stay friends with your friends because she went out with him before you and her meet. i think it would be best if you did not go out with this boy because if he flirts with a lot of people, you might think that he is cheating on you. i hope this helps and good luck.
0XI5eP70aa	Start by praying to God and asking him for peace of mind and the strength to forgive and let go. Another thing to do is to try to make the best of the situation. You can't really do anything to change your dad but you can do a lot to change yourself. Start seeing yourself as a great future boyfriend or husband for whatever girl your into....you have some experience already in taking a lot of responsibilities at home. Treat her the way that you wish your dad could treat your mom. Most importantly pray.

ldQj3bjRaa	You're probably feeling terrible, I would be just the same. I don't see how you can call these people your friends as friends wouldn't do that to one another. You should tell them about how badly they have hurt you, but give them a chance to explain and if they can't give a fair explanation then move on - they are obviously not friends.<br>  <br>  Just because nobody asked you it doesn't mean that nobody wants to go with you. For all you know, there may be somebody who really wants to ask you, but can't pluck up the courage. Also, girls get turned down, it does happen but you have to forget about this, think about what he is missing out by not going with you.<br>  <br>  You should still go to your homecoming. Be brave and go because it may end up being the best time of your life, you never know what may happen. I know this isn't great help, but I hope everything works out well in the end for you :)|`|6frCIiOmaa	I feel horrible to hear that. I wish I had a super hot, super rich, little brother to send you! I know it feels horrible right now, but I was unable to make it to my homecoming, and ten years later, its not that big a deal. But your only human and of course it going to hurt, I wish I could do more than just tell you that things will get better.|`|hF79vU8kaa	First let me say sorry.  I know it's a big deal when you're in school.<br>  <br>  You should be proud that you asked a guy.  Most people have problems doing that.  It's his loss that he said no.  Trust.<br>  <br>  Tell your friends how you felt, but don't accuse them.  They probably didn't want to tell you about going for dinner because they didn't want to upset you more.  It sounds dumb, but it might be true.  Find out their motivation why, and it might make all the difference.|`|6mA7fxZaaa	you don;t have to make a tragedy out of it, maybe the ones you call friends don't consider you a friend in the true meaning of the word. Oh, and that guy was either a really big piece of .... or maybe he had another date... don't worry something will happen... maybe your friends want to make you a surprise, but i wouldn't count on that if i were you. Maybe is best if u stay home, after all is just a party. Cheer up :)|`|syuNadtJaa	Yeah I agree with the guy who said to get a kick-a** dress. Hes totally right! Ignore your friends and just hang out with some classmates who you've at least talked to before. Sit at a table, ask some girls if you can sit with them. You have to make it a good night or else you're going to make yourself miserable. <br>  <br>  XoXoXo,<br>  - <3|`|sFF98bKXaa	go anyway.<br>  nobody asked me to homecoming but the dude i liked forevvvver told me i looked good there, danced with me and asked me out all in one night.<br>  you have no idea what's gonna happen if you don't go.|`|skM1r0M3aa	its ok... il be there for u... :D... u r not alone...

Maybe you did not get invited to the dinner because it is a couples thing.  Talk to your friends and just ask them why you weren't invited.  It that is too hard for you to be direct, say it in a joking way and it might take some of the stress out of it.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	I'm sorry.<br>  It IS a big deal when you're in school.<br>  I wish there was more I could say.<br>  I'm sorry. Don't cry.<br>  If you're not going to the dance, see if you can go out with your family someplace fun.<br>  You're too good for those people|`|AA10409800	Yes, this sucks.  Big time.  I won't lie.  But, your best bet is to get a kick-*** dress and just go.  You'll feel a lot better than if you didn't go at all.  Show everybody that you are above it all.<br>  <br>  And I know you've probably heard this a million times, but it really is true.  It's just high school  High school is over before you know it.  And trust me, most times it's not even the "best years of your life" as people say.  Not even close.  5 years from now, you'll wonder why you even cared.  You can bet on it.|`|AUsvrW8faa	I don't think they went behind your back.  You didn't have a date, so they didn't think you were going to the dance so you weren't invited to the dinner.  Your best friends probably didn't know how to tell you without hurting you (you seem really sensitive.....you're crying you're eyes out right now).  They would probably have to tell you by tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Don't take it too personal.  If you really want to go.....get a dress and tell your friends you're going by yourself.  I'm sure they'll tell you to come over for dinner.  If you can't go.....don't sit home and mope about it.  Go to a cousins house or a friend who lives out of town.  Get something to do so you're busy for the weekend.|`|Ve48V97Baa	you'll live...i never really dealt this back in high school 'cause i was too cool for dances and stuff...lol but yea if you know some older people there's always going out on your own...and anyway, you'll live so don't let this get to you...regarding #2 and #3, that's just immaturity showing up....when people grow up, 1) they wont refuse an offer out of politeness, 2) they wont leave people out...so yea just give it some time... cheers!|`|BgOkiBRbaa	God, some friends. If you still want to go, and can stomach it (I wouldn't be able to), go by yourself, and try to make some new friends while you're there. Also, never talk to your old friends again; they're complete losers.|`|gix0EL8Kaa	I'm really sorry.  You're not along though.  I went to my schools homecoming and spent the whole night siting on the sides texting (except since I don't have many friends I wasn't really texting, I was just pretending to).  And not a single guy asked me either.  Maybe you could just gradually start hanging out with different people that will be nicer to you.  Or maybe only one girl didn't want to invite you, and the rest of your friends just didn't want to hurt your feelings.  |`|UU1YR1Kaaa	I know how you feel, it hurts.  But hang in there, it sounds like they were really not your friends.  Try to make new friends, and maybe the night of the dance go to the movies or do something else.  Have a party at your house and invite older people there.  Go to the mall and hang out.   Just get your mind off what they are doing and do your own thing.|`|cRTD17ekaa	Then are they really YOUR FRIENDS ?? pray for real friends !!! ITS NOT YOU...ITS THEM ( OR IS IT ) ?? Only you can answer this question!!<br>  Look on the bright side; when you go to college you will meet REAL FRIENDS !!! GOD IS ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU WHEN THEY ARE NOT !!! I KNOW ITS HARD BUT YOU MUST MOVE ON !! YOUR BEST FRIEND ON EARTH MAY BE YOUR FUTURE HUSBAND.

IDK, just no that one day ull look back on this and realize it wasnt such a bad thing.  (cuz I promise life can b much worse)  How about just going to the party, (do u have a really hot guy friend from outta town or something that u could get to go with U) that would have everybody wondering.  I would just find something to do that would shock people, yet have them seeing that ur fine and dont give a damn.  Cuz u never wanna let people see u hurting, it just gives em more to play on.  Good Luck!

We are about 6 and 1/2 years apart in age, which made it "fun" for him to pick on me (I'm his little sister!!!)  Other than him pestering me growing up, we had a good brother/sister relationship.  After my parents divorced when we were younger my mom was single for awhile and he had to stay home with me after school and during the summers.  My brother made fun of me, (like any older brother would!) and one time we got in trouble for walking to Egg Roll Express to eat lunch one time.  I think it was because I was still pretty little and my mom was just concerned about us walking across a busy intersection.  Now I am almost 30 and he is 36 and he lives in a different state and has a family now.  We sure did have good times growing up.|`|AA10946581	Sorry to hear about your brother. I have an elder brother and I love him to bits. It is a nice feeling to know that there is someone for you, your own blood, I enjoy being with my brother more than my friends :) it doesnt matter whether its a brother or a sister, having a sibling is more important. And you are one of those lucky ones!|`|YLhTMXSPaa	Well honestly I don't like having an older brother because hes really annoying most of the time. I also have a little sister and shes even more annoying because she copies me all the time and my parents say I should be proud because shes looking up to me but I hate it! I think I would of liked it better if I was an only child. I wish I had an older sister instead of a younger sister though. My cousin is 18 and shes awesome so I would trade my sister for her any day cause shes so much more fun. So you might like having an older brother because I think you bond more if you are the same gender as your sibling. Overall I think having an older sibling is better because they act more mature and wont embarrass you in public.|`|AKdg2RhSaa	i love having an older brother...actually i have three...we fight yes but we are there for each other and they protect me and help me when i need help...i love them to death and i don't know what i would do with out them...i don't have any sisters so i don't know what it is like but i don't mind not having a sister ..I'm actually glad to have brothers....and i don't live with a dad so they are like my dad...so its great to have brothers|`|ALahmTiwaa	well i have two.<br>  sometimes it's good cause you guys can do stuff and hang out and other times they get mad at you for no reason sometimes, but even though they dont show that they care i know they do..it feels pretty good sometimes.<br>  <br>  im sorry for your lost. hopefully you can find a big brother in someone.. noone to replace of course.but yeah|`|ekD0jhvMaa	well, i'm an 18 year old female and i grew up with two older brothers (they are now 22 and 24). it sucked. they teamed up and tortured me! to this day i'm still flinchy as a result of being violently jabbed during my childhood. i guess since i was reared with older brothers it explains why i am "mentally masculine" today, i.e. i'm tough and more aligned with male interests. i would hate to have a sister, because then i'd have to compete with her etc. but coz i'm a girl, i cannot be compared to my brothers in my family. lol. you should be happy you have an older sister, she can provide you with insight for girl problems you may have.  also, my brothers like me to help them find clothing. enjoy your older sister. i've noticed older sisters are usually very nice to the younger bro, but idk about your situation.<br>  paz hermano|`|r5QCaEh3aa	there boring and mean

Tell her you love your husband, but you still love her the same.|`|ofCRTXw9aa	Grow some back bone & talk to her or yell at her. She needs to hear it.

52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I want to get married because I want to spend the rest of my life with one person and with a solid commitment. I also want to have children that aren't bastards - harsh but true.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	Where would you get this idea?  I've never heard of anyone getting married for only this reason.  My husband and I do plan to have kids one day, but we married because we love eachother and want to spend the rest of our life together.  We both definitely want children, but that was not the reason we got married.  We originally decided to wait for 3 years, for financial reasons.  It might be a little sooner than that now, because our financial position is better, but that doesn't necessarily mean we will just decide to have a bunch of kids.  One at a time, every couple of years or so.  :)|`|4POGapREaa	I got married last Summer and we're not having kids.  It's a commitment we made to each other.  If having kids is the only reason to commit, then I see that as more of a contract than anything else & it sounds pretty bleak in terms of love.  My sister is also married with no kids, and my best friend is married with no kids.  I love my husband & who needs me to continue over populating the planet anyway?  I don't think anyone cares.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	If the guy okay with that then whats the problem? Who says that you have to have kids?  If your guy does want kids and you don't he would be a fool to marry you.  But remember if everyone felt the way you do we wouldn't exist, now would we? ;>)|`|8IA3d3NNaa	Nah, otherwise couples who decide not to have kids or couples who are already have kids, or are past childbearing age wouldn't marry. It's a personal decision.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Of course not. People get married because they want their relationship to be acknowledged legally and religiously (if that is important to them.)<br>  <br>  Your dad is jaded.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	It's just an old fashioned train of thought that when you get married you should start popping out babies. The truth of the matter is that more and more people are choosing not to have kids. It can be for many reasons. But the only person that you need to worry about having kids with is your husband. Please, please, please, when you do find a guy that you want to marry be sure that he is ok with the idea of not having a family and for you as well be sure that you won't change your mind. I know I used to think the same way when I was younger. But, now that I am getting a little older (25) and have found the right guy, the idea of having children isn't so appalling. Just be sure to communicate. I know many marriages that have failed due to this lack of communication on such a drastic decision.|`|oYYblXFmaa	The way you said you hate kids.....that is a very strong mean to say,though. But at least you are honest to yourself. Why do you hate kids, anyway? You used to be a kid before? If you don't have mom's....how come you are here right now? I know, kids can be very annoying but they are very adorable. I used to have a friend who also hate kids. She got married and have kids. Why? She realized being married is a good thing, but she realized there is a missing part in their life. She feel the house is cold. Quiet. Her husband goes to work early while she works afternoon shift. Being herself at home.....lonely. Then, the head start to click, and decided to have a child with the man she loves. You don't have to get pregnant to get pressured. It takes two to make it. If you loves a man in your life....you will someday you want to have a child on your own. Right now, you are not ready to have a family. I can see you are just want to take it slow. That is good. Don't you worry.....when you know the time is there.....you will make a choice in your life. Have it or not.|`|8g51eBf1aa	I want to get married because I want to wake up every morning to the love of my life, and my best friend. Knowing that no matter what happens he's always going to be there for me. And also I want to a have a life long companion.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of people think that when they get married they HAVE to have kids. There's so much pressure too. And it shouldn't be like that. It's a choice between the husband & wife though.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	No its not the main reason people get married, they do it because they want to be able to spend the rest of their life with the person they love and care about.|`|3MDY29gnaa	No the reason people marry is because they are in love and want to spend the rest of their lives together.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	No, its not the only reason.<br>  My fiance & I have no plans for children - - if we have kids its going to be an accident - LOL.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Children are a blessing.

81ff98a2b59a7150ffd94a3f4604b9e1aa	You are living in his home and he is responsible for you.  I presume that you are underage, or you would realize that you could simply get a job, leave home and support yourself and do whatever you want.  <br>  <br>  If you live somewhere, abide by the rules.  You don't have to like the rules.  You've expressed how you feel about it.  Your father is like many parents today who are doing their best to set wise guidelines for their kids, and being hated for it. Things that are acceptable today are so far from acceptable in parents eyes that it is, literally, horrifying to them. <br>  <br>  Look, he can't know what you are up to when you are staying with friends all night.  He knows you don't like church anymore, so why should he expect you to follow the wisdom that goes along with a Christian upbringing?  He's stuck between a rock and a hard place, and no mistake.  He's supposed to guide, and you are supposed to listen and follow and learn so that when you are old enough and out of the house, you'll have absorbed enough common sense to stay out of serious trouble.  I don't know what kind of person you are, but trust me, I've watched perfectly nice, good kids get into all sorts of trouble that has hurt a lot of people, just because they were willful and going with the flow of hanging out with their friends.  <br>  <br>  Then there's the ripple effect.  It's a cr*ppy thing to know you are grandparent to child you'll rarely see because your kid knocked up a girl during a "sleepover," for example.  Or to be called to the police station because a curfew got broken and your child is in jail.  Or that your child did drugs when YOU (here I mean the parent) ALLOWED them to go hang out all night with a bunch of unsupervised kids.  Adults typically have to sleep, so that means the kids are pretty much unsupervised. The things that kids do today have tragic consequences and believe me, they don't just affect the kid.  The effects ripple out farther than you dream.  <br>  <br>  So don't blame your dad for being overprotective, try to respect the fact that he's doing the best he can to at least keep you safe as long as he possibly can, and to protect your future happiness as well.  His rules may seem "retarded" but they are probably the best he can do.  <br>  <br>  You've explained how YOU feel.  But have you done the grown up thing and tried to find out how HE feels?  Until you are ready to communicate at that level with him, to really get underneath the junk at the surface, you won't know what his fears and concerns for you are, and he won't be able to trust that you understand or are mature enough to grow up to be wise and safe and responsible.  And if he isn't sure of THAT, the rules are in place as a safety net for you.  As you mature, you should be able to discuss things in a way that reassures him of your maturity, and you will probably be granted more freedom.  After all, most parents don't actually WANT their kids to stay at home forever in an endless battle of rules.  It is exhausting!  Parents want their kids to mature and go out into the world ready to meet all of its challenges in a mature way.  And ideally, that's when father and son become more friends than parent/child.  If you learn to communicate more with your dad, you can let him into your life and reassure him that you won't be getting into any trouble....that is, if this is actually true.  I don't know who you are hanging out with, or what your morals are, so.......<br>  <br>  Your dad will be there for you long after all or most of your current friends have drifted away as school, college, jobs and so on.  When you are hard up or in need, those people won't be there for you the same way a parent will.  maybe they won't be there at all.  Or maybe they can be there for you for a little while, but not the long haul. Parents are the ones who usually hang in there with their kids in trouble. This relationship is worth pursuing, developing, making more healthy....<br>  <br>  I don't recommend the strategy you mentioned.  Basically, you are in a power struggle.  The young male who wants to be his own man an do what he wants, when he wants and with whom he wants to do it.  You've selected an issue, the "sleepover," as your vehicle.  But I'll lay it down straight here:  you are in your father's home, eating your father's food, sleeping in your father's bed, and worrying his heart and mind as he tries to raise you in a culture that has swung incredibly far from what he grew up with and can see value in, and as you struggle to get away from the church and hang out with friends who are probably pretty much a perfect expression of the culture that troubles him.  And on Saturday night, he is responsible for going over any preparations for Sunday morning - something that would be difficult to concentrate on if you are somewhere else, who knows where, really.  Just because you say you are at so-and-so's house doesn't mean that you actually stay there all night.  Instead of taking care of his job responsibilities, he'll b|`|6sqxrlIlaa	I don't know.

He is probably thinking you are in bad company.    Have you got a mother?    Does she have any say in what is happening.    Are you ever allowed to spend the night away?   You might have to go in for a bit of negotiation because the bottom line is that he does have the upper hand while you are a child.  Prove yourself obedient, reliable and trustworthy in every way you can and he might start trusting you.

Me parece que el término normal es relativo, ya que cuando uno tiene una relación de pareja lo "normal", la "intensidad" y la "frecuencia" deben ser establecidas por ambos, pues no hay tercero que valga.  Una relación de pareja se basa en una unión donde ambos componentes se compenetran a tal grado que comparten sus sentimientos através de los cuerpos en una relación súblime.  Ahora bien deberías evaluar si realmente es el amor lo que están demostrándose o es simplemente una relación de atracción carnal.  Nunca olvides que en tu vida y en tus decisiones, muchas personas opinarán, pero sólo tú eres capaz de elegir lo que es mejor para tí, y lo que es correcto.  Si ambos están de acuerdo, eso es lo que realmente importa; pero no olvides que apesar de esa fogosidad, es muy importante protegerse, tanto de enfermedades como de embarazos no planeados.  Tú eres due?a de tu vida y de tus actos, por lo tanto disfruta al máximo pero aceptando las responsabilidades de los mismos.  Cuídate mucho y éxito.|`|zIG8kwaGaa	Todo cansa, asi que aprovecha pero estan el la etapa de que todos los dias despues solo sera uno o dos dias por seman ya despues sera 1 vez al mes|`|bzFDbReeaa	bueno , puede  que te canses tu primero , pero debes en ′cuando de sen un aire .

Just think of all the men and women who's beloveds are over in Iraq for 15 monthes.|`|u9i2CxdWaa	Oh yes, it can definitely work out. I am in a long distance relationship with the love of my life and we put in a lot of effort into making it work (phone calls, video messages, emails).  My fiance is currently in Iraq, so it we communicate each and any way we can. But it's definitely possible to work.|`|05e0d007bfe7a567e1beeb76ee3ad80faa	Yes!

You also have to have trust in the person becuase if you don't than you will always think about the what ifs.|`|NWG1Gv5Saa	I think it can definitely work! I think the hard part is the pain of being appart and remaining faithful, but if you really love eachother you'll do ok.|`|xzc0IZ5waa	Yes, If you're willing to do what it takes. Such as moving, etc.

It's just an attraction to a celebrity. Don't you have any celebrities you're attracted to?<br>  <br>  I guess you could try talking to your boyfriend about how it makes you uncomfortable and ask him to stop talking about how "hot" she is in your presence. Best of luck to ya! : D|`|kNeKaZw2aa	You get used to the fact that it's human nature for humans to be attracted to other humans. Do you find other males attractive? Regardless of it being vocalized, it's the same thing.<br>  <br>  You're never going to meet a man who is exclusively attracted to you. Ever. It isn't the way the Universe works.|`|AA11071772	there's no reason to get jealious.<br>  i mean face reality, its not like <br>  their ever going to meet her, she <br>  a famous celeb, and their just some <br>  boys out of a thousand that <br>  think she's hawt.<br>  <br>  dont worry about it, <br>  shes not all that great!!|`|wpNQLLyOaa	tell them to get over it, they will never get with miley so why worry about it.don't you have a certain celebrity you think is cute. everyone does|`|7ab804564e5429f8f8edb4b7eb6c23c6aa	uh..you can't do anything.|`|CVvZfxKFaa	If your boyfriend is spending his time with you gettin' all googly-eyed over Miley Cyrus, you need to find yourself a new one. Not only is that very disrespectful to you, but Miley Cyrus?? C'mon. You do not need to be jealous of a kid star, whose character has identity issues. Not to mention that she is on the fast track to becoming Hollywood's next big disaster.|`|DAqUZcq2aa	Dump your boyfriend. He shouldn't be saying someone else is hot when he's dating someone else. And Miley Cyrus is not even "HOT". The only way she is even famous is because her "DADDY" is famous. She isn't even talented. You shouldn't even worry about what they think. Be happy of what you have. She is so revealing. Did you see her pictures for the Vanity Fair? SLUT!! And talk about how "HOT" Chad Michael Murray is. Lets see what he thinks of it.|`|gQXzPOG3aa	are you serious?<br>  well theres nothing you can do, honestly. <br>  you cant expect one day to run into her and start confronting her because of how you feel, because you most likely wont. so all you could do now is take it, i guess, <br>  and just ignore them, <br>  and just think, "theyre losers too who will never even meet her!" lol!!<br>  its not like your bf will cheat on you with her lol!!<br>  :)|`|tIz4TWBlaa	blow it off.<br>  just think, the tv always hides all your imperfections.<br>  who caresssssss, besides, they will never have a chance with her anyways.|`|KFu0mGt1aa	get over it and tell your boyfriend how hot you think some other male star is I bet he won't like that very much|`|e45fed8f3e6bedeaad7f718d75efa6d5aa	Miley Cyrus?

Let him have his fantasies, it's not like he'll ever actually meet her anyways.|`|hGxQVz8Kaa	Shes going to get raped by her 21 year old boyfriend. Don't be jealous of her.|`|Cztz2O2jaa	Dump him.

Oooh-la-la.|`|a18866a5fa9b1011516eec55c6df35e4aa	I think... "God he's nice lookin" lol. then i smile :)|`|AA11942055	I'm married now, but even when I wasn't, when I saw a guy I thought was good-looking, I would think exactly that: "He's good-looking."  It's very rare that I'll feel an attraction towards a man I don't know, that I just crossed paths with in a public place, let alone think romantic thoughts about him.  Oh, and while I may briefly make eye contact and smile, staring is just plain rude; I don't like it done to me, so I don't do it to other people.|`|5F1UErrhaa	Hmmm, it depends on the guy, but if he is like super-hot I maybe make eye-contact with him a few times.  If he smiles I will, but not otherwise cos he might think I'm a weirdo.  When I see him I think, 'Whoa, he's hot!' but I don't have naughty thoughts because I'm already into someone.  By the time I'm back home I've usually forgotten about them again.<br>  <br>  But when it comes to Joe McFadden from 'Heartbeat' (ITV1, Sundays, 8pm) I am definitely thinking naughty thoughts.  Can't help myself.  :)|`|bQ2RWRGNaa	if i see a hot guy and make eye contact with him im thinking ... he is very hot, hes got nice eyes, but is he nice, romantic and honest? is he going to make me happy, is he faithful. i would like to be alone with him and kiss him and what is he thinking of me?  |`|b6p9apUraa	They go "Ooooooooh baby" and cream themselves...<br>  <br>  No, they do exactly what we guys do; stop, stare, double-check that all the right stuff is in the right places and just admire really|`|9ac4efe2c281bd465dbf8d33952bdfb8aa	They think of him on their arm making all the other girls jealous.|`|dKglNtBtaa	I think "he's cute." <br>  <br>  Then I go on with the rest of my day.|`|ea599a3bab257d34bbe640e49222c626aa	wait till he approaches her.|`|10tQzTmmaa	Dude whats up with all these questions!

(or somethin) but nothin "too" extreme. i don't really have 'nasty' thought about boys unless i really really really like them! some of my friends on the other hand... right when they see him they say "I'd SO do him- anyday!"- me not so much. hope i helped <br>  <br>  peace/love<br>          - gala!|`|rDe0ZjDeaa	I get really hot in the face and smile alot when i see a hot guy, cuz of course i'm thinkin "man hes pretty hot"...but i'm not thinking nasty thoughts thats for sure, i honestly think thats a little bit childish, i'm probably a little bit judgemental like if hes not with a chick i think hes probably high maintenance cuz hes hot and has no chick or super full of himself that ppl cant stand him, but its also based on how he is dressed, in shorts and a tee i think modest athlete yum, if hes over done its like still lives at home, i bet hes got 2 kids w/two different chicks...just being honest...sum ppl only have their looks going for them i'll take a funny guy over a hot one anyday|`|VlIL3G0saa	when i notice a hot guy i look at him and think about the possibilities between the sheets. that does make me smile. eye contact is crucial becouse in the moment your eyes meet u can tell if the guy has a bit of brain inside his skull or not. conversation staightens that out without any doubt, but the guy has to come and talk to me. how am i to know he hasn't got his date around? and another woman is always trouble.|`|dZEa3YIaaa	well, when i see a hot guy, i make eye contact, and just wonder if im looking okay. and i try not to look too interested, or too bored. but i don't usually stay to talk to him, because i don't like approaching random strangers, because i wouldn't know what to say.|`|AA11536804	we primp...(fluff hair, touch up lipstick, tug on shirts/skirts, that kind of thing). <br>  as for the what are we thinking... amazingly close to what you guys think when you see a chick you're into, except some of us think long term- "what kind of boyfriend/husband/father would he make?" but not all think much past the first night...|`|x0O75WzEaa	im usually picturing in my head some pretty wild scenes.

Maybe she has something on her mind..maybe she is stressed out about homework or something else..maybe she is just feeling comfortable with you and feels you will understand that there are periods in life where we need a little space....without you freaking out.  It could mean NOTHING at all ....don't listen to the neigh sayers here..they are all so negative and would rather jump to conclusions than talk it out.

Unless she is like 35 and worried that she wants to have children, this woman is crazy.  In 2 months you just don't know someone that well.<br>  <br>  She wants to marry within the year and you don't.  You should just have a straight out conversation.  There is no chance in the world that you will be proposing within the next couple months in order for her to be married within the year.  Then she either has to decide Does she want to be with YOU for you or does she just want to have a big white wedding?  I suspect she is far more into the wedding than you though and may end up breaking up with you.<br>  <br>  Either way, better to find out now than to cave in to childish demands.|`|rYNM67oyaa	She's not the one you want to marry. She's definitely not ready. It sounds like she just likes the idea of being married and having a baby to take care of.|`|iDfRTLklaa	She is proposing marriage to you after only 2 months of being together, and then gets mad when you want to wait till you get married.  Your GF is being unreasonable to expect you to say yes after such a short relationship.  She sounds like she wants to get married, and it doesn't really matter to who.  Good luck with your relationship, it sounds like you are going to need it.|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	Tell her she can't make someone marry her by getting mad.  She hasn't even had enough time to get to know you in two months.
96dd1ddeb6999bc938d40452d39493b5aa	Is your dad in the military?  That would explain why he does this.  <br>  <br>  Have you talked to a school counselor, a relative or someone else you can trust?  Where is your mother in all this?<br>  <br>  The information you are giving is quite limited, and I might hesitate whether it is abusive.  If you have told your dad how you feel and he still keeps this up, then he is being abusive.  On the other hand if you haven't talked to him, he simply might think that this is his way to make sure that you turn out well and that you don't get in trouble later in life.<br>  <br>  Either way, it is not a bad idea to talk to a teacher or counselor in school if your father won't listen.
d36OrpbDaa	my parents also split up last year for a while, and my mom acted the way your describing.  it's really hard to deal with.<br>  <br>  i'd suggest going to counseling to talk to someone about what you're dealing with.  it's too hard to feel like you have to save your mom's life, and still keep yourself together and doing well too.  it's also hard to have to watch your parents' marriage fall apart, especially with your dad's behavior.  it's not right, but unfortunately it seems like plenty of parents put their kids through stuff like this when they really need to get some help instead.<br>  <br>  urge your mom to go to counseling.  tell her it can really help her to get things together and help her to feel better.  tell her you can't keep going on like this forever and that it's hurting you.<br>  <br>  she might not listen, she might not go.  but at least you'll have tried.  there's no way that you can MAKE her go to counseling, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  you didn't say how old you are or if you are leaving for college anytime.  just know that no matter what happens, once you are on your own, it won't have such a negative effect on you.  it will always be ppainful to see, but at least it won't drag you down as well.<br>  <br>  make sure to rely on other family members and friends and spend quality time with them .  they can help you to stop thinking about it for a while, and to help straighten out your emotions when it feels like you're in over your head.<br>  <br>  just don't start relying on unhealthy coping strategies, like drugs, alcohol, or partying all the time.  i don't know if this is something you would consider or not, but please don't.  because eventually this problem will fade in importance in your life, but then you'd be left with another BIG problem (addiction/bad reputation/what have you) that's all YOURS and even harder to fix.<br>  <br>  eventually you will be on your own and able to take care of yourself, and what your parents do will not have as much of an impact on your life.  it will always be painful for you to think about, but it won't drag you down. no matter what your parents do, you are your own person and are valuable and have a good future ahead of you.  just keep focusing on the light at the end of the tunnel.<br>  <br>  and please do try counseling.  it saved my life when i felt like i was being dragged down with my mother.  i don't know where i would be if i hadn't gone to a counselor. sometimes it's just too much and too difficult to handle on your own.|`|ZDMjuf4Taa	what a lovely sensitive and caring person you sound, your parents should be so proud of you.  at this moment you have such a lot to cope with, none of this was you or your brothers fault but the burden seems to have fallen on you to 'fix' things. you say that your mum relied on your dad financially and socially, she sounds like a needy person. things can change but it won.t be easy, first of all try to change the way you react to your mum when she is saying negative things to you, be positive it your answers , do not be afraid to go out and carry on with your own life, try to encourage her to go out, just little things at first, like a shopping trip or a meal, do not let her draw you into negative conversations about your dad, make it clear to her 'he is my dad i do not want to hear you speak bad of him in front of me thank you' hopefully she will soon realise that she can make a new life without using you and your brother for her emotional well being good luck|`|6C2GUuAHaa	Sazzie, I don't know how old you are, but you sound pretty mature and it sounds as if you will be out on your own soon.  I am so sorry for your situation.  You realize that your mom blames you so that she won't have to blame your dad, right?  <br>  <br>  You can't make your mom realize that this is all for the best.  She has to come to that conclusion herself.  When you think you can fix things, you're assuming a lot of blame and thinking that you have a lot of control over the situation.  I know you are bright enough to realize, at least intellectually, that this isn't so.  However, our minds and our emotions aren't always in sync.<br>  <br>  You can encourage your mother to seek counseling.  She sounds as if she is severely depressed.  Encourage her to go to the doctor for a check-up.  Stress and depression can cause physical symptoms.  <br>  <br>  Before my parents died, I came to realize that some family situations just can't be "fixed."  I wish I had a different relationship with my family, but I don't and never will.  But I have managed to have a relationship with my son which gives me great happiness.<br>  <br>  Just continue to love your mom, your dad, and your brother and try to detach from all of this a bit.  It's them, it's not you.  Please don't let this situation ruin your life and chances for a happy relationship of your own, though.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your family.  Sorry my answer is so long.

They will ask how much money your mother-in-law makes and determine what amount you may or may not qualify for.

AA11286455	What should you do?<br>  <br>  Grow up.  <br>  <br>  Mature.  <br>  <br>  Get some therapy to get some perspective and to understand that not every bad thing in the world is necessarily going to happen to YOU.  <br>  <br>  Repeat the above if necessary.  <br>  <br>  If the above still don't get you very far or you're not making much progress:  Get some medication for anxiety.  It can work wonders.|`|GChWTGNiaa	They were probably thinking "Dude, she's hot! Get a picture, we'll come back and see if she's here when we're not so busy."<br>  I know because my friends do the same thing.<br>  Or maybe they're preparing to kidnap then kill you (after you've had your eye drilled with power tools, your ankles cut, hands removed with a chainsaw, and your teeth pulled out.)
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Tell her since her advice turned out so bad and she isnt listening to what you want that you won't trust her advice again.|`|GChWTGNiaa	Just say no, and walk to the place yourself. You've got legs for a reason.
W9dabUw7aa	Just move and leave a note in your room or something...bet you won't go...there is something else going on here...maybe you are dependent on them in some way?|`|f8CN2qIvaa	You're old enough to move out on your own without worrying about what your parents think.  Why wait until the end of the month?  Get out of there right now!  Why are you still on the computer?|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Tell your parents you are moving out.I think at the age of 23 you do not have to sneak around.Unless you are mentally challenged or something,your parents have absolutely no way of forcing you to stay.Why are you so afraid of your parents?They may disagree with your decision,but it is ultimately yours to make.|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	You're grown but you can't talk to your parents?  Just tell them you're moving out and leave.  Simple as that.  Not trying to be a jerk, but if you can't even confront your parents about moving out, then I don't think you're mature enough to live on your own.|`|GChWTGNiaa	Just say "I'm moving out, we have an apartment already." And if they try to stop you, just say it's your choice, not theirs. Mommy and Daddy can't do much to stop you..|`|qp3LY0tRaa	well i think u shouldn't tell the police but tell ur parents that u r leaving and end of discussion<br>  good luck :)|`|70a43707807dc9900f19f111a38b3d42aa	Tell your parents you're moving out and move out. That way they won't be worried sick and say you're missing. At this point, if they don't agree to you moving out then that's their problem, but you are old enough to move out. You're over 18. Whether it's the "best option" or not is a different matter but by law you ARE allowed to leave. I just think you should tell your parents and move out. Don't let them find out afterwards and have to call the police and all. That would be the immature thing to do. Just tell them and DO IT. You can, you are allowed to indeed.|`|UGDMYh0Kaa	well if the situation at home is that bad and unbearable (like mine) then yeah ur brave for doing that and go ahead. telling the police would be a good idea but i think they may advise you that telling your family is very important. im sure they wouldnt force you to. good luck|`|Ipj0dbrQaa	like you said you are an adult, just tell your family, after all what can they do. if you just go you will loose contact with them but if you tell them then even if they don't like it they will come around to the idea.<br>  <br>  good luck what ever you do|`|fbeJMYt7aa	no just don't take no for answer. Tell your parents your moving but when you do have all the bags ready and all the arrangements made.

Your family should not have this type of control over you. Go to the post office, and turn in a change of address form so your mail is forwarded to your new apartment. While you are there, pick up some change of address forms that you send out to people to notify them you have moved. Send one to your parents. Stopping by the police department isn't a bad idea. This can/will save some problems if your parents report you before they get the card with your new address. You probably lose all financial support from your parents, but you will be free from your parents control. Good luck, I hope that all will go smoothly|`|05b8694fbec67abcebd67a0e2b82c126aa	I think you need to man up and grow a set of balls come on you are 23 and cant move out ????? you i bet are a real catch|`|JaSIm56Naa	no the best way is to just tell your parents my goodness you are an adult now they may not like it but it is something that they will get over in time|`|e2990eb46d523c3852908ba44a7cff02aa	no

She'll learn not to disrespect!!|`|7PRpRiRNaa	well tell her shes not your mom and you have no legal right over me!|`|njDZg2uFaa	u should tell ur dad to talk to her. It just inst right. Or call 911 and say my step mom is abusing me! :'(|`|tyZskVk6aa	i would talk to her. you are trying to adjust to this life style, and even though she is not your biological mom, she loves your father, and of course she loves you. realize that things will get worse before they get better, that is just how things are. if you talk to her and discuss your expectations, and the relationship that you want to get out of this then maybe the two of you will have some ground, and boundaries to go on... good luck, and i hope this helps!|`|bO9vJY2Caa	don't do anything and do what ever you want in time shell realize that you were trying ur best to impress but she wouldn't show the appreciation you deserved|`|f6fe44c4dd4dfec25bc0198c9161f1d9aa	take all her crap, and soon she will get sick of being full of **** and such a b**** to you. just be nice and show that smile all the time. she will learn to respect you.|`|ICel15qYaa	talk to your dad<br>  he might be able to help<br>  sometimes (like i find with my step) its easier to sorta uhhh rebel... a little and not do what she insists if u believe its not right<br>  try not to use "attitude" towards her tho|`|kau1P97Kaa	try and talk to her and talk about what your and her problem is, than hope for the best it works out
AA11286455	You need to get a good lawyer to fight this.  Now and before anymore significant amount of time passes or the court may consider the aunt the "psychological parent" and refuse to consider full or sole custody to him.  <br>  <br>  He's the closest next-of-kin to the girl, so it would seem to me that regardless of what was signed (now that he's "out of the dark" on the girl's existence) can be successfully challenged.  Again, time is of the essence.  <br>  <br>  Heck, if the girl were 12, even I as the judge would have a hard time turning custody over to him, even if it's the 'just' thing to do.  So get busy.|`|kYGIAu5Kaa	If he is the father and is on the certificate, then he Absolutely has rights to this child. I am wondering how the mother signed away custody of the child without having to contact the father in the first place. This is most defiantly lawyer time. get a good one. It will not be cheap but it is worth it in the long run.the mother had NO right to do what she did. Even if there is not a custody agreement still don't see how the father was not informed. good luck.|`|Vi6BzYIOaa	sounds like you have a really good case for full custody.  first step is contacting a lawyer .  if you can't afford one call your local chapter of father's rights groups.  they will set you on the right track.  good luck

iv9T4Ctgaa	First, you don't say how old you are.  By the content of your question, I'm assuming you are younger than 18.  Being a young girl...alone...in Hong Kong is courting disaster, e.g., kidnapping and forced labor as a prostitute.  Once you reach the age of majority and make your own decisions, you are then accountable to only yourself for any of your screw-ups.<br>  <br>  What you see as being overprotective (or anything else, for that matter)is actually your dad showing you one way in which he loves you very much.  He doesn't want any harm to come to his daughter.  And it's probably NOT because he doesn't trust you.  It's that he doesn't trust the human species awqay from his sphere of protection for his daughter.  Your dad is older...give him some credit for knowing things about life that you have yet to experience.<br>  <br>  You should actually feel lucky (honored, blessed, etc).  Lots of parents don't give a hoot about their children.  These are the kids that end up ruinning away from home, hooking, doing drugs and dying at early ages.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8mGMLk6zaa	Show your dad that your responsible. Show him and reasure him that everything will be ok. Maybe ask one of your friends (that your dad knows) if she will go with you.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	as a parent I would have reservations about my young daughter traveling alone to a foreign country.  My first question back to you is how old are you?|`|cjWrSpfYaa	Watch the movie Taken... :)|`|4SHr6i55aa	WELL IF YOU ARE GOING WITH YOUR MOTHER; THEN HE SHOULD LET YOU BECAUSE YOU WILL BE WITH A PARENT. IM AM 20 YEARS OLD. THE "DONT TRUST YOU" IS THAT HE DOES NOT TRUST THAT YOU WILL MAKE THE CORRECT CHOICES WHEN THE TIME COMES. REMEMBER THAT HE LOVES YOU AND HAS YOUR BEST INTEREST AT HEART. YOU SAY YOU ARE YOUNG; TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT LATER ON IN LIFE; LITTLE THINGS LIKE NOT LETTING YOU TRAVEL ALONE, WON'T SEEM AS IMPORTANT. LET IT PASS. LIFE HANDS YOU OPPORTUNITIES ALL THE TIME. AND IF NOT; PLAN THE BEST SUMMER VACATION EVER POSSIBLE. JOIN SPORTS. MAKE DATES WITH FRIENDS AND MOVIES.|`|GNa37oJXaa	well maybe try asking him if like your aunt or some other relative can go with you if hes super protective or just sit down with him and talk it over and let him know how you feel <br>  tell him you don't think its right that you have to suffer because of his actions<br>  let him know that you shouldn't have to go through this at such a young age and tell him that its ok that you and mom didn't work out and <br>  you thought that the only way to deal with it was to get divorced but tell him its only fare is he makes it work for you too and that you are able to see you mom and brother more often and its only right that he lets you cause u deserve that much!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  idk if that would work but i had that same problem when i was younger and thats kinda what i did with my dad and he thought that i was right and that he needed to make a change <br>  hope u get to see your mom :)|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Haven't you heard? Foreign countries exist so young Americans can drink and try drugs without their parents.<br>  <br>  Go with a group if you can. That should put his mind at ease. Also see if you can convince someone your dad trusts to go with you if he can't go.
lLtaCTKNaa	Im sorry to hear all of this, tell your mom.|`|f8CN2qIvaa	Tell her to stay out of your personal life.  She has no business interfering with you and your boyfriend.
6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	Yes , break his heart , embarrass him and keep the ring. that is a whore move. Tell him today and give the ring back. You might find someonr else that will buy you a ring that means something|`|AA10975867	And your next question says that the guy has a criminal record and your parents are leaving the country without telling you. This sounds made up. If it is at all true, then - to merely not show up to a wedding is the most cowardly thing on earth to do. Childish, immature,thoughtless. So many other words come to mind. You have a week. Break it off. Return the ring - and save all those people the trouble of traveling to the sham wedding.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	well hate to break it to you but an engagement ring is like a signed contract meaning if you dont marry him and break up with him then he is legally entitled to the ring, he can take you to court and you will be court ordered to give it back. How pathetic are you to do that to someone who obviously cares about you.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	I do hope your just joking us. If not your sure are a lousy person Give the ring back|`|DiZQFnf6aa	You also ask "I am a week away from marying my fiance....?" You are sick person and you are bored.

And you will also potentially wreck a good guy for any future women. Either way, you lose and everyone will know what you're like.|`|8g51eBf1aa	Your not mature enough to know anything about love or what marriage is all about!!!!|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Give the ring back and get out of his life.|`|HcboXOmjaa	I hope one day you learn that you can't be happy being materialistic. Your poor fiancé. Tell him right away you want to end things. What a shame!|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	Troll|`|o5Dvkkgfaa	you need ot give back the ring. if you want a ring that bad, buy it yourself. and to say you would not show up is rude. weddings are not cheap, you can not return anything. he loves you to make this type of commitment and you just want the ring. be honest and give it back, that would hurt less, plus you need to tell him you just wanted the ring and you were gonna stand him up.|`|4IQRDtoAaa	yeah....you've got some TERRIFIC ideas there about marriage and commitment and just general decency...get help.  Women like you get murdered for pulling stunts like this.  Hope you're not tangling with the wrong guy....the one who already has a criminal record?  haha....your parents sure did a bang-up job with you!|`|4Hv0i2Y8aa	That is cruel, heartless, and selfish. Give him back the ring (so he can get his money back) and break up with him now (so he can start to find somebody deserving of his love).|`|5UbC5hP9aa	This is why men treat women like objects. I can't believe you would even admit to this. Why would you want a wedding dress?? That makes no sense. You need therapy.|`|5voteJLRaa	I hope this is a joke! You should be ashamed of yourself and tell him rt away. That's not right at all.
2hcA3VP9aa	i am sorry for the living conditions that you inhabit, i think it might help if you can talk with your dad about how your mom is treating you. i think that you should try to talk to a counselor at school about your home problems because they can help you a whole lot more. but for the mean time i think you should try to build up the strength to ask your mom why she does what she does. you should look for face expressions and if her tone changes. again i am really sorry for your home problems and i give you much luck.
KcOpiKiYaa	Is she older? It could just be an old thing. You should definitely tell her that going to the hospital is the best thing to do absolutely...|`|d1TTwwUUaa	She could be having mild strokes. I would definetly call for an ambulance ASAP and the hospital will take her even without insurance.. So get off this and call an ambulance NOW|`|IhzzJfEqaa	the face hurting sounds like a very bad sinus infection which would cause her to not be able to hear. I have no clue what would cause the vomiting though. idk
AA11286455	I agree with 1065.  Your good and kind heart can be seen all over your post.  <br>  <br>  You have done absolutely nothing wrong--except make yourself *overly* available to people who do not appreciate it.  <br>  <br>  Further, it may be necessary to accept that your siblings are just like your parents--except they use you when they call and you listen but won't return the favor, courtesy, help.  <br>  <br>  It is not a bad thing to stop being the over-responsible one in the family.  It's actually a good thing.  Next time they call, say I'm sorry for your troubles and nothing more.  <br>  <br>  Alternatively, realize that many times people do not appreciate or respect something or someone IF THEY HAVE TO PAY for it.  The next time they suck up your time, respect YOURSELF.  Send them a bill.  Bill by the minute...or by the hour if you insist on being kiind.  Otherwise, don't answer the phone or simply be unavailable.  <br>  <br>  They may be angry t you, they may even hate you for it, but, then again, people usually do when you change your life in small ways or in big, fundamental ways.  <br>  <br>  It means that they've realized that they can't treat you as they did before, with little to no regard.  It means that you won't allow it.  Worse, it requires THEM to change; as such, you've greatly inconvenienced THEM.  <br>  <br>  In the end, this does require that you grow--socially, emotionally, as well as  spine.  You situation is made even more difficult bc you're siblings, you survived a common threat and come out the other side alive and essentially whole.  <br>  <br>  But tell me:  Where's the written law that says you have to like each other now, much less stick together?  Honey, they're operating on a completely different set of rules and leaving you to suffer for it, suffer over it.  <br>  <br>  In the meantime, in order to grow and to not wear your current friend out, work on YOURSELF.  Start a hobby, join a club or social group, go back to school, therapy isn't a bad idea to put your life, family, and experiences into better perspective.  <br>  <br>  Volunteering is a wonderful way to forget about yourself and your troubles for a while.  It validates you when others won't. It also helps you put your life in better perspective when working with those suffering worse than you are.  <br>  <br>  If you want to continue to be a "helper" person, nothing wrong with that.  Just find those who will appreciate and respect you for it.  Hell, you may even find someone willing to pay you for it.  Don't turn 'em down.|`|manCQ4Lkaa	U have don NOTHING wrong. dont make me cry now. look people have their ways. you need to get in tuch with them with a FULL heart. dont worry if it doesn't work out because with a heart and soul like your........ u'll have more friends than the lord himself|`|d1TTwwUUaa	No hon nothing wrong. Your siblings just see you as the strong one in the family and turn to you when things go wrong. But they do need to know how you feel. Write them a letter and mail it. See what happens from there. Good Luck and keep your head up.|`|KcOpiKiYaa	Sometimes family just wants to branch off and do their own thing. Don't worry though you have done nothing wrong. Don't be a pest and keep calling and texting....Just wait it out, you will get a response!|`|8afb688e78b320f9009e3ee53b0b0c78aa	Hi reading your post here and suffering similar to yourself im suspecting there was some type of abuse that went on within your childhood. It is very very common practise for siblings to become disconnected from each other due to childhood memories. It could be that its not just you thats feeling ignored, maybe your siblings show this type of behaviour to each other aswell? Maybe even still to this day its your parents influence or maybe its just too painfull for them to be with you and each other because to be involved and to care would mean faceing the past and hearing different takes on what happend and what shouldnt have happend.<br>  <br>  You have to belive that it shouldnt have happend and that you as a individual are not bad or such a terrible person that you should feel ignored, unloved, and left out. It seems to me you could do with speaking to someone to help you deal with the past issues and to believe in you and what you have now in your life. <br>  <br>  You do not have to acceot the way these people treat you but you do have to accept that no matter what you do your unlikely to change them as people. You could try being upfront and saying to your siblings how they make you feel, but i feel that maybe you shy away from confrontation and would not be able to do this. <br>  <br>  You should open up yourself to others around you and build a life and frienships away from your family. People that like you for who you are. You also need to concentrate on building your own confidence and esteem and i hope whole heartdly you can find the courage and insight to acknowlege the past and move on with or without them|`|K4J6f1e0aa	YOU didn't do anything wrong. Look, sometimes, family just need a break from each other. That's why people move out of houses- so they don't have to talk to you every day! You should just sit back, and do your own thing. Don't worry, they'll call you eventually
AA11286455	KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.  Physical, social, and emotional.  <br>  <br>  No telling when he'll start beating you over some real or imagined "crime".  <br>  <br>  If he ever starts to beat you, tell, tell, tell, tell.  <br>  <br>  If you ever see him beat your brother again, tell, tell, tell, tell.  <br>  <br>  If you ever see him beat your brother again, tell your brother to tell, tell, tell.  <br>  <br>  If you ever see him beat your mother again, tell your mother to tell, tell, tell.  <br>  <br>  If you ever see him beat your mother again and she does/says nothing, you run and tell, tell, tell.  <br>  <br>  Teachers, doctors, nurses, are required to report it.  Police, CPS, are required to act.  <br>  <br>  Hating him is totally understandable and forgiveable.  Just don't let it consume you or you'll miss out on YOUR life while being totally focused on him and his which would be a shame and a total waste.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|djUMvICoaa	I wouldn't want you to hate your dad, that is a good way to learn to hate people you should love.  What I want you to do is be upset with the way he does things and says things.  At first this may seem a little hard to tell the difference, but in time you will.  It also helps sort out those feelings of I want to hate him but how do I hate him when you can seperate things from his person.|`|LrxTy3zLaa	You shouldn't hate him... but you should tell him how you feel.... with an adult who can protect you as witness.<br>  <br>  I was raised in an abusive atmosphere. When my dad was around, which wasn't often, he was drunk most of the time... & physically, mentally & emotionally abusive.<br>  When I was in my 20s, I told him exactly how I felt about that.... it didn't change the fact that it happened, or even get me an apology... but it did make me feel better & cause me to see my dad differently.<br>  <br>  Today, I love him & we get along very well.<br>  I still remember the abuse... but I have forgiven him & moved on.<br>  I hope that some day you will be able to do the same.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	You should never be forced to be around an adult who makes you uncomfortable.  Perhaps do what is best for you -- be your own person, and make a common sense decision about this.<br>  <br>  If you are unsure, talk to an adult you trust and respect, even the school guidance counselor.  <br>  <br>  take care.|`|ShyCBmj5aa	ask your mom to take you to the court hearing and tell them how you feel.<br>  <br>  Usually if you say something that touches their hearts or even if they hear from you that you really don't want to live with him they won't make you.|`|vL6nyAX8aa	Just tell him your feelings.

4POGapREaa	We got married in Maui, Hawaii.  The hotel we stayed at arranged everything for the ceremony & it was around $1100.  It was on the beach at Sunset (I requested that) and the package included the officiant, photographer (with prints and a DVD slide show), hula dancer, flower leis, etc.<br>  <br>  We had 2 friends with us as well & it was just perfect.  Our room was great & had a sliding door that went right out to the sand.  I'll give you the link for the hotel.  I didn't want to do the ultra posh resort thing because it's so impersonal so I really loved this hotel but the key is to get the best ocean front room or else you end up disappointed.  It's the Kaanapali Beach Hotel in Maui & I would just die to go back there.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://kbhmaui.com/" rel="nofollow">http://kbhmaui.com/</a>
7G4hisdzaa	I used to live in Vegas.  At the Bellagio, near the entrance where the water show is, there is a fountain that several people toss coins in.  It is a very romantic spot....watch the water show and when the crowd dissipates(usually takes less than five minutes), propose there and toss a few coins in.  Say something like, I wish for us to come back in X amount of years and still be as happy and in love as we are now...<br>  Good luck!<br>  Edit:  I just thought of another idea....I'm really kicking myself for not remembering how to get there though.<br>  There is an INCREDIBLE view from a spot we used to go to...it was a bit of a drive from town, but you could see ALL of vegas from there.  You would drive down this long road, park at the bottom of some large rocks, and hike up about 30 feet.  Easy hike...if you can even call it one.  Shoot I wish I could remember how to get there....try googling views of Las Vegas...Sometimes there would be 3 or 4 people up there, but it's a large area and you never really bumped into anyone...if I remember how to get there I'll come back...ask some locals when you get there or google...Oh that would be a wonderful place.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	When you first get to your room at the hotel your staying in, tell her how excited you are to be there with her and since it will be unexpected just drop down on one knee and ask her, you'll have alot more fun that way after you propose instead of worrrying about when to do so.|`|njHgfl99aa	Go somewhere bright, beautiful and romantic and yet not many people are around to watch you two - remember this is only between you and her.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	The Venetian hotel has gondola rides.

8bTder08aa	He is who he is.  You've known him long enough to know who he is and how he acts.  He is not going to change.  It sounds to me as if you view him as somewhat of a a "home improvement project":  that he'd be the perfect person to spend your life with if you can just "fix"/change a few things about him.<br>  <br>  Going into a relationship with someone because of the "potential" they show or because you believe that you can make them change is a guarantee of heartbreak.  There is no force in the world powerful enough to make a person change if they themselves don't want to change.  The only person who you can surely and absolutely change is yourself.<br>  <br>  It seems to me that you've given in to this guy in every aspect of your relationship.  You don't feel comfortable living with someone outside of marriage, but you moved in with him.  You're basically supporting the relationship. He knows what you want from him-- a commitment, formal and public-- and he won't give it to you.  Do you really think that you're going to find a magic formula to somehow make him give to you the things he doesn't seem to want to give at all, in spite of seeing/knowing how much it hurts you to not have them?<br>  <br>  It's striking to me that you and this guy have broken up before.  Obviously the things that caused you to break up are still present in the relationship.  <br>  <br>  It's a truism that I've observed, that most people know more about their relationships with the people they love than they are willing to admit.  I think this is obvious in your case.  You know what you want, and you know you are not going to get it from this guy.  But for some reason, you're afraid to take the obvious next step:  break up with him for good and move on, trying to find what you want with someone else.<br>  <br>  As long as you won't let go of this guy, you will never get what you want, because he won't give it to you and staying with him keeps you from finding another guy who might be better for you.  Are you afraid, really and truly, that if you break up with this guy no one else will want you?  That you'll be alone?<br>  <br>  Until you understand that you're better off alone than in a relationship with the wrong person for the wrong reasons, you're stuck.  <br>  <br>  If you can't make up your mind yourself, then maybe you should go to a counselor to try to understand why you are stuck in a relationship with someone who won't give you what you want, but you won't let go of.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10050051	I hope to dear that you do not get married to this guy because you two sound so different and that he is nowhere near your level at all. Move on from him, really. If he was not into helping you look for a place for the both of you to share a life with, that only tells me that you will doing more of the responsible stuff.<br>  This is not the person for you.|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	First off, you can't get mad at him for not proposing to you. It's not fair to either of you. And you can't get mad that your living together without a ring b/c as you said it was your decision to move in together. You shouldn't say that you want him to propose to make you feel better about your religious beliefs b/c once again it was your choice. If religion was that important to you, then you wouldn't have made that decision to begin with. You are contradicting yourself out of bitterness. <br>  <br>  Trust me I understand wanting to be engaged. I am in a long term relationship, and I am in the role of your bf. I am still in school working full time an going to school part time. My bf says he wants to wait till I am done with school before we move on. And that irritates me too. I have been working on my bachelors for 7 years and nowhere near being done.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that if he is only working part time, going to school and having to depend on you financially, he can't afford to get engaged. He probably would like to be able to afford a nice ring for you and that's just not possible at this point in his life. This doesn't mean he doesn't love you any less. He says he wants to spend the rest of his life with you. That should be good enough for you. You don't need a ring to symbolize  your commitment to one another.<br>  <br>  And it is acceptable to introduce yourself as your boyfriend at your family reunion. Honey, it's 2009! It's ok to live with your long time boyfriend. I come from a big Catholic family as well and they understand that the times are changing. They may not agree with it, but it's your life, they have no right to say anything. They look at living together even engaged just as bad as a boyfriend. But most don't care! I have lived with my boyfriend for 3 years and they love him because they know he loves me. That's whats important. Not that we are living together and aren't engaged or married.|`|4IQRDtoAaa	Engagement is a very bad idea for the two of you.  He isn't on the same page as you with some incredibly important issues (marriage, finances, career, goals, etc.)  My advice is to move on and find yourself a MAN who has the maturity, responsibility and true commitment to make a proper husband to you.  If you continue this, you will be miserable.|`|Foep58JUaa	I'm sorry dear but it does appear that you are both on different levels. He does not want to tie himself down yet and you are ready for engagement and marriage. He may just need more time to mature and finish school. In any case, if he has not proposed or offered a promise ring yet (and these are things you stated many times to him that you would like) then there is nothing more to say than that he is unsure about whether he wants to spend the rest of his life with you. <br>  <br>  You sound like his mother not his girlfriend. You take care of him emotionally and financially. He is being selfish in some ways. He seems to be preoccupied with doing what his real mother tells him to do. Why would you want to marry someone who will constantly disregard your feelings or needs if his mother advises him to? As for your family reunion, go alone if your family won't accept you going with a live-in boyfriend. I think the problem with your guy is that he is still in the mindset that you would do anything for him regardless of how bad it makes you feel.<br>  <br>   I suggest talking to him one last time and basically giving him an ultimatum. Let him know you love him but that he isn't making the kind of effort in your relationship that you need at this time. Perhaps he'll change but more likely he won't. I think you need to live separately and that you should let him fend for himself emotionally and financially. Maybe mommy dearest will swoop him under her wing.<br>  <br>   You don't want a boy, trust me. You want a man. He isn't there yet. Sorry dear.

Over time, the persons and the couple you become may not feel or look or act the same over the years. So how committed to being married are each of you?  A lifetime can be a very long time.  I think this kind of awareness and readiness comes with age.  You be the judge.|`|iEnI3WSmaa	The answer to your question is more about maturity and intelligence than that of a number.<br>  <br>  To ensure a "working" marriage, you need two people who are compatible on many levels: intelligence, maturity, humor, etc.<br>  <br>  That being said, I suppose one could argue that the majority of these skills develop in the 20s and not too often before that.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|fPOg9DuXaa	I believe the average age for a man to marry is 28 and for a female is 26. But I think that it depends on the maturity of the two involved and how long they have been dating and how well they know eachother.
0ycoeVpZaa	leave him. maybe then he'll get rid of that dog. Y would u want to be with someone who considers a dog more valuable in  his life then u.|`|AA12349214	Whoa!  Take a breath here!  Sit down and breathe!  The dog is stressed and unhappy.  You have usurped a position it held and it is showing its unhappiness in the only way it knows how.  They lived in the house - and whats wrong with that.  By all means put boundaries on the furniture and the bedroom if thats what you want but you have to understand that the house was their home too!  And they had your partner to themselves and now suddenly you are there, taking away some of their attention.  They may be dogs but they still have feelings and still feel threatened by the arrival of you and your son.<br>  My strong advice to you is to get hold of a dog behaviourist - and check out people who have used them and get their opinion - and the behaviourist will be able to reconcile all the differences between you, your partner, your son and the dogs.<br>  My friend has used them here in the UK and it is marvellous when it all works out - which 9 times out of 10 it usually does. <br>  But do take into account in the meantime what your arrival has meant for the dogs.  They are as unhappy as you are.<br>  Google your local area behaviourists and I promise it wont take long.<br>  Shouldnt be more than a few visits.  It will be worth it in the end and your son will have a darned good best friend to play with.  Kids and dogs are meant for each other - in your case you just have to deal with a few issues first.<br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Just read your added info - whatever the expense you need a behaviourist - you have proven that you cant do this on your own and you need an outside pair of eyes who can see where the problem is stemming from.  Something has obviously happened to upset the balance.  Sometimes there are things that you just have to find the money for and I think this is one of them - or someone will end up getting hurt - either your son or a dog.  Or you will end up having to rehome it and that will bring its own problems.  But whatever - something has occured that has caused all this to start so you need to sit down and work out just when and where the problems started and work from that.  Ask your son gently if he has done anything that might have upset the apple cart and make sure he knows he wont be in trouble or he wont say.<br>  And I still wish you good luck!|`|AA11043457	There is a major problem when a man cares more for his dog than his partner. But he hasn't cared enough to marry you either so I'm not sure of his commitment to you.<br>  <br>  If your son is in danger from this dog,  you need out and you need out now.  It is the dog who is jealous of the kid. That is why he is peeing on the toys.  Your son should not be left in the room with this dog.<br>  <br>  I can understand his caring for his dogs especially if he had the dogs before he had you move in.  At first I thought the dogs were added afterwards but then  you indicated he had the dogs before so that is complicated or unclear.<br>  <br>  You sound like  you are looking for a place to stay or looking for love in the wrong place as doesn't sound like  you are receiving it there.  that might develop into something, but it doesn't look good<br>  <br>  I have a neighbor who has a GF and he said the other day that she is allergic to the cat.  He also said that if it came between the two, the cat would stay.  That tells me that he doesn't have a decent relationship with the GF.  <br>  <br>  Is there some kind of compromise?  Could he get the dog into doggie obedience school?  Maybe you can work on building up the relationship of your son with the dog.  Have him give him some treats and be right there to monitor it.  If the dog does something nice, pet him and have the boy pet him with you riht there.  the dog sees this new little "dog" as he doesn't see him as a man or owner but  as competition with him.  It isn't you and the dog but the boy and the dog and the dog is jealous of the boy so you can try to work at their relationship. Dogs can be very protective of children, but this dog feels threatened by his position with the boy.  <br>  <br>  If you can't get a better relationship going betwee dog and boy, you may have to leave.  Wich is more important to  you, this man who is doesn't care enough about you, or your son? And you are not staying because of your son or his security, it is your own. Sorry as I know youwon't want ot hear that.  You may want it because of your son, but you want doesn't doesn't exist, just what you want it to be.  What does exist is a jealous dog who sees  your son as a threat.|`|1E1m0ZOFaa	wow that is long, i think you should move on or atleast ask him who is more important|`|AA11646252	If you can not train the dog to listen to you then it is time to move on.  But then you also must say if he says this now then what else will be important to him later.<br>  <br>  rd

Just be easy about it.  No harm at all.<br>  <br>  Okay Troll - whats so thumbs down about this?  I know it is hard for you to engage what passes for a brain cell but you know what?  Men actually do do this - it doesnt make them a pervert or stupid and it can just be grown up fun - not something you would know about obviously.  Dont sweat the small stuff in life!  Except trolls - you should sweat until you are nothing but a puddle on the floor!|`|d36Qi7jLaa	buy him his own.  he will like you buying him panties of his own.  it means you are ok with him doing that.|`|briRpzL1aa	Give him a pair if it turns him on...
