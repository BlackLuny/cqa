20090203100904AAH0hub	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Water Lines frozen need help?	Here is the deal... We all used water this morning. So it was running just fine. I forgot to leave it dripping. Therefore when I got back around 8:30-9 my water wouldn't work in the house. Called a plumber to get an estimate of how much it was going to cost to have someone take a look at it and no one has called yet and it's now past noon!!!!! NOT HAPPY! So I went and turned the water valve off as much as I can and then opened up all the cold faucets in the house. Still nothing. I want to know how I can unfreeze my water? Where is it blocked out and how can I tell? I'm a stay at home mother who's husband can't come home so I need something quick and easy. Plus I don't want to electrocute myself!! Please help and thank you in advance!

Sometimes theres alot of dishes, and some times theres not, but I still wash anyway. Anyone else have more info? other thoughts?
20090203103009AAb1zQm	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	What's A Good, Cheap Alternative To Picture Framing?	I have a ton of posters and prints that I have been putting off having framed for years, because the cost of having them all put into proper frames is ridiculous...especially now.  I know that dry mounting on cardboard is one thing to consider, but it has an "elementary school art gallery" look that I don't like. And getting them laminated costs almost as much (if not more than) having them framed. Any suggestions?

I thought it would be pretty cool to give my room a little character by using some sort of marker to write all of the equations from my classes on the wall. I was just wondering if there was an erasable way to write it up there so that when it came time to move out of the dorm I could just wipe them away.

The maintence told us to see if it worked and then we heard a pop. Now the motherboard is fried. We bought a new pc but I feel that they should pay for the damages. It is either their waterheater or their washer that flooded. We had it flowing down our bedroom wall, out of our sockets, out of our vents.

20090219201721AAeskUw	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	I'm getting 3 hens that I'll keep in my backyard and need advice!!!?	I decided that I wanted to become more "organic" so I'm getting 2 rode island red hens and one that lays a lot of eggs but don't know the breed. I also got over 150 pounds of wheat (burmese or something like that) and about the same amount of corn. I have a large backyard but also have an aviary about 6'L X 2'W X 6'H. Should I keep them in the aviary? should I feed them just corn and wheat and what ever they can get in my back yard? I have a dog, a cat, exotic birds and a pond.  Are hens noisy? I have great neighbors and don't want to bother them, I told them I was getting the hens and that they could have organic eggs whenever they wanted to. I get the grain in large quantities for free and was wondering if I could eat it too but don't know how to cook it or what to do with it. I've been donating it to other people with birds. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

I want to clean out the mailbox so the house does not look abandoned to prevent possible abuse of the property before closing.   The mail in the box has been there for well over 6 months with the box open and visible from the road. Its been exposed to the weather and is a bit destroyed at this point. I want to know if I can take it out and bundle it up and take it to my local post office and drop it off as undeliverable mail? We have all been trained "not to tamper with mail" so it seemed like a good idea to ask.

20090219204640AARtIvg	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	For electricians and dryer repair people?	Earlier today I went to dry some clothes. When I turned on the dryer, it didn't heat. In times past, I found out that this can be due to poor airflow in the exhaust, and was easily corrected by just repositioning the dryer so that it has better exhaust airflow. Usually someone in the house 'leaned' on the dryer, pushed it out of the way (slippery wood floor) and the vent kind of moved and caused bad airflow; which made the heat not come on in the dryer. Today, I tried that and it didn't work. Pressing in on the plug made it spark some from the plug. But afterwards, the heat did come on in the dryer. It actually appeared to come on a lot hotter than normal, and I took my clothes out halfway because I was seriously scared that they would burn or something. I felt the back of the dryer and took them out when I noticed that it felt much hotter on the back of the dryer that it typically does when it is on. A very foul, toxic-like smell went throughout the house. The lint trap was clean. The dryer vent was venting outside properly, with no obstructions or lint clogs.       Earlier tonight, I took turned the main power off to the house and unplugged the dryer plug from the outlet. One pin from the dryer plug had melted the plastic around that pin. It did this:       http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/2335/mi...       What does that particular prong on the plug usually represent?          This is the wall outlet for the dryer plug:  http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/8008/mi...       You can see on the top right where it also seems to have burned the plug itself.       Just a couple of random pictures of the circuit breaker box and the diagram that tells a little bit about the breakers:       http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/5315/mi...        http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/3766/mi...          This is my mom's house, and it's freaking old as the hills. The entire thing needs to be rewired. All of the pipes need replacing (galvanized), and it needs more repairs than I am qualified for. We're planning to move by spring or summer of this year. I know this is dangerous and very much a firetrap of sorts.       The dryer outlet is a 30A 125/250V. Isn't everything 120/240 now?   The circuit breaker box says 100 Amps Max. We have a big split system heatpump that uses who knows how many...plus everything else typical in the house. That circuit breaker box concerns me sometimes when it 'buzzes' when the heat system comes on.      So I already know this whole place is freaking dangerous. What 'needs' to be done is everything needs to be rewired. We're moving soon, and that's an expense we'd rather leave to contractors (we're not even going to try to sell this place on the real estate market...it will need a host of contractors to fix it, and hopefully we can sell to some kind of contracting company).      So apart from what 'needs' to be done - what could have caused this particular pin in the plug to burn? From a safety standpoint, I know it may be foolish to do - but can I replace this dryer plug? What are the chances that it just wasn't plugged in all the way and the one pin melted/shorted when it was on with no heat, and I pushed the plug and it caused the plastic to melt?
20090219203507AAkTtpT	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	New memory foam pillow has strange odor?	I just bought a new memory foam pillow from JCPenney.  It wasn't cheap, but it wasn't restrictively expensive, either.  I noticed in one store that the pillow had a strange odor, which I thought was cigarette smoke.  All of that particular pillow design had the smell, too.  I couldn't buy a different design because I needed that particular amount of support due to the position I sleep in.  I didn't want a stinky pillow, obviously, so I drove across town to another JCPenney and looked at the pillows there.  The pillow that I bought there smelled okay at the store, but now that I have it home, I can detect the same strange odor.  It's not quite right for cigarettes, but smells stale and unpleasant.  I thought that at the first store maybe a stocker or employee had been smoking and the pillows just absorbed it, but it seems odd that even the same pillow design in another store across town would have the same odor.        I was wondering if anyone knew if the memory foam just smelled that way, and if it would wear off.  I can't sleep on a smelly pillow, but if it will wear off, I can avoid taking the pillow back.  I don't want to try washing it or anything, because it seems unfair to have to wash a brand new pillow.  I'll just take it back if the smell won't wear off, but I really need a pillow like this for my neck/shoulder pain.
