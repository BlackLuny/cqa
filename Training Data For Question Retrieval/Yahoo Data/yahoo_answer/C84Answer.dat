AA11494150	They must have a reason to stop you. The burden of proof required for a traffic stop is "reasonable suspicion".<br>  <br>  I'm not from New York, but I'm guessing the color of the sticker changes with the year. If he saw the wrong color, and suspected the sticker was expired, that is reasonable.<br>  <br>  One important fact... the officers "reasonable suspicion" does not have to be right, it just has to be reasonable. <br>  <br>  The legal principle you are referring to is called "The Exclusionary Rule", also known as the "Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine". It states anything obtained by illegal means is inadmissible in court.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	I am from NY.  The temporary inspection sticker is a plain white sticker attached to the inside of the windshield.  The expiration date on the sticker is hand written.  <br>  <br>  It's fairly common for people to "stretch" the ten days, sometimes only getting the car inspected when they get caught.<br>  <br>  The officer had reasonable suspicion to pull you over.  Sorry to say the charge will not be dismissed.  Most judges take driving on a suspended license very seriously.  You are not looking at jail time, but your suspension period will get longer and the fines will take a big hunk out of your finances.<br>  <br>  I'd start looking for other ways to get to school and your job if I were you.  Continuing to drive on a suspended license will just make your problems worse, each time you get caught the fine will get a little bigger and the suspension period will get a little longer.  The only way to get back on track is to stop driving until your privileges are restored.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	The stop was legal.  He believed in good faith that he had reasonable suspicion to stop you, and that WILL fly in court.  Because he had already had you stopped, he performed a background check for warrants and what-not for his safety, as he was having contact with you.  It might be thrown out in court, and could probably be plead down if it's not dismissed, but the officer took appropriate action at the time.|`|CBmizuGwaa	...try to remember, there is NO Constitutional right to drive...  it is a privilege afforded to you.

These ingredients were given this consumer-friendly name because part of their structure resembles sugar and part is similar to alcohol.<br>  <br>  Not one in the same<br>  Don't be confused. Although they share a similar name, sugar alcohol and alcoholic beverages do not have the same chemical structure. Sugar alcohol does not contain ethanol, which is found in alcoholic beverages.<br>  <br>  What is sugar alcohol?<br>  Sugar alcohols, also know as polyols, are ingredients used as sweeteners and bulking agents. They occur naturally in foods and come from plant products such as fruits and berries. As a sugar substitute, they provide fewer calories (about a half to one-third less calories) than regular sugar. This is because they are converted to glucose more slowly, require little or no insulin to be metabolized and don't cause sudden increases in blood sugar. This makes them popular among individuals with diabetes; however, their use is becoming more common by just about everyone. You may be consuming them and not even know it.<br>  <br>  Identifying them<br>  Common sugar alcohols are mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, isomalt, maltitol and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (HSH). Sugar alcohols are not commonly used in home food preparation, but are found in many processed foods. Food products labeled “sugar-free,” including hard candies, cookies, chewing gums, soft drinks and throat lozenges often consist of sugar alcohols. They are frequently used in toothpaste and mouthwash too.<br>  <br>  Check carbohydrates<br>  So why are sugar alcohols used so often? For one thing, they help to provide the sweet flavor to food in many products marketed towards individuals with diabetes. But, beware! There is often the misconception that all sugar alcohol-containing products are “free foods.” Some of these products may still contain significant amounts of carbohydrates. It's important to check the food label for the total carbohydrate contained in the product and talk with a registered dietitian to determine how it will best fit into your meal plan.<br>  <br>  If a manufacturer uses the term “sugar free” or “no added sugar,” they must list the grams of sugar alcohols. If more than one sugar alcohol is used in a product, the “Nutrition Facts” panel will list the amount of sugar alcohol it contains under the total carbohydrate. If just one sugar alcohol is used, the label will list its specific name, for example, “mannitol” or “hydrogenated starch hydrolysates.”<br>  <br>  Pros and cons of sugar alcohols<br>  On the positive side, sugar alcohols contain less calories (1.5 - 3 calories per gram) than sugar (4 calories per gram), and they do not cause tooth decay like sugar does. Therefore, many “sugar-free” gums including Trident? and Extra? are made with sugar alcohols. Sugar alcohols also add texture to foods, retain moisture better and prevent foods from browning when they are heated.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there are some negatives associated with sugar alcohols. The most common side effect is the possibility of bloating and diarrhea when sugar alcohols are eaten in excessive amounts. There is also some evidence that sugar alcohols, much like fructose (natural fruit sugar) in fruit and fruit juice can cause a “laxative effect.” Weight gain has been seen when these products are overeaten. The American Diabetes Association claims that sugar alcohols are acceptable in a moderate amount but should not be eaten in excess. Some people with diabetes, especially Type I diabetics, have found that their blood sugars rise if sugar alcohols are eaten in uncontrolled amounts.<br>  <br>  Sugar alcohols vs. artificial sweeteners<br>  Sugar alcohols and artificial sweeteners, such as saccharin (Sweet & Low?) and aspartame (Equal? or Nutrasweet?), are not one and the same. One difference between the two types of sugar substitutes is that the artificial sweeteners contain zero calories whereas sugar alcohols contain about 2.6 calories per gram. Another issue is diabetes management. Artificial sweeteners do not contain carbohydrates so they do not cause blood sugar to elevate, whereas, sugar alcohols have some effect on blood sugar. Overall, both can be useful in diabetes management when used properly.<br>  <br>  Forms of sugar alcohol<br>  Mannitol occurs naturally in pineapples, olives, asparagus, sweet potatoes and carrots. It is extracted from seaweed for use in food manufacturing. Mannitol has 50-70 percent of the relative sweetness of sugar, which means more must be used to equal the sweetness of sugar. Mannitol lingers in the intestines for a long time and therefore often causes bloating and diarrhea.<br>  <br>  Sorbitol is found naturally in fruits and vegetables. It is manufactured from corn syrup. Sorbitol has only 50 percent of t|`|a8e1KcS2aa	Trooper gets a thumbs up from me.  To further explain about the Breathalyzer.

a1pmr73vaa	Data indicate that the biases against minorities and women that humans show in laboratory settings are reflected in real-world practices. According to the March 1995 report of the Federal Glass Ceiling Commission, for example, a large proportion of minorities and women are locked into low-wage, low-prestige, and dead-end jobs. Additional data suggest that these two groups have been disproportionately affected by current trends in workforce downsizing; many service-oriented industries, for example, disproportionately employ women and minorities and are likely to continue downsizing through the year 2002. It is likely that the minorities and women who work in these industries will be hardest hit (Murrell and Jones, 1995).|`|htSZsds7aa	all of us...if i am more qualified, but dont get the job because they have to hire a minority who isnt as qualified, we both have lost as well as the company.

fa0KZ6bMaa	Every time Obama talks, the stock market drops. Every time the stock market drops, consumer confidence drops. When consumer confidence drops, businesses fail and people lose jobs. People lose jobs and then lose their assets and homes. Common sense tells you Obama and his democrat run congress are incredibly bad for America. <br>  <br>  Why can't the supposed "intellectual" liberals explain why as soon as Obama's spendulus bill passed, the stock market has been continuing to plummet downward. If this bill is what America needs, wouldn't the opposite be happening in anticipation of "good times" to come?

The market is not an entity, it is people. People like you and I who choose to invest. Obama has not generated any consumer confidence. In turn no investor confidence has been produced. This is a direct result of his plans. One is that he is spending massive amounts which no one knows how they will repay, but many believe that it will be through increased taxation on much lower incomes than what is being reported by the administration. The second revolves around all the new tax proposals on individuals, businesses and commodities. This last is most detrimental to the market because it drastically reduces expectation on returns from investment. Obama needs to back off on his agenda, slow the spending and definitely can the tax increases. These things would provide some breathing room and a possible platform for the beginning signs of recovery to take shape. Everything with Obama is now, now, now.

c9efb9774c2c4a0a3e5040b9d214c4d7aa	It depends on what you mean by the words. In the 19th and early 20th century, both words meant the same thing - basically people who believed the government was a tool used by the wealthy to oppress the poor and that the poor should take the economy into their own hands and stop listening to the former "owners".<br>  <br>  However, late in the 20th century, pro-capitalists in the United States started using the term "libertarian" to refer to themselves when they wanted to distance themselves from authoritarian communist states like the Soviet Union.<br>  <br>  Anarchism, however, still has its original meaning - a leftist, anti-capitalist ideology, rather than a right-wing, pro-capitalist ideology. Some anarchists now refer to themselves as "libertarian socialists" in order to distinguish themselves from the pro-capitalists who call themselves "libertarians".<br>  <br>  Some of the more extreme pro-capitalist "libertarians" call themselves anarcho-capitalists. Most anarchists see that as a contradiction in terms, because they see the hierarchies in the "wage slavery" system, constructed in order to enforce capital property control in modern corporations, to be authoritarian rather than anarchist. <br>  <br>  Most companies, after all, are structured like dictatorships - with a CEO or Board at the top, issuing commands to everyone below them. Control passes from the top down, rather than originating from the bottom, like your average democracy.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	So if one is more extreme, how coud they seem the same?<br>  <br>  Anarchists are opposed to ALL government.  Libertarians are opposed to any governments that infringe on the civil/financial liberties we are all guaranteed as humans.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Anarchists say NO government; libertarians say limited government. Hence, they aren't the SAME.<br>  <br>  Libertarians consider government necessary; anarchists say we don't need to have governments.|`|LNFg5KMuaa	Libertarians don't believe in not having a government.  We believe in laws and institutions that don't interfere with our right to act without regulation, restriction, or aid as long as that act doesn't interfere with others ability to act as they choose.  Our founders were reluctant to make a bill of rights because they all said that our rights were unable to fit on paper.  In other word we have a right of free choice, and whenever government gets involved with anything it becomes a government monopoly and you have lost your choice, and therefore your freedom.<br>  <br>  SOMETIMES it's necessary for government to step in but it is imperative that those times be defined as situational necessary evils and not rights that people are entitled to because the only thing your entitled to, is life liberty, and persuit of happiness, that is libertarianism|`|c3vPZfghaa	libertarians believe in a government that protects the rights of its citizens.<br>  <br>  Anarchists prefer the "Natural State"* of man.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	Using your logic a democrat is just a less extreme communist. Is that about right?|`|JV75Iz3eaa	Libertarians believe in the rule of law.  Limited government and no government are not the same thing.

Yes I see it: each bailout is another tear in the hull in the Titanic. More and more spending, until the entire hull is gutted, and the ship is sunk.<br>  Do you see those guys on the life-boats?

esOaJoqBaa	Humanitarian intervention follow the same lines of thought as any war: they death of a few will bring greater good to the many. Violent men understand only greater violence, and unless that violence is brought to bear on them they will not cease.

That is not the case anymore. There is already too much going on to be able to commit the resources necessary to go into Rwanda or Darfur. <br>  <br>  The American public is already tired of the idea of nation building, and that is what would be necessary to help those people out. The current regimes are to flawed and corrupt to continue, they would nedd to be abolished and started over from scratch, and the American public would not put up with years of involvement in those nations.|`|yKLBdoigaa	You have it all wrong, you do know that some jobs or MOS's have no lethal force or any force what so ever?

If by chance you're American, I suggest you concentrate on fixing the corrupt political situation here and not worry about the Russian matter.<br>   This is the problem in this country today, it seems like everyone is more worried about others than this country we live in.<br>    On the other hand, if you  are a Russian citizen, then I'm afraid It's your problem and none of our business, so good luck.|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	What problems?<br>  Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics " You are not alone"<br>  "The Final Countdown"<br>  "Gotta go home"<br>  Like every one else too having the same misery in own backyards in time.<br>  Luke 21.30-36<br>  Genesis 11.1,3-9<br>  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49<br>  Luke 9.25,55-56,60<br>  Luke 8.5-8,10-17<br>  Luke 4.4<br>  Luke 11.33-36,46-52<br>  Leviticus 4.13,22<br>  John 8.44<br>  Luke 16.13<br>  Matt 23.27<br>  Exodus 23.24,32<br>  Exodus 20.1-7<br>  Luke 9.27<br>  Exodus 20.5<br>  Leviticus 26.13-24,30-41<br>  Luke 24.44-45,47-48<br>  Matt 5.9,14<br>  Matt 22.17-21,32<br>  What do you think?|`|QI74CxD0aa	I think you might get better answers in the history section, because the political problems in Russia are a heritage of its past.  <br>  The disintegration of the former Soviet Union created problems in places like Chechnya where other people have tried to get independence.  There have been problems with former parts of the Soviet Union, like Georgia.   Some other countries like the Baltic States and Ukraine are fearful of Russian's trying to get control.   <br>  <br>  Then there are the economic problems.   After Communism, there was widespread speculation, and mafia type activities.  Respected journalists have been assassinated.  There are political issues involved in the oil and gas business.  Russia supplies a lot of this to Europe, including former Soviet republics.  <br>  <br>  It will take time to fix these problems, and the commitment of the Russian people.<br>  <br>  Unlike what others have said, I think that what happens in other countries does affect us, especially in a world that has grown smaller.
CM3Fl3WRaa	My wife did a few times. Her country doesn't allow name changes (something we found out when we went to renew her passport). Her green card was in her married name. Her passport was in her maiden name. Never had a problem.|`|AA11429715	She probably can travel with the combination of US residence card and SA passport in the two names, but it would be a whole lot easier to get a new SA passport in her married name which would match the residence card.  This would avoid any possible problems.
aBPtOorbaa	Technically, yes.  Any citizen can take another citizen to small claims court as long as the reason isn't frivolous.  In other words, your case would be thrown out if you sued President Obama for your payment of $2,500 in taxes because you didn't like the way he was running the country.  This is based on opinion and could not be adjudicated through rational jurisprudence.  If this frivolous suit was allowed in court and ruled in favor of the plaintiff, courts would be flooded with millions of Republicans (and some Democrats) with pleadings for tax dollars back.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, what I believe you are truly asking is if we think you would recover damages if you brought this case to court.  This isn't an easy yes and you should consult with a licensed legal professional (which I am not) as the law is complex.  Recovery of damages in civil court depends on three things: the characteristics of the judge who hears your case, the specific laws of the jurisdiction of the court, and the strength of the case you have presented.  Luckily in civil cases, the burden of proof is a preponderance of evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt; but I should note, the full burden of this proof lies within you, the plaintiff.<br>  <br>  The characteristics of the judge weighs heavily on your case.  If you know your judge in advance, it may be wise to research how that judge has ruled similar cases in the past.  The way judges have ruled similar cases in the past is called precedence and this a tool in proving your case.  If you reference a precedence that is very similar to your case and was decided in a favor in which you desire, there is a good possibility you will recover damages.  A good rule of thumb is to learn, anticipate, understand, and RESPECT your judge - they are very powerful.<br>  <br>  The laws of your jurisdiction have a direct effect on your case.  The statutory law of your state or commonwealth should be researched prior to your pleadings (the original step in which you present the information of your matter, including, but not limited to: plaintiff information, defendant information, damages incurred, how damages were incurred, etc.).  A great tool for researching statutory law would be the internet.  Usually you can type "the code of" and then your state/commonwealth name and get a hyperlink leading to your jurisdictional code - for example, if researching the laws of the State of Maryland, you would type: the code of Maryland.<br>  <br>  The strength of your case should take into consideration the judge's characteristics and precedence and also the respective laws of your jurisdiction.  Furthermore, you should build your case in a way that it would be impossible for a judge to rule against you.  Gathering as much information as possible and organizing that information seems like common sense, but can become a daunting task that you MUST follow through with in order to recover damages.<br>  <br>  In your case, you may want to reference case precedence, statutory law, the nature of your agreement with your boyfriend about the phone bills, and also documents supporting the debts you've incurred.<br>  <br>  One thing that may hinder your case is the nature of the agreement between you and your boyfriend.  There is something called the statute of frauds which outlines certain types of agreements that must be made in writing to be enforceable.  A way to remember these agreements is by the acronym of MY LEGS, which stands for:<br>  <br>  Marriage<br>  Year<br>  <br>  Land<br>  Executor-ship<br>  Goods<br>  Surety<br>  <br>  The Y in the acronym of MY LEGS may hinder your case.  Y or Year refers to the necessity of a signed written contract for agreements that cannot be performed within one year.  If your contract for telephone service is longer than one year, which most service contracts are now two years, then your ex boyfriend or his representation may point out that the payment for the line of service for his telephone couldn't be satisfied within one year, therefore any enforceable agreement should have been in writing.<br>  <br>  To reiterate, the success of your case depends on many factors, but if you adequately prepare for small claims and anticipate arguments, you have a good chance of recovering damages.  <br>  <br>  For my personal indemnification:<br>  In finality, I must say, as I have given substantial information, I am NOT a licensed law professional nor does my information intend to offer actual legal remedy.  I am a senior undergraduate student of business and I have had courses involving business and paralegal law.  In any case of legal jurisprudence, for definitive answers, consult a licensed lawyer in your area.  This information is solely intended to give you ideas on how to research your case further and all information could be found on your own.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email, though I cannot legally provide specific law advice, I can help direct you to resources to do your own research, or to a licensed law professional in your area.|`|epbzW5N8aa	yes you can and do not forget a detailed bill showing his charges.|`|2rcSILkWaa	Yes.

D4jZM26Paa	Refound common interests<br>  <br>  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, with Russia having been considerably weakened, both countries found common interests and a common free market orientation, and related to these, a common opponent: the United States as the sole superpower. In 1991, the Sino-Russian Border Agreement was signed apportioning territory that became contested during the Sino-Soviet border conflict.<br>  <br>  Outer Manchuria<br>  <br>  The Russian government agreed to transfer Yinlong Island as well as one half of Heixiazi Island (zh:黑瞎子岛) to China in 2004, ending a long-standing border dispute between Russia and China. Both islands are found at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, and were until then administered by Russia and claimed by China. The event was meant to foster feelings of reconciliation and cooperation between the two countries by their leaders. The transfer has been ratified by both the Chinese National People's Congress and the Russian State Duma. The official transfer ceremony was held on-site 14 October 2008.<br>  <br>  In 2001, the close relations between the two countries were formalized with the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, a twenty-year strategic, economic, and controversially, (arguably) an implicit military treaty. A month before the treaty was signed, the two countries joined with junior partners Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The PRC is currently Russia's largest customer of imports needed to modernize the People's Liberation Army, and the foremost benefactor of the under construction Russian Eastern Siberia – Pacific Ocean oil pipeline.|`|V1HAfAKUaa	They are quite  strong, as china and russia are former communist countrys, which basically is as strong the relationship between USA and Britain.|`|taElYijzaa	I don't care that, because I totally hate my government.<br>  Especially the Cultural Revolution by Mao.<br>  <br>  I hope I would chop the Mao's dead body into pieces and use it to raise dog.

jh9iPYvXaa	Bankruptcy stalls foreclosure, but not permanently. If you're that bad off, you might lose your home anyway. But it's a useful step if you're close to being able to make the payments.|`|spuz7DvNaa	You can file for bankruptcy and they cannot take your home but you must continue to make the payments which is what hinders people. You file bankruptcy on the bills you owe, not the bills you will owe after the date of filing. If you cannot make the payments, the courts will order a sale of the property or the banks will be able to reclaim the property.<br>  <br>  There is one thing that can delay all actions is to go to the bank or mortgage company and PRODUCE THE NOTE. Many companies cannot or have a hard time producing the note that even proves you owe them any money. This is the new, very legal, tactic being used to hold them off. From what I hear there are some banks/morgage companies that are writing the debt off because the note has changed hands so many times they cannot find it.|`|0925b6e49a69fe375d1a58ad2c4b8713aa	Because, simply filing bankruptcy will not automatically save your home.  It may provide a temporary stop to the foreclosure, and, that may be exactly what is needed in some situations to then restructure the loan and situation so that you can keep the house.  However,if you are then not able to show how you can now afford the house, you will still lose it.  So, for many people, it simply costs more money to file and ultimately the damage is the same.  Also, in the past, many of the ones that are being foreclosed on have already claimed bankruptcy.  So, they already know that they will not be able to use that again.

Griffin had previously been chairman of the National Front.  <br>  <br>  While Griffin was still a leading figure in the National Front, he was a close associate of Roberto Fiore, an Italian who belonged to a Fascist group which carried out the Bologna massacre, killing 85 people and injuring 200 others in the train station of that town.<br>  <br>  Nick Griffin has appeared on the same platform as David Duke, former leader of the Ku Klux Klan and a former member of the Louisiana state legislature. In 1996, Griffin launched a scathing attack on the Holocaust denier David Irving for admitting that some people might have died in the Holocaust. "True Revisionists will not be fooled by this new twist to the sorry tale of the Hoax of the Twentieth Century," <br>  <br>  When the former MP Alex Carlile reported Griffin for inciting racial hatred and Holocaust denial, Griffin commented: "This bloody Jew, our local MP who organised the raid whose only claim to fame is that two of his parents died in the Holocaust." Griffin wrote, "Some antisemitism may be provoked by the actions of certain Jews themselves and thereby have a rational basis". He also denied the Holocaust in several party publications prior to becoming leader. <br>  <br>  In 1995, Nick Griffin wrote in 'The Rune' magazine of the need to defend "rights for whites" with "well-directed boots and fists".<br>  <br>  In 1998 was convicted of incitement to racial hatred<br>  <br>  Nick Griffin made national headlines when he appeared at a joint press conference with Front National leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen<br>  <br>  He wants to introduce the following, it is in their manifesto:<br>  <br>  The reintroduction of national service and the requirement of people completing national service to maintain a standard issue automatic rifle in their home.<br>  <br>  The repeal of all equalities legislation<br>  <br>  the reforming of disabled and homosexual people. <br>  <br>  Its constitution states that all members must be of "British or closely kindred native European stock." <br>  <br>  He leads a party which when documentary-maker Jason Gwynne went undercover and joined the BNP for six months. His secret filming recorded party leader Nick Griffin calling Islam a "wicked, vicious faith"; party member Steve Barkham confessing to assaulting an Asian man in the 2001 Bradford Riots; and party member Stewart Williams stating that he wanted to "blow up" Bradford's mosques with a rocket launcher and council candidate Dave Midgley confessing to pushing dog faeces through the letterbox of an Asian takeaway.<br>  <br>  Then he has the support of such a free thinker like Richard Edmonds. When asked if the BNP was racist, Richard Edmonds, deputy leader of the BNP, said, "We are 100 per cent racist, yes". Tyndall had previously proclaimed "Mein Kampf is my Bible." Under his leadership, the BNP was strongly supportive of the South African Apartheid system.<br>  <br>  No not a lunatic just a fascist, white supremisist.|`|twdXT5wOaa	I wouldn't worry too much about this - a few councillors elected by illiterates in depressed areas won't give him a power base to do any more than the foaming to a small idiot audience he enjoys now.<br>  <br>  And, as has been pointed out before, he was probably already bonkers at public school - too much buggery, if you ask me...|`|xqtXY0RFaa	Auf Britain you halff a long history ovf making problem mit der rest ovf Europe, but now der time has come for us to shake mit der hants.

It is to do with the Nationalist idea of the Corporate State. It was applied to good effect by Michael Collins in Ireland (the National Loan) and later by de Valera in the same Emerald Isle - indeed had de Valera had not applied it seriously in the Ireland of the 1930s - when England had raised a tariff barrier against their importation of Irish goods, Ireland could well have gone bust.<br>  <br>  The corralling of funds to facilitate the earning of more funds through investment in industry is the first principle in business - one can earn more money in the mid to long term by re-investing interest payments in productive manufacture of goods that can sell and make a profit, than one can do by speculative investments in foreign projects whose value can fluctuate and whose outcome cannot be influenced by our own Government's policy.<br>  <br>  This is, essentially, the Corporate State, as espoused by Tyndall of the NF and made real by nations such as Israel. There could be a certain irony here, but it is noticeable that the BNP does not maintain an anti-Jewish stance.

BImIMnbzaa	The predictors of event in 2012 were hardly from our time.

It was Nostradamus who accurately predicted the WTC tragedy.  His word usage became understandable only after the terrible tragedy.  Words to the effect ," the twin brothers in the new city !"<br>  <br>  The Hopi Indian tribe is also a source of prediction for the events of 2012.

PPoyjq3Vaa	The United States government has a history of committing atrocity to blame on groups it doesn't like.<br>  <br>  Look up Operation Ajax  (the CIA's overthrow of Iran's democratically elected President Mossadeq)<br>  <br>  and then there's Operation Northwoods, where the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States drew up a plan to bomb a civilian airplane, then blame Cuba for that.    That way there'd be an excuse to invade Cuba.<br>  <br>  More recently is the 9/11 and Anthrax attacks, which are obviously connected to Dick Cheney and the men in the Project for a New American Century,  somehow.    There are no implicating documents yet.  But these documents take 25 years to come out, usually.<br>  <br>  We cannot trust the word of the United States Government until it has shown to clean up its act.  Obama is an improvement over Bush.  We'll see how much or how little an improvement he is, as time moves forward.<br>  <br>  There are definitely elements in our government who want to falsify an attack to blame Iran.    Senator Gary Hart wrote Iran a public letter warning about this very issue.<br>  <br>  The neoconservative element that still exists within the U.S. government has no problem with orchestrating the killing of others, and then the blaming of those killings on our government's or global corporations' enemies.<br>  <br>  If Obama reigns in the shadowy security apparatus too quickly...   that apparatus will falsify yet ANOTHER attack, and then try to blame Obama for being "weak".     That's why so many Democrats get so scared telling the truth... because they know this is what happens, and they know they cannot talk about it because they will be sidelined as paranoid conspiracy believers by the authoritarian Republicans... and more than half of the American public is too stupid to see through it.|`|E70A7aqcaa	Are you sober?

There were no 'unusual' events which enabled their actions - they just went for a simple plan and partly succeeded.<br>  <br>  I doubt if CIA were involved in Hariri's assassination;  it has all the hallmarks of a Syrian organised hit.  It was big, involved many people, and had all the escapes planned.  It wasn't a ramshackle one like certain local groups use to carry out, it wasn't small and clean like the alleged hits from the southern neighbour.  In the political situation, it would be hard to believe that any group could even plan something that big without the Syrian occupying authorities knowing about it, let alone escape with it.  That includes the CIA, professional as they are.<br>  <br>  I think it's also telling that Ghazi Kanaan, Syria's 'proconsul' in Lebanon committed 'suicide' which may be genuine.  Either he approved the hit without consulting his boss, or he botched it by not making it look like someone else's job.  Either way his cushy role was over, and there would be no pleasant retirement in the lemon groves above Damascus.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it's the Syrian government that's the biggest obstacle to open investigation of the murder.<br>  <br>  So, I don't buy it.

Government has only two valid functions, to protect the Citizenry from external military threat, and from internal criminal threat.  Certain agencies serve these valid functions.  Certainly the police and the military.  Certainly the courts and probably others as well.  <br>  <br>  Liberty is characterized by a society of individuals with such high moral character that they don't need a government because everyone acts out of an inner conviction of right and wrong.  <br>  <br>  Anarchy is characterized by a society whose members actions have no unifying guiding principles and the strong prey upon the weak.  Anarchy, by definition, cannot exist because the strong dictate terms to the weak, and this constitutes tyranny, a form of government.<br>  <br>  In Somolia, any attempt by the people to start a private school or fire department would result in the strong brutalizing the owners in order to serve their ends.  Tyranny arises naturally when Judeo-Christian principles wane.<br>  <br>  In a culture based on Judeo-Christian morality, the people would organize any and all services needed and the free market would adjust the price based on competition and excellence.  <br>  <br>  America was great because America was good.  It was when America ceased being good that it ceased being great.<br>  <br>  Now we have Obama.  Socialism is on the horizon, GM will soon fold as will numerous other businesses forced to conduct business in an unprofitable manner to serve unjust laws passed by 'equalizers' like BHO.<br>  <br>  Technically, income tax is a violation of the right to property.  A constitutionally protected God-given right is not subject to tax.  Your labor is your property, and when you trade it straight across for remuneration, it is not taxable.  There are valid taxes, and I don't mind at all paying them when they're used for Constitutionally valid purposes.  I don't mind sales tax on items that aren't a God-given right.  There shouldn't be a tax on guns, for instance because the 2nd amendment protects our right to keep and bear arms.  The right to life requires that I buy food and clothing to preserve my life.  Being necessities of life, these should be free from taxation, as should my primary dwelling be free of property tax or sales tax.<br>  <br>  As Billy Bud said "Farewell, oh rights of man."|`|b32jC7pGaa	Also no military....|`|AA11369432	That would be difficult to get use to.<br>   would we pay every time we drive down a road or highway.<br>  I say tax me.|`|JUyid5Wgaa	yes|`|Q6euzOmVaa	cut - hell yes!<br>  abolish - can't<br>  <br>  Congress & Obama are pinheads for wasting OUR money!|`|AA10928202	Good luck on getting that law passed.

Do you agree they need parental consent, or do you think they can get one without telling their parents?|`|73760ec70f62b217eab4a5ab28ce822baa	I agree with your first point.<br>  <br>  I disagree with your second point. She shouldn't need her husband's permission. Although I agree that it would be pretty rotten of a woman to have an abortion behind her husband's back, especially if he wants a baby; it's not the 1800's and women have the same legal rights as men.  Men and women should discuss whether or not they want children before getting married and/or having sex with each other.<br>  <br>  I agree with your third point. That's the way it currently stands. No one is forcing women to have abortions against their will.<br>  <br>  I agree with your fourth point. Isn't discussing the effects of ANY medical procedure already the status quo? If not, then it should be.<br>  <br>  I disagree with your fourth point. Many rape victims do not call the police right away because they are ashamed, drunk, tired, or injured. I really don't think it would be appropriate.|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	The only one I agree with is private Physicians having the option to not perform the abortion and that some states could require that alternate options be given to the mother. Those are already part of the current laws anyway outlined in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The test in that was that abortions are legal before viability but that states can place some restrictions on them as long as it doesn't present an undue burden on the mother. I will provide a link to that case below.<br>  <br>  I disagree with the spousal one and the Supreme Court already did too. I also disagree with the rape requirement that they report it within 72 hours. You are not a woman and probably don't understand the emotional reasons behind that objection, however, if you were ever raped, I'm sure you would understand why that is a bad requirement. Many women feel ashamed, scared, untrusting, or confused, and 72 hours is placing a huge burden on them.|`|JinXSnnMaa	Can I file a police report if I'm raped by my husband? You're statements and mine, are the very reasons Roe vs. Wade will never be overturned or revisited. Bottom line, a woman has a right to choose. Period! <br>  <br>  Try to understand. Women don't like abortions. Nor do we have them as a method of birth control. There are so many different reasons and situations why a woman would choose such a drastic measure. It's personal, guilt provoking, and a procedure not taken lightly.<br>  <br>  I would never have an abortion. I would try to talk my daughters out of having an abortion. But don't ever tell me the choice is no longer mine.|`|Bu4XeFVPaa	I don't think it is simple at all.<br>  I know there are many kids born to parents who won't or can't care for them.  That is child abuse, anyone can have a baby, it takes more than a crotch to be a parent.<br>  I am not sure which is worse, being born into a situation where you lose from day one, or not being born at all.<br>  Stop the abuse, all children deserve to be cared for.|`|QeV1ZkrPaa	Ok here's the deal I do not agree with you 100%, But  I personally would not chose to have an abortion, but who the hell am I to tell someone what they can and cannot do..  Bottom line I don't agree with it nor condone it, but I am not GOD...(or whomever/whatever you believe in)   I chose life for myself, but I am pro choice for others because it is not up to me to decide what someone can or cannot do. I can think it is wrong all day long, but it is our right to have that freedom of choice.  We cannot take that away just because we don't believe something is right or wrong...And that's my opinion..|`|kB7Wuyknaa	Not all.  It is extremely difficult for a women to report a rape, mentally that is.  It is soo humiliating, scary and just plain terrifying to go into the police station and do that.  After a rape, a women is so terrorized and traumatized that it's difficult to put herself  out there and in such a vulnerable position.  Who'd want to be raped all over again if the police don't believe you?  That's how it would feel to the victim.  So, no, I don't agree with you on that one.  I also don't agree on the consent from the father.  What if he is an abuser?  What if he can use the pregnancy as a weapon?  What if he can use that pregnancy and child as a way of keeping the women where he wants her?  What if the women knows for a fact that he will abuse that child too?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If the abusive father knows about the child and the child is born, that would bind her to him for the rest of her life. She will never be completely rid of him.|`|vszOEaOZaa	I am pro choice no matter what.  my only rule, not after the 2nd trimester.  it's not a man's choice to make.  it's a woman's choice who should chose to involve the father but should NOT be forced to.

I honestly wouldn't complain if starving nations would have them in larger amounts.|`|SwyZkNn6aa	I think that a woman should be able to have an abortion for any reason she wants to in the first trimester.<br>  <br>  After that I think it should be limited to health of the mother/fetus.  12 weeks is certainly long enough to decide what you want to do.<br>  <br>  And for all the pro-lifers out there who say that partial birth abortion is common, please read your facts.  It is only performed in extreme cases where the fetus or mother has no chance of survival.  You will be very hard pressed to find a clinic or doctor who would provide an abortion at that late of a stage.|`|RNEIC8X0aa	Why is it all about the woman...what if the man wants to abort it, and she chooses to keep it...why should he be forced to pay child support?..You can't have it both ways.

Not so much.<br>  <br>  The 'free' market is a lie and a fraud. Capitalism is a cruel pyramid scheme<br>  <br>  The solution to the spreading economic crisis and the deteriorating social position of the working class lies not in the reform of capitalism, for it is beyond reform. The crisis is of a systemic and historical character. As feudalism gave way to capitalism, capitalism must give way to socialism. The key industrial, financial, technological and natural resources must be taken out of the sphere of the capitalist market and private ownership, transferred to society and placed under the democratic supervision and control of the working class. The organization of economic life on the basis of the capitalist law of value must be replaced with its socialist reorganization on the basis of democratic economic planning, whose purpose is the fulfillment of social needs.<br>  While employing democratic rhetoric to legitimize its rule within the United States and to justify its use of violence all over the world, the contemporary American state retains at its disposal repressive mechanisms of unparalleled scope: a prison system that, with more than two million people behind bars, is the largest in the world; a massive and heavily armed police force; a judicial system that processes over 14 million arrests annually and that has the power to inflict capital punishment; an immensely powerful and lavishly funded military force, imbued with militaristic and anti-democratic sentiments; and a vast “national security” apparatus, which has been given extraordinary latitude in spying on and prying into the private affairs of the people. Over all these institutions the American people exercise virtually no effective supervision or control. Torture has become state policy, habeas corpus has been drastically restricted, and the state operates, in addition to its public prisons within the United States, an international gulag network of secret prisons into which nameless individuals, deemed “enemy combatants,” are made to disappear.<br>  Democratic rights established in an earlier historical period have been drastically eroded. Lincoln’s democratic vision of a government “of the people, by the people, for the people” has long since degenerated into rule of, by, and for the rich. The right to vote means little in a political process regimented by an institutionalized bipartisan “two-party” system that guarantees the monopolization of election campaigns by the two corporate-backed political parties. The existing electoral set-up excludes effective participation by parties opposed to the Democrats and Republicans. Ballot access laws have been designed to prevent challenges to the two-party dictatorship. Likewise, freedom of the press means little when the major media outlets are controlled by powerful corporate interests.<br>  The defense of democratic rights is inseparably bound up with the struggle for socialism. As there can be no socialism without democracy, there will be no democracy without socialism. Political equality is impossible without economic equality. <br>  <br>  Capitalism exists today because of the betrayals of the working class by its own organizations - the mass political parties and the trade unions. “The world political situation as a whole is chiefly characterized by a historical crisis of the leadership of the proletariat.” These words, with which Leon Trotsky began the founding document of the Fourth International, remain supremely relevant as a definition of contemporary political reality. There is not a single mass organization in the world today that presents itself as an opponent of the existing world capitalist order, let alone summons the working class to revolutionary struggle. This has created a surreal environment, in which the anger and discontent of the working class is suppressed by the old, politically sclerotic organizations. But as Trotsky also wrote in the founding document of the Fourth International, The Transitional Program: “The orientation of the masses is determined first by the objective conditions of decaying capitalism and second by the treacherous politics of the old workers’ organizations. Of these factors, the first of course is the decisive one: the laws of history are stronger than the bureaucratic apparatus.”<br>  EDIT None of the countries you list are or were actually Marxist<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Av3DN3hUyhT8QjNpW3it3EHty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081030110028AAs8hyQ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvAI_C0HsZgLrFdtfiK2mKjty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081223115702AAwqrQt">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|2rcSILkWaa	Yes, that's why no one wants to go there.

And I believe that you are paste and copy happy as well.<br>  <br>  You truly blew your cover by equating an economic system to a political system. Capitalism is equatable to Socialism and Democracy is equatable to Totalitarianism, to equate Socialism to Democracy is like equating apples to bowling balls.<br>  <br>  As for the economics of South America, were I just returned from, Milton Friedman and the Chicago School of Economics built their Capitalist structure. Yes you could make some abstract contrivience of French Politics to some of the South American revolts but again you confuse Politics with Economics.<br>  <br>  Socialism has nothing what so ever to do with Governance. You could interchange any Economic system ( Capitalism, Communism, Socialism, Anarcho-Capitalism, Mechantilism, Serfdom etc ) with any Political system you like. Democracy mixes perfectly well with Socialism just ask the French. And Capitalism works just dandy under Totalitarianism just ask Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy or Franco era Spain.<br>  <br>  Also I would like to bring to your attention that America is a Republic not a Democracy. The Founding Fathers loathe Democracy, because it is mob rule of the majority. Democracy does not give you freedom, ask the ancient Greek slaves and under class. <br>  <br>  Further the U.S. is far from the freest of nations, that esteemed title belongs to The Netherlands with the U.S. ranked at 12.

And is a central bank.)<br>  <br>  To stimulate the economy it would have made more sense to cut corporate tax and get those companies back in the U.S. then being in other nations. The tax revenue generated by them returning to the U.S. would have been a bigger boost to the economy. Even taking this bail out and giving it to the people would have been better then giving it to companies that have already proven they can not manage a company. You do realize this stimulus was big enough to give every adult in the U.S. 1 million dollars. Some would sit on it some would invest and yet others would blow it. This still would have been a bigger boost to the economy then building highspeed internet or repaving roads or a National mass transit system. How is Monitoring volcanoes. Going to boost the economy? After all this is what this was supposed to be for correct? I mean how is building a new road or a national mass transit going to save your job?|`|jZZ6KZVxaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If9KopxdA..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If9KopxdA...</a>|`|KZh3x4g9aa	absolutely nothing ! the market will take care of itself...he fooled you again ! this is not a stimulus bill,it is payback to the buds that elected him.|`|mINwDdXtaa	Lets see , all the junk we buy from China , the competition of seeing american busisness go over seas , leaving the money there , there needs to be laws, that if you live in the U.S  you need to buy U.S , keep your busisnees here ,  do everything possible to bring back the farms , is where the country made it big!

I wish there was something to stop the drunk drivers...but for now, I guess we have to settle for this. I don't think people even need the warning. In fact, I wouldn't give one if I were in charge of the decisions. When a guy is robbing a liquor store, we don't call him on his cell and tell him...Hey, the police will be there in five minutes do we?|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	No.  We don't need 24 hour surveillance.<br>  <br>  Our government spends that money on complete BS, yet they wont put up recording devices in trading companies to ensure 100% compliance.  So no, I don't approve of surveillance for people in a hurry while surveillance on those who are robbing people blind is never even discussed.<br>  <br>  Its ridiculous how twisted things are and how corrupt our state and federal governments have become.<br>  <br>  How come US highways are more dangerous than the autobahn?  Hint, speeding isn't the problem.

Dumb, dumb, dumb.|`|TBvUomw7aa	Probably.  In much of the world, drugs are decriminalized.  The Western influence is pushing for them to be completely illegal but they are overlooked as smoking the pot is a victimless crime.  We don't really see it here, but in many parts of the world, you can get a gun very easily on the black market without the government getting involved.  I would imagine that those places are allot safer.  Why would you open fire at a McDonalds (an American problem) if you know that there are probably quite a few people who are armed in there?

cMHxg372aa	You are correct. The problem of oligarchic firms "too big to fail" is one of multiple self-cannibalizing tendencies innate in unrestrained capitalism. When faced with overwhelming evidence of such flaws, market fundamentalists prefer to simply bury their heads in the sand and pretend these problems don't exist.|`|T2WPvUc1aa	"Why is it that capitalist systems always seem to concentrate the wealth and power in the hands of a few and always leads to an oligarchy"<br>  <br>  First of all, this applies to ALL forms of government, not just capitalist forms of government. The rich greedy individuals will do ANYTHING to consolidate more money and power. They couldn't care less about the common citizen.<br>  Under Communism, the party members lived with all of the luxuries, while the common citizen lived in poverty and misery. In fact, this has historically been more true of communism and dictatorships than in capitalism. In the 1960s people lost their lives nearly every day trying to escape from East Berlin to West Berlin. Why were so many people willing to die if life was not MUCH worse for them under communism than under capitalism?<br>  <br>  As far as not letting companies get too large, I agree with that completely. I was watching 60 Minutes last night and they had a segment about FDIC takeovers of banks that went out of business. They do it at night without notice, to prevent a run on the bank. They lock the doors and NOONE who is not authorized by them gets in until they have completely audited every aspect of the bank. Then, they reopen the bank under FDIC control until they get another bank to buy them out.<br>  One of the FDIC auditors who they interviewed said pretty much exactly the same thing. She believes that banks should not be allowed to get so large that they will be a threat to the economy if they go under. I wish more people in the government had that much sense. If they did, this country would not be in the mess that it is in today.|`|2132b3431e596b137342b3e009ee5777aa	Yep.   The concept is that regulation should help prevent these failures.

1e49c01a09d631f160dc7e1ac3b6b9beaa	It's always interesting to hear what is offensive to one, but not to another.  As a Canadian I find his choice reasonable, based on many criteria.   Pres. Obama has stated over & over again that he admires Pres. Lincoln, it shouldn't come to any ones surprise that he wanted to restore Lincoln to a higher stature in the oval office, where Pres. Obama can ponder upon his bust & refer to it when in conversation, as he uses the Lincoln name often.  Plus, he wishes to show an image of American strength & support, since he firstly represents the American People.<br>  <br>  Churchill's bust had his moment in time, now it's time for a change.  There's no insult intended, esp. since I doubt PM Gordon Brown shows any bust of a former President in his office.<br>  <br>  I assume he returned the bust thinking it was the appropriate course of action.  However, if it had been me making the decision, I would have found a place for Churchill's bust somewhere in the White House, so it would not have been an issue at all, because when you think about it, everyone tends to change their decor at times to reflect what's going on in their lives, so some important pictures get put away for another, or Granny's Vase gets put out only when she visits,  etc., & if it is correct that the bust was on lone, then returning it is/was the correct action to take.<br>  <br>  This action regarding Churchill's bust may seem so important that it feels offensive, but consider the amount of more serious issues Pres. Obama is faced with every day, then ask yourself if the removal of this bust would be so important, that he would need to weigh the pros & cons as to whether it would trigger disension with  British citizens?  I dare say his mind was on much more important matters.<br>  <br>  I also dare say that what you maybe seeking is a quick apology from the White House to make you feel better?  Why don't you write to Pres. Obama at the White House & ask politely for a response.  I wouldn't be surprised if they wrote back with one, otherwise take it with a grain of salt, or think more realistically & move on, cause more things in this world are on there way to cause you to be upset.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Returning  something that has been loaned is NOT an insult.|`|nTzTIrataa	It was on loan, and Obama felt it was time for it to go back.<br>  <br>  Winston Churchill was a conservative who endorsed policies with which Obama disagrees, such as oppressive British imperialism in Africa.  Why would he want the guy staring at him in the Oval Office?<br>  <br>  Find a real issue.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	I can't say that I'm offended, but it would have been a fairly easy diplomatic move to just keep the thing.<br>  <br>  It's also evident that many people in the Obama administration and otherwise have no idea how venerated Sir Winston Churchill is in Britain - he was named the best Britain ever by the public.|`|u23sBafTaa	I think it was rude and tacky !  If he didn't want it in his office I'm sure they could have found a place for it in Washington, if not in the White House then in a museum, it was given to us as a sign of unity after 9/11 !  What a fool he is !  Yet is people think that everyone around the world will love him !  Hillary screwed up with the Reset button she gave Russia it apparently said Overcharge !  Hell let's just send them all a staples "easy " button and just fully look like asses !<br>  <br>  <br>  It was not on loan it was a gift to America after 9/11 to symbolize our unity as allies !|`|UhAHaOWFaa	Well Obama is a liberal, so I would expect this kind of thing from him.|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	yes he was.|`|EMmGFqgJaa	No, it wasn't offensive. Churchill's bust was given to Bush and not to Obama. Since the White House is the new home of the Obama it would make sense to put things in his house that he would like. I've read that in place of Churchills bust Obama will place a bust of Lincoln whom Obama looks up too.<br>  <br>  I think it would be silly if someone moved into a house and kept everything that the prior residents had. Also I think having an American person's bust such as lincoln in the oval office would be better than having a british bust in the oval office.|`|Un3YxFvRaa	Absolutely he was rude and disdainful of the Brits.  He claimed he did it because it was given to President Bush as a personal gift.  That's another untruth, though, because if it were personal, President Bush would have taken it with him when he left.  <br>  <br>  The sadness of it is that if it were an African bust it would have stayed.<br>  <br>  I hope the Brits know that obama doesn't represent the people in this country who are gracious and read history.<br>  <br>  There was never a greater man than Winston Churchill.... and if obama thinks his slick tongue is in the same league as that of the late Sir Churchill, he is sadly mistaken.|`|jVUEohsNaa	HERE IS THE LINK<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/4623148/Barack-Obama-sends-bust-of-Winston-Churchill-on-its-way-back-to-Britain.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnew...</a>|`|62df66f7eb8ad819b353dee39b8374eeaa	He embarrassed all Americans.

The answer I have is contrary to a lot of popular thinking but it is experienced based.  <br>  <br>  I happen to believe that nobody outside law enforcement should pursue a criminal justice degree.  I say this because of the small amount of those that get the degree before getting hired,.... get hired.  Those that don't get hired have wasted their time.  <br>  I received information for one department that at one time they were hiring less than 3% of the people that applied for a position.  That doesn't take into consideration for the weeding out after people get hired.  So there is a small percentage of those that apply that actually get hired and then retained to continue a career.  <br>  <br>  Better courses of education are in Business, Business Administration, Public Administration, Sociology, and Psychology.  These enable you to obtain employment in law enforcement but also give you an avenue of employment if you don't ever qualify to be a police officer.  They also better prepare you for advancement if you do get hired.<br>  People who take sciences like Biology and Chemistry wind up as forensic specialists.  Some agencies have commissioned officers.  Some are civilians.  So you can't discount the sciences.<br>  <br>  If you insist on getting a criminal justice education, get it as a minor.  Then you have the best of both worlds.  <br>  <br>  hope this helped|`|AA11494150	Sociology is another popular degree, as are business degrees such as Business Management, Resource Management, or Personnel Management.|`|K2ecmzInaa	Business Admin, Public Admin, Accounting are all really good degrees. Psychology is an "eh" degree and I'd stay clear of it. Most cities are using a management style called TQM; Total Quality Management. Basically now they are trying to run cities and governments like businesses.
AA12053351	A company that is too big to fail, to a laissez faire idealoogue, would define this thing as a "government" thus it would not be free anymore to participate in the economy; it would be taken out.|`|Zf5gSpKnaa	"Too big to fail" was a phrase coined as a way to get government money to bail them out.  If a company can't survive without government money, it needs to fail.   The government is only prolonging the inevitable and wasting our money in the process.|`|LoSXjaGXaa	If a company that is "too big to fail" fails, groups of people will just buy their assets for pennies on the dollar and restart.|`|rxQt7auLaa	Which companies might that be?<br>  <br>  In a true laissez-faire economy, it is the economic laws that determine whether the companies live or die.  If the buying public no longer needs or desires that companies products, then it will decline and fail over a period of time, allowing other companies to become "too big to fail"<br>  <br>  It is only when the Government starts manipulating the economic landscape that failures of super large companies become a problem.|`|L8QR8EJraa	It's called bankruptcy and liquidation of debt, not papering over debt with a printing press.  There is nothing to big to fail, not even the US.|`|EwdsfwUyaa	No company is too big to fail.<br>  <br>  let them go bankrupt.|`|7M0KW1Iwaa	There is no such thing as too big to fail....thats just an ignorant mentality
AA10164318	Yes, it is possible.   This is also a problem with donor fathers, who may have a much higher number of children than a normal father.<br>  <br>  On the bright side, the genetic problems are not as high as once thought.<br>  <br>  This does lend some support to open records.

For one they are young and I don't know for sure what their gender is.|`|qQEl7Fukaa	Because snowflake babies are adopted, they wouldn't be genetically related to their siblings. Scientifically there would be no problem. Legally it would probably be decided by the state they live in.|`|16HN5H3Maa	It's possible.

Seriously.<br>  <br>  I don't read UK rags.  Sorry.  I'm sure President Obama is tired.  President Bush went to bed every night at 9PM.  He took the entire month of August for vacation.  In fact, W broke the previous record (held by Reagan) for the most vacation by any President.<br>  <br>  What was the question again?|`|q1GnMRxxaa	I think it is Ok to say now Don't be surprised when you get what you wished for. Obama fought hard for this job, very hard. He knew well in advance that the economy was going down. Maybe if he would stop blaming Bush and just do his job and be positive and look to the future, he could sleep better. Bush certainly had a full plate and was much older too. He slept very well. Some people are not cut out for the job of president.|`|e2facf0a453208536391b6d4d3f72b15aa	Did you read those?? One of those articles says ....'According to Bible prophecy, that third time is coming.

Then, to top if off the DVDs were an added insult as our DVDs don't play with the UK technology.  He gave them back the bust of Winston Churchill, to further insult them.<br>  I'm so embarrassed, the UK has been one of our strongest allies, in fact the strongest, and he has slapped them in the face.<br>  Tired?  He could keep up with a guy who everyone called too old to be president during the campaign, but now he can't keep up with how to run our country.<br>  What a jerk, and we are to put up with this guy for the next 3.9 years?
AA12212403	It's amazing when you just give your opinion and don't post links that people get on you and call you a liar.  So, when you do post links, then they complain as well?<br>  I have begun to find and post links to support my own opinions and thoughts as all too often people seem to think I'm pulling stuff out of the air.<br>  By the way, there is a reason, I think, why people won't work for this guy.  No one wants to board a sinking ship and no one supports someone who is a tax cheat in this job.  You'd have to be crazy to work for him.<br>  Just makes Obama continue to look bad.  He used poor judgment appointing him, without looking carefully into his background.  He used poor judgment not asking the guy to resign when all the tax stuff came to light and he has used even more poor judgment keeping the guy.<br>  No wonder our economy is crashing and burning.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	The fact is the Geithner sucked when he worked for Bush and Obama nominating him was a ridiculous choice.  The markets seemed to like it for a time but there were people who were very aware of his decisions.  His crap stunk long before the tax thing came to light.<br>  <br>  BTW, can you guys start posted some links from nationally known websites so I can actually look at them?  I also don't read UK stuff since that is pretty much pure tabloid at its very finest.|`|nkr0Nvemaa	Wonderboy financial Savior. You must be duh duh double u Bush he got us to where we are today. Unless there is a Devil (bush w) you don't need a Savior.
iJRAZpfhaa	Those who bothered to do their homework on this, would know that Gordon Brown has very few hobbies, but one of them happens to be watching movies.  I think the DVDs were a well thought out gift in this case and shows that the Obamas bothered to do their research and find out what Gordon Brown's likes and dislikes are.  Anybody who feels embarrassed about it and rushes to write to Gordon Brown to 'apologise' are going to be the ones left looking stupid.|`|AA10275485	Because Obama is a no-class amateur. And I have an approptiate  place for Hillary's "reset" button. This administration is such a joke. Were't they going to be the New and better Diplomats?<br>  And anyone who gives me a thumbs down  is drunk on kool-aid.|`|AA10138269	Better than nothing at all.

I mean all he wants to do is talk to people who wants to kill us. See why they hate us so much and how we can be very SENSITIVE to their needs and wants. Like the Taliban who wants to enslave woman, cut off the heads of innocent people,kill the Christians, and bring all to the Muslim way of thinking that's all.Oh yeah and he told the Prime Minister to take back the bust of Winston Churchill. It is a slap to a very true friend of this country and I think that Obama is trying to do that any one who was with us during the Bush years are on his enemies list and all the terrorist and socialist countries are now his friends. You got what you have voted for and be happy|`|7a52bbe9b83b7d055ff706cee3837f19aa	Yeah, I'm thinkin it was probably a "Benny Hill" collection...what else could a Birtish Prime Minister want?...ahh I love that Benny Hill!|`|53vJRwKWaa	Is that all that you know about it?  You'll probably even claim that these were Cheech & Chong DVDs.|`|S6XSLvjLaa	The guy (Brown) is apparently almost blind too!

jlgfkyrEaa	You should become a storm spotter by taking a Skywarn training course offered by your local National Weather Service office. It's a great way to become acquainted with both storm features and dangers. This will allow you access to the storms after you have successfully completed the course|`|z88IMXNFaa	No, it won't work.  The laws of every jurisdiction are that if the police tell you do do something, you do it or you are arrested.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	When you are an adult you can storm chase with the rest of them.  Till then you cannot sign a waiver if you are not an adult.<br>  <br>  If you just avoid the police they cannot tell you to leave, so just try going to more remote areas.  Hurricanes will be easier to find remote areas to chase, because so much of the coast is rural.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|WlFIXJSeaa	nope they will not! You must be a retard trying to get close to nature like that! Sit your silly butt down somewhere before you get twisted in the air and spit out like a hot wing bone!|`|rcPnnfmmaa	No, they won't arrest you anywhere in the U.S. They don't have the resources to force people out, although they will go around asking for next of kin to identify your body. They usually don't even set up roadblocks until after the disaster.<br>  <br>  However if you stay during a "mandatory" evacuation they will provide zero emergency services in that area until they allow everyone else back in. You will need your own supplies. I'd also bring a gun and a flak jacket because when the police are out of town for a few days, well, the night life can be interesting.<br>  <br>  Staying in an area in which a mandatory evacuation has been declared is a very bad idea. Do what professional storm chasers and Weather Channel correspondents do. Stay on the upper part of a large concrete and steel hotel away from the water and park well above ground in a concrete and steel parking garage.

Than make remarks on buisness.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure if the examples you gave are actually free-market examples.  In a completely free market this is how it would work: a private company at the mercy of the consumer (in other words, a company that is not subsidized, and has no government funding of any kind) cannot afford to pay CEOs more than the CEOs are worth. Generally, if the CEO's are being payed alot, it is because the company expects to make more money from the work of their CEO than the money they expect to lose by paying their CEO.  Otherwise competitors in their market will pay their CEOs less, pass the savings on to the consumers in the form of lower prices, make more money by selling more products or services, and thereby put the first company out of buisness.|`|65OG0ZHaaa	It's by no means capitalism for the examples you put and many others.<br>  That's why it's failing.<br>  This country doesn't know true capitalism.|`|TBvUomw7aa	I don't think that we have been capitalists in my lifetime at least.  The government is involved in every inch of how you operate your business.  If you mess up one little figure on your tax form, the IRS comes knocking on your door.  It doesn't really sound worth it to start a small business for me.  You have to pay worker's comp, insurance, ridiculous taxes and follow every single ridiculous law that the government has placed, but we have to make a living.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Get back to work!<br>  <br>  <br>  Best regards.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	How would we know what properly run capitalism is? Pure capitalism does not have government interference.  The government sticks its pudgy fingers in every little pie.|`|cMHxg372aa	This is criminal capitalism/fascism/corporatism. In much the same way as the far left as unable to accept the failure of the USSR as evidence of the failure of utopian socialism, the right-wing and libertarian ideologues are unable to accept that this sort of cronyism is the inevitable result of unrestrained markets.|`|qQEl7Fukaa	If what we've been told about the bailouts is true, then it makes no sense at all that failure is being rewarded. There has to be a missing piece to the puzzle. Maybe some folks knew what Obama was going to do and set themselves up for a nice profitable bailout.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	That is because this isn't capitalism.|`|zNB3tZXraa	Under normal circumstances, there is nothing really wrong with capitalism. You cannot throw this economic crisis into your equation. If Loews or GM or any other company, wants to pay their employees and/or ceo's that hurt their bottom line, that is a decision left totally up to the shareholders or business owners. If they make bad decisions and go out of business, they should not be bailed out. This is why the free market works. The consumer decides who survives and who doesn't. If you have a product they want at a good price, you will survive. But they don't tolerate poor products or ceo misconduct for ever. When government interferes, even with the best intentions of saving jobs, it distorts the natural order. If a properly run government did it's job, instead of kissing up to unions, housing lobbies, and every other special interest group that wants a subsidy, we wouldn't be in this mess.

The DPRK has a lot of saber to rattle however, they don't have food for an extended conflict.  We have roughly 25,000 troops and advanced weapons.  DPRK still uses surplus USSR and Chinese stuff so I don't think the actual armed conflict would last very long as we would quickly gain air superiority.  After that it depends on the politics of the situation.  Harry Truman didn't want to go nuclear and I expect the DPRK wouldn't be able to.  So, maybe a month of real conflict and years of "police action"...Venuzela, Cuba wouldn't count as they're just jealous.  China does have a dog in this fight.  However, DPRK is their dog and would get all those refugees.  China wouldn't get into waves of cannon fodder because they want to make money.  The question is how would this conflict start in the first place...highly unlikely as it is far better to let the bitter weather and failing crops kill the enemy slowly.|`|4UilmYwKaa	Nations like Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela will be on the North's side.<br>  <br>  Nations like Britain, France, Germany, Poland, Japan will be on the US's side.<br>  <br>  The conflict will last for years.

In the 1920s however, Labour emerged and wiped out most of their support.<br>  <br>  The Social Democrats were an offshoot that split from Labour in the 1980s over ideological differences.<br>  <br>  In 1988 the Liberals and Social Democrats merged to form the Liberal Democrats, and no they have never won a general election since then, coming consistently 3rd behind Labour and the Tories.|`|aCDWwsisaa	The UK has a Parliamentary system, with "proportional representation" based on the percentage of voters who choose each candidate, rather than a "winner take all" system such as the US has.<br>  <br>  Here is a list of the liberal democrats in the current UK Parliament<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/directories/hciolists/libdems.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.parliament.uk/directories/hci...</a><br>  <br>  I think you might have meant "Has a Liberal Democrat ever been Prime Minister?", in which case the answer would arguably be David Lloyd George, although they were just the "Liberal Party" then...

Japan educates their population into other more productive capacities as opposed to middle class robbery.<br>  <br>  The legal industry is the hub of rich class industry. Probably the most despicable part of this filthy industry is the "Family Court" segments (as if "family" was an objective, this is a marketing misnomer for what they really are which is "divorce courts"), whereas middle class families are destroyed and bled dry of their children's education funds - all for rich class financial benefit through fees and government budget elements.<br>  <br>  All the while, divorce at such expanded ratios is not a historical practice, and plethora traditional alternatives exist such as: negotiated extended family solutions, family counseling, family retreats, religious counseling, and etc. However, these traditional solutions do not provide the quickest and highest profits for the US rich class legal industry - divorcing families and children from their parents provides the highest profits.<br>  <br>  Within this legal so-called "family" spider's web, American rich class appoint judges to abuse and oppress under-class men - and through under-class women as well as other legal trickery - to bleed them of their labored earnings and to hold them down and keep them from revolting against the oppressors.<br>  <br>  This "liberal" turns the request back to you - will you call off the plutocracy legal dogs?

6OLiuM9Gaa	I'm a Veteran.<br>  <br>  I served my country -- and yours for a quarter of a century. I retired at age 45, got a couple more degrees and started a civilian career. I retired after 12 years at age 60. During those 12 years I managed government projects on the West Coast for a management consulting firm... solving problems for people who had no knowledge of the government or the military. In that 12 years I purchased a home on a VA-insured loan and paid it off in 10 years... I got paid well on the civilian job and paid more taxes than most.<br>  <br>  Now I live in a Veterans Home where I pay for my board and room. I help out with the guys coming back from the Middle East with "baggage." Granted, my medical and dental are largely taken care of, but, at almost 70, I'm probably healthier than you are and have no need of it.<br>  <br>  And what did you get out of all that? <br>  <br>  "People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf." (George Orwell)<br>  <br>  “These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.” (Thomas Paine)<br>  <br>  “War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing that is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.” (John Stewart Mill)<br>  <br>  I don't need your thanks. I know what I've accomplished in my life. And I know the price of freedom. I and millions of others have paid it so you can sit on your duff in front of a big screen TV with a beer and bash us. <br>  <br>  You want to know the price of freedom? It's spelled out in the last few words of the Declaration of Independence. "... we pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor."

IF, God Forbid, you were severely injured during the accomplishing of that job wouldn't you expect to be recompensed. Don't deny those who are deserving their small retirement/disability pay if it's fair and squarely earned but focus more on those who don't deserve it and actually do take advantage of the huge cracks in the system...THAT is where your tax dollars are being wasted not on those who serve and become injured in the line of duty.<br>  <br>  Oh and I would also like to hear about all this free travel as well if you don't mind...after all these years I might like to actually do some.|`|yPbdCa5Baa	Ok, just for the heck of it, I did some simple arithmetic.<br>  <br>  One of the posters said he purchased a house and paid it off in ten years. That saved him a lot of interest, but here's what it meant. The civilian job he had allowed him to make three payments a month. So let's, for the sake of argument say he was pulling in about $80 an hour to be able to do that. Now that puts him in about the 45% tax bracket (state, federal, and local taxes estimated). Now, you were getting about $20 an hour to be in the 25% bracket. That means that while you were making $100 and paying $25, he was making $400 and paying about $180... almost twice what you made. That would mean that in the 12 years he was on that job, He paid more taxes than you made in the 25 years he was in the service.<br>  <br>  For the 25 years he was in the service, all you did for your country is to enjoy the benefits and freedoms... and all you contributed was a miserable 30 pieces of silver. When that poster had been serving his country and making history, all you did was read about it.<br>  <br>  One day when his grandchildren climb up into his lap and ask, "What did you do in the war, Grandpa," I wonder what he'll say.

You are okay with 30 million Illegal Bangladeshi muslim migrants in India. You are okay with Islamic terrorists like Afzal Guru not being executed despite the courts having found him guilty. You are okay with Pakistani muslim artistes coming and performing, making tonnes of money in India. You even protest for the rights of Pakistani players to play in IPL despite Pakistan being directly involved in terrorist attacks against Indians especially Hindus for years. <br>  <br>  Yet you have the audacity to ask whether it's "Feasible" to let a few down and out of luck Hindu refugees into India! Shame on you cowardly bigots!!<br>   <br>  Well i say, they should be given Indian citizenship after making sure they are not circumcised muslims pretending to be Hindus, and we should execute dogs like you and this bastar*d muslim Rizwan guy and send your ugly corpses to Pakistan for burial.<br>  <br>  Edit: Bala your prayers are not going to do jack for the Hindus unless you become politically assertive as a Hindu. People are getting away with murder because Hindus always talk peace. There are limits to seeking peace and peace cannot be sought at "any" price even at the expense of our self respect.

They choose to have sex. <br>  <br>  Non-consensual sex is violent and the person being raped has not consented- she/he is having sex againsther/his will. <br>  <br>  Prostitution is consensual sex.

F4knwfVsaa	Corvette, it has no relevance because back then the country did not bail anyone out, they let them sink. This is the way it should be today. With all the money the Auto companies ripped off of the public prior to having the internet to keep them honest is absurd. Being a car salesman in this era is difficult due the thieves from the past. The auto companies along with the banks who screwed the public should be left to die. There are plenty of profitable automakers that are not looking for a handout. Besides, how many handouts have they truly gave to the public? Rebates/low financing doesn't count because they saw this coming years ago and thought if they give huge rebates they would get more customers to offset things. DID NOT WORK! It would be cheaper to let them sink.|`|6e801dc2d4cb4e651c8b24905ccb9bacaa	The auto industry is built from the bones of bankruptcy.  General Motors was CREATED out of the insolvency of Buick and Oldsmobile back in 1908.  Ford bought Lincoln out of insolvency.  Walter Chrysler was originally hired by GM to rationalize its manufacturing, became head of Buick & left in 1924 to re-organize Willys, which was insolvent & which would become Willys - Jeep after WWII (& it won a trademark dispute over the Jeep name).  After a year with Willys, Chrysler left & with other investors bought the bankrupt Maxwell company which became Chrysler Corporation.  I don't beleive Packard ever went into bankruptcy, tho' it came close in the 1930's.  It merged with Studebaker in 1954 which stopped producing Packards in 1958, & ceased producing Studebakers in the late '60's.  It never went bankrupt but was purchasec by Worthington Corp -- a compressor manufacturer.  The last branded "Studebaker" product wasa refrigerator.   Hudson did go bust in the '30's was re-organized  & merged with Nash in 1954 to become American Motors.  The Hudson & Nash names were dropped in favor of Rambler. The company merged with Jeep in the  '70's; was purchased by France's Renault & then sold to Chrysler.|`|JV75Iz3eaa	Studebaker, Tucker.
33rNmPTwaa	I believe the term you are looking for is called,  "without prejudice".|`|AA10667393	I don't think we can read your mind, so if you want to use any phrase or term that means signed under duress (compulsion, by force, under threat of [bodily] harm, etc.), go right ahead. Nothing will "release" you from liability if you are signing a confession or admission of liability and improperly try to state or imply your signature does not mean you admit to liability. That would be fraud.<br>  <br>  If you did not do what the document says you did, don't sign it. If someone is threatening you with something other than liability for what you did, that's your only defense.|`|nkr0Nvemaa	Do your own school work or you will turn out to be as ignorant as Bush W. or do I "misunderestimate" you.|`|z88IMXNFaa	There is no such term.|`|e61a72ed022789b06c8dae082a26fcd8aa	When endorsing a check, etc.:  You can write in "With Reservation of Rights."  <br>  <br>  This can and should be used on  anything that states in the memo line:  Paid In Full, etc.

If they are going to force you to sign, I doubt they will allow you to enter a legal term invalidating your signature. <br>  <br>  You can argue coercion, and you could also argue a legal principle called "necessity", if signing the document created a greater harm.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	If you sign under duress, you are never liable in the first place, so you don't need to write a specific line.

(Why an independent Tamil Nadu?), he criticized the Central Government of India inducing thousands of Tamilians to burn the constitution of India. The reason for this action was that Periyar held the Government responsible for maintaining the caste system. After stating reasons for separation and turning down opinions against it he closed his speech with a "war cry" to join and burn the map of India on June 5.

AK4OemrIaa	It might depend what state you are in and it also depends on what kind of ticket you got. In California, a speeding ticket, for example, will not get reduced because the amount is based on your speed. You can propose to have the fine reduced without pleading "guilty" first. Sometimes the judge might even reduce it without you having to ask if you agree to pay. I'm pretty sure in every state you can take traffic school if applicable, even if you had to pay a reduced fine.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	In Michigan one may do an "informal hearing."<br>  <br>  I got a ticket "reduced" to a non-moving violation, but paid about an extra $40.<br>  <br>  In Michigan one's insurance skyrockets with a moving violation.

AA11851828	Good point but,what's the question?|`|KjZTFuzKaa	AIG received a bailout because under Bush's plan, he wanted to give every bank a bailout so that the general public would not go into panic mode when they found out which banks were failing (which we later found out are Citi Group and AIG).  It was a smart move by Bush because if people found out which banks were failing, it would lead to a selling frenzy which would have pushed the market even further down than it already is (which seems pretty much impossible at this point).|`|110fda6e94f73c2bbaae8136ca9a20ddaa	Not true-- this is an internet hoax-- however some basis in fact as Congress did not start paying Social Security until 1984.<br>  <br>  Up until then SS was NOT withheld from their payroll checks.

Too bad most people will consider this just Obama bashing and believe that spending money on frivilous causes is ok..  Don't you know this is really helping our economy get out of this mess...

I call shenanigans.  Cite your sources.<br>  <br>  Besides, the actual reason they're bailing out AIG is considerably more sinister.|`|x3D2BUMEaa	Congress didn't let Bear Stearns go down, the Bush Administration let Bear Stearns go down.  Congress didn't have a thing to do with that.  Congress didn't bail out AIG, Hank Paulsen and the U.S. Treasury and the Bush Administration bailed out AIG.  AIG does not insure the Congress's pension fund.  See the Factcheck.org site's debunking of that falsehood.  AIG was the dominant insurer of credit default swaps and other risk hedges relied upon the the Wall Street investment banks and commercial banks who all almost went belly up because of their overarching greed, which is why Hank Paulsen was so desperate to prop up AIG, fearing that it failure would bring down just about everything.  Don't you feel foolish having been led down a primrose path by people feeding you lies?

During her recent visit she assured them we won't let their record on human rights abuses get in the way of exporting more US jobs to them.

Which 2% owns and operates the media (are you feigning surprise here)?

Hint: related to greed (I wonder who around here prays to the greed god?).<br>  <br>  Edit3: Saw D-Jam's answer - wrong. The reason for the rich class capital flight is because they hold the bank books and were the first to see the imminent bank failures. Duh.|`|PwQn0Oixaa	This is strange and I am baffled.  Only logical reason I can think is the rich took their money out and started moving it to tax shelters, thinking Obama is going to win (at that time) and they would be taxes heavily.<br>  <br>  I don't really know what to do or what can be done about it.  I am not sure if the government should be allowed to go after that, unless it's new income under new tax laws.  So if a company earned 10 million dollars after a new tax law was passed, then they would be held accountable...but not on savings or assets held...especially if they are not in the vicinity to be taxed.<br>  <br>  I can't blame them for making this move either...nor would I want the government to really do something about this outside of passing legislation and making assurances that they can put their money into US banks and not be taxed for it.  My personal thing is on income earned...not someone's savings.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	So, you think a bunch of money caused Obama to win?  Wow.

If you are speaking of some sort of memo which lays out the plan to lie to the public, I don't think they left anything like that lying around. The Downing Street Memo from the UK is one notable exception, in which it was written that the Americans were fixing the facts around invasion plans. The lies have also been well documented, often through interviews with people close to the administration, by authors like Woodward, Ron Suskind and Craig Unger among others. I particularly recommend Unger's "American Armageddon," originally released in hardcover as "Fall of the House of Bush."|`|TYGgRjqDaa	Did the words "I was wrong" that came from Bush not make it clear enough for you?<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I correct my statement.

q1GnMRxxaa	Once arrested, the girl can not drop the charges. At least that is the way it is in California. Women use to do this all the time. Sometimes they were bully-ed into it and sometimes they felt guilty. So now, once the cops arrest you, only the DA can drop the charges, which they rarely do. Most likely you will not go back to jail. The Da will just say whatever time you already spent in jail is your sentence. Because of OJ, most likely you will have to attend anger management classes at your expense and pay some fines too. Once again, this is the way it is in California, so your state may be different.

He only says what he has to say to get more listeners. I just worry that the hatred he spews are destroying the GOP by getting more and more people to cross over to the neocon view of bigger government, more spending and interventionist policies. I'm a traditional Republican that is for small government like getting rid of the Department of Education and getting rid of the Dept of Homeland Security and the NSA and getting the Department of Defense pace to defending our country instead of doling it out to other departments. I'm for American succeeding and not having to prop up the others that don't succeed.

MCWAhEenaa	Embryonic stem cells can't cure a damn thing, and are only good for you if you happen to BE a cancer. We should quit presuming that there is any science or practical applications behind the research into them. <br>   <br>  Adult stem cells are a great success. But what do you get when you put embryonic stem cells into a person, cancerous tumors! Just cancerous tumors! Why in the hell should we invest public tax money into promoting hyped up B.S.? <br>  <br>  It seems like the only reason the idiot left wants to invest in this asinine "technology" is that it pisses off people who think life is sacred.|`|sNqi1fLPaa	I personally dont see what the big deal is. If the government were purposefully creating these embyos to destroy them, then I might disagree/ But these embryos are left over from fertility clinica and are going to be tossed away anyway. So why not utilize them to save another persons life, rather then have them tossed in the trash. Isnt that what God would want us to do. Save lives rather than throw them away in vain. So I am pro embryonic stem cell research as long as the embryos are already created because of the choice of the mother and were not going to be of use. If anything, blame the mothers who choose fertility treatments, not the government who is trying to help others by using these embryos the mother herself has decided to disgard.|`|QpF6Tjtiaa	the government funds plenty of needed medical research and this is definitely needed.<br>  <br>  it is about time someone gave the finger to these religious quacks who have done nothing but stall progress and send tech jobs overseas.

Obama just issued an executive order allowing federal funds to be used for stem cell research on new fetuses.  The previous administration only allowed federal funds for research on existing stem cell lines, not on new fetuses.<br>  <br>  With the deficit / debt being what it is, I don't think federal funds should go to any of this.  We need to cut back on everything.  Let private research labs and universities take care of the research, and let's balance the budget.|`|jilrS1FLaa	If you get your news from headlines or comedy shows like Colbert Report etc... you'll always be uninformed.<br>  <br>  FYI: embryonic stem cell research was NEVER outlawed in any form by President Bush, nor did he refuse funding for embryonic stem cell research.<br>  <br>  what President Bush did (because the use of the embryo/fetus is so controversial to a great percentage of taxpayers) was decline to use taxpayer funds for creation and/or use of NEW lines of embryo stem cells.  a very specific limitation and with no effect on the research.<br>  <br>  embryonic stem cell research has been funded and performed all along under President Bush.|`|YrXVQBodaa	I'm anti- embryonic stem cell research. I personally believe that life is extremely valuable and should be protected from birth to natural death. I understand that embryonic stem cell research could make great scientific advances, and I don't blame anyone for wanting a cure for terrible diseases and disabilities. But I just don't think that we as humans have the right to take innocent life. <br>       Apparently though, non-embryonic stem cells can be researched with much the same benefits as embryonic stem cells, so I think there could be great potential there. I'm not anti-stem cell research, just anti-embryonic stem cell research. I don't care if the embryos are scheduled for extermination anyway. Utilitarianism, or, getting rid of whoever isn't "useful" is disgusting to me. It's only a step away from the WWII-era eugenics experiments of Dr. Mengel, and while I don't think we're going there, I don't think this is any more ethical.<br>  <br>  It's disturbing to me that almost everyone here is so callous about this. What if those embryos grew up into our friends, siblings, or mates? Would we feel the same way then? Think really hard about it folks, this is a free country but we're all still responsible for ourselves.|`|HKVFVS4qaa	It is a good choice.<br>  <br>  Enough said.|`|6avmzoDYaa	I'm pretty siked about it! I can't wait to see what scientists will discover, our Biology class did some research about it a couple of weeks ago and how there were regulations and controversy over it, and it's cool to see that it's finally being put into action now. If you want to know more about the scientific side of stem cells, this would be a great question to put in the Biology Section.

The statue was given to us as a sign of their solidarity and support, after 9-11.  The important thing here isn't what Americans think about it, but what the Brits think about it--and they are pissed.  That's putting it lightly.<br>  It doesn't make any sense to me.  Really, there isn't room in the Oval Office for a little bust of Winston Churchill?  Really?  You can't find a shelf somewhere to have that?

ck1wvh91aa	JFK was most certainly not a neocon as one poster has suggested. He did not believe in preemptive war and an American empire. Just read his historic 1963 speech at American University, in which he came out against a "Pax Americana," a position that put him in direct opposition to neocon philosophy. In fact, he was working through back channels to make peace with the USSR and Cuba. That being said, he was a more fiscally conservative Democrat than what you would call a Teddy Kennedy Democrat. One of his greatest achievements was a very successful tax cut.|`|Ro4rrQKDaa	Any one who likes a Kennedy by any name doesn't read unbiased History.<br>  They were all sorry the other two Hid it is all.|`|YonedWiEaa	actually I think there are more liberals than conservatives on here, but you are right...the Dem's have moved so far to the left that Obama is beginning to come around full circle to the right....|`|oVmGcRVtaa	There is much more to both of them than most people are aware of, so to attempt to do what you would like to do would be a disservice to both of them.|`|JinXSnnMaa	You are correct in stating JFK was conservative compared to Teddy.

qqwF8ZgIaa	To really answer I need to know what state you are in.  Each state has different landlord/tenant law.  That being said, most states allow the landlord to collect for reasonable charges.  What would it reasonably cost to clean one pile?  $1,400?  That would be one big pile.  Something does not sound right.  Have they provided you with an accounting?<br>  <br>  Some states have laws regulating deposits.  Some states have time periods for the landlord to return the deposit or give an itemized accounting of the damages, and if the time has lapsed, the landlord may not be able to make a defense.<br>  <br>  There are probably low cost or no cost landlord / tenant services in your state where you can get general information.  Check universities specifically.  They often have an office that can answer general LL/T questions.|`|ZNe6B9TQaa	I imagine that the contract outlined, to some extent, what could lead to your being charged this specific fee.  However, if there is no longer any proof of the incident, then there wouldn't be a whole lot that they could use to further pursue attaining the fee from you.  Try and some how objectively document that they would like to fine you for $1400 for "dog droppings" just in case they further pursue it.  <br>  <br>  To further answer this, I would have to see the contract in front of me and a know a little bit more about how they were pursuing you and how intensely they were pursuing you.

He has made threatening statements against Iran.<br>  Furthermore, he's wants to keep 50,000 troops in Iraq on a long-term basis.<br>  That's four wars.|`|e2facf0a453208536391b6d4d3f72b15aa	You realize we have been in Iraq for quite sometime, right?

Why did we not go to the Sudan, the Congo, North Korea or Burma? We went to Iraq supposedly to rid them of WMD's and there were no WMD's to rid them of, so there is no way for the war to be a success.|`|aLBmhdlTaa	He inherited both wars from Bush II.  He is drawing down forces in Iraq and sending more forces into Afghanistan as he said he would during the campaign.  <br>  <br>  Any antiwar folks who voted for him and feel he betrayed or fooled them only fooled themselves and betrayed the candidates who actually said they would get The US out of Iraq and Afghanistan sooner.  <br>  <br>  Antiwar voters had a candidate who opposes both wars and had more time in Congress than Obama, but they voted their fears instead of their hopes and left Cynthia McKinney with about a half a percent of the vote.  <br>  <br>  Rather than complaining about Obama, they should be apologizing to McKinney and trying to get her career back on track.  Her positions are fairly close to those of VT Senator Sanders, and to the left of VT Senator Leahy whose is up for re-election in 2010.  They could consider running her for US Senate in VT in 2010.  If she were to win, she would pose a threat to Obama's re-election in 2012 that might get him to back away from his Afghan build up. <br>  <br>  But to answer your question, I don't think Obama is a warmonger, and I don't think The Iraq war was just about oil.  I can understand why Bush believed those (including former Iraqi military officers) who claimed Saddam was building WMD.  Saddam refused to allow inspections as agreed after the first Iraq War, and his two worst enemies, Israel and Iran, either had nukes or were developing them.  That is pretty strong motive to get WMD even if he wasn't seeking to expand his power and territory.  <br>  <br>  That is not to say that oil and Saddam's plot to kill his father didn't affect Bush's judgement or that Bush or Obama aren't responsible for their mistakes.  I'm just saying things are not a simple as you want to believe.<br>  <br>  I doubt anyone will stop wars by accusing Presidents of being motivated by greed.  I think the best we can do is promote the development of effective nonlethal weapons so that when Presidents decide to send troops to war there will be less destruction of innocent lives -- whether the wars turn out to be justified or not.|`|d88671d1753103d5be206f7725c81108aa	lol, why isn't Saddam still in power?  How quickly we forget, it was the WMD's we went there for.. remember?<br>  <br>  Still waiting to find them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Any way, you can't call someone a warmonger for a war they didn't start but are trying to finish.  warmongers are people who start wars for the profit and for the sake of war in itself.|`|nkr0Nvemaa	Obama is sending troops into another country but you don't know that. If getting Saddam was our reason to go to war why did we first destroy the entire country? The answer is so Cheney and his cohorts could reap trillions in profits.|`|XPxqryaPaa	No, absolutely not.  He is trying to repair the damage done by the Bush administration and end the war in a responsible way.|`|Hw8rr1TCaa	Nope. Obama is not warmonger. Bush and McCain are. Both of them supported and still support large oil companies|`|JafmNha5aa	Not a warmonger but he doesn't have sufficient guts to end one his supporters don't want.|`|ZsWMkXCfaa	No, I think his onger is cold.|`|lwccQoEZaa	NO!!!

0JL3Mg78aa	There are some licensed farms (pretty secret I would imagine) and yes, state governments control the product and make sure it goes for medical marijuana and research purposes.

But thats a dwindling number and will eventually be phased out.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is California. There are medical marijuana dispensaries where they sell legal marijuana of all types and grades. You do need a prescription for it, but from what I understand they are not hard to find and some doctors give them out for any old thing.<br>  <br>  It's not grown by the state though, and definitely not by the feds. Its done by private farmers, but is heavily taxed by the state (of course). The owners of the "shops" are sole proprietors as well.<br>  <br>  So unless there's some hidden federal or state government pot farm I'm unaware of, then legal w/prescription or illegal are your two options.<br>  <br>  EDIT: There are no systems in place to "regulate" marijuana sold to sick people. These laws get passed so haphazardly. Basically the issue goes up for a state referendum (people vote on it), it passes (without fail! by large margins usually) and then *poof" its legal.<br>  Of course the government is ten steps behind by figuring it wouldnt pass and then gets caught with their shoes untied. Further argument and resentment (by conservatives mostly) prevent any real substantive laws or systems from colacing around it.<br>  <br>  Hopefully that'll change... starting with California.

If you haven't done weed in a couple of years then go and apply but random drug testing is part of the contract and it carries a heavy penalty if caught let alone the lives that are risked when using. If you've left that lifestyle in the past then there is no reason why you can't go on for a successful and productive life. Good Luck.
RD5sTZaFaa	1.  If a defendant is pleading guilty he is still benefitting by having an attorney to review the evidence in the case, review the charging document, and to discuss the facts and defenses that he might have.  Just because there is someone in jail charged with an offense it doesn't mean there is evidence to prove the charge.  If the state cannot prove the charge they should ethically dismiss the charge, but sometimes they forgit that, and a defense attorney will make them review their evidence and make a determination if they really should proceed.  Also, if there is a mistake in the charging instrument, (complaint, indictment, or information) the defendant might not know what to look for.  The attorney will review the document to be sure that the charge is properly plead by the state, and noone should plead guilty if the documents prepared by the state are defective.  The other thing that the defense attorney will do is discuss the facts of the case, to insure that the state is not trying to use evidence that was obtained illegally.  If for instance, a search of a person's home is conducted without a search warrant, or if the search warrant is obtained improperly, the evidence found cannot be used against a defendant.  To allow the evidence to be used would encourage unethical cops to ignore a person's rights and search whenbever they think they might find something, and if they don't find anything, to plant something, so that they look like what they did was the right thing.  The defendant may not know enough about the law and his rights to recognize when he might have these type of issues.  If there are defenses to a crime a defendant may not know that what he did is not really a crime.  For instance, in Texas it is illegal to have a handgun if you don't have a permit.  If you purchase a gun, however it is legal to take it home.  Then you can leave it there and go to get a permit to carry it legally.  There is a defense to prosecution if you are traveling from the shop to the home, and the defendant might not know about that.  He should not polead guiltyto an offense for which he has a valid defense.  <br>  <br>  2.  When people are in jail and they are given fines they are expected to pay them upon release.  Usually they are ok to contact the court clerk's office when released to get on a payment plan.  If they are going to have to go back to court on a certain day and they are still in jail then they will be brought back by the jailer, and can simply explain that they are still in jail.  If they are released they would go to the court on the date of the show cause hearing, and present their release paperwork, and proof that they a re on a payment program.  Judges are usually sympathetic to this type of defense.  If the defendant is in jail on  a misdemeanor offense usually the court will let them set out the fines and court costs in jail.  Most of the time they will receive $100. per day for each additional day they stay in jail after their sentence is served.  The judge will likely let them set that up before they leave the court on the day of sentencing.  On felony cases it is up to the defendant to start the payment plan after they are released.  If they are on parole the parole department might require that they set up a payment plan as a condition of parole.  <br>  <br>  Some states let inmates in prison work inside, and some require that a portion of the income from work, if there is any, is used to pay for court costs, or fines, or room and board.  There are several companies that set up their manufacturing company inside prisons and pay the inmates money  for work performed, but it is usually not as much as the person would earn doing the same type of work on the outside.<br>  <br>  If they have noney when sentenced there is no reason that they cannot pay the court costs and fines upon sentencing.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|011830a2652ee7687c383f5f54db2d13aa	The job of an attorney is to ensure the rights of his/her client are enforced and to "zealously advocate" the client's side of the story.<br>  <br>  Every court has its own Local Court Procedures manual.

I think that it's probably the first step to the decline of an empire when its people can't take care of themselves anymore and need assistance from their government.

bbd9f479cf25ead4d609a7042cebc55baa	First off - ignore the people who seem to be unhappy themselves and are bent on making you think negative things. My husband is deployed to and we have a very strong marriage. Its hard no matter what, but the key is having that trust in each other. If he has not given you a reason to think otherwise, dont let yourself go there. Your biggest defeat will be yourself if you allow it to be. They dont have a lot of time over there and as far as the address, he probably used myspace as a tool so he could get mail from friends as well as family. <br>  Being a military wife/girlfriend might very well be the most satisfying job (and yes, it is a job) that you might have. There is a great sense of pride and satisfaction that goes into loving a soldier.<br>  I hate being away from my husband, but 2 main things you learn is 1) the little things that you would typically take for granted, for example holding hands, watching tv together, snuggling up to each other, being able to touch them while your talking to them (basically things other people might say you obsess about, because they dont know) are things you realize count the most and 2) Deployments make a strong relationship stronger. <br>  The reader who responded with "he is the one that should be worried about you cheating"  has got issues. Anybody who wants to read this and just run off at the mouth like that with a negative thought probably is not happy themselves. Another reader commented on this and I agree, make sure you keep them very updated on everything that is going on. Sometimes they feel like they might be loosing some control on what might be going on at home, so keeping them updated keeps them involved. Another reader said Send him letters or cards ALL THE TIME. Emails are good, but also send stuff in the mail. They might not always be able to get online, but love to have letters. I send my husband a card or letter every single day, and no this is not my first deployment, I did that for the first one to. <br>  One more thought for you and this is something that I use is dont let anybody convince you that a relationship can not last any amount of time without cheating. Like I said, if you have a strong relationship, your love can withstand distance and time. It might seem like he cant go a year with that intimate touch of somebody, but if you can do it there is no reason to beleive he cant do it to. Dont distrust him on just a gut feeling because there will be times when you dont hear from him for a while and you cant go assuming he is messing around every time. You will make yourself crazy.<br>  You can do it, it will be ok. Like I said, dont let anybody convince you with negative thoughts.

Just be patient and good for you for being faithful to him.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	It takes patience.  Understand that in Iraq he might have to share Internet access with over a thousand other troops on his base and since it is satellite it can go out at anytime.  He may have been checking his Myspace and was going to contact you personally when his time ran out or the satellites failed.<br>  <br>  I would recommend e-mailing him but not spamming him since one or two e-mails should be enough.  Tell him how you feel but consider his position as well since he is in a combat zone right now.  Also, I'm pretty sure you have friends you can hang out with in the meantime.  They might not understand your situation if they don't have boyfriends who are deployed but they can still be there for support.|`|WwHFdfknaa	For one thing, they are extremely busy and will not be on the internet as often as you like, that's reality! My husband is currently deployed, for the first 6 months i had no contact with him, mail was messed up and packages and letters went missing. You just have to deal with it and trust him and he has to trust you too in order to make a relationship work.  You need to stop stressing out and find something creative to do to keep your mind busy, days go faster if your doing something other then worrying.|`|rNXCnJ8Eaa	Don't take offense to him not emailing you directly, he probably didn't have the time to send a specific message to you, hence why he ended up sending the mass email to everyone.<br>  <br>  He's not going to have loads and loads of time to think about women over there at the moment (just deploying and all) so if he says he's dedicated to you, he's going to do his best to stay faithful.<br>  <br>  As for the distance, well logically, even the strongest relationship will take a hit from the physical distance. You just have to decide if you cannot let it affect your everyday life, and hope that he's honest when he says it's not affecting his.
AA12341057	I'm not gay, but even I feel betrayed by fellow christians that they would cast their votes in such a way. Prop 8 was designed solely to make the State of California treat a single minority group worse.<br>  <br>  Jesus hung out with prostitutes, dirty fisherman, lepers, and tax collectors (the gangsters of his time). Why should His people treat homosexuals any worse than anyone else? I thought we were better people than that.<br>  <br>  I have never been so disappointed by Christians as I was on the day we overwhelmingly approved prop 8. Especially considering the fact that California no longer has "Equal Protection Under the Law" as a part of it's constitution. That makes any minority group vulnerable to the whims of the masses. <br>  <br>  Seriously, if the courts uphold this nonsense, I'm going to collect signatures for a constitutional amendment that removes the power to collect tax from the State of California. Think it would be hard to get a slim majority on that?|`|WlDVd92paa	like you care about gays-lol|`|2d66454da71ea52f9302b902d6991747aa	I'm sure they do.<br>  <br>  It's one thing to have tolerance, it's another thing to let them have a status that allows them to foster or adopt children.  <br>  <br>  Even liberals have seen "Gay Parades".

LSxBwiFSaa	Yup... -NOT that that stops anyone under the age of 18 from doing it...

Nice "try" Parents... -but You don't have a CLUE..!  :)|`|z88IMXNFaa	No.  The age of consent differs from state to state.  In many states it's 16.|`|CowgOqXTaa	No, it isn't.<br>  <br>  Such laws are State specific. They range widely, with 18 being the oldest.<br>  <br>  In my State - CA - the age of consent is 18, and there is no "close in age exception" (Also called a "Romeo and Juliet law") so any sex with a person under 18 is a crime - even if you are under 18 yourself. <br>  <br>  At the other extreme, many States set the age of consent at 16. In many of those States, a "Romeo and Juliet" exception makes sex with someone under the age of consent legal down to some lower age, so long as the older party is within a certain age difference of the younger.<br>  <br>  You can find the actual text of the "Statutory Rape" laws of each State (Almost no States actually use the legal term "Statutory Rape", but it's as good a generic term as any) here.... <a href="http://www.moraloutrage.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.moraloutrage.net/</a><br>  <br>  (Oh, and just to clarify.....

778ce8519ad6a8f80e6ff1f1d19afc90aa	I do not agree with that. It sets a dangerous precedent. If you can say moral values don't apply to one thing that MANY people feel a moral objection to, what can you say it about down the road? <br>  <br>  Many terrible things have been done in the name of science: animal vivisection, human experimentation... The Nazis did many, many terrible things in the name of science. Even in this country, we had the Tuskeegee Experiments, in which people with syphilis were allowed to die untreated in order to see what the disease does to the body through autopsy.<br>  <br>  This is science without moral guidelines. Yes, I have a problem with that.|`|fA42bQHraa	"Promoting science isn't just about providing resources, it is also about protecting free and open inquiry," Obama said. "It is about letting scientists like those here today do their jobs, free from manipulation or coercion, and listening to what they tell us, even when it's inconvenient especially when it's inconvenient. It is about ensuring that scientific data is never distorted or concealed to serve a political agenda and that we make scientific decisions based on facts, not ideology."|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	Obama has no values.

Science w/out humanity is out of control.|`|C7CaNLGlaa	That is a very scary statement.  Obama has however, demonstrated time and time again that values and morals shouldn't matter.  His Presidency, the way he came to power, and the people that work for him are among the most corrupt on the planet.  This new administration threatens to turn the USA into a Third World nation equal to Saudi Arabia or Zimbabwe in crime, graft, and corruption. <br>  <br>  But what a strange thing for Obama to say about science.  He wants to tax power plants out of existence because someone named Al Gore said the Earth is heating up because we drive cars to work.  He made a movie based on junk science and Obama seems to be taking it seriously.  <br>  <br>  But that's the whim of a socialist, control medical and energy.  And soon the breadlines will appear.  You can tell they're breadlines because they'll have a banner with that picture of Obama looking skyward with the word, "Hope" on it.  Yeah, right!|`|KZh3x4g9aa	obama sat in rev. wrights church for 20 years,was a close friend and his kids were baptized by the racist marxist pig.obama claims he never heard the rev. being racist or marxist.there are videos al over the internet verifying the lies.now you want the people to address his statement about science comes before values ! I think adolf hitler or josef stalin said that first as they were shipping people to camps or gulags ! you got to be fkng kidding .....|`|AA10123414	Never said that. Major misquote. In fact he said that we will not be doing research in to cloning.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	This was political. Blame republicans for the handicapped please|`|AA10287176	No, actually he didn't say that. That statement doesn't even make sense, because it assumes that there are only one set of values, and it assumes that scientific research is not guided by values (if scientific research weren't guided by values, there would be no point to the research - we only research things because our value system values potential new discoveries). Since I assume this was inspired by the stem cell decision, the one set of values assumed here would be conservative Christian values. But there are other value systems that exist that not only allow, but might actually encourage stem cell research. Values, for example, which advocate reducing disease and alleviating suffering.  <br>  <br>  Ok, with that aside, the question should be "Do you agree that science comes before some values?" The answer to that would be an unambiguous yes. The value of science (increasing human knowledge, curing diseases, aiding technological progress) outweighs some value systems. Looking historically, it seems obvious that science should have come before the anti-intellectual values of the medieval Catholic Church. Science comes before the values of flat-earthers, and it comes before the values of creationists. The values of these groups eventually have given way or should give way to science, because what they stand for simply is not as valuable to humankind as science is. Of course there are other value systems which "come before" science, which is why science is constrained by ethical codes and the law. As should be obvious, the question is which values are less important than science and which are more important.|`|b90f0a4c32cc3dde140d446b8bb1d11aaa	Obama has no values, so it is easy for him to make that statement.  Listen carefully to what he says in his speeches.  He is devoid of christian values and when you have a President that is an empty vessel; with no morality; that is a puppet of the puppet masters, he could think of nothing to appoint himself as President for life!  Another Presidential Order in the works people.  All you Obamanites, beware what you wished for as you may come to regret that pull of the lever at the polls.  This is a very dangerous person we have at the helm of the Presidency and I think people are starting to realize it which includes our representatives.  I think they never thought this guy would lead from the left so swiftly and that he would destroy the stock market; and remember a man with no conscience will do anything expedient to accomplish his goals.

For example... there were bloody footprints at the crime scene from a "Bruno Magli" shoe (A *very* expensive shoe) in OJ's size. OJ stated that he would "never wear those ugly-*** shoes", and no such shoes were found in his home. After the trial was over, however, photos were sent to the press of OJ wearing the exact shoe in question at public events prior to the killing. <br>  <br>  Richard|`|uGUvct02aa	maybe because, unlike the jurors in the OJ case, most people have an IQ higher than their foot size, most people understand that when the dead person's DNA is found in the suspect's car, on the suspect's person, along with blood stains from the dead person on the door of the suspect's automobile that it means more than "all of us gots blood" (to quote one of the former jurors).  Most people with a thimble full of common sense know that the man got away with murder because he had a brilliant and incredible attorney, the DA was a complete dipstick for moving the trial to downtown LA, a judge that was enjoying the limelight of a ludicrous 9 month trial and he had a jury with  the combined mental capacity of a small rodent.<br>  <br>  Also, do bear in mind that he was found liable under the slightly lower "proponderance" standard for causing the death of both Nicole and Mr. Goldman.|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	My belief is that given the pathetic testimony of Office Furnham in the trial, he could only be acquited.

The fact that some of the evidence was tainted by the investigators also helped in gaining his acquittal. <br>  <br>  However in the civil trial he was found guilty unanimously by the evidence presented.

What I don't think is possible that a lot of the top people in our government knew who did it.|`|mVlRpc97aa	Because I was raised to believe what the media and the politicians tell me.<br>  <br>  And I know the $2.3 trillion dollars was reported as missing by Secretary Rumsfeld the day before 9/11 and has never been accounted for.  <br>  <br>  Still though, I don't think the $2.3 trillion would have been used to cover up.  That would mean that there are rogue elements in the government and I KNOW we only elect good people to office, never criminals.<br>  <br>  I know about the insider stock trading in the days before 9/11 trading too and I assume that because we only elect good and honest people to Congress, their reason for refusing to investigate that must be to protect us from the terrorists.  Why else would Congress refuse to investigate those transactions to identify people that had foreknowledge of the attacks. <br>  <br>  Of course I also understand how some transnational corporations have made hundreds of billions of dollars as a result of the wars and war on terror.  That doesn't make me suspicious either.  I'm sure that is all coincidence. Transnational corporations are our friends ... they gives us employment and I am sure they would NEVER use their political clout for their own monetary gain.<br>  <br>  I also know the government has never produced any credible evidence that the attacks were carried out by the alleged terrorists but I believe them, even though it is obvious now that everything about Iraq was a lie.  Maybe they are just protecting us by not disclosing the evidence.  I know the government loves us.<br>  <br>  And you know ... I trust what I read in Popular Mechanics.  Yes ... I know the editorial management was turfed out with new politically friendly management right before their 9/11 coverage started, but I have difficulty believing that Popular Mechanics would be dishonest - even if it meant money and political favors in exchange.  C'mon .. nobody is that dishonest as to spread propaganda in mainstream magazines.<br>  <br>  So I'd prefer to just go about living my comfortable little life and assume everyone is honest and kind.  For me, it's much easier to believe the attacks were carried out by Arab terrorists than to confront the possibility that there might be rogue elements in powerful positions in the government who also have the power to muzzle the mainstream media.  That's my main reason.

The same thing happened during the 7/7 train bombings in England.  How is this possible?  Just a coincidence?<br>  <br>  3)  Why were all the bomb sniffing dogs pulled from the WTC a week before the attack?  Why was this done by the security company that George Bush's YOUNGER BROTHER AND COUSIN ran?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?mkt=nl-nl&vid=0fcb75ef-c0fd-4d43-9fc0-33524530a8cc" rel="nofollow">http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?mkt=nl-n...</a>    <br>  <br>  4)  NIST has now admitted that WTC 7 fell at free fall speed.  How is this possible if the building supposedly fell only due to fire:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.neithercorp.us/nforum/sci_tech_hell/nist_finally_admits_freefall_of_wtc_7-t727.0.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.neithercorp.us/nforum/sci_tec...</a><br>  <br>  5)  Cleanup Crews and demolitions experts reported 2800 F heat and Molten steel under the rubble of the WTC.  Anyone with a rudimentary understanding of physics knows you need a SOURCE that burns at that temp.  in order to create the heat.  The hottest burning material in the buildings was the jet fuel, which burns at 1800 F, and NEVER any hotter.  So, what inside those buildings could have burned at 2800 F?<br>  <br>  6)  WTC 7 was not hit by a plane, yet it collapsed 6 hours after the attack.  NIST claims this was due to fire.  So then why did this steel building not collapse from fire after burning more than a day?:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzXX_UgDhgo&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzXX_UgDh...</a><br>  <br>  These are not "conspiracy theories".

This current economy is the fruition of policies that the Bush administration and the Republican majority congress put in place. In 1980, Reagan began the assault on both FDR's New Deal 'and' Johnson's Great Society policies that said government 'does' have a role and responsibility to protect the "general welfare" of its citizens. (see the Constitution's Preamble)  The Republicans have always been "extremely" business friendly (to put it mildly). There can be no cohesion between the two idealogies.   Thus the smoke and mirrors of "trickle down" economics was born.  This states that low taxes will spur investment. Investment will spur jobs. And prosperity will "trickle down" to everyone else.  The problem is, it depends on businesses NOT sticking a cup under the trickle and adding the money they could have contributed to society (but didn't) to their bottom line. All Reagan did was explode the deficit that Bush I continued (then had to raise taxes).<br>  <br>  Clinton came in, raised taxes on the most wealthy, instituted a pay as you go philosophy, and cleared the deficit and created a surplus.  Please note under Democratic Presidents, economies generally expand. under Republican presidents, the economy generally contracts.<br>  <br>  Thus under this latest incarnation of trickle down, with the Republicans holding ALL THREE branches of government, they went for broke.... literally. (side note, Clinton 'was' in fact a very corporate-minded, and ccorporate-friendly president. While corporations did very well under Clinton and the Republican congress, EVERYone came along for the ride).  In 2001, the Republicans held the type of power they had not held since BEFORE the Great Depression.  And they cut taxes on corporations and  deregulated everything in sight to the delight of business and to the detriment of our country.  Now if trickle down was EVER going to work,  it was NOW.  But it did not. And not only did the corporations once again stick a cup under the trickle... THIS time, they EVEN sent American jobs overseas.  (the ultimate middle finger to Americans).  yet they still need Americans to have money so they can buy their goods. (go figure) <br>  <br>  Now President Obama comes in during DESPERATE economic times.  Times where the companies are laying off by the thousand. The opposite of supply side (trickle down) economics is Demand (Keynsian) economics.  When PEOPLE HAVE MONEY, it creates demand. investment in anything that creates jobs WILL stimulate the economy.  I repeat.. INVESTMENT IN ANYTHING THAT CREATES JOBS WILL STIMULATE THE ECONOMY.  And when a family has money, they will spend on things they both need 'and' want. more money on food, clothing.  Maybe now a dinner and a movie.  Maybe now there is money for that new car (see failing auto industry).  and each ripple creating more demand, which creates more jobs to 'fill' the demand, and you get the cycle of GROWTH in the economy.  and guess what ELSE... People who have jobs PAY INCOME TAXES.  Now you have increased the tax base, and can begin PAYING DOWN the national debt like Clinton did.  This is what FDR did.  This is what Clinton did.  The unemployment rate was 25% as FDR took office. There is a REASON FDR is the only president to be elected FOUR times.  By the late 30's the rate dropped to 17%.  And the recovery was slowed only when he listened to Republicans who (in the late 30's) said STOP the spending. (obviously the final push out of the depression was entry into WWII)... and guess what... THAT was all government spending that gave people jobs from soldiers, to doctors, to mechanics, to factory workers....   ITS ALL ABOUT JOBS, PEOPLE.  PERIOD. <br>  <br>  This is the track that President Obama has taken.  While conditions are terrible, NOT doing something would be WORSE.  and CUTTING TAXES IS "PROVEN" NOT TO HELP. CREATING JOBS "IS".<br>  <br>  This post was really really long.  But it is accurate.  it is not revisionist history. (as what is being sold on the other side)  it is what happened.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	Those who actually believe it has to get worse before it gets better are amazingly ill-informed.

Who knows how many lives could have been saved if he had just not bent to political pressure.<br>  <br>  The importance of 'research' is to determine what does and does not work . . in the case of stem cells . . everyone is born with stem cells and the stem cells age with the body the same way all cells age with a body. About thirty years ago bone marrow and later stem cell transplants began to save the lives of children who had cancer. Stem cells are unique cells in the body . . they have no purpose other than to replace any cell that becomes damaged. Thus in the case of cancer a patients own stem cells can be harvested from their own blood . . by a process similar to dialysis . . stem cells are separated out of the blood and than the blood is returned to the body. The stem cells are frozen for later use. The patient is than isolated in the hospital and given high doses of chemotherapy in the hopes of killing off all remaining cancer in the body. Unfortunately this treatment also kills the patients immune system That is where the stem cells come in . . a few days after the chemo the patients own stem cells are given back to the patient through a transfusion.  The stem cells recognize that the patient no longer has an immune system and immediately gets to work building a brand new immune system . . hopefully cancer free this time.  The success rates for some cancers are higher than they are for other cancers . . no one knows why because research was stopped. However, scientists want to know if the cord blood stem cells or embryotic stem cells can make a difference in saving lives . . because a stem cell that has not aged may be better than stem cells that are older. No one really knows because research was halted in this country. Lifting the ban on stem cell research should be able to provide the world with answers about if this treatment is effective or ineffective. It will just provide answers . . that's all.|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	I think it was more of a moral stance on stem cell research.|`|1tNmUmE3aa	Stem cells can be used from adults too.

I am surprised at all of the real talk of revolution or insurrection beginning to go around. At least several people in "Blue" states that I know seriously looking for a "Red" state to relocate to, and take it from there. The middle class is getting tired of paying for corporate "plunder" tactics that now pass for "smart" business, as well as for the lavish social welfare programs that all the lazy moochers are lining up for. it is the Left's aim to disarm the middle class figuratively and literally before they become fed up enough to act as a mass. It's tough for the middle class to act in concert for something like a a revolution because they are so independent and do not have a "group identity" like those rely on them for a livelyhood.

But since barry bought the election they haven't been able to keep anything in stock.  Aside from some high priced competition level shot guns and some high end revolvers the store was empty.  They haven't been able to keep the shelves stocked because people are hedging their bets and purchasing firearms.

The PATRIOT act took away so many rights from US citizens that anything can now be considered an offence: and Punished harshly!  Only mass action will reverse the damage that Bush did to the US.

In medieval times, peasants were allowed to live on the land to work it, and they paid a portion of their earnings from the land to the king.  Even nobility, who were deeded land by the king, still had to pay taxes back to the king for the rights to the land.  Today, stop paying the taxes on your home and find out who REAL-ly owns it.

To answer that in any kind of intelligent fashion would require a lot more time and space than can be devoted here.  Your best bet would be to meet with an attorney in your area that practices in the area of trusts and/or business formations.  <br>  <br>  To answer your stated questions in brief though: yes, a trust can have its own health and life insurance (as in, they are paying for it), so long as you can get an insurer to underwrite it - they're under no obligation to do so.  <br>  <br>  Yes, a trust can be sued.  There may be a question as to whether or not the beneficiaries of the trust can be held individually liable based on the set up and language of the trust.  Same thing for the question about whether or not someone gets hurt - the right to sue doesn't go away, but it impacts the parties named in the suit.<br>  <br>  As for the benefits, etc., that's something you really need to discuss with your attorney.  There are a lot of considerations to go over, and a lot of advice will be specific to your situation.  If you're seriously considering this, its worth spending a few hundred bucks on an attorney to really go over it - get good information so that you can make a good choice.

hDOBfBZeaa	When you place cash on the books, you'll get a receipt from the jail clerk proving that you placed money, the amount, and that it has been placed on this person's account. I'm not too certain that they know who places cash, as it would take too much time away from staff if those in custody all wanted to see who put cash in their books. I think all they get is a balance if they request it. My advice is to keep the receipts, you can always send copies in your letter to your bf if you feel you really need to prove anything. If all you want is enough for him to write home, 10-15 bucks a month is probably more than enough - he can buy the paper, envelope, pen(s) and stamps and then have some left over for top ramen and crackers.|`|1YCzew5paa	You can receive mail in jail. as long as you put the address of the jail and his name it will get to him. you should tell him every time him money. i would send more then it cost on the outside. its expensive in there.if you still have trouble you can contact the prison where he is and they can give you everything you need.|`|NAJfCxnOaa	Please re-state your question, I don't understand.

So no, I don't think Obama is nuts.|`|9Kax4Kekaa	The drug cartels are here to stay because we as Americans are the number 1 consumers in drugs worldwide.  As long as there is a demand there will be a supply.  Although I think here you're getting into several different issues.  <br>  <br>  One, the right to bare arms, which I agree with.  Without guns we are powerless to overthrow a tyrannical government, which like Thomas Jefferson said is not our right but our duty to due so.  Also, like that same man said "Those who desire to give up freedom in order to gain security will not have, nor do they deserve either one".  Freedom is freedom, and one must take the good with the bad.  Also criminals do not register guns, they buy them illegally.  Therefore any law banning or restricting guns is only affecting a law abiding citizen, it does nothing towards crime. So I agree he should not take away that right.<br>  <br>  However the drug cartels run deeper then a few Mexicans, they are organized crime weaved together with the foreign and national mafia and even certain elements of our own government.  You're not going to stop them with a handgun, so I don't see what one thing has to do with another.  Although one could argue that we as Americans are abusing our right, how many crazy racist Texans have shot at women and children trying to cross our southern border?  Women and children with no tie to the drug cartels.  Their only crime is that they were born on the "wrong" side of the border.<br>  <br>  Keep the guns, keep an open border policy, keep the constitution as is<br>  KEEP ALL FREEDOM ALIVE<br>  For the day we don't, is the day we are no longer free|`|ew7nQKXSaa	The Libs aren't going to do anything about anything. They, like the Republicans, talk a good game, but in the end, all politicians do is blow hot air. They do a few little things to make it seem like they are doing something, when in reality, they are reneging on their bigger promises.<br>  <br>  For example, Obama has told people he is going to remove troops from Iraq. However, he's going to place them Afghanistan. So, nothing is really changing. He's doing the same thing as Bush, but in a different country. In the end, when he's up for reelection, he'll say, "I removed most of the troops from Iraq."<br>  <br>  The smart man will say, "And moved them to Afghanistan."|`|oIGOQDkSaa	Yeah, Obama's nuts, but no one will turn in their guns.<br>  <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=89830" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?f...</a>|`|XxUByikJaa	Do You Live in the South West ?

48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	It appears that you have no defense, so why do you want to contest the ticket?  Having a long commute, a clean record, or a loud A/C have nothing to do with your violation.  Yes, you can try to "game" the system, but it is likely that you will not succeed in doing anything but losing the ability to go to traffic school.  My advice is: sign up for traffic school, pay the cost of the ticket (about $435) and whatever the traffic school fee is, and keep it off your record.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	you could do it by written  Deceleration<br>  but you are probably going to lose anyway<br>  there is NO excuse for not yield to an emergecny vehcile<br>   you might just opt for traffic school<br>  now if you were deaf that would be a totally differnet story|`|AA10753086	If your only excuses are the AC on full blast and the noisy vehicle it probably doesn't make any difference because you'll probably lose either way.|`|hNzUnxY2aa	ALWAYS do Trial by Declaration first regardless of whether you're guilty or not.  Screw the Courts, they just want your money.  Don't say that it was because of your AC and noisy SUV that you were unable to pull over, say something more believable, whatever it is.  <br>  <br>  The first thing you have to do is extend your court appearance date as long as you can, ask for extensions until they won't give them to you.  Then you ask for your Trial by Declaration, it's gonna cost you about $50 but it's worth it, it will probably buy you about 6 months, and if you lose you can always appeal the decision and ask for a trial for which you appear.  Make sure you write your declaration in a formal manner and do not insult the officer in any way.  If you lose, well then ask for another trial.<br>  After, you get your trial, go to the Court 48 hours before your trial date and ask for an extension, only a Judge can authorize the extension but if you're a student say you have a midterm or something and they'll automatically give you the extension.  Don't ask for the extension before the 48 hours, because if you do so the court will have time to inform the citing officer that the trial date has been moved, if you do it 48 hours before your trial date, the officer will most likely show up and lose a day of work :)<br>  Now, on your final trial date--after about a year since the citing date--hope that the officer does not show up, since that will get your case dismissed 99% of the time.  If he does, I would probably encourage you to change your plea to "guilty with an explanation", if you plea "not guilty" you have almost no chance of winning, but "guilty with an explanation" might buy you some sympathy from the judge.  <br>  <br>  Good luck fighting your ticket man! <br>  <br>  P.S. Feel free to message me if you have any other questions.

That did not end the war,like that of a treaty would have done.But, agreed IN principle that the DMZ Zone would serve as the dividing barrier of the 2 Koreas and that North Korea's sovereignty would be recognized.<br>  <br>  All of this occured and technically speaking the fact that we are still at war as are the 2 Korea's. The fact that there has been a cease fire for 5 decades shows that any possible continuation of military engagements seem futile.I mean yes the US and N. Korea still argue in principle for the 2 conflicting governement types of both nations and the fact that N. Korea is trying to develop nuclear efficiency. <br>  <br>  But, here is as far as it goes for N. Korea is an impoverished nation that does not have the means to wage war with the US. Also, it has very little allies besides China and Russia and because China and Russia arein the Security Council with the US they would remain neurtal to a possible restart of a Korean War for the sake of the global community.<br>  <br>  Not to mention S. Korea is one of the most high tech societies on the planet and have obtained economic superpower status, so it would be foolish for N. Korea to restart the fire again cause this time S. Korea does not even need America's help. Also, Japan - a neighbor of N.Korea and American ally would not like if N.Korea starts any troublein regards to nuclear activity cause of the proximity it has and the fact N.Korea would have to launch a missile at the direction of Japan to reach the Western US seaboard. An aftershock would reach Japan and because Japan already have a history with nuclear devestation they are wary of this.<br>  <br>  Not to mention Japan has the militaristic might to match their economic might. Something S. Korea does not have and now that US-Japan relations are not testy,like they were during the time of the Korean War for it was only a half a decade removed from the US bombardments of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

I had no doubt in my mind that although he harbored some rightist ideologies as well as war monging ones as well he is no Bush and has the best intention to serve the United States.

QX38Vpdkaa	Relationships in the workplace demonstrate very poor judgement. I learned many years ago - you don't sh*t where you eat.|`|3DrSrzHAaa	In my workplace, that is a real no-no and is cause for legal action against the supervisor/boss.  It creates an appearance of favoritism.|`|c0ab280c9166f6cd89a7d926bfdfc24daa	I completely agree with the Sailor's answer. I am also a Veteran and would find it very irresponsible to have a personal relationship with a supervisor in most cases.<br>  <br>  However the work environment needs to be examined. In a small mom and pop shop, everyone may be very friendly with each other. What you describe seems more like a larger business.<br>  <br>  I think it is okay to get together sometimes, like if one person has a boat and someone else wants to go boating with them. You are an adult, you don't need to go out of your way to avoid someone just because you work for them. This shouldn't happen very often.<br>  <br>  Sure someone who is friends with the boss might get promoted faster. But it also works the other way: the friend might get passed up because the boss does not want to appear to have favoritism.<br>  <br>  The boss may also enjoy having you work for them and be less inclined to promote you if you are a really good asset to them. In some situations it could feel like the two friends are competing.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I made good friends with some of my supervisors in the military. But that was through appropriate pathways such as speaking in their office. What you do off the job can call into question your ethics and conflict of interests. Significant time spent with a supervisor cannot be ignored.<br>  <br>  It would also be very hard socially. Topics that are not appropriate in the workplace can come up in other places. You may be having dinner with a supervisor and you mention that a teenager you know is having an abortion but people are harassing her about it. You could find out that you have very much conflicting views about the issue. This can affect how your boss percieves you.<br>  <br>  There is a reason certain topics and actions are innapropriate in the workplace. If they find out something about you, like you have a disabled child who you may need to take time off to take care of, you may not get promoted because they are scared you wouldn't be able to work as much as someone without kids.|`|G9gm4nnEaa	Coming from the armed forces, my views on this are rather strong-that's improper.  When a superior enters into a relationship with a subordinate, one of two things (both rather unequitable) will happen.  Either the superior will give the subordinate all the favorable assignments while consigning the other employees less-than-desirable tasks, or the superior will realize his/her natural tendency to do this and will overcompensate and saddle the subordinate with ALL the dirty work.  Regardless, it's not right and it's not fair play.  Superiors and subordinates should maintain professionalism by not entering into a romantic or otherwise unduly familiar relationship.

RD5sTZaFaa	To "waive" means to give up that right.  <br>  <br>  If you have any doubt about paternity you should require the genetic testing, because yes, if the child is later found not to be yours you are just out of luck, you won't get your money back, nor will the order for support be terminated.  <br>  <br>  I hope that if you are having a chile it is with someone you trust, and that there is a continuing relationship so that the child has the benefit of the love and support of both parents.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|MnbMpzaoaa	You agreed to paternity without being genetically tested and you will not insist on genetic testing in the future.<br>  <br>  Yes, you claim parentage.

However, the core of the Earth is REALLY far down, and there are only some places (i.e. near fault lines and thin spots in the Earth's crust) where the heat is readily available. So there isn't the money, political will, or cost effectiveness in the techology to use it on a large scale. Yet.|`|7M0KW1Iwaa	They actually build buildings that use the earth's heat to warm them....saw it on Dirty Jobs. That would save A LOT of energy every year.|`|YupMCYHlaa	No, we don't have the technology.  The molten core is down about 4000 miles, nobody can drill that far down.<br>  <br>  There are places where magma wells up into the crust of the earth, causing geysers, hot springs, volcanoes and such.  And those places people -do- use the heat of the magma to produce power. Most of the power in Iceland comes from this, in fact they use hot water from volcanic areas to heat their homes.  Here in California, there are a lot of hot springs around the Napa Valley area, north of San Francisco, and quite a bit of electricity is generated by 'geothermic' plants.   Also north of Yellowstone Nat'l Park, Yellowstone itself being the caldera of an ancient volcano that some believe could become active again.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	It is called geothermal energy.  Drilling all the way down to the core would be way too expensive- about a thousand miles deep.  They tie into hot springs and other naturally occurring sources to make it work.  Iceland has used this for years.  There are also systems that go down about 100 feet  to pre heat water.

It would take a book to explain it and people aren't willing to learn only piss amd moan. It's going to take everyone to bring about change but as you can see Republicans want to stay the course with the same failed policies. if you keep feeding the rich and big business eventually everything has to fail because   when people don't have any cash to support business they go belly up.if people can't see this they aren't looking. Bottom line is Republicans will fight till the end voting no an everything but still have their hands out for their share of the money.  I can see the rich and big business thinking that way but average middle class people can't see what is going on. Ex. they give themselves thousand dollar raises and vote no for a lousy dollar raise for us. They accept health care that we paid for but say it's socialism if we get it., when are theae people going to wake up.

Obama did nothing to help his home State of Illinois, and under his Senatorship had one of the worst economies in the entire country.

But if the detector's circuitry can be completely shielded so that it doesn't transmit anything outside it's chassis, then there's no way the cops can pick it up. So if the manufacture tested the product thoroughly and is honest in his advertising, I see no reason why it shouldn't be possible for a radar detector to be completely undetectable.|`|NAJfCxnOaa	Kind of.  Radar detectors leak low oscillation radiation.  Undetectable detectors supposedly have sealed their cases to reduce or eliminate the LO leakage.  What the clever cop can do is pull up behind you and hit you with his radar.  When you stomp on the brakes, he may have you because you hit your brakes when he turned on his set.

AA10274478	I am sort of a Democrat and sort of an Independent, and I am against abortion. Many years ago I joined the Republican party mainly over the abortion issue, but I got fed up with republicans a few years back. I became an Independent, but now I feel myself wanting to gear back into the Democratic party if I can do it as a Pro-life.<br>  <br>  I do believe in making a few exceptions like rape and incest, life of the mother. But people who choose to have sex need to accept the responsibilities attached. I do NOT agree with Republicans who want to shunt off the baby once it's born and blame everything on its mother. If we are going to demand that the baby be born then we are going to have to care for that child (and the mother) once she is born.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	No one wants someone to have abortion but if you get out around people who are having abortions I think you will understand they have no choice & that suicide &  have done other desparate things. Read about the history. I saw a movie about it when I was a teenager & it showed how people went to back ally butchers & ended up dying right there or later bleed to death. Dems are for treating others as they would want to treated so first understand why anyone would decide to make this horrible decision. Then see what happend to people before it was legal to have medical care.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	I am sort of against it? Like morally I think its murder and people who do it will go to hell. But that is my religion and I don't think that is a good thing to base all the laws on, not everyone is religious or shares my beliefs. Also realistically I think its still probably the lesser evil in a lot of cases so it should definitely be legal. <br>  <br>  But I don't think certain types should be legal at all. Like- when people have abortions because the baby has down syndrome or something similar, that just makes me ill. I can sort of be OK with people who have early abortions, most of them don't even think its a 'real' baby at that point right and its done for different reasons? But that type of abortion is really just killing a person because they're a specific kind of person or something. Its way too much like the nazi doctors for me? Anyway, thats really long. Basically I think its wrong but sometimes it is less wrong than the alternative. I don't consider it when I vote because generally I can't decide which side I would vote for?|`|CNSGz12zaa	I think we are all against Abortion. I know of no one who is Pro-Abortion. But ultimately the Republicans and Conservatives should stay out of our private lives as it is a Woman's Choice not Congress. Some limits should be put on it such as partial birth abortion but otherwise it is not the for the Govt. to say.|`|Cq8gHlt7aa	The world population is already far above what scientist think the earth can sustain.

Undocumented workers are just an excuse to keep morons like you distracted. Part of the reason why Reagan revived the economy years ago was the fact that he granted amnesty to millions of hard working illegal immigrants.<br>  <br>  Many anti-immigrant americans complain of undocumented immigrant<br>  workers accepting low wages thus resulting in unfair competition<br>  in the job market.  They are even blamed them for the downward<br>  trend of pay rates to very low levels. Solution?  Regularize<br>  these workers so they can join the unions. Surely, they'd rather<br>  have $18/hr instead of $8/hr.  Another complaint is they are<br>  draining the welfare coffers of the federal government by<br>  becoming a social burden.  Solution?  Legalize them so they can<br>  pay ss/medicare and income taxes.  If 10 million undocumented<br>  workers pay payroll and income taxes and property taxes, that<br>  would be billions of dollar going into government coffers.<br>  Terrorists, druggists, smugglers, criminals, be they citizens or<br>  immigrants have there place in jail.  But hardworking people<br>  seeking the american dream should be treated with respect and<br>  dignity.  America is a nation of immigrants.  Even native<br>  americans have accepted the presence of immigrants in this land.<br>  But many have forgotten that our ancestors came from other lands<br>  in search of the american dream.|`|558bc8fded7dd07d3d8386ff2bb3a738aa	No!. <br>  But is too late, Obama promised to them, in spanish trough his half sister, a lot of job security, amnesty, welfare, housing, free college, etc. <br>  <br>  That's why he won the elections, with the hispanic support.<br>  <br>  to the answer under mine; they DO GET WELFARE AND FOOD STAMPS, I see it with my eyes in our local grocery store.

He's useless (as he has proven), ineffective (as he demonstrates everyday) and a liar (just listen to his show). No publicity is bad publicity for him since his audience of brain-dead heads will continue to listen to him. Newt is just trying the to be as controversial and get attention by being the only Republican not licking Rush's boots. It's fun to watch the Republicans self-destruct, isn't it?|`|Wx1PqjgBaa	Childs play.  Wait until Limbaugh unloads on former Bush speechwriter David Frum for his article in Newsweek.<br>  <br>  "And for the leader of the Republicans? A man who is aggressive and bombastic, cutting and sarcastic, who dismisses the concerned citizens in network news focus groups as "losers." With his private plane and his cigars, his history of drug dependency and his personal bulk, not to mention his tangled marital history, Rush is a walking stereotype of self-indulgence—exactly the image that Barack Obama most wants to affix to our philosophy and our party. And we're cooperating! Those images of crowds of CPACers cheering Rush's every rancorous word—we'll be seeing them rebroadcast for a long time."|`|AA11042510	I have supported Rush for 20 years.  People who like Rush dont care what uninformed people say about him.|`|PwQn0Oixaa	I mostly think Newt doesn't want Rush Limbaugh to be the voice and face of the Republican party.<br>  <br>  Like him or not, Rush will more or less put a worse image of the GOP and thus new followers won't come.<br>  <br>  I keep saying to death that the biggest problems with the GOP is that many see them as the party of the wealthy whites, war-mongers, and people who can't get out of the early 1950s.<br>  <br>  Many, even conservatives, have said the GOP needs to re-image and redefine itself.
kPG2g4iSaa	Yes, it is possible for a person to change rates after a certain amount of time, although I don't claim to know the specific requirements. It would almost certainly require a re-enlistment on the part of the person wanting the change.<br>  <br>  However, if you already have two alcohol tickets, there's a very good chance that you won't make it two years without getting another one. How do I know this? It's just the odds. If you're young enough to join the Navy and already have two alcohol tickets, you most definitely have a drinking problem, and there is about a 95% chance that you are an alcoholic.<br>  <br>  Now, I'm quite aware that I'm not going to get any warm fuzzies coming from your direction because of what I just wrote. As a matter of fact, I would be surprised if you weren't pissed at me right now. But you know that people close to you have talked about how you might have a drinking problem. They might have even used the "A" word. I'm being very blunt here for a reason: you must stop drinking or else alcohol will ruin your life. Find an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting to go to and you will discover that you have a lot more in common with the other attendees than you ever dreamed.<br>  <br>  Best of luck on your career ambitions and your life.

The more people read and hear about the President's and the democrat's policies, the more the people don't like it. Look at Jim Cramer. He's on record as an Obama supporter, yet he thinks that Obama is going to ruin America financially. The big news today was Warren Buffett saying that the republicans should just vote for the democrats plans anyway. What wasn't reported was that just prior to saying that, Buffett disagreed with the President on "card check", "cap and trade"/carbon tax, the President's "calling out" CEO's for using company jets, and is against "trying to jam a whole bunch of other things down their throats.  don't think anybody on December 7th would have said that a war is a terrible thing to waste and therefore we're going to try and ram through a whole bunch of things."|`|xb3A4mH5aa	If they keep it up, I mean their mouths, they are going to loose plenty!

qV8Vz36Iaa	If you listen to the commentary on the DVD version of this movie, you will hear that the 9/11 false flag operation was part of the motivation behind the movie. In the movie, the tower was destroyed by V and the government claimed it was a planned demolition. In NYC on 9/11/2001, WTC1, WTC2, and let's not forget WTC7 were alledgedly destroyed by a terrorists conspiracy. The Truth Movement claims the three buildings were destroyed through a planned demolition, and there's a lot of evidence that points in that direction.<br>  <br>  This movie hits the nail on the head when it comes to mass media.

Para Rescue are elite forces that are trained to rescue downed pilots in all sorts of environments, terrain, and combat situations.  Combat Controllers I am not overly familiar with but have been told that their mission is more along the lines of securing a place for air craft to land i.e. take over a hostile airfield, subdue enemy forces or provide initial security/navigational aids to land air craft at abandoned or makeshift sites etc.  Not sure if they also provide forward recon support for attack aircraft or not but wouldn't be suprised.|`|GSCD9vq3aa	no|`|CTaKjwDTaa	Wikipedia.org<br>  <br>  type in US SOCOM

U95m4LhAaa	If you clicked on "merit system" and "spoils system" you would have understood it.<br>  <br>  The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act (ch. 27, 22 Stat. 403) of 1883 United States federal law established the United States Civil Service Commission, which placed most federal government employees on the merit system and marked the end of the so-called "spoils system." The act provided for some government jobs to be filled on the basis of competitive exams.<br>  <br>  The merit system is the process of promoting and hiring government employees based on their ability to perform a job, rather than on their political connections. Federally, it was instituted by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. It is the opposite of the Spoils system. <br>  <br>  In the politics of the United States, a spoils system (also known as a patronage system) is an informal practice where a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its voters as a reward for working toward victory, and as an incentive to keep working for the party—as opposed to a system of awarding offices on the basis of some measure of merit independent of political activity.

sKMAuY8eaa	what state?  Arizona has third party liability laws, so everyone gets in trouble|`|HeoS75kGaa	Thanksap has the correct answer.  Both the owner and the employee can be severely fined, and the owner can potentially lose his license to sell liquor.  In many states, if not all, underaged persons are not even permitted in a bar where 51% or more of their revenue is derived from the sale of alcohol.  The bar owner could be fined heavily for that offense, alone, whether anything was sold.<br>  <br>  Liquor licenses are controlled by the state, so state law applies in the situation.|`|AA10187742	Both, AND the owner can loose the liquor license permanently|`|AA12146958	This would come under local/city ordinance.

Hopefully a jury agrees with you since she had no buisness being there and no buisness drinking|`|iJA0LxVyaa	Yes, this is still considered rape. You cannot use alcohol to excuse yourself of certain actions. If that was possible, we'd all be out causing havoc and blaming the booze.<br>  <br>  If she went to the hospital and they swabbed her and whatnot, then you're pretty screwed. Obviously this was a stupid drunken act, but you seem to have put yourself in a hard place.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should just apologize to the girl and her family. Let them know that you had assumed she was older, you were both intoxicated and she was the one who suggested having sex to begin with.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I have no advice for you. Good luck with everything and keep the drinking under control.|`|q6GnofENaa	So I'm just going to give you some hopefully encouraging advice with this because I think right now you need it.  First, go get a lawyer, immediately, before you do anything else.  Then, go straight to the source, go to the girl and her parents and pretty much beg for their forgiveness.  Tell them that you understand being drunk is not an excuse but that you are human and humans can do very stupid things sometimes, VERY stupid.  Tell them that you honestly were not aware that she was underage and that if you could take it back you would.  Try as hard as you can and all you can do is hope for some kind of understanding.  By the way, if you do get off easy somehow, you might want to think about not drinking EVER again since you obviously can't think straight when you're drunk.  Good luck..

Being that we are in a recession right now, this could be a multi-billion dollar business that can put people back to work. Not to mention tax payers wont have to house the people that get caught possessing it and selling it. They could focus on the real criminals like child rapists. The gov't should tax it though.|`|1JrTdTRlaa	legal but not in large amounts

G6yyceAxaa	believe or not, Infantry.  Infantry uses 1 lieutenant for every infantry platoon in the army. most of them are branch transfers, or in other words, they are transportation officers that the army borrowed to be a LT in the infantry platoon. once they go back to there branch, they fester doing staff work.  Infantry officers normally have to score in the upper percentile to be selected, as the promotion is much faster in the branch.  don't hear much about a finance officer making general.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	None of the Combat Arms branches are that difficult to get.

AaXl3vcCaa	i assume you are not in the US cuz the price was not dollars but whatever your equivilant of the better business bearue is who you need to call, save the reciept and call them and report it, if you have proof that they advertised it at that price and accepted your payment they should have to give it to you, keep in mind you could end up in small claims court though too|`|Re9Pdfxbaa	The advertising is called "an invitation to treat" and the seller can sell at a different price when you go to pay for it. But once they have agreed and accepted your money they can not change the price. Under contract law you own that TV for the price agreed when you paid for it.|`|x16GkFsyaa	How frustrating!!   Like with most things of this nature the only way you can pursue this and win your argument is if you have solid and  original forms of proof.<br>  <br>  Did you have an email receipt of your purchase confirmation if you bought it online?  Can you also provide proof of the dates it was advertised at this price and the date of your purchase transaction?<br>  <br>  The blog could be a slightly grey area, because it is likely it will need to be seen "live" on the website by trading standards or by another solid means (I can't suggest how)  Because if you highlight this to the company they are only going to delete it from there site! <br>  <br>  It is completely false advertising and it is probably a successful way of drawing people in, however companies tend to win against the consumer or so it always seems because of loop holes in the standards and law with things like this.  Strength is usually in numbers... I highly doubt you are the only person who tried purchasing that item at that cost..  Remember any business hates bad press, that's usually their weakness!!<br>  <br>  If you do decide to pursue this, I doubt you will get a result very quickly though.<br>  <br>  Good luck
T8nap2Pnaa	Getting the visa in the Philippines is the last step in the process. The first step is getting an employer to sponsor you and then waiting for them to file a petition. Since there are more people who apply for H1bs than there are available visas, then there is a lottery in April each year when the winners are selected. however, the petitions aren't valid until October 1. So, that process alone can take up six months or so, assuming your petition gets past the lottery. As for H2bs, they also require petitions, and there are quotas for them as well, and H2bs are like tourist visas, just because you apply you won't necessarily get one. If they think you aren't likely to return, you'll be rejected.|`|1AzCDrO6aa	first you need an employer to sponsor you for a work visa. there is really no way of knowing how long since they do a lottery for the visa. if you are lucky, you can get yours the same year but if not it will take years. you just hope for the best and at the same time expect for the worst. good luck. ingat kabayan.|`|8QjEISWeaa	3 yeras

us829DaMaa	I just came off of recruiting duty and can tell you that your misdemeanor should not be a problem at all. As far as your G.E.D, last year the Army was paying for people to get their G.E.D. but you would have to basically sign a contract that you would have no options with. Finish your G.E.D. and see your local recruiter. At most you may have to get a character reference for your misdemeanor.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	Once you actually get your GED see a recruiter.  The violation you got won't stop you from getting in as long as all fines are paid.<br>  <br>  The basic requirements are that you have at least a green card, are at least 17, have no non-waivable law violations, have at least a GED (which limits your options for jobs and bonuses unless you add 15 college credits to it), and are able to pass the physical at MEPS.  The recruiter can give you the full details.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Right now the Army has tightened up on GEDs because of the influx of people trying to join because of the economy and you will probably be turned around.  What you can do is get the 15 college credits so you can count it as an HS diploma.|`|rNXCnJ8Eaa	There's so much I  could ramble on about so rather than do that I'll put up a link to a pretty good website with LOTS of information.|`|CvqRa0XEaa	It can but probably won't.

2bb016b1e780abaa80d9a9bd66d8e804aa	Direct Democracy is where each citizen/stakeholder has direct representation.  There are no elected representatives.  Think "Survivor".<br>  <br>  It is unwieldy outside of a hamlet.  Some small towns in New England still use this form of government at the local level.  States will sometimes have a form of direct democracy in the form of petition processes, intitiatives, and recalls.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	The only example is the Greek city state of Athens 827bc-136 ad.  All the citizens gather in the agorra (marketplace) and caucus-  they move to one side or the other of the town square to show their vote on the matter.  then they are counted and the winners decide the issue.  Not very good for personal rights, and not good for planning.  May as well do a public opinion poll - same thing but the margin of error would be 0.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I believe that is where the citizens of a country directly vote for their leaders and other issues.  I think the difference between that and the democratic republic we practice in the US is that in the US the people are filtered from directly voting by the Electoral College and our representatives.
CowgOqXTaa	The legal term is "malicious litigant". <br>  <br>  Many States have an automatic limit on the number of pro se lawsuits one plaintiff can file in a year. In addition, a defendant can always go to the court and ask to have a specific person named as a malicious litigant. Once such a label is issued, the plaintiff is subjected to additional restraints on his ability to sue.<br>  <br>  What those restraints are depends on State. In some he must have a lawyer (because lawyers are barred by the canons of ethics from advancing a frivolous or malicious suit), in some he must get a judge to sign off on the suit before he files it, and in some he must post a bond to cover the defendants costs if he loses.<br>  <br>  Richard|`|XD42367paa	Richard is spot on.

ZB1vk86Maa	You need to do a little more research. They are nothing like each other you don't have to try out for Cav Scout you just sign a contract for 19d and go to basic training and Ait for it. Marine Recon is an elite force within the Marine Corps. You have to go to Recon Indoc and if you get through it they will send you to the Basic Recon Course. BRC has a high attrition rate so good luck with that. This just gets you into Division Recon there are still steps up from this like Deep recon platoons, Force Recon and MARSOC. I would say Marine Recon is more along the line of Army Long Range Surveillance Companies.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	They are both elite of course.. they do different jobs.<br>  I think Marine Recon is. They have several different spots in it- a Marine told me that there's a group within Marine Recon that is the equivalent of "Delta Force".<br>  Marine Recon does the same kind of work as Navy SEALs, and they also do missions similar to Rangers I hear.<br>  Good luck and thanks for serving.|`|tROFU72waa	Cav Scout is a basic MOS in the US Army bro.  They are a conventional fighting force that, while attending some cool schools, are nothing outside of the ordinary.<br>  <br>  Marine Recon (now MarSOC) are elite Marines who work in a specialized Reconnaissance field.  The attend schools for that specific purpose ie Combatant Diver, Airborne, HALO, Ranger, Scout/Sniper.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line:  The US Army Rangers are akin to Marine Recon, not the Cav Scout.|`|Im8G3mjRaa	Well, considering Marine Recon is some sort of a Special Operations thing and Army Cavalry Scouts are more of an Armor thing...I'd say Marine Recon. I'm Army so I'm bias so if you compared Marine Recon to Army Rangers or something, I'd say the Rangers.|`|tZqi3hwwaa	These special forces have different tasks to accomplish and they both do it well.

But with no income they need to know who is providing you with shelter, food etc..<br>  <br>  You can also get on WIC (Women Infant Children) at this time, and receive nutritious foods, such as, milk, bread, peanut butter etc. And once the baby is born they can provide you with formula and such. <br>  <br>  Good luck.

It doesn't matter if it's felony or misdemeanor.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	No...<br>  Unless they get a warrant.<br>  <br>  The only way a police officer can enter your property without a warrant is if they feel there's imminent danger... i.e. violence, domestic abuse, gunshots, a fleeing felon, etc...<br>  <br>  Smoking dope doesnt qualify.<br>  <br>  Of course cops have a gun and a badge... and contrary to popular belief some bad apples in the blue ranks dont always follow the rules.<br>  So just to be safe... keep your blinds drawn ;)|`|zHmZkMStaa	I think in some states they can.

AA10123414	Sure you can refuse. You should use the time to find a lawyer.|`|HeoS75kGaa	Constitutional rights are not just part time privileges.  They apply all the time.  You DO have the right to remain silent.  This is true whether you're in custody, or simply being questioned.  They may choose to take you into custody while they investigate further since you did seem to be involved in some way.  Whether or not they have sufficient evidence to charge you will be another matter.<br>  <br>  Obstruction is NOT the refusal to cooperate, contrary to what some law enforcement people claim.  Obstruction is when you deliberately give false or misleading statements to literally obstruct the investigation.  Refusal to speak is not giving false statements.<br>  <br>  The exercise of a right cannot be converted to a crime.  You cannot be arrested for failure to cooperate.  Again, you could only be arrested for suspicion of abetting in the crime, or for actively impeding the investigation.  To reiterate, refusing to speak is passive impeding, not active.  That is not a crime, any more than pleading Not Guilty in court would be Perjury.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Yes. Because anything you Say can (& usually WILL) -be used against You ! So if you NEED to talk to SOMEone- make it a Lawyer...   :)|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	You can, but you can then be charged with obstruction of justice.<br>  <br>  The so called "5th" (a constitutional amendment protecting you from self-incrimination) is only applicable in a court setting.|`|a4f625e9943640ad9aec7382d7bcfe89aa	You can refuse but can still be called to testify at court.|`|RRFbDou9aa	Yes, you can.|`|hDOBfBZeaa	Well, from what I understand it was your friend, not you that was charged with anything. So, i'm assuming that police were asking for your statement as a witness possibly. You have the right not to speak to police if you're being arrested, you just simply say that you've got nothing further to say without an attorney present.

Bush had eight years and he just made it worse. I'm not sure how to fix it, but setting a date to pull out would certainly be better than just hanging around, pissing people off.

You may or may not have touched him. But if you went up to him (and not him to you), in an angry manner, he could have sufficient reason to believe he had to hit you. However I do not know the details.<br>  <br>  If there was something you could have done, like walk away or put your arm up to hold him back, then you could be liable. If you continued to fight him after he backed off or was down (and no longer an immediate threat), you should be in trouble.<br>  <br>  If there was a way you could have stopped the fight or if you continued to fight past the immanent danger, you should be held liable.<br>  <br>  If he hit you and you backed off, he would be the one in big trouble. But now you are not only in trouble, you have someone who hates you for hurting them and all their friends.<br>  <br>  He is responsible. That does not make you any less responsible for your own actions in excess of what was required to prevent physical harm from happening to you.|`|eJzvWPkIaa	if he threw the first punch,<br>  he should be getting in trouble.<br>  fight it, say you were just protecting yourself.<br>  self defense.<br>  and that was a horrible thing for him to say,<br>  i hope you permanently affected his face :)<br>  haha.<br>  that's mean.<br>  but you could definatly fight that.<br>  even if he got hurt worse, he threw the first punch and you could say it was self defense.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK !|`|xluqxYj8aa	Now honestly, I hate my dad, SO I wouldnt care.

Most of the illegal immigrants who come from Mexico are poorer people, they do non-skilled labor type jobs and most visas/greencards go to people with more job skills like doctors, engineers, computer workers etc?

It is there job to represent their districts but to do what is best for the country.  Earmarks only help certain areas but hurt the country in the long run.  We need smaller federal government. And we need a president that will stand up to them...|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	By your definition you could call any bill an earmark since it serves someones congressional district.  Personally I think there should be 1 bill for 1 program.  These multi-program bills always seem like trouble however that is way things are done in Washington, not just with Obama but almost since our country began.

Ebqz6NhXaa	Yes. These are the first attempts by the Chinese to undermine US. objectives in the area. The Chinese are stepping up their military most likely preparing for a war with the West. They have already started the building of aircraft carriers. <br>  Thanks to Bush the US is strategically weak due to the wars in The Middleeast. China has  realized this and is seeking to undermine our positions all over the world. They are arming the Sudanese government. They are supporting Iran. The Chinese still hold Tibet and are attempting to regain Taiwan. The Chinese are not limited by human rights or working for the greater good, however hollow that good may be. The Chinese government is ruthless and unscrupulous. It is willing to kill its own citizens to maintain order. <br>   In the end we only have ourselves to blame. If corporations hadn't gone to China seeking low cost manufacturing the nation would not have had the funds to begin its rise. The desire of the West for cheap useless crap is our undoing., Now the rise of China is in nearly direct conflict with the west.

AA11268819	Because he didn't have liberal enough viewpoint.|`|U2qRvH2laa	The Democrats have a bleeding desire to interfere and medal in other countries affairs when they see someone getting the upper hand. They couldn't get into the Bosnia conflict fast enough. When they voted with the republicans to go into Iraq, to enforce UN resolutions, one would have thought they would have been the last to back away. But when casualties began to mount they didn't have the stomach for it. That's when they began to make up things like "Bush lied" and "they didn't have nothing to do with 911". That took the focus off the UN resolution reason. Further, they didn't want Bush to succeed because that would continue to put their socialistic agenda in jeopardy. The last thing they would want is for Bush to succeed and possibly catapult another Republican into the office. Bush wore the Republican label and that means opposition. It wasn't so much they didn't like the Iraq conflict, it was the fact they were stuck on the side lines and rather than support the country they decided to be a fly in the ointment. Typical left wing mentality is to be un-American and they came through with flying colors. That's just what they do best.

They are trying to help us out by suggesting that if we do not listen to Limbaugh, it will be in our best interest. Thanks for your unsolicited advice Libs. I never knew, until this week, that you cared so much about the well being of the Republican party and the Conservative movement. /sarcasm<br>  <br>  Only in the liberal mind is he ruining the GOP. In the real world, he's one of the best things that is happening to the conservative movement, so the left has to do whatever it takes to get the right to distance themselves from Rush. Which would be a very bad move.<br>  <br>  "I am a big Rush fan myself! I love it when he opens his mouth. He has done more for my party than even Obama could!"<br>  <br>  Yeah, you wish.

Love Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson and their their songs like Subdivisions, Tom Sawyer and Freewill.  I didn't know they were Republicans (do they even have a Republican party in Canada?)<br>  <br>  Seriously, Rush who?  Equating Rush Limbaugh with the leadership of the Republican Party is like equating Ronald McDonald with the CEO of McDonalds.<br>  <br>  The only major way in which the Republican's lost their way in the past 8 years was in the mind boggling 180 and complete abandonment of fiscal restraint after Bush took the White House while it also controlled the legislature.  I thought I had stepped into some alternate reality.  In that sense the real leadership in the legislature and the executive led the party way off course but I think the party finally understands that.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind too that since the Reagan administration onward, the Republican party grew with a much more diversified base and a significant portion of the Reagan Republicans are what many old school Republican idealogues would call RINOs.  It was always a somewhat fragile coalition in that sense and the Republican Party has to decide whether it wants to abandon the practices of maintaining that coalition to go back to its roots.  It already largely abandoned the concept of maintaining that solidarity in the last election which coupled with its abandonment of fiscal responsibility is why it lost most of the political moderates who are integral to the success in any national campaign today.<br>  <br>  If the Republican Party really wants to rebuild based on its historical pre 1980's base then it has to look towards it as a long term goal over the course of at least a decade and not just one or two election cycles.  It is going to have to alienate and disown a significant portion of its current supporters.  It is going to have to recruit and educate the next generation of voters on a grassroots level about its political philosophy in a positive and intellectual manner which has been fairly absent outside of academic circles for at least the past decade.|`|5K43n7ieaa	I don't listen to him, I listen to Mark Levin (a better conservative talk show host).

If you are asked to sign a card, where is your right to a secret ballot. <br>  <br>  If the card check is not successful, then and only then, will you be allowed a secret ballot. <br>  <br>  Republicans and many democrats are against it because it gives the company no opportunity to rebuke the union. It also makes it impossible to simply close your doors in an attempt to avoid unionization. That is not right and denies the company its right to free speech.

ujIinLzGaa	Possibly, to some degree, but I think it was mostly an attempt to sell houses to a lot of people without proper concern for their ability to pay (the "pulse test"), so that groups of the loans could be packaged up and sold as investments.  A partial effect of this was that more illegal immigrants could possibly afford houses than before, so I can see why you would ask this question.|`|caefe9fcecf0459fc50d20cbc39f206faa	I dare say it was. In fact, I think it may have - for certain politicians - been the primary motivating factor. <br>  <br>  I have so many friends who've immigrated LEGALLY and given none of the freebies being handed to illegal aliens. <br>  <br>  The number of people who've yet been permitted to even ENTER the U.S. - tho they've followed every law concerning Legal immigration - is over 6 million. Some have been applying, paying fees, updating, paying more fees and waiting for over TWENTY YEARS. <br>  <br>  That is simply, grotesquely unethical. <br>  <br>  If those who observe the law make any tiny mistake, they're held fully accountable. Many are sent to the back of the line. Most illegals I know of, though, are constantly in and out of jail but suffer no consequences whatever concerning their "immigration" status. Why not? Because in a legal sense, they're not even immigrants. They're trespassers. <br>  <br>  Those most enraged at the marches of '05 & '06 are Legally immigrated "Mexican Americans" (call them Americans; they don't like labels that imply being only half-American.)<br>  <br>  Great question!!!<br>  <br>  See: dontspeakforme.org<br>  <br>  EDIT: Well, that about describes me...

They have always had the lunatic fringe represented by Limbaugh.<br>  <br>  Jindal is an elected governor. Steele has been elected Party President and official leader and spokesman of the Republican Party. To lick Rush's boots mean that they thought that just by having a colored face you could influence and attract people of color. Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer. If he not entertaining enough to attract and audience he's canceled. So therefore, if you don't say inflammatory things you won't get an audience.<br>  Both Jindal and Steele have failed miserable.

Rehabilitating their citizens to be run by a democracy is nothing similar.<br>  <br>  If you would use this comparison, then you would have to say China is FAR weaker, since it's having about as much failure in Tibet, which is much smaller and doesn't even have a military.<br>  <br>  Though I do not share the same opinions as you. I do not feel that China is incapable of defeating Tibet in an all out War. They just cannot convince all the citizens to their way of thinking.

Therefore, there would be no need to declare ware since a state of war already currently exists.  The armistice is monitored by the UN.  China already tacitly supports North Korea so it is not a question if they would join. So, your question is moot.|`|SU8Dv2ZAaa	If the U.S. declared war on North Korea, China WOULD NOT go to war with the United States; they might if it was just South Korea, but they're not exactly fans of Kim Jung Il. Would they help the North Koreans? Probably with supplies and things like that but I highly doubt they would declare war on the United States. <br>  <br>  The Russians have always been unpredictable. With their recent display of their "power", and I use that word loosely, they might try to pull something like that.<br>  <br>  If the United States were attacked, NATO would come to the war zone.

m24wuDzwaa	Maybe they are waking up to the fact that their so called global free market capitalism is unsustainable and is now self destructing. If so they must also realize that the propaganda they have used to maintain their power in the past cannot continue to work. Their anxiety is therefore in exact proportion to their ever increasing inability to control the flow of information and the values that people assign to the information they encounter. Without control of public opinion with what means of control are they left? Brute force can to easily be turned and often does turn against it's masters.

The Tax structure takes so much from people once they earn over 100K that it becomes very difficult to get to the next level. The rhetoric on taxes is pure myth, but the people keep saying things like "fair share" as if they know what those people pay now. If they did know, they certainly would not use that word. The top 5% pay 40% of the budget now, and the Democrats will certainly make it 50% or more. If that's not Socialism by it's definition, it's certainly not "fair".<br>  <br>  Upstate NY has the 2nd highest poverty rate because of enormous taxes to pay for a huge government patronage train. You are better off with a State pension and health care than starting your own business. Meanwhile, the private sector has left (50,000 people in the past decade alone) because they are educated and don't want to work at the DMV. It's a total failure, but the Left keeps power by bribing the poor with all their giveaways. No upward mobility but they are taken care of cradle to grave.|`|tyvFUPOxaa	I no longer care whether we are capitalists or socialists; I personally have had it with the elites changing the rules every time it is to their advantages.

Because the longer we delay making our feelings known about what is happening around us, the worse things are going to become.<br>  <br>  I am set financially and I am self-employed, but for me there can be no joy in life until these international bankers and conspirators are brought to justice. If I live 20 more years, I will be amazed. But I will not be amazed if I coped out on my parents and my children by not taking a stand with my neighbors worldwide against this worldwide evil.
SlhuFfuZaa	The greatest enemy of freedom has always been the complacency of the citizen. The next greatest enemy has always been a greedy, power hungry government.<br>  All great nations have fallen from the inside and not from the attacks of an external enemy, as witnessed by history. And I suppose that we shall not escape that fate, as it is looking us in the face more and more everyday as it licks it hungry lips ready to devour our liberty and freedom soon. <br>  It will be served medium rare by the Great Pretender, His Ramness, the Judas Goat!|`|caefe9fcecf0459fc50d20cbc39f206faa	If the government of Our nation, whether by mistake or with full knowledge, whips up the fervor for a war against any other nation with no solid proof that we are in any way threatened by that nation, we've been victimized as a Citizenry. <br>  <br>  If we - that same Citizenry - permit ourselves the impossibly costly past time of focusing on the puppetry of so-called "parties", we may well be a greater threat to our Liberties than the most corrupt of governments. <br>  <br>  I have a dream. <br>  <br>  Soon, this epic plot and all its characters in governance will become so arrogant - so confident of our fear of voting outside these manipulative parties... so self-assured that our hatred of that 'other party' will determine our voting choices - that those parties will toss caution to the wind, talk down to us and show us their backsides... <br>  <br>  ...for the last time. <br>  <br>  I do SOOO love the disenfranchised from both parties.

The American people are allowing this to happen.  The only thing that separates us from a Hitler-style police state is the limitation of government, in other words, the Constitution.  When we allow our public servants to ignore the Constitution, and to usurp more power, we are setting ourselves up for tyranny.|`|Y7RbTYNvaa	This becomes more and more apparent with each passing day.<br>  <br>  "Give government the weapons to fight your enemy and it will use them against you." -- Harry Browne|`|YonedWiEaa	if I heard you right then I think you are wrong.....This new administration isn't promising to protect us from anything,|`|bIQU17Apaa	Yes. Whenever a government claims there is a threat from such foreign nations, it is more likely to remove liberties from the people in the hopes of protecting the people, and it is more likely that some people are willing to lose some liberties to gain protection. But what is ironic and what both government and a people willing to remove liberty for safety is that they are doing the exact same thing the supposed threat is trying to do. And that is remove liberty. It is never acceptable to remove liberty for safety, because then you are giving into your fears, or the supposed foreign threat.|`|izY3JNhqaa	Although we tout FREEDOM a whole bunch the fact still remains that the USA is the most CONTROLLED country of all.

After watching Zeitgeist, it really touched me on a level of belief that I always held . . . the monetary system, for example.  We are all born into slavery, into indentured servitude.  Especially in the richest country in the world, it is poignant that the homeless freeze and starve, have no medical care, and . . . Anyway, the whole fear-mongering thing was transparent to me from day one.  Bush, Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini . . . they knew how to work that angle.  I am just surprised at the number of sheep in the freest country in the world.<br>  <br>  You have to earn dollars for the right to live.  Something's wrong with this picture.  And government exploits that picture.  We need a paradigm shift.

Ar9XHVaeaa	Alan Keyes is not as popular of a guy as Obama. Obama has a way of speaking that causes either people to instantly receive a belief in "hope and change" or to see him as a phony and what-not. This has caused him to be a lot more prominent in the news and the talk of conservatives and liberals alike. Also, Obama's attraction to the youth of America has caused him to leak into pop culture.<br>  <br>  Keyes on the other hand, while also having good views on individuals rights and the sort, never was as powerful speaker as Obama was. The best comparison of this I guess would be the senate election 2004, but that is unfair to Keyes since he was thrown into the situation at the last minute. <br>  <br>  So I guess it would have to do with their manners of speaking and the attraction to the youth of America, but I agree with your overall sentiment, Keyes was never given much respect by Democrats, Republicans, or the media.|`|PwQn0Oixaa	Alan Keyes is an even more insane radical than people make Obama out to be.<br>  <br>  I remember when he ran for Illinois' Senate seat VS Obama.

There must be a reason for these treasonous actions by our government, and the only reason I can come up with is that most of our government officials are actually working for the NWO. <br>  <br>  They accept the saleries that we pay them, but their work actually benefits the NWO. Almost every high ranking member of government from the President to our Congress past and present, and all high ranking governmental positions in between are all filled with members of the CFR. <br>  <br>  This also includes all of the members of the Federal Reserve, although the Federal Reserve is actually not a governmental agency, it has more power than any government agency. It (the Federal Reserve) is the only private business that can not be audited by any governmental agency. That is an awful lot of power and authority to be in the hands of a non- governmental private business. To have the power and authority to tell the federal government NO, you can't look at our books. <br>  <br>  Even the dreaded and feared I.R.S. can't touch the books of the Federal Reserve. Now what does that tell you. I'll will let you be the judge.|`|0db7dfe907b8101041f1b50d64e06e6baa	If you have any doubts, read FOREIGN AFFAIRS, the magazine of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Some of the structures for the New World Order are the UN, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Bilderbergers, the European Union, the secret proposed North American Union, the International Court, and many of the treaties our globalist public servants are signing.<br>  <br>  Don't forget Bush the Elder's many references to the New World Order.

If you can't even show up for one day out of a month, than make sure your commitment is fully there. If you're doing your own PT and you think you really don't need it, than good luck at recruit training.|`|ILgk3OLOaa	Hell no you don't.  Those things are a waste of time and aren't going to help you out anyway.|`|DeAo0JGraa	make up a excuse..but its just going to show your lack of commitment|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	It would benefit you if you did go to the meetings and they are mandatory. However if you had good reasons If I was your recruiter I would insists on a face to face meeting once a month at a minimum.<br>  Just to ensure you were still eligible to go and still intended to ship on time.
KhyPqoFIaa	Dude be a fighter pilot!<br>  It′s lots of fun!<br>  <br>  Is glamour and challenging, a bomber pilot is an airline pilot with a bomb on the belly of the plane! you only navigate <br>  <br>  You can actually deploy bombs from f 18, or f 14 or f15 or f16 <br>  You pull G′s from a fighter <br>  <br>  There are more bases out there outside contintal us for fighters<br>  The excercises are lots of fun for fighters<br>  <br>  You can be an airshow pilot like air force thunderbirds or navy blue angels!<br>  <br>  From the surfer!|`|KDOIKIq2aa	Fighter pilots make movies. Bomber pilots make history.<br>  <br>  Times change, but in the old days a fighter pilot could transition between two maybe three aircraft types over the course of a career.  Now you might get stuck flying only one.  Fighter pilots fly faster and pull more Gs.  Fighter pilots will also find more slots in the Air Guard and Reserves than bomber pilots.<br>  <br>  A bomber pilot will most likely fly only one aircraft unless they start on the B-52 or B-1 and then get a slot to fly the B-2.  Bomber pilots fly longer hours, but at least have room to get up and walk a little and have some what of a proper restroom on those long flights.|`|YdLPJuTkaa	I would say a fighter pilot sounds more exciting personally.  However it would seem like a bomber pilot would have a better chance at getting a civilian job when he/she gets out.|`|jEIXPj7oaa	be a fighter pilot, it would be sick flying really fast shooting other planes down,<br>  <br>  but a bomber you get to drop a huge bomb on a country and watch it explode and say "yea i did that"|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	They each have their own appeal.

At least with a telemarketer you could tell them to put you on their 'Do Not Call List' now the same computers call back the next day.

Education is the only way to a real mixed economy.<br>  <br>  Now take from a different point of view ... why are ultra-conservatives that opposed to science? You know the answer.<br>  <br>  I have been to college. I never heard of a teacher telling his students who to vote for. My teachers gave me all the info possible for me to make my own mind.<br>  <br>  Ultra-conservatives often go to church to listen to the priest telling them who to vote for. It's quite different.<br>  <br>  (btw, you can't tell me you can dissociate ultra-conservatives and ultra-christian people ... you know that)|`|k6hicodfaa	First off, the "fairness doctrine" is not in play on a legislative level.<br>  <br>  Second of all, that point regarding colleges and universities is simply untrue.  Faculty members are getting younger and more moderate.  Beyond that--many, many courses have nothing to do with politics.  I have yet to see Organic Chemistry has a bias or Mathematical Physics have any political bias.|`|4nmLPk44aa	Schools and universities used to be into the doctrine that One nation under God was taught, until the liberals took over sometime I think in the 40's and started teaching darwins theory, Keynes, and Marxis Lenin. that would be why we are in the mess we are in today, brainwashing!!|`|AA11268819	Talk radio will died off and that's the whole purpose behind it.  There's nothing "fair" about it and BO knows it.<br>  <br>  As for the colleges and universities, all the liberals would do is show their real age so no one could hear the other side.  Many do that now.|`|b32jC7pGaa	I think the fairness doctrine is about as likely to pass as Antarctica is to move to Kansas. The whole thing is a scare tactic. And, anyone, liberal or conservative, who loves the Constitution and the Bill of Rights would spit on the 'fairness doctrine'.|`|7de370467c1bd78c2289f9e195b0bb85aa	That's a good idea. There should be balance to idiots like Ward Churchill.|`|8aXimsjBaa	Yes definitely!  The college indoctrination camps would then have to change their left wing ways!<br>  <br>  Peace|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Good luck getting universities to admit they're biased, and on proving it.  They've got text books that support the supposed truths.  It never ceases to boggle my mind how many inaccuracies I have to correct when my daughters come home with their text books.  I just tell them to go along and do what they must to pass, but they know they'll get the truth if they come to me when they question anything they read.  It starts in kindergarten.  By the time they get to college, they don't know any better.|`|KjZTFuzKaa	The fairness doctrine is a piece of C***.  The reason why there are no liberal talk shows is because no body listens to it.  I have no problem with letting a liberal radio host on the air but I'm sure the station will when it brings them zero ratings.|`|aqeWwA71aa	FOX "News" lies are not "opposing ideology" - they're simple lies.  <br>  <br>  Americans can choose what is allowed on our airwaves.<br>  <br>  Ask you fat pink Karl Rove why the FOX lies are important???|`|ubrOdZqMaa	That is a great point.

Very rarely will any liberal accept. They know they don't stand a chance. This is not a one sided opinion-it's fact. I'm a moderate conservative, would love to hear people like Pelosi & Reid debate Rush or John McCain. Never happen.|`|EnODJeIcaa	That's a damn fine point if the fairness doctrine needs to be implemented in a fundamentally free medium where people can choose to listen or not...then colleges should have to present differing arguements besides the communist socialist idealistic principles being taught at our schools.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong...I get that most kids are predisposed to being idealistic radicals when they are young...but for their teachers to not only support but demand that their ideology by in line with radical "progressive" views...shouldn't PUBLIC Universities be held to the same standard as a private market enterprise like radio is since our tax dollars are being spent on upkeep of these facilities?<br>  <br>  Hell I pay $3000.00 a year in state income tax while the Calfornia colleges are crying about how they don't have enough money...the campus here in Santa Barbara has spent over 400 million on new facilities in the last 3 years and they are pulling their pockets out asking for more money....<br>  <br>  I'll help them build a new "Green" building if they'll discuss why some people believe in the policies of Ronald Reagan and why free market principles MAY BE a better route than socialist principles without rolling their eyes and telling the kids to meet them in the square for a drum circle...<br>  <br>  It blows me away that Public University teachers are not given random drug tests...when I can walk on campus for a soccer game and spot 5 proffesors with bloodshot eyes and gooey dispositions...<br>  <br>  Pot smoking hippies may be who's running the California University system...but that doesn't mean it's a good thing.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Its funny when I hear claims like this...<br>  <br>  I went to TCU, my brother to TTU and my sister went to TAMU...<br>  <br>  Yes, they're all in Texas, but they're not liberal at all.  I think the "liberal" factor has more to do with regions than anything.  Not to mention the vast majority of studying done in college has nothing remotely to do with "liberal/conservative" agendas being taught.<br>  <br>  Unless of course there is a liberal/conservative way to business operations (the function), engineering, etc.|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	What I can not understand is why so many people think we need a fairness doctrine when we have the 1st amendment guarantee of such.|`|EPObVPzVaa	Process of Socialsim.<br>  <br>  Demonize the oppostion.<br>  <br>  Stifle independent thought.

Exactly how does someone with a stolen social security number get a social security benefit that they didn't earn?

There's a difference. If the Fed could give power to the states, it could also take them away. That's why the Founding Fathers worded the Constitution the way they did. They "recognized" unalienable rights, they didn't "grant" them. <br>  So far, about 16 states have declared their sovereignty by invoking the 10th amendment. They are afraid of the Federal government overstepping its bounds.<br>  You're dead right about the gov't being involved in things not specified in the Constitution. It's high time we reversed that.<br>  <br>  Jim Sock- Secession is NOT the same as declaring war. <br>  <br>  Softsneakers- Yes, Florida, like every other state, has the right to count the votes.

9tcv3TiWaa	With base housing you will get a 2 or 3 bedroom depending on the base he is located at and availability.  You have to pay cable, internet and telephone yourself.  For some housing that is now what is called PPV, they have a monthly allowance for electricity.  If you go over the allowance then you have to pay the difference.  If you don't then it is credited to the next month.  You also have to maintain the yard, with the Marines they are very strict including how high the grass is.  You can get written up if it is above a certain height.  There is only basic appliances like fridge, stove, dishwasher.  you have to supply your own washer/dryer, furniture.  Unless you are at an overseas (OCONUS) location in which you can be limited to what you are allowed to bring weight allowance wise.|`|ABmZYbDZaa	Yes, it is basically free because their BAH pays for it.

It's all the little stuff like linens, dishes etc. that add up fast that you need right away.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|LSpxWf7maa	From my experience in the military which was AirForce(1996-2000)...On base housing is 100% free,, no utility bills at all.

8MUj24s6aa	Yes, because fingerprinting those who are law abiding and legally able to own, buy, use, firearms will reduce the criminal acts committed by those who are already fingerprinted by law enforcement and still manage to buy a firearm... Leave it to a Liberal to come up with such "good" idears.<br>  <br>  "The laws that forbid the carrying of arms ... disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Can it be supposed that those who have the courage to violate the most sacred laws of humanity ... will respect the less important and arbitrary ones ...

Those who defend affirmative action and race-based politics, however sincere may be their desire to defend the rights of oppressed minority workers and youth, accept the framework of capitalist society and the domination of the vast majority of working people by a tiny privileged elite. They inevitably adapt themselves to the politics produced by this system, which is based on splitting working people along racial, ethnic, religious and other lines to cover up the fundamental class divisions of society.<br>  The Democratic Party's promotion of affirmative action has proceeded in pace with its abandonment of the liberal reformist policies that were associated with the New Deal of the 1930s and the Great Society of the 1960s. During the Clinton years the Democrats joined the Republicans in eliminating welfare, demolishing public housing, building up the powers of the police and carrying out other policies detrimental to minorities and the poor. These policies went hand in hand with cultivating a layer of black entrepreneurs, academics and officials to preside over the ever-worsening conditions in America's minority neighborhoods.<br>  Liberals claim to defend “equality of opportunity”—a chance for minorities and working class youth to rise within the hierarchies of capitalist society (corporate management, the political structure, the military, etc.)<br>  Socialists seek a genuine equality of conditions of life. Our goal is not to create “diversity” within the hierarchies of capitalist society, but ultimately to do away with them and create a society free of class domination. It is not to integrate the ruling class, but to abolish it.<br>  From a socialist standpoint, education has a fundamental democratic significance. It is not merely a means of access to wealth and status, but a goal in itself, a necessary part of the development of a fully human personality. Every human being should be educated to the level required for life in a modern, technologically advanced society, which means college-level or advanced technical training for nearly everyone.<br>  We therefore reject affirmative action, which is based on the premise that some sections of the population must be denied access to higher education, and simply argues that this deprivation should be rationed out differently than at present. Excluding some white youth from a college, in order to include more minority youth, has nothing to do with “fairness.” One might as well argue for an election law depriving a certain percentage of whites of the right to vote in order to offset the lower participation rate among minorities, due to poverty, illiteracy, inability to get time off work, lack of transportation or outright discrimination.<br>  Affirmative action not only fails to overcome the problem of racism, its discriminatory character inevitably exacerbates racial divisions and pits white and minority workers and youth against each other in the struggle for a completely inadequate number of jobs or educational opportunities.<br>  This can only play into the hands of the right wing, which seeks to forestall a movement from below by fomenting racism and promoting a reactionary, anti-democratic agenda among confused layers of white workers and middle class people. Right-wing demagogy about the “special privileges” supposedly provided to minorities has played an important role over the past quarter century in masking the staggering growth of economic inequality and disarming popular opposition to the enormous privileges enjoyed by a tiny and unbelievably wealthy elite.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	Pros, Non<br>  <br>  Cons, it took people that were actually qualified for the job and gave it to people that were the color of the day.<br>  <br>  The blacks talk about equality but want to push others out. <br>  <br>  If they think they have it so bad, let them pack up and go back to Africa, after all they do call themselves African Americans.

Everything should be based upon merit - regardless of race.|`|1ca97aeb1adb840d4eb477bdf71f8911aa	There are no pros.<br>  <br>  It is based on race which is exactly the opposite reason for the civil rights act.<br>  <br>  "Based on the content of their character not the color of their skin."

arAjR7cjaa	It looks very similar and may well have been but copyright law doesn't always protect the originator of an idea.  Unless you've got proof or some kind of circumstancial evidence that the logo idea has been stolen then there's not much potential for a case in the courtroom.

People are starting to realize that he is illequipped to be President; he is really floundering; and those speeches will soon be ringing on deaf ears...Fiscal discipline?...LOL Mr. Obama, I say practice what you are preaching."  Where is the fiscal discipline in government?  Did you hear that a NY Times Reporter asked him a question on AFI?  "Mr. President are you are Socialist?"  He did not answer..he fluffed off the reporter, but later after his speechwriter gave the puppet some words to put in his mouth, he called back the reporter and made some kind of rediculous statement denying he is a Socialist glibbly...So you will know that reporter won't be on AFI anymore...He is not well informed; he never ran a state; and his fiscal irresponsibility shows that; he voted Present in the State Legislature in Illinois; so people would not know his true ideals; but if people had read his two books, you would have a keen incite into what makes this man tick and its not pretty...It is full of Marxist retoric; it is full of ideals that are totally the opposite of what our ideals are all about, but yet with all that; they elected this guy..and I know why..They were voting more against Bush than for Obama....No one knows anything about this man..he is an enigma, a mystery; a man with no history; as it is locked up for no one to analyze...So the American people voted for a mystery man and boy does it show now...He is out of his league big time...He is floundering; and the people he has surrounding him are totally inept; totally ineffective and that is why we are going down the tubes fast.|`|pi5WKPNwaa	I think that the liberal media is starting to wake-up, and the honey moon is over for sure.  The problem is that this white house attacks anyone that dears to question the almighty Obama.  I think that there are a number of honest hard working reports that are not specking out because they do not want to be castrated by the admonition or the rest of the Obama AP press. The press is intended to be a 4th branch of the government letting the people know when they are being wronged.  I think we have all been wronged and the Statue of Liberty has been down right RAPED.  When the press dose finial get a clue and stands up for us, it maybe to late.|`|PwQn0Oixaa	I looked all over Newsweek's site and could not find that article.

Obama, Bush, Clinton, and Bush Sr.  They all made promises they never kept or broke.  They all made campaign pledges that never came out.  It's unfortunate our leaders try to woo us to much but yet never come through.<br>  <br>  Again, as I keep saying to death, people are judging the President based on FIFTY DAYS OF HIS TERM!  The Bushes and Clinton were judged on the 4 and 8 year terms they had.  It's astounding people are expecting so much out of him in such a short period of time.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying people shouldn't criticize Obama, but I am saying to think he's going to make miracles happen in a month or two is absurd.  I'd rather have the bigger criticisms when he's hit January 15, 2010.  See where he is in a year.|`|fXeqf3btaa	I sure hope so...the Media has been so biased its disgusting...maybe people who just watch main stream media will finally start to see why some are so upset about Obama, his administration and his policies!|`|JV75Iz3eaa	Great, all of the idiots who drank the Flavor Ade are coming out of the woodwork to wail and moan.

They've invested too much in this guy. So much so that they can't spin their way out of it and come out looking anything but foolish. So they will continue to prop him up, spin his mistakes and redirect the attention of the American people. <br>  <br>  I was reading an article the other day that compared Bush to Obama in his relationship to the press. Bush responded to the press, Obama manages the press. Bush answered questions, Obama tells the press what to say. And the press lauds him for it as being so 'open'. Heck, he's doing their job for them and they're more than happy to let him. They're even parroting back his bogus claims such as 'Every 30 seconds in this country a family goes bankrupt due to a medical crisis." He's never had to back up this bogus claim and the press has taken to repeating it. Say something enough.....|`|spuz7DvNaa	They sure are.

I would have liked, to but I don't have a week to sit around and analyze it. Here is some common sense for you. The country is in shambles, there are many uneducated people out there, and controversy sells. People are pissed and want someone to be pissed at. Obama is in a position he can not fix in 1 year or probably not even in 4 years. That gives plenty of people the opportunity to publish and others to read all the crap that we know will be directed at our president no matter who he is or what he does. And since people love controversy so much they will believe it. Consider this before you believe everything you hear.

The arrogant captain (Bush) ignoring the iceberg warnings while racing across the Atlantic When they realized there was an iceberg in their path, he tried to turn, he tried to reverse, but he couldn't stop the ship on a dime, and he hit the iceberg anyway. As Captain Bush watched the water press up against the glass of the bridge, crewman Obama enters. Captain Bush places the captains hat on Obama's head, and says "The captain goes down with the ship" and runs for a lifeboat. That's why it's Bush's fault. He hit the iceberg.|`|PwQn0Oixaa	The DJIA was 14,164 as of October 9, 2007.  It's been falling ever since.  It was 8,212 on Inauguration Day.  Who do we blame then up til then?<br>  <br>  The only part I see as Obama's fault in this is that he's coming out with radical policies that more or less damage the status quo that was enjoyed over the Bush Administration.  People with money are worried, scared, or put off...so they're getting out of the US market and finding any tax shelters they can.<br>  <br>  So this leads to the argument if Obama should stop worrying about the middle and lower income classes and focus all the benefits of life on the rich, thinking they'll trickle the wealth down to the middle and lower classes via jobs and such.<br>  <br>  The other factor is that the economy was heading downhill in the Bush Administration and then went into the red when Obama started office.  We can say this is fear from the rich on his policies, or Bush policies taking the country into the red, or even blame both parties in Congress over the years.<br>  <br>  Interesting fact, on September 30, 2002 the DJIA was 7,528.  Not as bad as 6,600, but still shows that neither side is a guaranteed high DJIA.<br>  <br>  I also like to think that it's not just Bush or Obama that can be blamed here and there, but the Congress, and the business community itself.  They took advantage of the free market and traded in things that they shouldn't be.  Add to that the people who maxed out credit cards, took on mortgages they couldn't afford, and then filed for bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's totally Bush's fault, but I also don't think this is totally Obama's fault.  It's everyone's fault in some way, shape, or form.  We led our economy away from brick and mortar and mostly went for get-rich-quick bubbles which all burst...and now we have a mess to deal with.<br>  <br>  The argument is still going back and forth on how one can make businesses invest and work in the US.  How can they get them to open up jobs, factories, offices, etc...and not ship them out.  How can we get this happening without having to burden all income classes with more taxes and without having to repeal things like minimum wage and other labor protection laws.<br>  <br>  I've heard "tax cuts only" as the answer, but I certainly haven't seen any benefit from it compared to those at the top.  I don't know if investing US dollars less in war machines and more in interior is the answer, but we tried it one way and got into a mess.  Now we have to try other avenues, even if they aren't popular to the few who got successful from the old ways.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Uhm, not sure what rock you were under these past two years but the market was at 14400 in November of 2007...a WHOLE YEAR before the election...so, how is it NOT Bush's fault?

There's even preacher who believes this, if you can imagine that.<br>   <br>  Some people are gullible and look for ways to "rationalize" their fears. They also don't question anything, including stupid emails that are total fiction.|`|b22d8ccedb447bfcc30483c3590f81f3aa	Many of his supporters are indeed anti-Christ.

But anyone has the potential for evil.|`|1TSWsQtlaa	Well in reality the Anti-Christ would be able to deceive everyone and make us think he was good and a benefactor while really unleashing evil.<br>  With this in mind I would say Einstein is a better choice for ant-christ.He was loved thought to be a pacifist and yet gave us the theory of relativity opening the door for everything from the bomb to nuke reactors and everything destructive in the modern day.|`|1fDj2bJ9aa	For the same reason there were those that were believing there was actually witches in Salem, those people were unbalanced. Not much as changed just the hemlines of their skirts and the lapel of their coats.

EzrciMgXaa	you have a point BUT liberalism has its drawbacks or else we'd be living in a Utopian society, anyways i think being a Constitutional Republican is best for the USA|`|lEaT5q06aa	as best as i can tell<br>  american liberals <br>  have an innate need to control other people<br>  and be paid a good living to do it|`|bXn6WGaXaa	Wow. That was well thought out and well written. Good job.<br>  <br>  Christ may done a lot of the same things liberals say they want to do, but he was pretty conservative when it came to his faith. I don't think he would look too kindly upon things like abortion and gay marriage. He would have forgiven them, but they are still sins. Herod was the government administrator, and wanted government control of everything. That's a liberal idea if I ever heard one.<br>  <br>  America was built by dissenters, but having a dissenting opinion does not make one liberal. Again, they were tired of sending their money overseas to a huge central government. Huge central government is a cornerstone belief of liberals in this country. Huge central government gives me the willies.<br>  <br>  I find it interesting that being liberal is equated with being a nice guy or interested in the welfare of the less fortunate. Conservatives regularly make more charitable donations than liberals. You name Christ, Martin Luther King, and Mandela as liberals, but you forgot a few lefties. How about Lenin, Stalin, Kruschev, Castro, Idi Amin, Pol Pot, Mao Tse Tung, Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales, and Hitler (remember, national socialist party)? How about liberal "feel good" guy Barack Obama donating $950,000 to Raila Odinga, wannabe Kenyan dictator? How about the mess Kennedy made in Southeast Asia? "Hey hey LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?" Remember that?|`|GvBtoKsqaa	You miss out on the group-think that cons engage in. You don't get the chord to plug into your brain whilst Rush subliminally tells you what to think on every single topic.|`|t6UkxbBNaa	You're kookoo!!!<br>  Jesus didn't sign a bill saying that abortion is legal.<br>  Jesus didn't spend money on foolish things.|`|qt9rrk6xaa	Nothing.|`|VK0brk89aa	I can spell CROCK when I see it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Crock|`|3UTlASavaa	Recycling questions from four years ago is really pretty lame.  Bush and Cheney no longer matter.  Conservatives believe in the same things that liberals believe in they just disagree about whether the government should be involved in forcing people to support those issues through taxes and governmental programs.|`|a92cce07a2845569186ec10ae10457cbaa	Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior.  That's when you know you're a conservative.<br>  <br>  Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior. That's when you know you're a liberal.|`|xnB0NVsbaa	Trying to use Christ as a foundation for liberalism is a little off base. Christ did not support the murder of unborn children.|`|4AxBMYpUaa	nothing, but conservative a$$wipes can't seem to grasp that.|`|a6k5WZxGaa	nothing|`|B07sKfdvaa	Ummmm....Jesus is God and knows the hearts of man...liberals want to be God and are a bunch of men without hearts|`|bQpIctgPaa	Most of what they do is destructive to the fabric of our great country.  There's nothing right about that!  Enough said!|`|H1If1jSNaa	Ok I will not address your entire question... I could barely read it and not puke. America was founded by a bunch of white, rich, slave owners. I think they signed the Declaration of Independence. A republican freed the slaves also. America was based upon a document called The Articles of Confederation also. The Constitution was kind-of a quiet coup that changed the make-up of the country centralizing power around a Federal Gov. Democrates rape Social Security when they are in power. If it were in a private fund with your name on it that you chose, you could get your money when you retire. As it stands none of us will get any money (It is part of the General Fund). Liberals are a tax & spend party. They consider "the rich" anyone that works hard and dosn't need assistance. Their voter base is illegal aliens and welfare drawers. Too much typing for 2 points. Have fun helping Obammy ruin our country!|`|ys6ZHLceaa	you don't have to justify it for me.  there is NOTHING wrong with being a liberal or a conservative.  <br>  <br>  what's wrong is blaming the other, pointing your finger and shunning those with different views.|`|8nxlkMDzaa	nothing at all, as long as your not a democrat, cause if your a democrat and you call yourself a liberal you are a moron.|`|t3NEdrjqaa	its a mental disorder of course....u sound like a robot..so far the king has failed to stimulate anything but the further decline of the markets and more negativity.|`|Lw1hCjH6aa	liberals are not saints Polosi,Obama Reid Kennedy on and on they filthy rich pompous people are so far from God that I will have to pray for your lost soul to compare these Vile people to Jesus Christ|`|rxQt7auLaa	Christ did not have to pay for the food he provided the hungry.  He miracle'd it.<br>  <br>  If Obama can start miracling some jobs without taking money from me, then maybe I will change my opinion.|`|KMeUXNq3aa	Jesus fed the hungry. He didn't steal it from the successful to give to deadbeats though.|`|7HdgMaOnaa	Without even reading your rant I can tell you are smoking crack so put it down|`|D9AUzmZRaa	Nothing, of course. It's the only sane choice.|`|0hncNSXlaa	first off all the bush bashing is a little late second there is nothing wrong with being liberal third however is that is is unfair to call everybody who ever did bad a republican as i recall back in the 1860's the "liberal south" was still very much for slavery which is why the dem party was split and allowed for a republican you may have heard about named Abe Lincoln to become president and eventually end legal slavery in the US now calling pharoh a republican or conservative is also incorrect because he was a monarch same with king george and to bring jesus into this argument is just striaght garbage yes he helped people but that does not automaticly make him liberal because im sure he still believed in abstenence and monogamy and i highly doubt he was or would be pro abortion and again herold was a monarch i mean your practically saying hitler was conservative but then again he was all for helping feed germans and such because it made him popular so was he a liberal or how bout drug dealers selling to children are they conservativs too nope they want more liberal drug laws so please get off your liberal high horse and open your eyes neither liberal or conservative is solelly correct and you are right about the declaration of independence right to life liberety and PURSUIT OF HAPPINES not gaurenteed happiness but the pursuit meaning it is not the governments job to make you happy just that it must allow you to seek happiness<br>  <br>  <br>  oh almost forgot my jefferson quote  <br>   A government big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have.         <br>  <br>  Thomas Jefferson|`|Gx1ewGOFaa	Ah'll tell ya what's wrong with being a dirty commie lefty-liberal, boy!<br>  <br>  Believing in freedom, equality for all, believing that the poor don't deserve to be poor and the rich should help them. Believing that everyone is entitled to education and healthcare. Believing that people's personal lives should be personal, and that we should be trusted to make our own decisions. Appreciating that we live in a multi-faith world, and that religion should not come into politics. Believing that people are inherently good, and abandoning a selfish, Hobbesian belief system.<br>  <br>  Disgusting ideology, isn't it? 8-)|`|adqaTo9xaa	OK!<br>  Jesus was not a liberal! or conservative! to base his life and make this distinction is intellectually dishonest.<br>   Jesus gave to the poor privately. he did not use the government system for redistribution of wealth or food. he preached against the elitist systems. he did not push for beaurocratic systems of social management but on the grass root and personal level! <br>  <br>  you spent a lot of time trying to justify the elite beauracratic system of slavery. to bad your first example shows your misdirection!<br>  <br>  Socialism has always enslaved mankind!

HeoS75kGaa	I'm in favor of stem cell research, and I'm against the death penalty.  <br>  <br>  Still, their argument is that the death penalty is only applicable to those who have actively done something to warrant it.  In other words, someone had to commit a crime bad enough, and get convicted, to get the death penalty.<br>  <br>  To kill embryos is the taking of life from a potential person who did nothing to warrant being killed.  Whether or not I agree is not the issue.  You asked for the logic, and there it is.|`|73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	Interesting question - you also see the opposite question quite a bit on Y!A - "How can people be pro-choice but anti-death penalty?"<br>  <br>  But if you think about it, it is only hypocritical if you are pro-life and pro-death penalty, NOT the other way around.<br>  <br>  Here is why:<br>  <br>  Because the abortion issue generally comes down to where one BELIEVES that life begins, pro-choicers do not believe that abortion involves killing (whether you think that notion is correct is a separate matter).  However, most pro-life/pro-death penalty people believe that abortion involves killing an innocent person, while the death penalty involves killing only people who “deserve it.”<br>  <br>  The notion of whether anyone “deserves” to be killed is one worthy of debate, but for the sake of argument, let’s say that some do deserve it.  <br>  <br>  The hypocrisy comes into play when you introduce the very real and ongoing problem of wrongful convictions.  In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.<br>  <br>  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  Therefore, if you say you are against killing innocent human beings, you must necessarily be against the death penalty, or else you are a hypocrite.|`|AA10447191	Yes you are missing the fact stem cell research is possible by the death of infants.<br>  <br>  The death penalty is involved in adults committing terrible crimes.|`|ljRE5MeAaa	How about a compromise?

uvWH4Ioyaa	Assuming your parents owned the property as joint tenants and not tenants in common, then you will need to go through the probate court to effectively transfer legal title to yourself. But did your mother have a Last Will where she left everything to you?  If she had not Last Will, are you her only child? Even if you are the sole heir or legatee, you will still need to go through the probate process which is intended to insure that all your mother's debts are paid including her funeral bill, medical and hospital bills, any pending utility or real estate tax bills, etc. Her estate is also liable for costs of estate administration in the event you retain an attorney to help out.  It would be a good idea for you to pay to consult with a local attorney if only to get an understanding of the local probate procedure.|`|xxmTTNdTaa	Wow, that is a tough question.

cMHxg372aa	I'm a small business owner, and I have no problem with paying taxes. Of course, any actual small business owner - at least those who are successful - realizes full well that growth is driven on the top line, not the bottom. When my customers are doing well, I do well. When my customers are hurting, so am I.<br>  <br>  What I do have a problem with is the UPWARDS redistribution of wealth that the tax code facilitates. All-in-all, I pay about 30% of my income to the IRS, whilst Warren Buffett pays 17% - something is seriously screwed up there.<br>  <br>  Provided that the wealthy are made to pay their fair share as well, I would have no problem paying a bit more in tax if the additional revenue is necessary for the long-run prosperity of the country. There's another trait of all successful business owners - a long term perspective.|`|AA10079277	Classic.  Who cares, it is their money!!<br>  <br>  Some owners will keep it, others will want to make more, so they will invest it in the business and grow the business, thus hiring more people.<br>  <br>  Personally I like to give to charities as I believe they get more money to those in need than government -  which is horribly inefficient.<br>  <br>  I hope you know that you are not limited to the amount of taxes you owe.  You are welcome to send in more in order help those in need.  How much extra did you send in last year?|`|f7a27dc3bf1ef3fa5b6d27e18088be8eaa	D... however that's part of the Idea of working for yourself... so one can make more money...... and A if the employees are exceptional....<br>  <br>  Why bother even having or owning a small business if you can make more money working for the Big Company and have weekends and holidays off.....<br>  When you work for yourself any day off you take is an unpaid day.... then you have to fork over high premiums for healh insurance....... <br>  Remember small business might employ two or three people..... that's two or three people out of work for everyone that feels why bother.....<br>  could easy add up nation wide to thousand and hundred of thousands of jobs....|`|C7CaNLGlaa	It is typical of the Liberals to declare war on the productive.  If you've made something of yourself, even if you're at the bottom of the payscale, you must still support those who are too lazy to do anything for themselves.  You are the evil ones, you must pay, and pay, and pay, and pay, and pay, and pay.  Taxes, taxes, more taxes, regulations, legal matters, bills, fees, etc.  <br>  <br>  Obama:  "I don't unnerstand.  I've opened the floodgates to illegal immigrants so they can continue their drug wars here and I've levied a 50% tax and a  30% carbon tax on all businesses.  Why did they all decide to close up shop?<br>  <br>  Oh well, yes I can!"|`|zNB3tZXraa	All of the above. An economic environment where small and mid size business can flourish and expand will provide more jobs, with higher wages( if they don't get choked to death by the unions) increased worker benefits, and more money to re-invest in the business.

There is an organisation here called 'Common Purpose' whose members have infiltrated Councils & Constabularies across the country as well as the BBC.<br>  <br>  "Common Purpose is rather more than a Charity ‘empowering' people and communities’. In fact, CP is an elitest pro-EU political organisation helping to replace democracy in UK, and worldwide, with CP chosen ‘elite’ leaders.

Unless you've got something to hide, you should be thankful for these things.<br>  <br>  One of my friends got mugged and raped, but her attacker was convicted because of CCTV footage. People in the UK are very quick to judge and complain about all the awful things 'the Government' are doing.<br>  <br>  Like when the price of oil went up - that was Gordon Brown's fault, surely?

XA69SIvnaa	There is no requirement for college credit hours when enlisting in the Army. Having college credit hours can get you rank in certain cases (i.e. 60 sem hours gets you E-3 PFC, bachelor's gets you E-4 SPC) but it is by no means a requirement to get into a certain MOS. The ASVAB (Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery) is the test that determines what jobs you qualify for in the Army. The big line score for the Army is the GT (general technical) score. <br>  <br>  Perhaps your bro wants more rank and doesn't want to go in at the lowest rank (E-1), or maybe he is a little scared - it is very normal, I think everyone has a mix of fear and excitement when joining up. I can assure you that 19D Cav Scouts do not need college credits to join up.|`|cdYE660baa	Either he's telling lies, scared of joining, or was disqaulified and afraid to say why. The easiest way to find out about the Cav Scout MOS, is call your local recruiter and ask them. They'll tell you. But I personally think he's lying. I'm leaving in May for basic and the only thing i was told that i needed to have college credit for( which i do) is for Special Forces.

I have been of that opinion for some months, and the only thing that can be done now is hope the fall isn't as far and the landing isn't as hard as it looks like it might be.  I'm not sure where some of the other comments are coming from about Buffett and the Obama  Administration, here's a quote from one article:  <br>  <br>  "Buffett said the nation’s leaders need to emphasize a consistent message, and they should support President Barack Obama’s efforts to repair the economy because fear is dominating Americans’ behavior."<br>  <br>  Here's a quote from another article:<br>  <br>  "Buffett also urged Democrats and Republicans in Washington to work better together, and to communicate bipartisan efforts to fix the economy to voters. "You can't expect people to unite behind you if you're trying to jam a whole bunch of things down their throat," he said."<br>  <br>  I'm really not seeing a blanket condemnation of one party or the other, e.g. blaming the Dems for jamming things down people's throats, the quote is pretty clear insofar as him urging the two political parties to work together.  I'm sure one concern he is addressing has got to be partly caused by the transition between administrations with one big supply side bailout followed by an even bigger demand side bailout with the opposition in each case hollering long and loud over them and playing the blame game.  I don't think the political infighting has done anything to bolster confidence...but things are awfully bad now and it is going to take a while yet before it hits bottom.  Regardless of what we do, the entire global economy is at very high risk.<br>  <br>  I also share Buffett's concern over inflation.|`|AA10928202	Read some history.

By committing to a political solution the IRA have given the nationalist population that option and given the population as  a whole the option to have devolved democratic system by which to freely choose their political direction. <br>  But then most people in Ulster don't sympathise with the Republican movement, hence they have freely chosen not to pursue that direction; a choice that in the current "Reykjavik on Liffey" climate they might well be glad of.|`|a18866a5fa9b1011516eec55c6df35e4aa	The IRA are callous murderer's, who no longer militarily operate.

If she is say 16 or so, the Courts will also pay a lot of attention to what she wants.<br>  <br>  So in the sad event that should happen she (or the nominated guardians) should hire a lawyer immediately and go to court asking the court to appoint that  guardian for her. I think the odds are very good that the court would do it if the guardians are willing, given her age, her father's nomination of a guardian, her desires, and her reasons. <br>  <br>  I do think the father should talk to an attorney who can help him draft his will and that attorney can also advise on this point.

R5u7IEUoaa	Paul is a true fiscal conservative.|`|33ThRhRhaa	He would be the BEST President the United States of America has seen perhaps in the last century. This is a brief overview of who and what Congressman Ron Paul is all about:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.house.gov/paul/bio.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.house.gov/paul/bio.shtml</a><br>  Congressman Ron Paul of Texas enjoys a national reputation as the premier advocate for liberty in politics today. Dr. Paul is the leading spokesman in Washington for limited constitutional government, low taxes, free markets, and a return to sound monetary policies based on commodity-backed currency. He is known among both his colleagues in Congress and his constituents for his consistent voting record in the House of Representatives: Dr. Paul never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution. In the words of former Treasury Secretary William Simon, Dr. Paul is the "one exception to the Gang of 535" on Capitol Hill.<br>  <br>  Ron Paul was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Gettysburg College and the Duke University School of Medicine, before proudly serving as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force during the 1960s. He and his wife Carol moved to Texas in 1968, where he began his medical practice in Brazoria County. As a specialist in obstetrics/gynecology, Dr. Paul has delivered more than 4,000 babies! He and Carol, who reside in Lake Jackson, Texas, are the proud parents of five children and have seventeen grandchildren. <br>  <br>  While serving in Congress during the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dr. Paul's limited-government ideals were not popular in Washington. He served on the House Banking committee, where he was a strong advocate for sound monetary policy and an outspoken critic of the Federal Reserve's inflationary measures. He also was a key member of the Gold Commission, advocating a return to a gold standard for our currency. He was an unwavering advocate of pro-life and pro-family values. Dr. Paul consistently voted to lower or abolish federal taxes, spending, and regulation, and used his House seat to actively promote the return of government to its proper constitutional levels. In 1984, he voluntarily relinquished his House seat and returned to his medical practice.<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul returned to Congress in 1997 to represent the 14th Congressional district of Texas. He serves on the House Financial Services Committee, the International Relations committee, and the Joint Economic Committee. On the Financial Services Committee, Rep. Paul serves as the vice-chairman of the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee. He continues to advocate a dramatic reduction in the size of the federal government and a return to constitutional principles.<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul is the author of several books, including Challenge to Liberty; The Case for Gold; and A Republic, If You Can Keep It. He has been a distinguished counselor to the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and is widely quoted by scholars and writers in the fields of monetary policy, banking, and political economy. He has received many awards and honors during his career in Congress, from organizations such as the National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, the Council for a Competitive Economy, Young Americans for Freedom, and countless others.<br>  <br>  Dr. Paul's consistent voting record prompted one Congressman to comment that "Ron Paul personifies the Founding Fathers' ideal of the citizen-statesman.

Updg7xbqaa	Yes, the ASVAB score most people see as the AFQT is a percentile rating. If you get a 50, it means you scored above 50% of the people who took the test at a certain time. Then there are the line scores, that does break down by category to generate those other scores to see what you are qualified to do. Your best bet is to get any of the available ASVAB study guides from your local book store or library and work on those areas you are weak in.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind it isn't an exam that you're passing, but an exam evaluating your skills. I tutor math for my local education center for folks that are taking an asvab score improvement class so they can put in warrant officer packets. It really just takes practice and understanding what the reasoning questions are asking, and then carrying out the math which most times is usually very simple, but easy to mess up if you don't know what operations you should be doing on the numbers.

(and if it does get shown to kids at school, the parents have to sign waivers... at least at my school we did)<br>  <br>  at least someone is taking the initiative when parents won't or the teens are just too embarrassed to talk to the parent.  i think its better to have it matter of factually stated, in a fun and interesting way than having them learn their sex ed from friends, Myspace or Maury Povich.<br>  <br>  I think this is great!<br>  <br>  PS- i also think its great to present different sexual situations to teens... doesn't mean they'll become obsessed with "golden showers" (i mean, who cares if they do tho...) but at least they'll be comfortable, or at least knowledgeable of what's out there.  knowledge is power, right?  besides, we all have fetishes.|`|UkaKZDR6aa	For high schoolers it's probably okay.

968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	If it was say, another Falklands, they would redirect resources from elsewhere, there are always battle groups on exercise in Canada for example so this would be cut and troops redeployed.<br>  Given the UK's recent experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan any country would be stupid to tackle us with seasoned troops on strength, look at how we did in 1982 when we just had troops with Northern Ireland experience.|`|aFWJ47Qwaa	I think it depends on what kind of war we were fighting. The army is stretched and even making cuts in equipment as was in the news lately so if this was another Iraq war which involved guerrilla warfare tactics we could cope but only just. If however it was a united country that attacked us I think the fact that we are a nuclear power is threat enough.|`|f36531cfc5056db27dde00a32fcfe48baa	Of course the UK can.  When I was in the army I had the chance to train with some UK soldiers and they were as badass or more than I was.  The US will always be there for the UK, they are our strongest ally.  Don't count of France!  they either ignore your need for help or surrender.|`|etXYn0sCaa	Depends on the scale of the war. We dont have huge standing army anymore, but it would be a waste of resources to have one, our ties to the rest of the EU, the US and the UN mean that it is difficult to prosecute a war on our own, and unnecessary|`|JhC6BvPpaa	With all due respect to other answerers.....<br>  Although I wish we could, and I would hope the UK is strong enough to do this, I would be very surprised indeed if we could now mount another 'Falklands style' campaigne 'USING MOSTLY OUR OWN RESOURCES' like we did back then. Plus we have far fewer ships and far fewer troops now. We would need massive amounts of help from other countries to use their airfields and shipping. Plus, the Govt is bankrupt, and I doubt that it could afford to start firing smart weapons at ￡1 million a time.<br>  <br>  However, we now station a defence force in the Falklands. Cannot be too sure about the figures due to changing times, but I think around 500 men, 4 Tornados and 2 Sea Kings and undisclosed numbers of RN ships (maybe 2 destroyers and a frigate). There is also a large runway that large troop carrying planes can land on now, so it's relatively easy to reinforce.<br>  <br>  Back in '82, we had HMS Endurance with only 79 Royal Marines on it which made it very easy for Argentina to invade.

HeoS75kGaa	Agreed.  File a complaint with the department.  Even if nothing happens as far as you know, it's still in the cop's record.  Enough of those, and he gets canned.  They may make excuses, they may cover it up, but a complaint is public record, and there's no hiding it.  Enough excuses or cover ups, and eventually somebody important is going to want to know WHY.<br>  <br>  The only time a cop is going to rifle my pockets is when he's announced that I'm being detained for a reason and it's a patdown, not just because he thinks I look suspicious and he wants to see what I have.|`|eVt0qkT8aa	Yes, that is illegal. He had just stereotyped you by saying you looked suspicious. You should definitely report him.|`|3oNcHdgCaa	The way you described it, it was likely an illegal search. The problem is since you *were* carrying illegal drugs, it's going to be impossible to file a complaint against him without getting charged with possession. It's probably best to just let this one slide, and if next time he messes with you when you and your friend aren't doing anything illegal and he has no reason to believe you've done anything illegal, go file a written complaint at his precinct and ask to speak to his supervisor.|`|xxmTTNdTaa	That cop sounds like a jerk!!!

Cops can get away with a lot of illegal acts, (well unless they are committed against people in California and caught on Video) but as a general rule they need "Reasonable Cause" to detain you. with a name like Jose, I will guess you are latin. In many states that is a cause for racial profiling which is illegal under most circumstances. In your case he ended up being justified as when you say Green I am guessing you mean Marijuana, which is illegal. But they will always find something, perhaps break a taillight and claim they stopped you for a vehicle violation. My advise is, ask politely what you did wrong, when they start a search, ask if you are under arrest, if so what for? If you happen to be in a high crime area, or maybe they saw you leave a known drug dealers place, they may be justified in their fishing expedition. Best advise is to talk to an attorney! If they only confiscated the Marijuana, I believe the best response is say "Thank you Officer"|`|18d1a84d04c48581a1a7239ab70c2743aa	1- that is not the true/whole story<br>  2- go ahead and report it stoner...that will get real far<br>  3- again, i doubt this is how it went down<br>  <br>  but if it was a true story...that was an illegal search and seizure...you could file a complaint and you would NOT be charged. but it would make your life a harder to have more cops on are butt.  <br>  <br>  you would not be charged b/c it was an illegal search and the officer probably didnt put the weed into evidence.<br>  <br>  still dont believe the story, i dont know any cops like that|`|18d9aa70c53578f18caa307002ccab93aa	No that was not legal.

Americans want to decide for themselves what org. to donate to, even the "filthy" rich should have the right to make that decision. we would not look like a third world country, we used to be looked at by foreign nations as the most generous people alive, foreign leaders were once amazed at how many welfare type organizations thrived in America that were completely voluntary. if the gov. decides they will take care of it for us, why would people continue to donate/contribute to other organizations? they wont because the gov is doing it for them. and im sure you cannot deny that a private org. runs more efficiently and effectively than a gov. program.|`|adqaTo9xaa	Better!<br>  <br>  I was homeless for a year and I got no help from the Gov. but I was fed twice a day by the local church and was givin shelters and clothing when needed. the problem with society is not the people. people will do the right thing. the problem is the government like those communist examples you gave.<br>  <br>  what more do you need to get the clue! the federal government is the problem  along with those clowns in congress that use the presedency as a sock puppet to confuse the people!|`|4xN3ZIhYaa	your question summarizes the problem, you immediately look to government to babysit you.<br>  <br>  my mother raised four kids without any government aid and i work my *** off and go to school at night.  i do it all so at the end of the day i can hold my head high and say i take care of me and mine and don't wait by the mailbox for federal aid like a leech.<br>  <br>  you have a quitters attitude from the start so you wont succeed|`|KMeUXNq3aa	Deadbeats would have to eventually man up and go to work, or become extinct.<br>  <br>  Easter bunny:There are probably 10 times that many gang members today on Manhattan.

KDOIKIq2aa	Physical shape needs to be good, high school athlete.  <br>  <br>  ROTC not only teaches you military history, equipment, tactics, and strategy it also teaches to to lead.  On completion your given a commission as a 2nd lieutenant.  <br>  <br>  A regular day could start with PT, if your on scholarship or belong to one of the other groups that want you to take PT.  Then it's off to class like any other college student.  Some time during the week there will be an hour long military science class you'll need to attend.  During the week you'll also have a two hour lab and meet as a unit with your other cadets and go through military training like tac lanes, rappelling, or first aid etc.  Then once a semester you will need to go on a FTX more real world military training.  Our Battalion had a second FTX each semester for Ranger cadets and others willing to take on the OPFOR role.  Most of the time your just another college student.|`|H0iYP25Taa	1. There is no preliminary physical shape to be in. Training will be provided to get you in shape and there will be some summrs you will be attending boot camp.<br>  <br>  2. ROTC is a great experience because once you do four years of ROTC, once you graduate and go in the service you will automatically become an officer (and that depends on what branch of the military you are enlisting).<br>  <br>  3. I don't understand what you are asking here. But it varies upon the school and the branch. <br>  <br>  ROTC is a great experience. I have friends in ROTC and they like it. Of course the pay your tuition FULL and you serve only four years afterwards as an officer. Good Luck!!|`|LzS9c228aa	Well, if you want to get a good score on the physical test, then you should be in shape to do, 1.5 miles in less than 13.30 minutes, 50 push ups in less than 1 minute and 60 sit ups in than 1 minute. I'm enrolling in college right now, but my brother is an Officer at the detachment of Embry Riddle and his doing his master right now.  <br>  <br>  ROTC and Enlistment are two different things, ROTC is more a program to help you become an Officer when you graduate, It's the biggest program in the country that make Officers. Now on those 4 years as a cadet you are not a soldier, it's more a program of the military branch that you chose than a part of it, and not always pay your entire tuition, you need to have a very good GPA. Now the pros are that you will have a lot more of chance to become an officer than trying to go to OTS ( Officer Training School )  by yourself after you graduate, just like 270 go to OTS at the time, so is a really big competition. <br>  When you enlist you sign to be a Soldier, you will have deployments, a lot, depends on what career you chose, if you get in as Security Force,for example, you will deploy every 6 months and will be home for 6 months, so you might not get all the time you need to study, a lot of people do it, but it's really hard, I a have a friend in the Air Force Security Forces and he is always telling me how hard it is to study on the internet. Now the pros, you will get pay depends on how many  years you sign or if you have an AA, if you sign 3 years you will get in as a E-1 that will be around 1500 a month, you will get an apartment on the base, they might pay your tuition and you can get good loans. Now if you sign for 5 years the only thing that changes is how much you get pay that's around 1800 a month. Enlistment is more hand on training than ROTC, you will be training all the time, you will be on service all the time, deployments all the time, now one of the bad things about being enlisted, it's that to become an officer will be really hard, you will have a lot of competition, they pick only the best ones and you have to get a bachelor degree that you might not get it in 5 years of service as an enlisted soldier. <br>  <br>  I don't know if is the same on all the detachments, but, you have to go 3 times a week to ROTC, 2 days of training that are based on running, doing push ups, pull ups, sit ups, things to keep you in shape, and 1 day you have to go with uniform to take classes about the military branch that you chose. It's really nice, I'm dying to go to school and that's one of the things why i want to go, of course i will be an USAF security Force Officer when i graduate, so think about, i hope this information can help you, of course keep asking people that know more than me about this, that way you get the best answer. Wish you the best.<br>  Im Sorry is a little bit long hehehehe, i love to talk about this.|`|K8qAniReaa	1) If you plan on taking the scholarship you must be in good enough shape to join the military.<br>  <br>  2) Yes.  When you graduate ROTC you will be a commissioned officer.  Commissioned Officers get more pay and better treatment than enlisted.<br>  <br>  3) Depends on the day and the detachment.  Talk to your school's ROTC detachment.  They can give you a good idea of what life is like for them.

They knew that the American people's demands in the wake of such an attack would perfectly dovetail with their agenda, and their well documented coddling of terrorists (FBI taken off terrorism cases, etc.) led directly to such an event. That being said, I don't know if Obama is a threat to pull off the same thing. I don't know who he is hugging and setting free, so I'm not sure where you are coming from.

The CIA and FBI knew full well his role in Marilyn Monroe's "suicide", just like the role RFK and Peter Lawford to a lesser (damage control) extent played. It was decided that he had to go, and LBJ was basically sitting by the phone that day waiting for the call.<br>  <br>  As for the present incompetent administration, we're headed for a National Referendum a lot sooner than later, so that capable leaders like Gingrich and Buchanan can step forward and put us in the RIGHT direction.|`|ggBfHk1waa	Yes, I believe so.

There were many reasons, but one of the top reasons is that his brother Bobby Kennedy turned on the Mafia and started prosecuting them when they had handed his brother Chicago in the Presidential election, so they were resentful and they did his brother in.  Their saying was:  "Cut off the head, the tail dies."  The tail was RFK...so when the tail didn't die and  RFK was running for Pres.  they did him in too..Very sad isn't it?

This gave the U.S. Treasury the power "to issue silver certificates against any silver bullion, silver, or standard silver dollars in the Treasury." This meant that for every ounce of silver in the U.S. Treasury's vault, the government could introduce new money into circulation. This gave the U.S. government back its power to issue currency, while stripping the Federal Reserve's power to loan money to the government at interest.<br>  If enough of those silver certificates were to come into circulation they would have eliminated the demand for Federal Reserve notes. Executive Order No. 11110 is still valid<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe so, Maybe not, we shall never know...|`|d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	This is one of the wackier Kennedy Assassination theories.<br>  <br>  The theories point to Executive Order 11110 signed by Kennedy which delegated authority to the Treasury Secretary  to print silver certificates at will (ref: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_11110" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_o...</a> ). The theory goes that this would put the Federal Reserve out of business.<br>  <br>  One only needs to examanine the claims to realize how silly the theory is.<br>  <br>  <br>  - Given all the Fed duties and responsibilities, to claim that issuing silver certificates would nullify all the Fed duties is preposterous<br>  <br>  - Ever since it's inception, the Federal Reserve has worked with whatever the currency of the realm. Federal Reserve notes circulated along side silver certificates, gold certificates, and coins. From a day-to-day operations side, it really makes no difference. <br>  <br>  - History showed that the government was trying to get away from the silver standard. Silver prices were rising to the point where a silver dollar would have more than a dollars worth of silver. This executive order was seen as giving the Treasury Secretary more flexibility to do that.<br>  <br>  - There was not enough silver to replace all the currency in circulation with silver certificates.<br>  <br>  - Kennedy scholars have concluded it is a hoax.

It sounds harsh, but the reality is more times than not life is a vicious cycle, and those types of people only breed those same types of people.  I'm sure a small percentage of children who come from parents like that might grow up to be responsible adults, but chances are they won't.  So which is worse??

How about the people who performed illegal abortions on themselves and died as a result...now you have two fewer people who could potentially cure aids or be president.  I'd love to hear your stance on health care or poverty with respect to people who aren't ready to have children (aren't financially and/or emotionally ready/stable) but are forced by the "pro-life" agenda to have the child.

I can remember when I was on food stamps and on state medical assistance when I had my son. I got my degree in nursing and now am going for pharmaceutical work.

You get way more than I do in UI benefits thats for sure, I know I couldnt get medical in my state I got 89 to much from UI for that and I get under 50 a month in food stamps not much but it all helps right. Go into your office, bring birth cert, state id, rental agreement, statement from manager as the statement of someone who knows you. I had them write the statement on my copy of my rental agreement, bring the most recent bank statements, I took those and I printed the actual days that I applied for food stamps with me, they will tell you there is you can get emergency, then they will give you an appt for usually the next week to go in and the intake worker reviews all your paperwork and takes your statements and then lets you know whats going on. It takes up to a month to get your FS the first time but they do give you from the date of applicaiton, so the card will have fs on it as they tell you it will be. UI benefits are to go up a few bucks as on April 1st too, so you will have to submit a form of change of income once that starts, to make life easy, get extra forms when you apply so you can fax over new changes to your situation. Thank god, our tax returns are not considered part of our income so make sure you tell them how much of the income in your bank account is from your return, or simply pull that money out and then print your newest bank info from online and tell them about it if they ask.

KCtrnxmkaa	they are all different branches of the US military for a reason... they all have different jobs... Let me help you out.<br>  <br>  Marines- The badass on the ground fighting force. They are the first in and last out. They are the front lines dirty gritty devildogs. Known as the toughest branch of the military. Live off pride in being the best fighting force. Work on land sea and air. smallest branch of us military. most pride. Every Marine is a badass rifleman<br>  <br>  Army- the ground force of the us military. They have troops on the ground. bigger branch then the Marines. they have more firepower more weapons systems. Easy promotions. However, not everyone in the Army is really a fighter. You could be anything from a janitor to an office worker to a Ranger. Mostly land.<br>  <br>  Air Force- The gods form above. They are the computer geniuses of the   War. They have most of the Air power including bombers, stealth planes, fighters... They are more of desk workers. they have the best bases. most comfortable. They are not known for having gritty fighters however.<br>  <br>  Navy- In charge of the Ocean. They transport Marines, along with supplies and have intelligence. In the navy you could be anything from a Seal to a fighter pilot to a captain to a janitor. You will spend most of your time at sea in the ocean.<br>  <br>  None of the branches are better then the other. THey all have there own jobs... all there jobs are done to perfection making the US military in a whole the best military in the world. Find which branch is right for you|`|YdLPJuTkaa	None...  It depends on what you want.  If you want to be on the ground fighting marines or army.  If you want to have more of a desk job then the AF.  The navy is sort of your catch all except for infantry.  The navy has construction batallions on the ground, but again they have more of the technical jobs. That Dude laid them out in a pretty simple and to the point way.|`|j7enSIr5aa	I may take some flack for this:) dont mean to offend anyone:) anyway I used to live in the city with the biggest Navy base in North America and all the guys I met were drunks -- dont want to put down whole navy but it happened time after time-- <br>  I have two nephews that are marines and they are very respectful and determined-- and they may be drunks too but -- anyway thats my experience --|`|wufKLi6Haa	None are better than any other. It depends on what you want to do. Each branch has their "specialties". If you want to know more, go talk to recruiters. They will be able to give you the most up to date information about the jobs that are open  and what it will take to get there.|`|uIJLSoW5aa	Army...They have the most jobs to choose from, the biggest incentives, and show you everything in writing before you sign everything.|`|pYRZcfsJaa	there is no "better" branch.<br>  <br>  okay, the Navy is better in the ocean, the Air Force is better in the Air, the Army and Marines are best on land. <br>  <br>  I would suggest you think about what you want to do in the future, visit their web sites, once you've picked one go visit a recruiter, and it you don't like what they are telling you go to the next branch on your list.<br>  <br>  and don't listen to people who say their branch is better "just because"... they don't know what they are talking about.|`|O3Yx21WMaa	There all great -

AA10079277	Where you might cross the line is if you wear the uniform with the rank insignia on.  Even military cannot wear rank that they are not.  There are indeed laws for this type of thing.  Whether you paid for it or not is irrelevant.  Just the jacket alone,even with rank, is probably not a problem|`|nooi0ldjaa	when i was young i used to wear my uncles old jacket, but never would i throw ranks on there i did not earn. i even knew that when i was 7. that is dishonorable. <br>  <br>  nothing wrong with just wearing the jacket though.|`|bc31594d662102e5c53e9da54ca5195baa	It is not illegal. Specially since you don't wear a uniform but<br>  just the jacket. If someone mistakes you for a soldier when<br>  you just wear the jacket that's actually their problem. Not<br>  yours. The rank could sound edgy but it's really not as military<br>  ranks have no relevance for civilians. Is it dishonorable? Ah well.<br>  After the last years of flag in mud frenzy in every front yard it's<br>  kinda hard to piss me of with such crap.|`|rYNM67oyaa	If you wear the shirt with just the flag and and branch of service it won't be any problem. Don't wear a name tag and rank insignia. <br>  <br>  It wouldn't be dishonorable just disrespectful because you haven't earned any rank yet.|`|BD78ZzYkaa	It's wrong and Dishonors Vets,and as far as I am concerned Immoral. Wear the Jacket and nothing else. And I really don't believe people are mistaking a 16 year old for a Military Serviceman.|`|XA69SIvnaa	Yes you are impersonating a soldier and yes it is dishonorable.<br>  <br>  You did not earn the right to wear any rank since you've never held nor earned any rank. You did not earn the right to wear U.S. Army tape over your heart since you have never served in the Army. You did not earn the right to wear absolutely any unit insignia since you never served in any unit. I don't know if you are violating any law but you are making the Army look like a bunch of morons parading around in an ACU top without the pants/boots/beret (all of which you should not be wearing anyway)<br>  <br>  Cease wearing all of this and wait until you finish Basic Training, AIT, and get to a unit to wear all this stuff.|`|CTaKjwDTaa	there is a difference between you wearing a shirt with the US Army logo<br>  <br>  and you wearing a full fledged ACU with rank insignia.<br>  <br>  That is poser<br>  <br>  Btw what rank did you get? <br>  LOL i bet its probably like e-6. Some 16 year old walking around withe the rank of Staff Sergeant|`|k76mr7rKaa	I'm not sure about the legal aspect of it, but take the rank, branch of service and unit patch off. <br>  <br>  You may not be impersonating, but you will come across as a poser, and those are always irritating|`|xICWcWhnaa	jacket.yes, nametag yes..the rest ..you havent earned.

The new lasers have a beam width of less than 2 feet at 500 feet of distance, so all he needs is a small portion of your car to be visible. <br>  <br>  It is also possible he clocked the truck too, and another officer down the road flagged him down. Even if the truck was not stopped, claiming you were doing the same speed as another car is not a valid defense.<br>  <br>  I would not suggest you bring up the part about almost hitting the officer, it may work against you. The prosecutor could argue your vision was obstructed because you were following the truck too close, or they may think you were driving faster than you should have been.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	I would show up to court with that one.

Zm8sQpKLaa	It strictly depends on the verbiage in the lease, and what property was taken.<br>  <br>  Most leases have a clause that allows the landlord to seize certain items in lieu of owed rent. State law however defines WHAT property can and cannot be taken.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	What sort of property?
fDuCamMraa	Why don't we just open it up to selling other body parts? It's your body. How about auctioning off a kidney? You only need one. Or a cornea. You've got two of those too.

When the clone gets to the proper age and weight, do a frontal lobotomy then take what ever you need. It's not REALLY human.<br>  <br>  It isn't the embryo that really concerns me. It's where things will go from there.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Just to let you in on reality, we do it to other animals all the time.<br>  <br>  your problem is you still live in the dark ages viewing man as some divine creature.<br>  <br>  better question would be " what kind of world do we live in where unused embryos from fertilization clinics are steam cooked and destroyed rather than used to find cures."|`|Lw1hCjH6aa	It makes me sick to be honest I thought my father help defeat this type of Nazi supremacy in ww2....  look at the answers you are getting They do not see a life being destroyed  in the first place Look up late term abortion and you will see the most sickening form of abortion.....

If you need a organ and you don't want stem cell research, well SORRY. you don't get an organ. I'll take it for you if I need one. I don't want to hear you crying and playing guilt trips, "I'm dying and your not going to give me an organ and you have one right there". I don't want to hear it! Just go ahead and start digging that hole and jump in early.<br>  <br>  Ron Obvious- This bills aim will NOT killing anyone. Use your common sense in your brain. The doctors THROW OUT the cord blood. So where is someone being killed when you are SAVING that cord blood that gets THROWN OUT and now are doing something USEFUL WITH IT! If that doesn't make sense to you what the heck does?? <br>  Nobody goes to the abortion clinic with the idea of stem cell research in mind. They are already planning to destroy a baby, so it leagl, OK well let's make something positive out of it and use the cord blood to help people who are here live better lives. Umm, why not? Ohh you think you have a better idea in blocking this bill? Great idea. LOL! Whatever idiots.<br>  <br>  Little Dragon - You said it in a nutshell. Maybe I should of said what you said and not go on my rant. Little Dragon you rule!<br>  <br>  Son of Liberty - I love what you are saying, only thing is science can concentrate on just reproducing an organ rather than reproducing a whole human. Plus you can use a peresons own DNA to make the organ and then help your body accept the transplant and not have complications. These retards have no idea what's up with science.|`|KMeUXNq3aa	I have 10, can I get 11?|`|bXn6WGaXaa	More like 20 pieces of silver. <br>  <br>  I think that the creation of life for the express purpose of destroying it is sick. I understand that stem cell research is an important, possibly vital branch of science, and I support non-embryonic stem cell research. If the same stem cells are available through amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood, why do we have to kill anyone?|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	The embryo is the result of in-vitro fertilization. Several are made. One is implanted. Eventually, when the couple decides they want no more children, those embryos are destroyed. This has been going on since in-vitro fertilization started in the 1970's. Making cell lines out of the embryos seems more ethical to me than sending them to boil in an autoclave. If you protest either of these alternatives, then you should be protesting in-vitro fertilization.|`|fL0wHyNNaa	You are making the common error of calling an embryo a baby. They are two very different things.|`|d3b6fdf2d631c2f5712339448db9e43caa	an embryo does not have a heartbeat, so their is no one killing babies for science.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	I bet you won't be so critical when they find a cure for cancer or can grow you a new liver.|`|IasHMWM2aa	We throw unused embryos out.

The malpractice insurance, the needless steps forced onto the health care industry are all passed onto the consumer.

You do realize NOTHING is free, right?|`|kB7Wuyknaa	To all that think that the health care system as it is now has nothing to do with our bad economy:  As a business owner, I have seen health care premiums go up 4 times in the last 5 years.  We have an agent and we keep him extremely busy trying to find us affordable deals for us and our employees.  We had to stop paying the premiums for our employees two years ago in order to stay as profitable as we were before the system went crazy.  If we continued to pay %100, we would have to lay off some of our guys.   The people who's companies cannot afford the premiums or even a percentage of them are doing just that and those people who are losing their jobs are also losing their health care.  That puts a big burden on those with no income coming in.  It is one reason for the rising foreclosure rates.  People get sick, they don't pick and chose when it happens.  If it happens when they have no paycheck, what are they going to do?   They use up their savings, go bankrupt and lose their homes.  It's not rocket science folks.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	Socialized medicine will BANKRUPT America . . .. <br>  <br>  There are waits of months and months and months for your "free" MRI in Canada . . . . <br>  <br>  the only problem is . . . if you "think" you have cancer, you need to know NOW .. . .or you're DEAD.

He's stated Geithner would give a detailed plan several times, but we're still waiting.  Geithner can't even get a deputy to work for him.

glt02wg2aa	That's a really tough one - Carter was/is known for his intolerance of Israel. He received big donations from Arabs.<br>  Yasser Arafat - Known to be the Grandaddy of Terrorism by creating suicide bombers, and was actively directing terrorist operations right up until his death. After his death there were NO terrorist activities for about 6 months.<br>  Jimmy Carter & Yasser Arafat Shared the Nobel "Peace Prize" - two peas in pod.  The Nobel prizes were created and run by Socialists - Nobel being a Socialist himself - Almost no conservatives will be allowed to win a nobel prize.<br>  Carter also helped North Korea develop Nuclear Weapons - So I consider Carter a treasonous traitor.

X4kSnB4gaa	I don't remember them asking about underage drinking. But they do ask you about drug use. The recruiter asks you when you are doing all your paperwork together if you've ever done drugs or been arrested for drugs or anything like that. They ask you again at MEPS when you are in the process of enlisting. Furthermore, they ask you when you get to boot camp, at the "moment of truth". If you admit that you've done drugs before during this, they will automatically send you home. My advice is keep your mouth shut about it, unless it's on your record, then tell the truth to your recruiter because he will find out anyway.|`|K8qAniReaa	Drug use and alcoholism does disqualify you from enlistment.  You might get a waiver if you confess but you will be excluded from certain jobs.  If the military ever does a background check on you (which they do whenever someone needs security clearance) they might find out about it.  If they do find out you will be discharged for fraudulent enlistment and possibly jailed (though they rarely jail people for that kind of thing these days).|`|k76mr7rKaa	Drug use will never disqualify you from enlistment, so just tell them the truth.<br>  <br>  Marines are the heaviest drinkers you will ever meet, so again, they don't care, if they ask just tell them the truth.|`|jQ2K7y9Haa	the marines what questions do they ask you about drug use? do they ask about underage drinking
AA12341057	On this site, I've really only mentioned him when directly answering questions about him from conservatives.<br>  <br>  We don't care about Rush Limbaugh nearly as much as you do. On the national stage, he was recently used as a tool to point out how weak and leaderless the GOP is, and I'll admit that was pretty funny. Seriously, did the chairman of the RNC just back down and apologize to the radio talk show host?<br>  <br>  MESNDBLUES: To answer your question, we don't have to listen to him to know what he's saying, because many of his devotees are happy to repeat him verbatim (especially on this site). That's not to disparage them, aside from their questionable choice of a hero, there's nothing wrong with quoting someone you respect.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	He said he wanted the President to fail....Don't worry, though. Smart Conservatives are the ones talking about Limbaugh these days, not us. David Frum, Newt Gingrich....both think Rush is out of line and nasty....and, unlike the rest of you, THEY aren't apologizing to Rush for their claims.|`|GvBtoKsqaa	Rush Limbaugh needs to hurry up and die.

He was all dressed in black, constantly sniffing his nose like a someone who just put blow up it and then he starting bouncing up and down like someone who snorted something really powerful.

You would think a guy who has been in the closet for such a long time would know when to be more discreet!|`|I6dcRgD6aa	He was at C-pac & I have a split screen so can watch several things at one. He was even put on CNN. He took Jindal off the screen & Palin who was forced to pay $7000 for ripping off the tax payers has been quiet. He also helped her dodge questions as to why her daughter Bristol told fox that she was pro-choice when it came to her pregnancy. So Rush stood up on TV & looked like a nut case. He was fat & gross & said nothing yet the crowds would stand up as soon as they sat down giving him one standing ovation after another. If you get the transciption & can find anything he said of value you should post it here cause no one could find anything. Meanwhile, the cons. are saying polls are going up for them. Yet the polls that were accurate & proven to be on election day show the country is approving of Obama but 75%. So Rush was obviously on some kind of speed & made the party look bulliesh, immature & having nothing of value to offer the country. He pushed the party over & it was already realing from Jindal which you might not know about. He almost pranced to the podium then was so boring reading from a script while they keep saying Obama reads. So libs have been having fun. I was hoping SNL would do something on all of this & maybe they will but they used Dwayne the Rock who played a nervous Obama which is a joke in itself cause he is as calm as Rush is rushed. So Dwayne played Obama is her were crazy. He busted out of his clothes. But Obama came out smelling like a rose...they played the song Solid as Barack.|`|ShhOXGuQaa	what is funny is that liberals hate every word, thought and action Limbaugh has ever done....yet when these same liberals are asked.."oh? do you listen to him?"  the answer is always the same..."&*^%* NO!!" then how do they know what he is saying or thinking?? and btw...I think Rush Limbaugh is awesome..the more that is heard  about him, the better..and i can only assume the "republican" posters here saying Rush is a democrat in disguise, also thought John McCain was a great candidate..because when you get right down to it, the opposite of Rush is McCain...and we don't need more McCain's..|`|v1dnnMQuaa	I don't know, what brought on the hundreds of repetitious stem cell questions over the last 24 hours? <br>  <br>  Probably because Limbaugh found himself in the news and under attack for his ridiculous rhetoric.|`|k6hicodfaa	That's simply perception.

W3NY2E5daa	Nope, they consider all jobs to be combat regardless of what the job is. I was discharged from the Air Force due to a co-worker messing up my right foot. This injury caused me to be medically classified as non combat/non world qualified. The thing is my job in the Air Force was a non combat position and we could not be tasked for war unless congress passed a special bill (I was assigned to a special command that reported directly to the head of the Air Force and what we did was far from combat related). My command went to bat for me and fought against the discharge paperwork (they had a lot of training invested in me and wanted to keep me in) but was told that my job being a non combat position did not matter as I was still classed as a combat position by the top brass of the Air Force due to just being in the military.<br>  <br>  So it is highly unlikely he will be able to get any job at all in the military.|`|9rhmeb7raa	"Bad back" is too generic to give a definitive answer.

Letters are also good but once again these are things to send throughout the deployment.  For my deployment what I used most was more along the practical not special side as follows:<br>  <br>  New Laptop<br>  Handheld game device (PSP, Ipod Touch or similar)<br>  High quality shower shoes (like the Adidas slip ons)<br>  LED headband flashlight (geeky but used that sucker every day)<br>  <br>  With something like a laptop or a netbook you could load up tons of family photos or record some video etc. and put on there.<br>  <br>  If the location will allow unrestricted internet access there are these nifty devices called Slingbox.  You connect it to your Cable TV/AV setup at the house and then you can access it from any computer in the world that has unrestricted internet access.  It allows the remote user to have full control of their AV gear at the house.  Your deployed spouse could operate your VCR/Cable Box/DVR/CD player etc.  You could for example load a rented DVD into your machine at the house and he could play it remotely.  You could make a home video and pop it in the VCR and he could play/watch that.  He would have access to watching current TV shows etc.  The key to this device is that his deployed location has to have the right kind of unrestricted internet.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|LRds4JnMaa	An mp3 player (he can always download off someone else's laptop in the unit), and one of those digital photo frames where you can put something like 25 pictures on it.

WBwlKbLeaa	Absolutely not. For one, illegal is not a race. U.S. tax paying citizens have every right to expect our laws to be followed. These illegals come over, jump on welfare from their many anchor babies, get free healthcare, drive with no license or insurance and take every freebie they can. The majority of tax payers feel the exact same way you do and do not want them here. The girl who said that to you is probably an illegal lover and they are just blind.|`|tOBUxfYvaa	No,let the people who called you racist know that illegal alien is not a race. Then ask them if they are implying that all illegals are of one race and tell them they're being racist for thinking such a thing.|`|oM420kqRaa	Racism is based on race not status in the country. If the person who said you were a racist doesn't realize this then you should fill her in.

But not a racist.|`|UiUPOA0laa	No! We as tax payers have every right to protect our country. Illegals bring nothing but negatives. If they were such great people they could do it legally.

I like our government but dislike the people currently in it.  We have had at least three presidents in a row lie their way into office and cater to their own individual special interests.  Sadly, as much as I had hoped to the contrary, Obama seems to be no different than the rest.  Since he has taken office the government, now dominated by Democrats in the House and Senate as well as having a Democrat as president, have spent close to two trillion dollars, all laden with pork.  The two changes I have seen come to Washington are that they are a little sneakier about how they earmark and cater to special interest, and that they are bankrupting the country even more quickly than W Bush dared to do.  <br>  <br>  I have heard historians state that the average democracy lasts about 200 years, and sadly it looks like that will again hold true.  With huge parts of the country becoming much more politically polarized, with both parties sinking the USA further and further in debt and then blaming each other, I don't see how this country can possibly last much longer.|`|pqqKLCmwaa	I do like Pres Obama, but I generally don't like the govt. Most of Washington caters to big money interests,Republicans to a large degree,Democrats to a lesser degree. They go around the world pissing off  3rd rate countries , and making enemies by the millions, then find it necessary to spend billions to defend ourselves from them,as well as send Americans overseas to be  killed fighting the enemies we made ourselves. We supply 3rd world dictators with weapons to fight their neighbors, only to have those same weapons turned against ourselves at a later date. We allow our industry to export jobs by the millions, and at times even pay them to do so. <br>     Most other western countries avoid large involvement in foreign wars unless there is a threat to their security. They also provide better for their own citizens with healthcare and elderly benefits.Bush's Medicare drug plan, while it helps some ppl,serves mostly to make Big Pharma rich. The intent is seen when they stopped the sale of cheaper prescriptions from Canada, using the scare tactic that they were unsafe. Govt contractors routinely charge ridiculous prices for their merchandise,and generally run overbudget, with the govt's blessing. We have all heard the stories about $150.00 claw hammers, and planes that go millions over budget ,just to name two. <br>     The list goes on and on...<br>      I do like Obama,and hope he can help the situation some. I am under no illusions, though. He is not God, but maybe a hope for a few things to be made better. THe main thing is the economy right now. Much of it may be beyond the govt's ability to fix.|`|4crqyM2laa	There is nothing fishy going on here.

K8qAniReaa	The Air Force community college is for airmen to take college credit classes.<br>  <br>  If you want to join the Air Force you have a few options.  <br>  <br>  1) You can enlist.  This is the easiest option.  Your high school GPA doesn't matter as long as you got your diploma.  They only look at the ASVAB which is a general knowledge exam.  It is very easy to pass.  Just talk to a recruiter and they'd be more than happy to help.  You can find a recruiter on the Air Force recruiting website.<br>  <br>  2) You can go to the Air Force Academy.  If you graduate you will become a commissioned officer.  This will require a nomination from your congressperson and very good grades.<br>  <br>  3) You can join ROTC.  Just get accepted to any college or university that has Air Force ROTC.  They will train you in being an airman and an officer.|`|afec6d005fb7698534de7994ff84613caa	As far as I know, they mainly look at the ASVAB (not sure if I spelled that right or not) and if you have a certian level, they will contact you.  The AF is picky as to whom they let in.  Its the smallest branch number wise for that reason.  Its also one of branches that requires you to be smart.  I deal with Airmen all day, my hubby is AF :D  But he didn't graduate from high school, and his GPA was horrid, but he reached the desired score for the AF (and I'm sorry, not sure what that would be) and he's making a job of it as well.  Once you are in, then you can look more into the schooling.  Just work on getting better grades, and focus yourself.

RkfIPD7Iaa	They didn't.  He was convicted by a jury of committing the crimes he was charged with.<br>  <br>  Hypothetically, those who claim he is in jail unjustly claim the government used him as a patsy to cover up their own misconduct.|`|oKZZ3vxLaa	Fear.<br>  Plain and simple fear.<br>  Fear of the truth.<br>  John Trudell gives wonderful first hand<br>  accounts of the entire Wounded Knee<br>  incident. <br>  Read anything by him online that you<br>  can find. It may help you find a more<br>  complete answer to your question than<br>  the simple one I gave.<br>  Good Luck in this endeavour.
d627c5a658e261507295281bd8932073aa	If you are staring college, go for law based quals rather than criminalogical or social ones.<br>  <br>  Although there's no entry requirements, they'll help you with CID work.<br>  <br>  Apply for Police and do AT LEAST 2 years. You will then be eligible to apply, but in my experience you need 3-5 years.|`|a4f625e9943640ad9aec7382d7bcfe89aa	You would not need particular qualifications.You start in uniform and after two years probation you can apply for vacancies in CID but competition is great and usually experience counts so it could be quiet a few years before you get a chance.|`|kgmDFjLaaa	After your initial police training, you will have to complete your 2 year probation period. After that you will be able to specialise in any field (i.e. CID). There will be a selection process and if you pass that you will begin your CID training, on passed you will become a "Detective"
AA11288277	You're asking liberals to think?  That might just overload their gnat sized brains...<br>  <br>  Here's what I think:<br>  1. I think Comrade Obama has backed out on his campaign promise of Washington reform.<br>  2. I think Comrade Obama has backed out on his campaign promise that there would be no more earmarks in spending bills.<br>  3. I think Comrade Obama is a puppet on Nazi Pelosi and Barney Frank's strings.<br>  4. I think Glen Beck is on to something...maybe we should nominate him in 2012.|`|9w9UHyCNaa	I think that a news reporter doesn't have enough knowledge to openly judge what politicians are doing right now. Especially with that kind of attitude. If you are a politician, economist, or some sort of specialist then that would be different. But a news reporter?<br>  <br>  Just another neocon rant. Nothing special.<br>  <br>  OH I agree with him alright. Pfft.|`|kiyVz23Jaa	Donovan, so what if Glenn Beck has an attitude. Maybe this is what this country needs now. He is absolutely right even if he is a news reporter and not some.........politician.<br>  <br>  He is speaking out what most Americans are feeling and thinking. We need more of his attitude than this politically correct bullshit. <br>  <br>  If you are offended by what he says, then that is just too tough. People need to start growing a spine.<br>  <br>  I salute Glenn Beck.|`|sfjMv6bdaa	Wtf  I always thought Glen Beck was on Msnbc or CNN, never knew  he was on Fox....<br>  <br>  <br>  He is right though, except for the fact that the ENTIRE bill is defunct and it won't hell us do jack ****.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	They secretly agree with him.
mqV9TOv0aa	Every Marine is a Rifleman First!<br>  <br>  My advice is to go for the engineering degree, either mechanical or electronic (or both). What are your likes and dislikes now... if you like History, you'll LOVE the Corps... <br>  <br>  I failed the entrance exam for the US Marines, my head would not fit in the jar... I went into the USN as an Aviation Electricians Mate, and the thing I have the most respect for in the world is an Aviation Marine! This includes their Pilots as well!<br>  <br>  As far as Sniper being open to Officers, I do not know for sure, but if it has to do with a Rifle, than every Marine can get the training to do it I'm sure!<br>  <br>  ME!<br>  <br>  .|`|km9cQNAXaa	The Marine Corps also has fighter pilots if that's your goal.<br>  <br>  As an officer you will not be able to be a sniper. That job is reserved for junior ranks. It costs a lot of cash to train an officer, snipers are relatively cheap to train and are fairly easy to replaced if killed or injured in combat. No so with officers.<br>  <br>  Ian M|`|kyTBaYFlaa	special forces|`|tcA1w24jaa	All Marines are elite.<br>  <br>  If you're asking what the toughest, most stereotypical bada** jobs in the Marines are, that would probably be the Recon / Force Recon guys, they're the Marines SF.<br>  <br>  As per your original question, Marine Officers can be put in charge of a STA platoon (Which is snipers) but they won't actually be shooters, no.|`|GgG0inaUaa	Take the college degree. Your odds of of being a scout are very slim. You have a better chance of winning the lotto.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	No, as a former sniper and instructor the answer is no!|`|6gfODrpWaa	No man, officeirs canno't be snipers.|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	You might "MIGHT" be able to go to school for it, but its an enlisted job.
3y9AlP6Raa	There may be a residency problem....<br>  Check the following.......<br>  <a href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/careers/istherafforme/nationalityandresidency.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.raf.mod.uk/careers/istheraffo...</a><br>  .......but don`t give in.<br>  Persistance has it`s admirers.|`|Lk0IRENxaa	Of course you are|`|44AkhdRnaa	Yes, there will be no issue at all.|`|JQXFG2ABaa	Yes
7f1TfskEaa	It's fake.<br>  It was done after the US Air Force mistakenly dropped a bomb on some Canadian military in Afghanistan.  During the investigation/trial, it came out that the pilots were using amphetamines and they tried to blame the pills for their mistake.  I don't remember the end result.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	Of course it's a joke!  What brand of amphetamines would it be advertising. Does Merck or Bayer usually advertise saying to take drugs rather than their branded products.  And why state watch out Canadians. Here comes the USAF! We have never been in any conflict with Canada in the era when there have been airplanes.|`|GOpDGnsXaa	Don't know I know soldiers have been known to have them it seems weird the Government would admit it. Its probably a Hoax|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	That's definetly a joke.  It references the killing of Canadian Forces by American forces.  And yes it is true all branches of the US military are given amphetemine prescriptions at a much higher rate and amount than non-military US civilians.  Specifically the use of amphetemines by the US Air Force is much higher than other branches of the military.<br>  <br>  That specific poster is most assuredly a form of a political satire poling fun at old propaganda posters and the friendly fire situation.|`|K8qAniReaa	I don't know if it's a real ad. But the military did give soldiers amphetamines in order to keep them awake during World War II.
