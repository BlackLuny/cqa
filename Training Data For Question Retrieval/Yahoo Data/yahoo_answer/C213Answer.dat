Religiosamente se considera que si llegan a faltar los padres, el padrino hará la función de padre. Sin embargo, legalmente tienen derecho las familias de los padres. <br>  Hace poco bautizamos a mi beba y recuerdo mucho las palabras del padre que dijo que ante Dios los padrinos tienen que dar cuentas de su labor con los ahijados, que deben ser una guía y ejemplo para ellos.<br>  Yo tengo gratos recuerdos de mi padrino, que en paz descanse. Siempre me dio consejos y de vez en cuando algún regalito de acuerdo a sus posibilidades.

The chances are higher though, that your baby will have brown eyes!|`|4lpJRXYsaa	this is weird but 2 parents that have brown eyes can have a baby with blue eyes, but 2 parents with blue eyes cannot have a baby with brown eyes........ lets put it this way I don't really know the possibility of your daughter being born with blue eyes but......... my grandparents had 7 kids, both have brown eyes.... 1 & 2 had brown eyes, the 3rd born had blue eyes, then 4,5,6, & 7 all have brown eyes|`|dcd1de17803a79e3f8899aed15210b60aa	Go here and it will tell you what color eyes your kids will likely have--- <a href="http://museum.thetech.org/ugenetics/eyeCalc/eyecalculator.html" rel="nofollow">http://museum.thetech.org/ugenetics/eyeC...</a>|`|MSiPQbrEaa	Well, genetics that are passed down from older family members can cause two brown-eyed partners to have a baby with blue eyes. There is a possible that your next baby can have blue eyes, too. I am not sure what % of a chance it could be, though.<br>  <br>  Anyways, congrats on the incoming baby. :)|`|zTX6SKk9aa	Your next baby could have blue or brown eyes - and there's nothing odd going on.  Bear with me!...<br>  <br>  We all have 2 genes for eye colour.  Brown is dominant, so if 1 of our genes is brown, we will have brown eyes, no matter what the other gene is.  Our kids inherit one gene from each parent.  So if your child inherits a brown gene from either you or your partner, it will have brown eyes.  However you or your partner may have a recessive blue gene.  If you both have a blue gene, and your baby inherits these from you, it will have blue eyes.  (And you must both have a blue gene, as your first baby does have blue eyes).  If your baby inherits a brown gene from one of you and a blue gene from the other, it will have brown eyes as brown in dominant.  <br>  <br>  So...brown gene (from mum) + brown gene (from dad) = brown eyed baby.<br>  brown + blue = brown eyes<br>  blue + brown = brown eyes<br>  blue + blue = blue eyes<br>  <br>  And don't start me on green and grey eyes...<br>  <br>  Have a lovely baby, whatever it's eye colour!!<br>  <br>  Basically there are 3 chances in 4 of it having brown eyes, and 1 chance in 4 of it having blue eyes.

Oaqy0xmAaa	Belle means beautiful in French so it is certainly a beautiful name. But because your family name only has one syllable Bella would sound better to me as there are 2 syllables  (as in your lovely name Brandy). Also Belle Brown sounds a little like "Brown as a bell" as in "sky blue".<br>  I have a kid in my class called Belza, she is gorgeous in every way and has American origins too. Well hope it helps but at the end of the day I am sure you will see your litlle girl and her name will come to you straight away. Good luck to you :-) ps I think the double B is charming and in many cultures they try to keep the double like this.|`|QeY0rgBHaa	I love Belle Brown.<br>  In my opinion bella is a dogs name.<br>  I think that double B is fine!<br>  When i hear Belle i think graceful!<br>  Good Luck!<br>  Please, please, please answer mine!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An5.rUq.OajlZe14tFbsm1zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081014113044AAqzN1B">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  =)|`|3e517d704e865c18d41cfcc10a0a4bc6aa	Well I think it is cute. If you like it go with what you like. However, I would love to know what the name means. |`|ZW1ohMP3aa	I prefer Bella just because it flows better, but i love bioth names! I love the double B's-i ithink they're great, BBs a cool nickname.|`|6hA0O06xaa	Sounds like a little poodle's name.  A bit trendy.  Belle Brown is too many B's and both names are only one syllable.  You need a longer first name.|`|cvU3MOqMaa	I think Bella is a nice name, but i know way to many dogs named Bella. Belle might make a good middle name.|`|kLQ6J4QKaa	I love the name Bella.<br>  Have you thought about Marley for a middle name?<br>  <br>  They don't sound so good together though.|`|69kHwADJaa	I like Belle it sounds cool.|`|2GZxR3Liaa	I think either name is pretty adorable actually and is on my potential name list. <br>  <br>  Personally, I see Belle as more of a middle name than Bella. <br>  <br>  If you are concerned with the length of the name seeming overly trendy or short, try using the more old fashioned form of the name, like Isabella, or to make it with a modern twist, something like Izabelle. <br>  <br>  |`|N36QrXYuaa	I like Bella more than Belle.  It sounds better because it's two syllables, and it flows better than Belle Brown. Either way, it's too much, and I don't think the double B is too much.  |`|e3bJE2I4aa	I like the name Bella, my niece's name is Isabella and we call her Bella for Short. I think it is the cutest.|`|OTlBdxYWaa	Bella Brown |`|Zbn8A7Geaa	I like Bella better than Belle.  A way around the too many B's would be to name her Isabella Brown.  Isabella is a beautiful name.  And you can call her Bella like you want, but when she becomes an adult, she'll have a choice -- she can use her full name (without so many B's in a row) or keep the nickname Bella (if she doesn't mind the B's).<br>  <br>  Or opt to use Bella as a middle name and use a non-B name for her first name.|`|fd4e10a42c86c67feb1b080c908f919aaa	Bella Gracie Brown<br>  Bella Mylie Brown<br>  Bella Morgan Brown<br>  Bella Claire Brown<br>  Bella Paige Brown<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|SN7YHJTbaa	I love both, but Bella is my fave because it flows better. Belle is lovely, but  sounds more like a middle name.<br>  And double B's are fine. My best friend's name is Sian Selena Shannon-Sinclair, so her initials are SSSS, and she doesn't get teased or anything! :)}|`|q7kiY8L7aa	I like Bella Marie Brown :)<br>  It's a pretty first and middle name, and the double B's a cool.<br>  I know someone named Brandon Brooks and everyone calls him BB.|`|MkqgeUkHaa	I like Bella, very pretty - and I really like when the first and last name have the same initials.<br>  <br>  How about Bella Madeleine? Bella Adair? Bella Adelaide?|`|qmvJPRlVaa	I'm not crazy about it, but I don't hate it. I think it makes a better middle name or as a nickname for Isabelle/Isabella
0WstfAmzaa	I like Kailani Marie and Kailani Arabella.  :) It's a tough choice.  I would probably go with Marie - in honor of the baby's grandmothers.<br>  Congrats! |`|X70So9rvaa	i did both of our moms middle name (i had twins) (clarity ann and cheyenne maria) and that made them so happy that we did that. i would do the mothers middle name (marie is close enough to maria that they will still appreicate it).. |`|4q8Y5q6Raa	I like Kailani Marie better, its much easier to say and flows together much better. Kailani Arabella is cute but is a long name, somewhat too long. |`|AA11064695	Kailani Marie|`|887473dd6877337cb899156218187fc8aa	Well I love both names but if I absolutely had to choose one, I would choose: Kailani Arabella..........sounds like a more rich and unique name, although I like Marie, but it is very common, people like to guess middle names and someone always says Marie. But both are beautiful, I would choose Arabella!! gl and congrats!|`|BAapKykEaa	Kailani Arabella is quite the mouthful.<br>  <br>  Choose whichever you like more, but my suggestion is Kailana Marie.|`|3TRknEJKaa	Kailani Marie|`|41f3f511fdae8607c1e4c4ccb58ae109aa	Kailani Marie|`|WmNcnUmlaa	Kailani Marie|`|ZW1ohMP3aa	Kailani Arabella Marie|`|cf16d063227beac8e083347cf46b9eb9aa	Kailani Marie <br>  the other one sounds like a stripper name.|`|b639f61d656c58882c6d485d251a34e1aa	I like Kailani Marie.<br>  <br>  Way better.|`|wuji8MaLaa	I would compromise.  Go with both and put the name you like least, last, knowing that hardly anyone gets called by their middle names unless they are in trouble.  Or a teenager who's trying for their identity sometimes decides to use their middle name and first initial.  <br>  <br>  Personally I think Kailani Arabella Maria has a nicer flow to the letters than Kailani Arabella Marie.  That way you get what you want and still honor your moms.  |`|xFroEe7Uaa	Baby Kailan is actually the name of a tasty vegetable.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthychineserecipes.com/Kai_Lan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthychineserecipes.com/Kai...</a><br>  <br>  I dont think its very promising to name your daughter after a saucy vegetable. She might grow up to be the same.|`|Zj02W3lHaa	why dont u have both?<br>  <br>  Kailani Marie Arabella<br>  Kailani Arabella Marie|`|ykSjlyNJaa	Kailani Marie<br>  <br>  How about Kailani Maribelle???<br>  <br>  Pretty first name by the way|`|b2c14e5ca7fe9461ae97418d7b1934f2aa	Marie is the best one. I'm sorry but whats the deal with her first name? I'm sure you want it to be unique but that wouldn't be the way to go......|`|hlX9vSNJaa	Kailani Marie|`|yv94euDBaa	Kailani Arabella.<br>

MHPHd3V3aa	Ho perso la verginità a 16 anni. Non spolliciate, finchè non ho finito. Credevo che sarebbe stato il grande amore della mia vita, ma non è stato così. Disincantata dall'amore, ho iniziato a pensare che sesso e amore avessero solo relativamente una connessione tra loro.... E a fare sesso con chi mi piaceva (attenzione, non con chiunque, tutti i partner che ho avuto mi piacevano davvero molto!!!!), perchè mi piaceva l'atto in se, le sensazioni che dava, come se fosse una sigaretta... Finchè non ho incontrato lui... Lui che ha tenuto le mani a posto e mi ha dato addirittura da pensare che non gli piacevo abbastanza... lui che mi ha detto: "non sei una sc.op.ata in macchina, non sei una sveltina... Non sei sesso, sei amore". E quando abbiamo avuto la nostra prima volta insieme, per me è stato come se fosse la prima in assoluto. E proprio grazie all'uso sconsiderato del sesso che avevo fatto prima, mi sono resa conto della differenza tra farlo occasionalmente e farlo perchè si è guidati da un sentimento sincero e travolgente. Xadoom, non giudicare chi non la pensa come te... Non siamo tutte ragazze facili e prive di valori, solo abbiamo un pò meno forza di volontà e meno fede di persone come te. Credimi quando ti dico che io non giudico, anzi, AMMIRO, chi come te ha tanta forza nel mantrenere il suo punto di vista.|`|8hmAI3qKaa	io era una di quelle persone ke credeva nel fare l amore solo dopo il matrimonio...fino a quando non ho trovato la persona che mi ha fatto camnbiare idea e con il quale sto insieme da 5 anni...|`|HmmjWAD5aa	ciao!<br>  beh...io ci sono!!!<br>  per la mia prima volta ho aspettato il matrimonio, alla veneranda età di 30 anni (stessa età di lui)...non è stato facile (chi crede non è fatto di legno, decide solo di portare avanti una scelta !!!) ma non mi sono mai mai mai pentita! certo chi la pensa così è sempre meno, ma soprattutto sono sempre meno le persone che lo fanno portando rispetto agli altri e a sè stessi..è qeusta la cosa triste..per il resto, ci vuole tanta fede (o almeno bisogna provare ad averla) e se una persona non se la sente o non ce la fa non è peggiore di chi porta avanti questa scelta...però, ripeto, per noi due è stato bellissimo così (e continua ad essere bellissimo! :-)|`|KKmc8Niraa	esiste esiste...<br>  Io però purtroppo non riesco a condividere questa scelta...<br>  Ammetto che prendo il rapporto sessuale molto seriamente e proprio non sono capace e non voglio andare con il primo che mi capita, ma, credo che l'affinità fisica sia molto importante e purtroppo non sempre questa c'è, anche se si è legati da un amore profondo...<br>  E non mi voglio raccontarmi bugie, dicendomi si ma se ci amiamo.... se fare l'amore non è bello alla lunga il rapporto si logora... e credetemi non sono una ninfomane o ossessionata dal sesso anzi...<br>  Credo che quando mi sposerò, se mi sposerò, sarà con una persona con il quale sono riuscita a raggiungere una bella affinità sia fisica che mentale...<br>  =)<br>  <br>  AGGIUNGO:<br>  xadoom... so quale sia l'importanza di una carezza... e da come ho scritto prima può sembrare che mi dia all pazza gioia con sentimento ovviamente =p (facciamoci 2 risate)<br>  Non è così però, ho 22 anni ed ho fatto l'amore con una persona sola... ero innamorata, ogni carezza era un brivido ed ogni bacio un'emozione fortissima... quando ho fatto l'amore con lui avevo 18 anni e indubbiamente immensamente inesperta (lui aveva già avuto rapporti prima di me)... Purtroppo le cose da questo punto di vista non andavano molto bene anzi, lo so perfettamente che le prime volte non sono diciamo idilliache, ma proprio non ci prendavamo, non riuscivamo a trovare un contatto...<br>  A lungo andare la nostra storia è finita, per altri motivi che non sto a precisare, ma ti posso dire che questa poca, chiamiamola affinità, ha sicuramente influito molto nel nostro rapporto...<br>  Attualmente, dopo ben due anni di clausura ( =) ) e rifiuto ho conosciuto un ragazzo stupendo del quale sono profondamente innamorata, che mi rispetta, insime abbiamo deciso di conoscerci meglio ed aspettare i nostri (ma soprattutto miei) tempi...<br>  Non so come sarà con lui, spero stupendo come lo è tutto il resto =)<br>  Sono questi i motivi che mi spingono a dirti che a mio avviso è molto importante conoscersi anche sotto questo aspetto =)<br>  Un bacio|`|dxOIqI77aa	si.....esistono..........io diciamo ke nn la penso xrò proprio così. cioè, penso ke cmq aspettare fino al matrimonio sia un pò dura ed oggi giorno è difficile arrivare al matrimonio ankora vergine! ma cmq credo ke l'importante è farlo con la perona di cui di fidi, di cui sei innamorata e sai ke qst amore è ricambiato.........odio le raga ke lo fanno kn tutti, così tanto x divertimento. fare l'amore è qlks ke unisce due xsone, e quando ami 1 persona si prova una sensazione indescrivibile........fare l'amore dona sensazioni fantastike indimenticabili, ke il sesso nn potrà mai dare!!!!!!!!!!|`|hSwqIeVMaa	credo che persone cosi non esistano piu ma ci dovrebbero essere perche adesso il mondo fa cosi pena|`|xAdyipehaa	io quando ero ragazza, ero convinta di fare l'amore durante la prima notte di nozze, ma quando ho incontrato mio marito, ho ceduto dopo due mesi di fidanzamento, comunque lui è stato il primo a cui ho dato il mio primo vero bacio e a cui ho donato la mia verginità.

E dopo 2 anni e passa siamo ancora qui.. Più innamorati ke mai.. ^_^<br>  Penso ke aspettare la prima notte di nozze nn sia più così importante come si pensava una volta.. E poi fare l'amore aumenta tantissimo l'unione e l'intimità della coppia.. O x lo meno x noi è stato così.. E poi è bellissimo farlo.. Perchè privarsi di una gioia così? Nn ha senso aspettare il matrimonio, basta trovare la persona giusta.. Un bacione.. ^_^|`|8vVy2aBIaa	presente!|`|Anuz4jgPaa	sai io come la penso? che nel secolo che stiamo vivendo e pressoché impossibile rimanere vergini fino al matrimonio e ti spiego subito il perché...<br>  <br>  una volta....e più si va indietro con il tempo, più è vero....si arrivava facilmente vergini fino al matrimonio perché ci si sposava molto presto.....<br>  <br>  quindi.....certo che anche oggi si può, ma sempre con lo stesso metodo...anche perché è difficile reprimere i propri istinti sessuali che sò...fino a 25/30 anni....<br>  <br>  inoltre la mentalità è cambiata, la societa, e gli usi sono cambiati anche grazie all'emancipazione femminile e all'avvento dei contraccettivi...che hanno reso quasi anacronistico il concetto di verginità fin dopo il matrimonio...<br>  <br>  certo con questo non sto incitando tutti/e i/le 12enni ad andare con il primo/a che gli capita...ma solo che ci sono diverse spiegazioni del perché sono pressoché rare le persone che decidono e soprattuto riescono ad arrivare vergini fino al matrimonio!<br>  <br>  ciao<br>  -----------------<br>  bhe xadoom89....perdonami, ma devo farti 2 appunti:<br>  <br>  1) mi hai risp che tu hai "molti amici che si sono sposati (anche oltre i 25) vergini" ........... se è vero allora hai tu stessa la prova che esiste gente che crede in questa cosa e la fa....<br>  <br>  2) poi hai aggiunto anche : "io penso che sia bello farlo con chi si ha intenzione di passare la vita, non necessariamente da già sposati".............bhe, perdonami ma ti contraddici pure tu....!!! se è l'uomo o donna della tua vita....perchè non aspettare o sposarsi subito?!?<br>  scusa, ma un'affermazione esclude l'altra!!!!!<br>  ....se anche è la persona che vuoi sposare....se lo fai da non sposati, rimane cmq che non sei arrivata vergine fino al matrimonio.....<br>  <br>  ciao|`|RBs3KGOfaa	io nel fare l'amore dopo il matrimonio non sono molto d'accordo...perchè secondo me se si trova la persona che ami e che ti ricambia e se siamo pronti, è giusto farlo, dato che fare quella cosa, lega ancora di più due persone!<br>  io l'ho fatto con il mio fidanzato che amo moltissimo e lui ama me...ed è stato il primo...tornassi indietro o rifarei!|`|pxAZfQSjaa	ciao xadoom io la penso cosi..io credo ke l'amore bisogna farlo dopo il matrimonio xkè non è bello ke uno si sposa dopo aver fatto già tutto! è come se uno gia conoscesse la persona! invece no ci deve mancare qulacosina! ognuno la pensa come vuole io la penso all'antica e ne sono fiera.....<br>  nn bisogna consumare subito qst valore col primo ke lo kiede....

Le tabac diminue le poids entre 150g et 300g, c'est totalement invisible à l'écho)<br>  <br>  Le tabac peut engendrer des problèmes respiratoires sur l'enfant mais avec la pollution ambiante, je me demande si ?a fait vraiment une différence. <br>  <br>  Enfin, dans le doute, mieux vaut s'abstenir, c'est certain. C'est comme l'alcool (et là on a des éléments, pas des hypothèses, un seul verre suffit), et toutes les drogues|`|YsFzUG7oaa	dire a ton amie ke cest pas parce ke l echo ne devellope rien d anormal ke tout ira bien ensuite moi ma copine fumait et fume toujours comme un"pompier" son accouchement a eu lieu 2 mois plutot pourtant tout ete bien a lecho avec un bebe de poids normal pour son stade^mais avec une maladie pulmonaire et maintenant il a 7 ans et toujours suivi par pediatre car il a un leger retard mental et de l ashtme!!!!!on parle assez des mefaits du tabac pourtant bon c est vrai je fume pas mais ca me fait flipper ses pub sur le tabac et les gens continuent je sais plus koi penser!!!|`|82dagReuaa	Je sais que c'est pas bien mais je me suis accordée deux cigarettes par jour avec accord de mon gygy, a priori trop de changement et de mauvaises nouvelles ( rien à voir avec ma grossesse, ?ar ca c'est que du bonheur) dans ma vie et mon gygy m a dit qu il valait mieux fumer 2 par jours pour destresser plut?t que d'être comme un lion en cage.|`|TH3yzReRaa	Ma belle soeur fumait un paquet par jour depuis presque 10 ans avant de tomber enceinte, elle avait déjà essayé d'arrêter mais sans y parvenir. Quand elle a su qu'elle était enceinte, elle a arrêté du jour au lendemain ! son bébé comptait plus que tout et cela a suffit à lui donner assez de volonté pour arrêter. Cela a scotché tout le monde de voir à quel point elle a su trouver la volonté, le courage, l'amour et le sens des responsabilités pour tout stopper net ! Comme quoi c'est possible !<br>  Aujourd'hui elle allaite depuis 5 mois (presque 6) et elle n'a toujours pas retouché une cigarette !<br>  <br>  Ta copine est vraiment inconsciente ! mais surtout sans aucune volonté ni le sens du devoir... enfin bref, une grosse connerie...|`|GD7ntT1Qaa	non j ai arreté<br>  <br>  il n y a pas que pendant la grossesse qu il y a des risques, apres aussi : asthme par exemple et pour les plus fragiles, leucemie infantile vers 4 ans ! <br>  <br>  et oui ta copine est conne ! |`|beFX6cjVaa	je sais que la cigarette peut causer l'asthme chez le bébé.

Je lui ai fais une crise de larme à la caisse de Leclerc car on n'avait pris que 10 baguettes de pain pr le déjeuner et j'avais peur de manquer!<br>  <br>  Merci aux hommes de nous supporter|`|eIUEfsXOaa	lolo trop mimi ce que tu as écris!mais bon moi le papa ne mérite pas sa médaille puisqu'il c'est cassé lol,mais c'est clair qu'il y a des supers mecs qui assurent pendant la grossesse de leur femmes,mais bon arrivé à l'accouchement ils sont récompensé  à leur tour donc tout le monde à le droit à la médaille du bonheur!|`|NAMjLgWAaa	je reconais tout a fai mon homme la dedans!! c'est vrai que on parle bcp de la maman, bla, bla, bla, mais les papas qui nous suporte,qui reponden a nos envies, nos caprices, qui nous rassure, qui nous consolen, qui fon tou pour nou, qui nou aime tou simplemen!!! merci a eux!! bravo  a eux!!<br>  (merci mon homme pour toute ta patience, alez courage plu ke 3mois!! je tm!!)|`|cfc42ebd3227b789ac5675478ad4d5a3aa	Excellent !! Merci beaucoup ! C'est vrai que le futur Papa a droit a cette médaille...je lui en fais voir de toutes les couleurs parfois !<br>  <br>  En tout cas, c'est trop marrant parce que quand je lisais ta "question", bébé dans mon ventre faisait que bouger ! Elle doit approuver je pense !<br>  <br>  Vive les Papa !|`|ahKw1iAhaa	Pour l'instant je ne vois qu'  un homme sur le site|`|iVQAzawFaa	super bien dit!!<br>  sa mérite bien une étoile!|`|6b6a904cb8756df8a49e314aef2b005aaa	Je suis tout à fait d'accord avec se que vous dite.<br>  <br>  Quand jai eu mon fils, après une césarienne, heureusement qu'il été là car j'avais d'horrible douleur dans le ventre, donc la nuit pour me levé dur dur, en plus j'allaite mon fils, donc mon super homme ce levé....<br>  <br>  Aujourd'hui je suis enceinte de bb2, il m'aide beaucoup fait à manger, ménage....<br>  <br>  Alors à tout les hommes, en particulier le mien je leur décerne la médaille de la légion d'honneur |`|KTjFUGamaa	Moi je trouve qu'une grossesse c'ets la chose la plus chiante qui soit : fais pas ci, fais pas ?a....etc. Aucun mec ne serait capable de faire autant attention pendant 9 mois (faut voir leur réaction quand on leur demande si pour une fois ils peuvent ne pas boire et conduire en rentrant de soirée... alors que nous on n'a pas eu une goutte d'alcool ou une cigarette pendant 9 mois!)<br>  On prend du poids qu'on se dépêche de perdre en culpabilisant (pas beaucoup de mecs culpabilisent quand ils prennent quelques kilos alors qu'ils n'ont aucune excuse!!) Je ne parle pas de la fatigue, des jambes qui gonflent, des l'angoisse des vergetures, de l'impression d'être grosse et moche, du ventre immmonde après l'accouchement et tous les détail. Donc franchement arrêtez de dire qu'on est chiante pendant notre grossesse et que les pauvres papas nous supportent parce que moi je veux bien lui refiler la grossesse et supporter ses sautes d'humeur, je pense que c'est vraiment plus cool.En revanche je suis d'accord sur toutes les questions et le angoisses que peuvent avoir les futurs papas et auxquelles on ne fait pas assez attention car on se focalise beaucoup sur la maman. Il faut prendre le temps de les écouter.

Les kilos? Pas grave je les perdrais après, mal aux jambes (la chaleur) ?a passera<br>   Et moi aussi je disais que je n'étais pas malade juste enceinte car sinon je n'aurais plus rien fait du tout, au boulot, à la maison... tout le monde était aux petits soins, mais je me sentais bien c'était naturel et d'une telle évidence pour moi. Par contre je ne dis pas que la prochaine grossesse évoluera de la meme fa?on.

Je radottes comme les vieilles aussi!! Je ne m'inquiétes pas pour ce que je manges là c'est clair, je ne grossis pas encore non plus. Voilà bonne grossesse à toi!!

7WcfzvPvaa	Obviously not enought since there is a huge pile to be washed behind me, I'm hoping if I ignore it, it will go away! <br>  <br>  More seriously,  I have a family of 5.  I can wash a load every night of just the clothes we wore today.  I have to say that I probably do 10+ loads a week too, including towels, sweatshirts, sheets, kitchen towels, uniforms (school, softball for kids and hubby, tennis, karate)...you know, I probably do 12 loads a week now that I mention all that stuff!|`|94106f122aa0859301482207e00eda9caa	Hey Lynn,<br>  <br>  I can beat 'cha! With 6 people, we could do 4-6 loads a day and still not see the bottom of the laundry pile! It isn't so bad with clothing, but then you have the towels, kitchen linens, sheets, comforters, sleeping bags, winter coats, hats, mittens, scarves in Winter, or Swimsuits filled with sand and extra towels in Summer. We live right by Lake Michigan - so I have 3-4 sandy months and then 4-5 snowy months. Nothing like digging sand out of the dryer hoses! It's awful! My kids are mostly teenagers - they are trying to get sand off and shaken out before coming in the house - so there's not much you can do to reduce it more than it is. <br>  <br>  OH! Forgot - if kids are in 1-2 sports, band, dance or whatever - you end up with uniforms or workout stuff and stinky muddy shoes to throw in - love those days! <br>  <br>  5.5 loads a week is not even close if you have 2 parents and 1 baby! LOL! I think the baby could make 1-2 loads per day easily!!!<br>  <br>  Nice question though!<br>  <br>  And I wanted to add - this is with an extra LARGE capacity washer and dryer!|`|DDFSITiYaa	Oh Moms! I have to tell you what has changed my life and my laundry!!!  <br>  <br>  3 years ago my old 20 yr old washer gave out and we HAD to buy a new one.  Well, I am not one to go for gadgets and upgrades (my hubby does!) but I did some research and we ended up buying a fancy schmancy large capacity front loader and matching dryer.  I CANNOT BELIEVE THESE APPLIANCES HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE!   Truly! <br>  <br>  For our family of 5 ( with girls who wear things 5 minutes and put them in the laundry grrrr) I do about  6 loads a week and all in about 3-4 hours.  It is AMAZING!  These things were expensive but worth every penny.  I use less water, less energy, less detergent, it cleans clothes gentler so they last longer and I can wash our king size comforter.  They paid for themselves. <br>  <br>  I'll get off my soapbox now but seriously, think about it - highly recommend! |`|8tGAE1Nmaa	i do 10 loads on monday and this is the average, and 8 loads on thursday and this is with the sheets and sometimes the blankets which make the load up to 12 loads on thursday... |`|GwwsJzSMaa	at least 2 every day so thats 14 but on a sunday my washer never stops so must do 8 loads on that day so roughly 20 per week. Just me my husband 2 lads 21 and 17 at home and the eldest drops his bag of washing round on a Sunday!|`|5iFsE3AKaa	I Have a family of 5...so I do about 2 loads of laundry a day, mon-sat. so about 12 loads a week. |`|VuUz8NgKaa	Usually around 8 to 9 loads, My daughter simply can't stay in the same clothes for more than 2 hours when she is home.|`|DTWEJKBEaa	Family of 3 ... around 8-10+ a week|`|GoH9UuX8aa	I do not know the exact answer to your question but I can give you a number on a family of five.<br>  <br>  I have been very sleep deprived with a baby that must be tube fed every four hours around the clock.  With three other children who still need me to be a mom something has to give and the last week it has been laundry.  So today I buckled down and knew it needed to be done.<br>  <br>  So far today I have washed four loads of darks which includes two of the kids sheets and blankets.  I still have three loads of whites and three more sets of sheets and blankets I plan to do today.  So in all I will have washed 8 loads of laundry today.  I would say that is about one weeks worth of clothes.|`|jJcj7SU6aa	I have a family of four at the moment and twins on the way<br>  <br>  my oldest is a 4 yr-old boy (very very messy, muddy and boyish) and a 2 year old girl (very creative when it comes to paint) . At the moment I'm doing about 14 at the least.<br>  <br>  I think in a few months i'll be doing a bit more though with another girl and another boy on the way<br>  <br>  good luck and god bless to you and your family|`|gk4z8fp2aa	Woo.  Reading these answers makes me very thankful for our new (HUGE capacity) washer, lol.  Hubby does his own work clothes so that's one load I don't have to do.  I probably average 3-4 loads a week, maybe 5 if things have been really busy.  We're a family of 4 :)|`|Z971opTYaa	I am a SAHM it is just me my son and his father and i do  a load or two  a day during the week and i never do laundry on the weekends...I am always washing something tyring not to get behind so i can enjoy a laundry free weekend..|`|U2yxjQfAaa	one load... I hate doing laundry. This is comign from a woman that will go buy new underwear before she washes the rest, LOL! I know that's bad.|`|FSZIrUtRaa	I usually do 2 on Tuesdays, and 4 or 5 on Sundays<br>  <br>  |`|2FZreku3aa	wow 5 1/2 that would be nice.  I do at least 12 loads every week.  *sigh*|`|liJhjOn7aa	There is six of us here I do about 2-3 loads daily!  I say on average 18 loads a week.|`|UY3j47ozaa	i do a load of laundry everyday.......|`|41f3f511fdae8607c1e4c4ccb58ae109aa	6-8 loads for a family of 4.|`|zJoOMewDaa	I do at least 10 loads a week if not more.|`|V1WLA2Staa	Five and a half might be right in our case, but we're only a family of 3!|`|q16iJ6PSaa	2 loads per day....so 14<br>  <br>  God I hate laundry.|`|OeD2sJt7aa	I do about 5 loads but there is only 3 in my family and I stuff that washing machine to its limit! |`|flqAr30laa	I do laundry on sundays and i do 3 loads a week, whites, darks and colors.<br>  Im a single mother of a 10yr old. <br>  my  mother has a hubby and an 8yr old and she does 2 loads a day.<br>  |`|AA11109728	I probably do that much, at the most, and it's just me and my daughter.  Then again, I don't have a whole lot of clothes, so I have to do mine more often.  So you figure my laundry 2X, my daughter's 1X, a load of towels and a load of whites.  I'm thinking your amount is way more reasonable for what actual moms do for laundry in a week!  Parents magazine needs a reality check!  LOL|`|dDVAUA9saa	I do way more than that too, and there are only three of us!  My hubby and myself, and my 18 month old.  Including towels and cleaning rags, and her cloth diapers, i do about 12 loads per week.<br>  <br>  3mom- thanks for the advice on the washer/dryer.  I need a new one soon and we were seriously thinking about the front load, large capacity.  Thanks!  My washer takes forever!|`|z5EDtgtyaa	it's just me my daughter and my husband and I do about 4 loads a week sometimes more depending on if I had to change my daughter's clothes when she gets home from day care she has two loads and my husband and I have 2 but if you add towels and sheets it would be 6 loads|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	Too much!  <br>  <br>  We are a family of four and we average about 6 a week, but my oldest will do her own sometimes so that cuts my work down a bit.
FYiKgeN8aa	I used nipple shields for the first few weeks and it did a great job drawing out the nipple.  Another Godsend was the hospital grade pump I rented.  It really helped me draw out the nipple and get my supply up.  Just keep trying to put her to the breast and see how it goes.|`|ogdm7RLYaa	It's possible that the nipple shield can reduce supply...but it didn't for me.<br>  <br>  It was probably that you should have been waking her up to eat, as long as she's eating well and gaining weight, I wouldn't worry.<br>  <br>  I also have nipples on the small side, so I was given a nipple shield too.<br>  <br>  We we're completely off it by 2 months and I have never had a problem with my supply.<br>  <br>  Good luck :]|`|Sid0WCnmaa	 I want to tell you first of all I am so proud of you for continuing to bf . I used a nipple shield for 8 months and the lactation consultant said that I should write a book on it because I never gave up . They told me to pump because it would effect my supply so I always pumped after feeding her every time. I built up a huge supply that I had the supply of a mother of triplets . Now I donate my milk and I am still bf without the shield at 15 months . You need to continue to use the shield as long as it helps and don't let anyone discourage you. The way I weaned her off of the shield was I just got her really hungry and I pumped to get let down before I put her to the breast and the I pretty much just plopped it in her mouth and she loved it ever since. Good Luck|`|wPoLJBf2aa	I used nipple shields when I started to breastfeed my daughter, and I never had a problem with her gaining weight. I didn't however have a lot of milk, and she had a hard time latching on (hence the reason why I was using nipple shields) so I would pump the milk out instead, but I don't think the nipple shields were the problem at all. Take care, and good luck! |`|WGBTjjAvaa	You really should contact a lactation consultant to make sure you are properly using the nipple shields. You definately do not want to be underfeeding your baby. I do not think it is reducing your supply, maybe just making latching harder. I never had to use nipple shields but I have never heard of nipple shields reducing supply on all the bf forums I ahve been on over the past 12 years of being a mom.|`|a6IzhQfNaa	I used a nipple shield for the first couple months with my daughter. I honestly had exactly the same problem. I was told that it was not the nipple shield just that I needed to be more aware and accurate with the feedings. It made me crazy, she was either too heavy or too light. In the end, I just decided I would rather have her getting a lot and weighing a little more than not having her get enough. I would let her wake up when she wants to feed. And if the nipple shield helps you and helps her then I would continue with it. Don't worry though, it sounds like she is a healthy little baby! Good luck!

L'unica cosa...è capire se dietro al suo ti voglio bene...non ci sia il fatto che il bene che ti vuole è più di tipo "amicale" che "amoroso"...<br>  Un bacione<br>  Bimblue|`|augOPZBGaa	Io preferisco un "ti voglio bene" vero e sentito..invece di un "ti amo" falso.<br>  ormai la parola ti amo viene usata come se fosse niente..<br>  <br>  <br>  riky *_* buahauh XD|`|s3H9lPF3aa	no... un "ti voglio bene" lo si dice anche fra amici, parenti ecc. un "ti amo" diversamente viene usato quando 2 persone si amano, quando provano dei sentimenti importanti; questo è il valore che io dò a queste 2 "frasi"... il mio ragazzo mi ha detto che non mi dice quasi mai "ti amo" x il semplice fatto che io lo so.. e non ha bisogno di dirmelo a ogni messaggio, telefonata ecc.<br>  secondo me non è lo stesso...|`|Jcfgsc9Aaa	se ami...<br>  è ovvio ke vuoi bene|`|JtI60IViaa	dopo mesi e mesi, anni e anni di "ti amo ti amo ti amo", può capitare ke nn riesca più a tradurre in parole quello ke è il vero sentimento, quello provato, x questo può capitare di alternarlo ad un "ti voglio bene" che manifesta la ricerca di un'espressione ancestrale, "infantile" del sentimento, puro come il sentimento ancora PIù FORTE DELL'AMORE che i bimbi piccoli provano nei confronti della loro mamma...|`|KUIfDDW4aa	beh di certo sentirsi ti amo e bello, ma se e detto con il<br>  cuore e x davvero!!! a quel punto se e un ti amo falso, senza senso e senza cuore, meglio un ti voglio bene<br>  verissimo detto col cuore!!!ormai oggi tutti dicono ti amo<br>  al primo ragazzo(e viceversa) che capita...<br>  siauu|`|KfUIXbA4aa	Ti voglio bene può significare tante cose...!!! Però ti amo è una parola mooooolto forte!! bacini|`|NzWdqbXSaa	nn proprio..<br>  se uno ti ama dice ti amo..<br>  se uno ti vuole bene dice ti voglio bene..<br>  magari può capitare qlk vlt di dire: ma io qnt ti vgl bene?<br>  nl senso di: qnt tengo a te?<br>  e li c sta.. x il resto 2ndo me no..|`|RE8fIbAcaa	x amare 1 persona la devi prima volere bene...^^|`|bK3komw8aa	prima di avere il ragazzo dovreste almeno imparare ad esprimervi in italiano, leggere le domande e le risposte su sto sito è raccapricciante....|`|yoojmXPcaa	al di là del ti amo o del ti voglio bene ci sono i comportamenti che parlano. il mio ex nn mi ha mai detto "ti amo" ma" ti voglio bene" tante volte. però il suo comportamento parlava di amore nn di bene. un altro mio ex mi diceva "ti amo"e dopo 5 mesi che si era lasciato con me (dopo 4 anni e mezzo)si è sposato con un altra.|`|mMrEpzP0aa	Si Si... ti ama cmq... è solo che "Ti amo" lo riserva x i momenti speciali... (lo so xkè anche il mio amore è kosì^^)|`|x3kboZttaa	Dire ti amo troppo spesso come se lo si dicesse solo per abitudine è come se privasse la parola del significato profondo che ha... e comunque non solo amare ma anche voler bene è importante. In ogni caso non credo che i sentimenti di una persona cambino se per una volta si dice qualcosa di diverso... ;) Di solito a me fa piacere quando il mio ragazzo mi dice che mi vuole bene... :)|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	a quanto pare ...per loro dire..ti amo o ti voglio bene..é la stessa cosa!|`|OGiuuCDzaa	c'è vi ama...<br>  1^ elementare...

Other sources: fermented soy products like natto , dried raw figs, rhubarb, pinto beans, turnip greens, and kale.<br>  |`|oRzqWhsDaa	he is lactose intolerant maybe ask your doctor try two percent milk and see if that works hes almost a year old he can have regular two percent milk it is important he has milk for a source of calcium for his bones in this body|`|o1StMQeyaa	At 11 months, breastmilk/formula should continue to form the basis of his diet for at least another month. As you have stoped breastfeeding, he needs the additional nutrients of formula that regular dairy products don't provide.<br>  I'm not familiar with the heinz canned breakfasts - do they contain dairy products? If so, and he can eat them without side effects, he doesn't have an intolerance to dairy products. If they don't contain dairy and he vomits after eating/drinking any dairy, take him to see a doctor. <br>  If you suddenly switched him from breastmilk to lots of dairy, it may take his body awhile to adjust to the change. <br>  Good luck!|`|1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	He is likely to have a dairy intolerance. It's quite common in young children. <br>  <br>  Does he have any eczema or a rash or fussiness. The fact that he vomits after dairy indicates an intolerance/allergy or just a sensitivity to it.<br>  <br>  See an allergy dietitian if you can't give him formula - otherwise try a Hypoallergenic formula.|`|13BALkIMaa	Milk is the easiest way to get calcium in babies. But there are many other ways to get calcium. Talk with your doctor or search online to learn more about calcium intake for children. Many sites will show how many milligrams of calcium are present in different foods. At this age they should be getting about 1000mgs a day.|`|G0qsVfoUaa	Maybe he is lactose intolerant?<br>  I wouldn't wait, I would make a doctor appointment...it really isn't good that an 11 month old throws up constantly. He needs a source of calcium for growth, and you need to know for the future too.
5tsZRyYGaa	I dont know where you live, but here is Dallas, Tx there is a magazine called "Dallas Child" it has everything that is going on in the Dallas area for the month. some are free!! Maybe the town that you live in has a magazine like that. |`|a6IzhQfNaa	My daughter is 21 months old and I try to do different activities with her everyday. We read together, take walks, go to playgrounds, go around the house saying what each object is, do puzzles, look at pictures of animals, color, sing songs, learn numbers, and so many other things! I just signed us up for a music class. This class was wonderful and also allowed my daughter to play with other kids and get used to other adults (she is pretty shy). If you have the time then often your community will do different classes that you can join with your toddler. Have fun!<br>  - Are you a blogging mom? Join Blogger Moms! in Yahoo! Groups|`|j2mRop0laa	Do you have a mommy and me dance class? It isn't so much to teach them dance at that age (at age 1 and 2). They usually just stand around a free dance and the moms get involved. It's a good way to meet parents. Also the gymboree gym and kindermusik. <br>  Other than that, the library has storybook times 2 times per week for toddlers. They read a book, they get snacks and a juice. call your local library and see if you have that.<br>  Another idea, start your own park outing club. Call up 1 or 2 people you know with kids even close to your girls age and ask them to invite 2 more a piece. Meet up at the park once per week. <br>  Going for walks, nature walks with a digital camera, visit relatives, visit the pet store, get washable finger paints and order a huge blank mural from orientaltrading.com. <br>  just have fun!|`|avx7bLnKaa	look up local play areas<br>  for example Tampa FL has<br>  kidz club and playpatch... these are play areas with toys and such and a whole bunch of kids... and when school is in session you don't have to worry about older kids<br>  <br>  or places like<br>  gymboree play and music -this is separated by age groups<br>  as are places like<br>  <br>  there are places like these in my area but you need to search yours to see what you hve<br>  my gym<br>  Little gym<br>  <br>  or some malls have enclosed or semi enclosed play areas<br>  <br>  you can see if in your area thier are spray parks, public pools, zoos, aquariums, museums<br>  <br>  some museums and aquariums have special play areas for kids<br>  <br>  most museums or aquariums or zoos have a yrly pass you can purchase<br>  <br>  <br>  oh and look up local playgroups in your area<br>  websites offer these like through meetup.com<br>  or mom's clubs<br>  or sometimes area churches have mom groups or toddler groups you can join|`|AA12033653	Find a mommy and me class to take your child to.  This will help with her socialization skills, and give you both something to do outside of the house.  |`|eEbqfYUTaa	play with ..not the right age to take out|`|0IPxeDJiaa	My life is probably not anything like yours (DD is almost 10 months), but here goes :  <br>  <br>  DD wakes up about 7 am and we nurse then eat a small breakfast.  We play (and I get ready) until she naps at 9 am.  Sometimes we go for a walk before lunch (I go grocery shopping) and we eat around 11:30 am / noon.  DD usually naps around 1:30 pm.  <br>  We go for a walk and to the park, or out and about.  At 4 pm, she gets her snack (yogurt and fruit).  If the weather is good, I give her her snack at the park or wherever we are. Usually we're back at home around 5:30 pm /  6 pm (unless she falls asleep in the stroller) for me to make dinner.  <br>  She eats anywhere from 6:45 pm to 7:30 pm.  <br>  Bathtime is at 8:15 pm and she's in bed before 9 pm.<br>  <br>  We also have a mommy/baby group once a week and I usually get together with another mom another time during the week.  <br>  <br>  DD loves aquariums, art exhibits, etc. as long as they're baby friendly!<br>  <br>  Mondays we usually hang out and only leave the house once after her second nap since our weekends are energetic!  <br>  <br>  There are days we do what I want to do and DD is cool with that as she loves to go shopping, out to the market, etc.  A change in routine is never bad.  We also have lots of parks where I live so we can hit a different park every day or take a long walk if I feel up to it.|`|AA11229410	I am a stay home father because my wife makes more money.  I had to learn to check my ego at the door and find ways to be with my little girl.  The biggest thing I did for her was talk to her all the time.  This is something I read about that would help with speech. She is now two and a half and she talks more than most kids at daycare.  She talks as I drive her around town and tells me what is going on as she sees things out the window. <br>  <br>  It was harder than I thought it would be to find the words to say.  Even before she could speak I was telling her what I was doing with her and I would tell her what was going on around her.  I would read to her before she was born.  Now she really thinks she can read to me.  <br>  <br>  I find that the time I have spent with her has helped her more than what she gets from being dumped at daycare.  I miss her now.  Will she be the leader of the pack?  I don't know but she has personality.

uhISTuDnaa	Yeah I'm pretty sure they can. If you watch while getting an ultrasound, they will move away from the little device on your belly cause it pushes on them. My baby kicks the doppler thing when listening for a heartbeat cause she hates the feeling of that thing pushing on her, too. I always mess with my baby. lol. She loves it when I moisturize my belly after a shower. She always, never fails, balls up near the top and I rub it down with cocoa butter. They can definitely feel stuff.|`|NhSqwBAAaa	Your baby absolutely can feel you and no, he is not likely to be hurt by light poking! He can even feel more than just when you poke at him. He can feel if your having a bad day or a good day. There is a very special bond between mother and child and, during pregnancy, they experience things as one. They go through everything together and it all has a direct effect on the baby and this incluces; what you eat, cleanliness, excercise (walking), and your emotions. If you are happy and healthy, then the baby will be happy and healthy. So it is important for you to stay in a positive mindframe throughout your pregnancy. Doing things like enjoying the kicks and poking back at your baby are fun, positive experiences and you should enjoy every minute of it! Just be careful when you are interacting with other people to not let them send your mood askew... If someone irks you, just go back to the positive feelings you have when you think about the wonderful new addition to your family! I personally have mountains of respect to women who give birth to new life and I hope that people never lose the idea of how important and sacred this whole reproductive process really is to our species. Good luck on your new family and may the wind be always at your back!|`|yi6SCnteaa	yes he can. he's far along enough where he responds to your movements and the sound of your voice|`|rDxRP30Aaa	yeah he can feel it you wont hurt him dont worry|`|qtn4RiHbaa	yep i think they can feel ya.dont worry u wont hurt him.
6kaRUPRFaa	Yes.  I felt like I had horrible gas (gross, I know).  I called my mom and she said "GO TO THE HOSPITAL NOW!".  Good thing too, my little boy was born an hour later.  Even if it is only braxton-hicks, it's better to be safe than sorry.  <br>  <br>  Also wanted to add- some women never have steady contractions until the end.  Timing them is not always useful.|`|6Di3JyY7aa	yes the beginning of labor could be crampy without contractions this is because the baby is getting ready to be born also this gives you time to get to the nearest hospital as soon as possible and get ready for this wonderful moment in your life. Another thing is that the best of doctors can predict the time you are ready to have baby but it can just happen at any time ok that it for now have a safe delivery<br>  |`|0jhK2oeZaa	With my first child (I had 4) I had what felt like indigestion and I had had pizza earlier that day, so I didn't think much of it  lol ! Yes, I think you could have started labor, but not necessarily. You have to wait until your contractions are coming steadily anyway.  Good Luck! and congratulations!<br>  <br>  **Breast feed your child!|`|KLUPLlzsaa	No, you wouldn't be just yet.  When you start having the contractions they will be a bit more intense then braxton and you will KNOW. Trust me you will know. If you are really concerned I would cal your ob. :) |`|WXPArbIMaa	There is a possibility, but odds are you are not near labor.<br>  <br>  But, as someone mentioned before, call your OB if you are worried. Even if you aren't worried, it's good to double-check!<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|AA10700334	Baby's have their own time schedule...time the contractions(they may not be Braxton Hicks!) If they get to be every 10 minutes apart, Call your doctor!|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	YES|`|MFoNAkjzaa	yes good luck..it has been a full moon so it is possible|`|BQ4Sd9oJaa	I think yes....When I had my first, I wasn't sure if I was in labor or not.  Finally my husband said, "We're going to the hospital anyway, because if it's not labor then something else is wrong."  We went and two hours later we had a daughter.  We've had 2 more after that.  Good luck...and enjoy the miracle|`|213eeceec31513f022de891e469950b6aa	Actually mild contractions actually do feel a little like menstral cramps or sometimes just a lil pressure.|`|KtXWFiBjaa	isn't that what a contraction is? arent the contractions supposed to be every 5 min APPROX. if ur in labor?|`|jzObj3uVaa	Yeah I think so.|`|t5VB8RWFaa	yes|`|M6c0hUefaa	Everyone feels labor differently, especially early labor. <br>  <br>  Some women don't even know they're in labor until they're 8cm!<br>  <br>  Anyways, your best bet is to time them, start doing something to see if the crampiness goes away. Call your doctor, or midwife and tell them whats happening. <br>  <br>  When I first started going into labor with my daughter I didn't think I was in labor until i started timing the pains and realized that they were just too consistent to be false, although my doctor didn't believe me.|`|KXZ8jIP9aa	yes, of course! in fact that's very common. if you have any further questions relating this topic, feel free to ask, I'm a doctor, and ill be more then happy to help you out.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	My water broke...and about five minutes later, I started having that feeling you get right before you start your period....then all of a sudden about 15 mins later I got the worst diareah...feeling...cramp but 50xs more intense.  I would start walking a lot,  try to do squats...it works.  <br>  Good luck!!!!!|`|yCR6qg0baa	It very well could be actual labor. Go ahead and set your bag by the door, take a hot bath, and start timing them.<br>  <br>  Only 5% of babies come on their due date. 95% come within two weeks earlier or later than the due date. =)  GOOD LUCK!|`|Md4Gqxdtaa	i think it is probably a sign of contractions if they continue to get worse call the hospital and head that direction|`|r7dYHFLtaa	Trust me you'll know when they're real contractions !
46tTmMT7aa	Him sounding congested could be from formula in the back of his throat after eating.<br>  |`|2zszNy7Aaa	My son did this at the same age, he looked like he was choking and couldnt breath properly, i took him to my gp and he said its normal, they have a whole in the back of there throat so they can breath while breast feeding or having a bottle and sometimes the mucus can build up.|`|bB0C87vQaa	He he us first time mummys! When i was in hospital I thought bubb was gonna cark it a few times cos he was breathing so loud and deeply and croaky but apparently its normal! maybe try a different formula that might be less thick or something? I he seems happy in him slf , has no fever and is still feeding and pooing and weeing then im sure he is fine :) |`|CmxJdPh2aa	my guess would be acid reflux...its actually somewhat common in babies.  make sure he is burped well when put down after a feeding and try to wait to actually lay him down for 20-30 minutes after a feeding. other than that keep an eye on it until tuesday and bring it up then.<br>  <br>  added: my son actually had this and he had quite a few strange episodes that ended up in me actually taking him to emergency at one point. three times he had weird things that he would make a weird noise and tense up, usually while sleeping. he wouldn't cry but it really freaked me out. the time that i ended up taking him in instead of calling the hospital  his lips even turned blue. thats why i say keep an eye on him, but wait til the docs appt. if possible--they can run tests and see if its something they need to treat or just keep an eye on...|`|466394efb1b6e7091a517df116a2ecfaaa	Im 14,but I always hear my mom and aunt saying stuff like that. my little cousins breathe like that and my sister used to but doesnt anymore, but they do not turn red/pink|`|dc628c84ed9b9f2f5bfb75b116f5d31caa	Call the doc asap i would because it sound like to me he has fluid in the lungs and cant breath right so please dont wait and go ahead and call the doc in the morning just to be on the safe side... or take him to the er... either way do something fast... This is just my opinion but it is better to be safe than sorry....<br>  or it could be nothing... there is number of things that can cause this so have it checked<br>  |`|QOSjaFMuaa	Just wait to talk to the doctor.  Maybe he has a little cold.  Do you notice a runny nose? Maybe try clearing his nose out before you feed him and see if that makes a difference. He could also be drinking too quickly, like trying to breath and swallow at the same time.  |`|g2elB8eDaa	does he spit up? It sounds like what was happening with my duaghter. Ends up she has acid reflux. Talk with you doctor Tuesday. Hope all is well.|`|Gbs6Sa0haa	 f you are really worried I would try to get him to the doctor earlier then Tuesday so you will feel better.  But it does sound like congestion from the formula.|`|4e833c08dc49ec15a3d74e52613cf7c2aa	obviously only a dr can answer correctly, but my son was like that and he had very bad wind, and also silent reflux....  |`|XmO3nFSLaa	I too did that and I called a nurse line they said that babies don't breath at normal intervals and that if baby takes a breath every 10 sec...meaning they take a breath and hold it longer than 10 sec you should have them looked at but if they don't hold it longer and are not blue in face or around mouth it is normal.....but if baby seems to grunt could be a sign of something wrong...but if it is just after bottles maybe baby is forgetting to breath...If you are worried that much have baby looked at trust your instincts if you think it is serious no harm in going to check on it!!!<br>  <br>  Edit also if baby seems to have stuff in throat or nose use bulb syringe to suck it out(fyi when sucking one nose hole cover the other)|`|dccfm6kIaa	I would bring it up with the doctor. You never know what it could be. Maybe he just has a tough time sucking and swallowing or something. My son used to squeak really really loud when he would nurse. He sounded like a mouse with a microphone and it was the funniest thing... but it is kind of hard to say without being able to actually see him... If he is doing ok and he doesn't stop breathing while he's eating I'm sure that you can hold off until your appt on Tuesday. Keep an eye on him for more difficulties so you can tell your doctor exactly what is happening. I hope that everything goes okay and maybe its just how he eats... |`|ja427oPHaa	I think you are being paranoid. If he is having any breathing difficulties it will be very obvious.He probably is a little congested after feeding which is normal also, particularly if you are formula feeding.  His pallor(skin colour) will be pale and lips will have a bluish tinge to them if he is experiencing any breathing problems. I suspect your Dr will say the same thing. I wouldn't listen to an 18 year old girl who was stupid enough to get pregnant and can't even describe what she means! I'm sure you bub is fine.|`|jLJ7HjUpaa	The noise and the red face makes it sound like Reflux/GERD to me.... <br>  <br>  What Are the Symptoms of GERD in Infants and Children?<br>  <br>  The most common symptoms are:<br>  <br>  Frequent or recurrent vomiting <br>  Frequent or persistent cough <br>  Heartburn, gas, abdominal pain, or colicky behavior (frequent crying and fussiness) <br>  Regurgitation and re-swallowing<br>  In young infants and children, some problems may be associated with GERD and include:<br>  <br>  Colic (frequent crying and fussiness) <br>  Feeding problems <br>  Recurrent choking or gagging <br>  Poor growth <br>  Breathing problems <br>  Recurrent wheezing <br>  Recurrent pneumonia<br>  <br>  IF he has this, it is very simple to fix... But def talk to your doc about.<br>  |`|1E1YmcVkaa	I don't remember any of mine doing that (I have 3) I would definitely ask the Dr. or just to be safe, call tomorrow, they usually have a nurses line you can call and they will ask the Dr. your question and call you back.  They will let you know if they want to see him ASAP or if they want you to wait for his appointment.  Don't worry about being over protective, I am on my 3rd and I still call her Dr. when I am facing something I don't understand.  That's why they went to school and get paid so much.  Good luck.|`|XrTlDy08aa	I was a very paranoid mom, i couldnt barely sleep. but you cant judge your instincts on what every other mom says not even grandma because every baby is different and the mom knows whats best for there baby...but like you said just explain the situation to the docter or call and make a sooner app. |`|lVYeCp6paa	Sounds like spit up.  If it's too difficult to explain to the doc, try videotype when he does it and show the clip to the doc if doable.|`|JqQeeFgFaa	im only 15 but i have 10 younger cousin (about 10) he could have Asama my brother had it and still does sometime his face would turn red so check with the doctor but thats wat is sound like.<br>  <br>    |`|1m8zFFXyaa	CALL IN THE MORNING AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET IN A DAY EARLY. TELL THEM YOUR SON IS BREATHING WEIRD.|`|U0KCmsKXaa	This does sound a little odd and I don't recall my son ever making strange congested sounds during or after feeding.  Definitely make note of this to your doctor on Tuesday.  Your doc might suggest a pediatric ear, nose and throat appointment for your little one.  Hope all is well!
n8vBnA9Iaa	My son was 10.3 when he was born. He displayed all the same things as your baby is. Don't worry. He won't starve himself. He will awake when he is hungry. <br>  Let him do his own thing. He sounds happy and well adjusted.|`|u7kDLuklaa	Sounds like you have a perfect baby on your hands!  No need to worry .. relax and enjoy the sleep!<br>  <br>  WOWOWOW ...10lbs6oz?  |`|be68e6d198f3f9ac69efb2146c8d907eaa	everything is fine!

Sceaming all the time never sleeping. I would consider yourself lucky not a worry-wart.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	No, babies at that age sleep a real lot. ENJOY it now :)<br>  LOL<br>  And havent you heard?! NEVER WAKE A SLEEPING BABY!! =]<br>  loL <br>  He's a big boy, so he can eat more, and go longer. LUCKY YOU!|`|AA10222220	Sounds like a growth spurt. My daughter (28 May) sleeps for 9-10 at night every night and naps throughout the day. I breastfeed on demand so I don't know what she gets but at her 4 month checkup today she was right on target weight wise...Worry if this goes on for 5 or 6 days...call the ped if you want, they are used to it. Good luck!|`|03602b1cce42bfcc3e99b3e415d87d4aaa	It's perfectly normal for a baby to do that. Normally,as a baby gets older they sleep for longer periods of time without eating food. When they do wake up however,they are pretty hungry. That's why you feed them well which makes them tired and they fall asleep.  |`|SDr9Y7Zyaa	That is perfectly normal.<br>  At 5 weeks my daughter was going to bed at 12 and not waking until 9-10 am!<br>  I woke up every morning panicking that i had left her..but it carried on and she still sleeps through the night at 6 months old.<br>  Dont wake a sleeping baby and enjoy it! We are very lucky to have babies that allow us to sleep!<br>  Congrats x|`|wVjvz13Caa	Medicine can make babies a little more sleepy and so can being ill. Don't worry about it. It sounds perfectly normal to me.|`|LQZLShCvaa	be happy you can sleep....<br>  it's perfectly fine.|`|8HjyIUXTaa	count yourself lucky.  If they want to eat they will let you know.  Enjoy the sleep.|`|hHLnVEYXaa	Its nothing to worry about..contact a doctor if hes undersleeping though lol|`|AA11022786	Yeah I understand your worry...my daughter was the same except she was only eating about 1.5 ounces at 4.8 lbs (at birth)  and we had to wake her up for every meal. I was told if the baby is eating good and he's wants to sleep then let him...if he normally doesn't eat well or isn't gaining weight wake him every 2-3 hours to eat. You have a big boy on your hands and I don't think you should really worry, they say babies grow while they sleep and he's got enough reserves to use for that.|`|oIFMohfUaa	At 4 weeks, he is most likely going through a growth spurt.  Makes him more tired.<br>  About this age my son started sleeping 10+ hours!<br>  Thrush may have something to do with it, as his system is off.<br>  You may want to check into something called "Baby-dophilus"<br>  It's the same as Acidophilus that is in our yogurt...it's also already in our bodies.  It's the good bacteria.  A tiny bit of it, on his tongue, can help get his system back on track.<br>  I used to think people were crazy to try such things, until my son had it and it was almost impossible to get ahead of...he ended up with a severe yeast infection on his bottom before it was over with!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

a6IzhQfNaa	I don't think I would describe period pains exactly like contractions. Contractions are a lot worse. Your whole belly will tighten, I mean get really really hard. You will also feel a lot of pain and will have to force yourself to take deep breaths instead of the short, shallow ones that you will want to take. But this could be different for you. If you are concerned I would call your doctor. Otherwise I would wait until you know it is contractions and that they are occuring every 5-8 minutes. Good luck!
PmY09h4Iaa	Ca me semble un peu t?t pour te dire le sexe du bébé. Normalement, c'est à la deuxième écho que tu le sais (donc au 5ème mois). Après, comme tu es une grossesse à risque, peut être as-tu une écho tous les mois? en ce cas, tu le seras peut être au 4ème mois. <br>  Après, pour ma louloute, à la première écho on avait rien vu donc on avait pressenti que c'était une fille mais bon, on ne peut être sur de rien et en tous cas, le gynéco ne s'était avancé en rien.

d888b47101fa7c7ab64e754dcde2d66daa	Well their could be a couple possibilities to consider. One it is just because it is your second child, two you have too much amniotic fluid or you have more than one baby in there. I have been through all of them at the same time. With my second pregnancy I found out it was twins and I had too much amniotic fluid. At 5 months I looked 9 months with twins. It was very painful. I ended up going into labor before I could make it into the specialist and gave birth 4 months early, which resulted in my smallest baby passing away shortly after birth and our bigger baby passed away at 8 months old. <br>  <br>  So there are different possibilities. Just dont worry yourself it could be nothing at all. If you are concerned however don't hesitate to call your doc and share your concerns with him. Maybe he can give you an ultrasound and figure out whats going on.  Good Luck and Congrats!|`|EnH8jv6Taa	I was extremely bloated when i was pregnant and at 10 weeks i looked as though i was 7 months and had twins in me! (but i didnt just one!!!)<br>  I am only a very small person (this is my 3rd pregnancy) and it really looked strange i went and seen the dr about it and he told me that you can get very bloaty in the few months of pregnancy. Personally from experience i would not worry too much unless you get even more bigger than what you are already. BUT if you are worried best to get checked out by your doctor.<br>  Good luck withy your baby!|`|AA11627844	ooo maybe your gonna have twins! that would be cool.<br>  just ask your doctor when you go in to make sure you are ok. <br>  good luck.|`|CqxzPWMsaa	Can you move your appointment up to be on the safe side? |`|pcb8watraa	Unless twins run in your family or if you were taking fertility drugs then you are probably not having twins. Give yourself a break. For many of us this is how it is with your second. Wait till your third, it's even worse, LOL.  I looked the same way and hated all the comments about having twins. Your stomach muscles are already stretched out and it's like once they realize you are pregnant again they just assume the position. So don't stress out. Just try to get some belly support as you get bigger. It may help with the stretch marks.  Good luck and congratulations!|`|3PyCIZh2aa	Whether or not it's twins, gas, you're farther along then you thought, your eating alot, constipation or whatever I wouldn't let yourself get too worried.  I've never heard of any complication of which that is a symptom.  To put your mind at ease ask if it is possible to reschedule to a earlier appointment.  |`|dNb3ySTKaa	Well like you said you do get bigger and faster when its not your first pregnancy but usually when yu get big that fast it mean theres more than one but its more if you or the baby's daddy has a history of twins ANYWHERE in their family genes. Good luck i hope you get what you wanna hear|`|9scpRClxaa	I'm 11 weeks with my third and am still in my regular (ok--bloated days--I look like I just need to lay off the doughnuts and do a few crunches) jeans (at least the low-cut ones).  I'd call and get checked, but that's just me.  To make sure there is nothing wrong.  |`|AA12010424	its ok, your stomach muscles after the first child are not the same so therfor after the second your stomach will blow up a little more, i am three months and i look like i am 6 months,i was abit shocked but just the way it goes|`|t16ueKIGaa	Oh tell me about it.<br>  <br>  My first I didn't show until 6 months. Yet this time I had a noticable bump at 12 weeks! We were convinced I had twins. I don't btw, just a normal second pregnancy bump (the size of a house!)|`|XSnj1JWsaa	I was the same way! I was 8 weeks and had to buy a small size of maternity jeans. All my shirts still fit me, but my jeans were sure snug! I got pregnant in October and was showing big time by Christmas. |`|JE7Bcfrmaa	There is a good chance you just have a lot of fluid.. and yes you may have more than one... or two ... or three ? lol <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry|`|bONVrTOdaa	I hate to be blunt, but it may be gas, I done the same thing.  But just to be safe, you should make an appointment. |`|lDupobUOaa	it's possible that there's more than one in there....i would call your doc and let them know what's going on|`|J7skVtRkaa	you could be having twins or triplets|`|DLDweOcYaa	It could be a case of severe bloating maybe?  It's very unusual that you would be showing as early as 7 weeks even if you were having twins (unless you are a very thin woman).<br>  <br>  Congrats by the way.  I found out yesterday that I'm pregnant with baby #2...woo hoo!|`|6d6GHChPaa	See if you can move the appointment up. I am seven weeks tomorrow and will have my first appointment on Tue... most offices try to get you in around the 7th week. Could be that there is more than one in there.

I believe IN it, because it really exists... I've heard of it happening all the time.|`|bzfXbM4raa	I believed it should be used, yes.  But not as a form of birth control.|`|kbIkVS0raa	I believe it is the woman's choice|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|`|hhSgIbSHaa	I believe it is a womens dicision.. I have been there and had to make that decision once in my life and it is a very hard one that should not be judge so easily. People all say they believe what is right and wrong and they never end up in the situation some do. I dont think that it should be used as a form of birth control but i do feel that sometimes we have to make certain decisions our life. I think people should do what is best for them and i certainly do not think it is murder as long as you do not wait to long.|`|2NxBl4t9aa	No not at all! It is murder! Have you ever seen what a fetus looks like at only 8 weeks? They have a heart beat, arms, legs, tiny tiny fingers and toes, and the basis of a nervous system! They only need time to grow! the only way I could see it being ok is if mom would die to have baby! As for me then I would die before killing my child! Not to mention its just the easy way out for people who don't take responsibility for their actions! As far as soaring populations I think birth control and condoms are a much better way to control that then murder! Not to mention the baby never gets a choice to live or not which is not right and therefore abortion should not be allowed! No to abortion!<br>  <br>  Edit: Mz.Myuni we can't view your video so I don't know if you support or do not support abortion! Thanks!|`|593caa49d52a99d80258e45eda9cdf3aaa	No, for my Christian beliefs.  BUT, also, because I can't have kids.  I think it's so selfish that a person, because they couldn't use protection and be smart, kill a kid just because they don't want it.  Well, do you know how many of us are dying inside because we can't have kids?  Why can't you just give it up for adoption.|`|u7kDLuklaa	I believe there are times when an abortion is the best option and i believe in a woman's right to choose.<br>  <br>  Would i have one now?  No.  |`|AA11841749	Absolutely not!  It is the most horrible thing for a woman to do, under ANY circumstance.  Horrible!|`|QL5o5b3eaa	  It's murder.....|`|AA10179693	no|`|uEo0vS7aaa	Only in the case of incest or rape. I say these reasons because It is a great idea to have the baby and put it up for adoption, but how do you explain 18 to 20 years later how the person was conceived? If I was a victim of rape, How would I be able to continue the pregnancy knowing that someone took advantage of me and hurt me physically and mentally? The experts say that it sometimes takes years to get over this mentally. How would I feel having to explain this 18 to 20 years later? It would be a horrible mess. What if me telling that person caused them to hurt or kill themselves because they knew they were already not wanted or even loved in the foster/adoptive care that they were in. Too many young people who have gone through foster care come out sacred for life and then for me to tell them that they were here due to incest or rape? I couldn't, wouldn't put that on anyone. If i get thumbs down on my opinion, that is what it is--My opinion.|`|9LuM1lyUaa	Do I believe in it?  It exists, they've proven it.  It's not something you can really disbelieve.<br>  <br>  Now, do I believe in a woman's right to choose?  Yes, I do.  When you restrict a woman's reproductive rights, you turn her form a human being into an incubator.  Rape, incest, misused contraceptives... these are not something that a woman (AND her child) should be punished for for the rest of their lives.|`|Ve1EQWFTaa	I think the choice ends with having un protected sex... there is no reason to ever have an abortion... it is not the fault of the unborn child that the parents believe they will be lowsy parents or are too busy to take care of them... or that their lives are more important... what ever the reason, the answer is NO I DON'T....|`|0ae94159aebb0543d95ea52595c8db2caa	I personally do not believe in abortion because there are other avenues to take. It's really a personal decision for the woman. |`|eDXO4L4eaa	I think you mean do i believe in abortion? I belive it should only be used before the fetus develops before a certain poiny<br>   |`|DD3pR6oJaa	i would never get one but i am 100% pro-choice. i don't want men to even have an opinion on it, because it is a woman's choice!|`|PwgoRJfTaa	I believe in a woman's right to choose abortion.|`|85c5311997163fb0c9433eafcf8e14c9aa	just wacth this <a href="http://www.abort73.com/video/AbortionMedQT.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.abort73.com/video/AbortionMed...</a>|`|dm4hnEcVaa	No. I would never do that
x0ut6OULaa	You have a 4-month old child and your wife is already pregnant again, because you couldn't be bothered with wearing a condom.<br>  <br>  Suck it up and be a man.  You've created a baby.  Your wife's doctor told her that she could get pregnant at any time even if she hadn't had a period yet.  Her doctor told her to use birth control if the two of you didn't want another baby.  Her doctor told her that women are extremely fertile in the first months after giving birth.  And I'm sure her doctor also told her that even women who breast feed can still get pregnant and should be using birth control.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but I have no sympathy whatsoever for irresponsible adults.  You're married.  You made a baby.  Now you've made a second baby.  Next time she gives birth, remember to use a condom.  Every time.  Or else go get a vasectomy.  <br>  <br>  |`|vKEYa8aeaa	your question makes no sense whatsoever.<br>  <br>  i read your question like 40 times just now and twisted it a whole bunch and came up with maybe you meant when can she get on birth control? she can get on birth control now|`|F78gD5Neaa	Your rambling really doesn't make much sense. I do understand that you want to have your wife have an abortion. As a woman that cannot give her husband a child or adopt (due to financial) I am strictly opposed to abortion. I say if your wife became pregnant then it was meant to be. Suck it up be a man and raise both of the like a family. I realize it may be hard but if I could do it you certainly can to. My 3 sons were very close in age, not planned that way but it happened and I dealt with it with no help.|`|q1842IR6aa	1st of all how do you know your wife is pregnant again?  Did she take a pregnancy test?<br>  <br>  Also, is your wife is nursing the 4 month old baby?  When mothers breastfeed, they tend to not get their periods.<br>  <br>  Did you wife go to the ob/gyn for her check up?  If not, make an appt with her ob/gyn and discuss your concerns with the doc.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|EDdmZhqPaa	hes saying his daughters only 4 months old, and he wants to know how late into a pregnancy can you get an abortion.<br>  <br>  butt, heey maybe you should use protection? if you get an abortion, just think of someone taking your daughters brains out, while shes awake.|`|a03fa4884ad51e3db19db55334d523a5aa	Umm... your question made my head hurt, for i read it a million times and i haven't the slightest idea what you mean.|`|ESZohUFRaa	It took a while, but I'm pretty sure the situation is either:<br>  <br>  He has had a baby daughter, and his wife got pregnant again, and they want to know when to get an abortion<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  His wife is four months pregnant and he wants to know whether they can abort it|`|Vni5Oyueaa	ok if she's 4 months pregnant now its to late to abort. 
CK9R8QLQaa	Legally, you do not have to tell your parents you are going onto birth control. The only problem is if you can't pay for it. <br>  <br>  Anything that happens to you medically is your business and your business only after you turn 15, your parents have no legal right to know. <br>  <br>  If you cannot afford birth control by yourself, find a planned parenting clinic near you and see if you can qualify for government funded birth control.

fHrK4uvSaa	Ehi!! Guarda stai pure tranquilla, perchè una cosa nor-ma-lis-si-ma!!! Se può rincuorarti non sei neppure la prima, fidati, che si è ritrovata in una situazione simile! Infatti, anche il mio ragazzo come il tuo, e, vanne certa, come la maggior parte dei maschietti, ha la rubrica del telefono PiENA ZEPPA di numeri di ragazze!!! Inizialmente da fastidio, ovvio, siamo esseri umani!!! Ma pensaci bene...perchè mai dovrebbe cancellarli?? In fondo se volesse tradirti e avesse bisogno di rintracciare una fanciulla..beh..a cercare ed ottenere il numero da qualcuno, solo perchè glielo hai fatto cancellare, ci metterebbe meno di 2 ore!!! O no??? E poi, insomma..per metter le corna non c'è neanche bisogno di una stupida combinazione...è molto più semplice e lo saprai anche meglio di me!! Inoltre, pensaci un attimo..se chiedesse a te di cancellare tutti i numeri che hai? Non darebbe fastidio? Per quanto possa restarti a gola, mettiti nei suoi panni.....cioè, a me darebbe sui nervi. Ma non tanto quanto perchè ti dovrebbe interessare avere il numero di quello o di quell'altro..però metti che ti fanno uno squillo..almeno sai chi è, cancelli e chissene!!! E ovviamente, se lo fanno al tuo ragazzo il trillino, guarda il lato positivo: almeno sai anche con chi prendertela!!! ^^ Poi, insomma..se proprio alcuni non puoi vedrli..cancella e via!! Io l'ho fatto con i numeri delle ragazze con le quali, magari, parlava in chat...di quelli non se ne fa prorpio nulla!!! Anche del resto..beh..se ne fa di poco sicuro, anzi, non se ne fa proprio di NULLA!! Ma mi fido..e comunque se mi volesse tradire, fino a un certo punto!!! Cioè..coscenza sua, no??? Pensaci su e stai tranquilla!! Dai!! Un bacino..spero di esserti stata d'aiuto!! ^^|`|A8oAjlCNaa	eh madonna... che sarà mai? guarda... il mio ragazzo si sente con la sua ex ma io non ho problemi... lui di amiche ne ha parecchie ed è giusto così... perchè anch'io ho molti amici... sai cosa dovresti fare? fidarti!! tutto qua!!|`|KUIfDDW4aa	fidati!!!di certo c'è un motivo se lui vuole stare con te!!!|`|NzWdqbXSaa	cs te ne frega?|`|RGRLrk5qaa	ma nn devi fare 1 bel niente... come tu hai molti AMICI anke lui avrà molte AMIKE...

R9O9XIcaaa	Je suis certaine que tout va bien se passer.Moi aussi j'ai toujours une petite appréhension quand j'ai rendez vous avec mon gynécologue et pourtant je le vois tous les mois et tous les mois il me montre bébé mais ?a me rassure que quelques jours c'est tout!!!belle journée à toi bises|`|Iz7GwFJUaa	Oui je te comprend j'ai aussi toujours une petite appréhension avant mes rdv chez la gyneco et pareil pour l'echo d'autant que celle des 12 sa est là aussi pour vérifier un certain nombre de critère notamment la netteté nucale pour la trisomie. <br>  <br>  C'est dommage pour papa car là c'est la seule écho où tu vois encore bébé en entier sur uen image aprés c'est des "morceaux".<br>  <br>  Va y avec quelqu'un de ta famille ou de ta belle famille ainsi tu ne sera pas seule.<br>  <br>  Allez bon courage |`|Nv1LF4iJaa	Pauvre chouette! C'est s?r qu'une grossesse c'est beaucoup d'émotions et on est plus sensible, surtout si le papa est loin. Et surtout, on veut que tout aille bien et on veut se faire dire que le bébé va bien et que tout est normal. C'est tout à fait normal d'être inquiète à ce sujet, on veut le meilleur pour notre enfant et pour notre famille. Mais ne laisse pas l'inquiétude saper toute ta joie. Dis-toi bien que dans la grande majorité des cas, tout se déroule très bien et que le bébé est en bonne santé.  <br>  <br>  Et c'est normal d'être mitigée, ne te sens pas coupable pour ?a, c'est bien correct et tout à fait normal et tu n'es pas la seule. <br>  <br>  Personnellement, je crois qu'on a un peu beaucoup trop médicalisée la grossesse. Une grossesse ne devrait pas être suivi par une multitudes d'examens et d'écho. C'est invasif pour le bébé et ?a cause beaucoup de stress pour la maman. Tu as tout à fais le droit de refuser un examen généco ou un écho. Les médecins font au mieux de leur connaissance, mais ils ne sont que des êtres humains faillibles. Une amie à moi s'est fait dire que son bébé n'avait pas d'os dans son nez. Le bébé est né avec un très beau nez... avec un os et tout ce qu'il faut. à une autre, on lui avait dit que son bébé était trisomique, alors qu'il est né en parfaite santé. Tu vois, les médecins ne sont pas des dieux et il faut que tu écoutes ton coeur. Qu'est-ce que tu désires vraiment pendant ta grossesse?<br>  <br>  Sois bénie et que le Seigneur bénisse l'enfant que tu portes et veille sur son bon développement!!!<br>  <br>  Grosse bise! <br>  <br>  |`|X6DkoMvYaa	Pour la 1ère écho mon mari était là mais tu verras une petite crevette.<br>  <br>  Pour la 2e echo mon mari aurait bien aimé venir mais ?a n'était pas possible, on a déjà un enfant et on ne fait pas toujours comme on veut.<br>  <br>  Moi aussi j'angoissais un peu surtout au début quand j'allais voir mon gynéco, j'avais toujours peur qu'il m'annonce une mauvaise nouvelle, mais ?a n'a jamais été le cas et puis quand bien même il t'annoncerait une mauvaise nouvelle tu auras toujours le temps après pour réfléchir avec ton mari à la solution la plus adapter.<br>  <br>  Ne t'inquiète pas tout va bien se passer.|`|YsFzUG7oaa	moi aussi jangoisse avant mes echo jai rdv dans 1 semaines a lecho 2 et deja jai peur certaines prennent ca en etant contente etant sur ke tout va bien mais moi je me dit et si ya kelke chose ki va pas? a l echo des 12 semaines tout aller bien mais depuis 2 semaines je suis allongée car jai mon col ouvert donc jattend la prochaine echo pour voir si cava mieux.mon mari nest pas toujours la mais jy fait des dvd kon se passe en boucle rien ka deux...ma soeur a vu lors d une echo de 20 semaines ke le coeur de son bebe s etait arreter alors ke tout aller bien elle en avait perdu 2 avant ca alors je te dit pas la deprime kelle a eu et kelle a encore depuis 1 an...mais bon esperons ke tout ailles bien pour nous!!!!bonne continuation et dis nous koi!!!|`|EXfuI5tTaa	Si le papa ne peut pas venir avec toi, essaies d'y aller avec une personne proche...

J'ai accouché a terme, et meme 3 jours aprés le terme, c'était un petit fainéant .<br>  Et bien imagine, il s'est retourné 10 jours avant d'accoucher, et bien il m'a fait mal, je l'ai bien sentit, et avant d'accoucher, mon médecin me dit " vous allez pouvoir accouché par voie basse, il est dans la bonne position!" Il m'a fait de belles frayeur.<br>  Il peut se retourner a tout moment... Il n'y a pas de date pour ca .<br>  <br>  Bon courage a toi en tout cas.|`|L2WvVFevaa	si tu choisis de faire la peridurale une cesarienne sera toujours possible si bébé ne se decidait pas a sortir mais tu devrais essayer de parler a ton bébé en lui demandant de se retourner tout en lui faisant des caresses sur ton ventre des fois ca marche et sa ne coute rien bisous|`|07c4198e83db0df29ceeed25bdb5755eaa	pour ma part mon premier fils était en siège et nous avons attendu qu'il se retourne mais rien ! C'est alors qu'a 1 mois du terme le gynéco m'a fait "une version" il retourne le bébé (sous echo) avec les mains. ensuite le bébé avait la bonne position et l'a gardé jusqu'a 9 mois ! par contre un suivant monito tous les deux jours pour voir si le bébé surpporte la nouvelle position. Pour ma part j'ai un problème de bassin et bébé ne passait pas en siège et je ne pouvait pas avoir de péridural pour des problèmes de dos donc pas de césarienne sous péridurale ! donc soit une césarienne sour anesthésie générale soit la version. ON a opter pour la version. Si tu veux des autres présision contacte moi par mail.

SYBfPFcDaa	Only if you're ovulating, but you can ovulate ANY time without knowing about it, so yes it is possible and plenty of people have!|`|a6IzhQfNaa	It is definately still possible to get pregnant then. But it isn't as likely. You are more likely to get pregnant when you are obvulating which usually isn't right after your period and is not during your period. Good luck!
a6IzhQfNaa	My daughter was the exact same way. The trick is committing to a routine that you do every single night: playtime, bath, brush teeth, quietly read books. Then you have to tell him it is time to sleep and put him down in his crib. He is definitely going to throw a tantrum and cry, keep checking on him but don't pick him up. He needs to learn that night is the time for sleeping and nothing he does is going to get him out of that. You need to be able to get sleep to be able to take care of him too! Good luck!|`|EWMUsNHDaa	well i suggest for you to give him a bottle full of milk (10 ounces) and lay beside him then say shh shh shh shh shh shh shh shh and then if u get tired start just ummm like rocking him but not hard real slow....|`|sHHfDscgaa	My 8 month old goes to sleep after a small bowl of cereal and an 8 oz bottle of formula.  he does pretty good until about 2 am and his pacifier falls out of his mouth and then he wakes up.  I know when he gets sleepy with this new schedule we are on and we just put him down with a pacifier and put a blanket next to the side of his face.. VOILA... sleeping child.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best.  But I find that a full belly gets them every time.|`|VjOPdTBoaa	give him a glass of milk before he goes to bad and no soda pop four hours before hr goes to bed at night 
5DK546BUaa	Easy to pronounce and very melodious and pretty...<br>  I love the meaning and history behind the name!<br>  As for being a good name for the USA - don't worry about it. We are a melting pot filled with names from "Cloud" and "Blue" to "Benjamin" and "Elizabeth" to "Gonzalo" and "Frida" - We even boast "Pilot Inspektor", "Kyd", "Apple", "Coco", and "Fifi Trixibelle" - Your choices are just fine, and better then many!<br>  <br>  HTH :-)|`|Y8ZmuWwgaa	As someone of Indian origin born, raised, and living in the US, I can tell you that I love it, personally. I'm not planning to give my children Indian names, but if I were going to, Aditi would be a top contender. <br>  <br>  I have a good friend, also born and raised in the US, whose name is Aditi. As far as I know, she has never had many problems with it- she has never been made fun of, and I don't believe anyone has thought it's too foreign sounding. To the contrary, I know many people have praised her name for being exotic and uncommon; it does sound sophisticated, in my opinion. <br>  <br>  I'd say it's fair as pronunciation- I used to go to school with an Aditi as well, and I know people sometimes pronounced it "Uh-dee-dee", but after being corrected, they were okay, and usually pronunced it correctly. <br>  <br>  I have an Indian name as well- Sharmila- and I think there will always be a few thick people who can't process foreign names, but thankfully, these people are the very small minority. Aditi is as good and will be as easy to pronounce as any other Indian name- I have never encountered any Aditi in the US being made fun of for her name or having any major problems with it.<br>  <br>  I think it's beautiful- it's a great choice! <br>  <br>  EDIT: And as someone above me said, America is the land of Jagger Blue, Apple, Coco Riley, and Nevaeh. So I highly doubt Aditi would get made fun of next to these ;)|`|LM5X30C7aa	No - Choose something that she's not going to be made fun of. I was a family day care carer and it's hard trying to remember and pronounce these "unusual" names that don't roll off the tongue. The other chn used to have trouble too. She'll get called 'Titty" - yuk.  There's some beautiful girls names around. Unless this name holds some significance, find something else.|`|eeee2f2fbb78961fe66b645a046c24b0aa	Dee-tee-dee or dee-dee-dee is slang for a really stupid, idiotic, or moronic person. So i suppose some kid will figure that out and call her that at one point in her life... But they'll find something for ANY name really! Go with what you love, teach her to be confident, and she'll be alright :)<br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|Uz4V7Jckaa	I know a girl from India called Aditi. I would say, unless you're from that culture, don't give your child that name, it's trashy/ridiculous.|`|tEVpc0Cpaa	Well, its as good a name as any. Does it mean anything special to you? It's nice to have a name, that has a story or meaning to it. <br>  Too foreign sounding? Perhaps... but it's the US. If you can't call your baby a foreign name there, where can you?  :)<br>  <br>  Besides, I think you can make fun of every names. If not the name, then something else. Children will always find something they can make fun of...|`|4f472af39c19b74a29ee86bfa81438daaa	hey cmon.... why worry about others making fun of little things..... ppl always tend to make fun of one thing or the other if not the name then ur physical self... If u like the name...., its a hit . and if u don't ...well think of something else... But never have this jerky kinda feeling that others can make fun of this or that... ppl are bound to make fun of everything they do not have... hope u getting it... Best of luck.. |`|hln7Hyiwaa	I think it's a lovely name, and I don't think she will be made fun of, it seems like a simple name.I love it, but being the mom it is totally your choice to decide if you like it or not.|`|T9SS5QBmaa	I pronounced it A-die-et-tee.<br>  <br>  I like it tho|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Any name where you feel the need to tell people what the pronunciation is, you need to consider that your child will have to do that their entire life.
MMpAbD14aa	I am 13 weeks and i rode the boat that goes in the air back and forth and my baby is perfectly fine it actually made him happy. The only reason some of those signs say not to ride is because the bars push down on your stomach pretty hard. All in all things like bumper cars or roller coasters are not good. Also its okay to be scared it wont hurt your baby. Good luck and stop getting bad advice from people that aren't pregnant or had never been unless they are doctors.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Being scared will not harm your baby.<br>  <br>  Some amusement park rides are safe, others are not.  Usually the rides will  have a warning posted if they are not safe.  (In general roller coasters and very bumpy rides are potentially  hazardous. Something like a merry go round or ferris wheel should be fine.)|`|9f363935da83a04ad649588218c4b33caa	You'd need to read the signs for the haunted house and the rides. If it's not safe for you to do something, it will be posted on a sign outside the ride.|`|ErCJnABBaa	I have been told that a pregnant woman should NOT be startled.  So if you are going to one of these haunted houses where people try to jump out at you to startle you, then I would skip it.  But if its a haunted house like the one at Disney World where you just sit in a car and look at supposedly scary stuff, then that will not be a problem.<br>  <br>  Rides that create any sort of centrifical force or high g-forces are out.  These would include ALL roller coasters as well as my extream rides (think Mission Space, Test Track just to name a few that come to mind at Disney World).<br>  <br>  Those with MINOR forces are sort of an "it depends" type situation.  As a specific example, our OB said that DW could ride the "Tea Cups" as long as we didn't spin them.|`|LeNeinDUaa	haunted house: yes, as long as you are walking and not on one of those jerky little moving carts.<br>  <br>  Amusement park rides: NO, not ok.|`|e8HCEZDpaa	Amusement park rides are an ABSOLUTE NO NO!!!!!!!! Do not ride any rides it can cause you to go into premature labor. |`|p6AMoTs8aa	No amusement park rides and being scared is ok|`|7edddef837f9013ff2f1f46a6893dcb7aa	Being scared won't cause any harm to you or the baby, but be extremely careful with amusement park rides. Something like a ferris wheel should be ok, but DO NOT ride roller coasters or ANYTHING that has high speeds and/or sudden changes in direction.  Anything that jerks or jars you at high speeds has the potential to cause a placental abruption, which is hazardous to you and your baby.|`|41f3f511fdae8607c1e4c4ccb58ae109aa	I rode the rides at Sea World San Diego when I was 16 weeks.  Everything was completely fine.

GOD.<br>  <br>  You are an embarrassment to everyone around you. I hope your parents find out.<br>  <br>  Obviously, I think it's a horrible, sluttty, selfish, rotten thing to do.|`|3914f07763f3427f6a3a80bad01d0e3caa	Do you care about the relationship? If it's something you won't miss then go for it.<br>  <br>  It might get weird between you and your boyfriend afterwards though. Or heck, you might have changed feelings about being with a girl!<br>  <br>  It would be an experience though. ;D|`|HcCYeLMAaa	i say why not your curious right ? i mean why not do it now i really would. BUT the only thing is i think you should pick the girl with him. ( same age ]|`|CXHY5Inxaa	nasty whore|`|dqvZmj22aa	You're grounded.  No TV or internet for a month, only going to school, church and shopping with your family.<br>  <br>  Your BF is just not treating you with the respect you deserve.  You can do better.<br>  <br>  Sex isn't just there to feel good.  It means something.  Done right it's about 2 people becoming one soul for a few seconds or longer, making a permanent connection.<br>  <br>  I'm not blaming you, no one TOLD you it was important and almost religious.  They either told you "just be abstinent" or told you it'd give you a disease and kill you.<br>  <br>  But the truth is, it's important.  It's not a game.<br>  <br>  I give you a high score for wanting to get opinions first though.  Any time you need advice, look me up.  You seem like too smart a person to NOT help.|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	I wont get into all the no sex blah i think everyone has already done that lol but i will say alot of professionals have said three-ways will destroy  relationships. do some looking into this. Alot of sex talk doctors do not advise this because it does hurt most relationships. Many reasons. I am not saying it always does because there is some couples who r fine haven a swingers relationship. But u say a one time things but u dont know that this could open soo many unwanted doors for ur relationship. |`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	BAD idea!<br>  <br>  According to the advice show "Love Line", and just about everyone else who is in any position to know, a three-way will destroy any relationship.  Not only does one person miss out on most of the 'action', they usually lose their partner to the third person, too.|`|651039784dab016323f64ae9cd179fd4aa	wow , u really dont have anything better to discuss--perhaps something like school, sports, education might be nice for a change. <br>  How about a threesome with math, science, and soccer? every tried that?|`|kmu0fYXdaa	*ACHHHU* ACHHHHU* *COUGH* *COUGH*<br>  Excuse me,sorry I'm allergic to whorebags.|`|FhSCxiPZaa	uhm, probably not the best idea, i wouldnt go for it.|`|88A9Xcd9aa	Ur 15 and already thinking of that crap?<br>  WOW... <br>  That quite insane.. <br>  I mean cuz im 14 and im not even thinking of sex yet.. Not even close.. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry but thats just sad.. that a 15 yr old wants a threesome<br>  |`|SWOeg0jFaa	I think it's bad enough having sex at 15, but i'm not going to judge you and it's actually becoming really common at this age.<br>  As for the three some though, now that is just STUPID.<br>  I won't even begin to get into the troubles it will cause with your boyfriend, your sexuality etc.|`|3SUKMps4aa	Are you sure you can take that?You and other girl having sex with your BF?haha your cool.Dont do that honey,thats a very bad idea.Unless you can take a scenario seeing your bf ******* with other girl.Stop exploring.Learn your limit you are too young for that.|`|gWIRjPMRaa	Id say NOT to go for it!<br>  Threesomes are tricky and especially hard when there's emotions involved. You mentioned it yourself with all those rules you've already made up. It has to be a nice girl, have to check for STD's, you don't wanna have to run into her, and probably the biggest problem, you don't want just her and your boyfriend to have sex without you.<br>  Plus, if you give into this sexual fantasy, he will probably ask for more and then it will ultimately ruin your relationship.<br>  So age really has nothing to do with it (even though you are a bit young), threesomes are just not a good idea in general.|`|q0vvy4yDaa	okay im 17 and have sex with my boyfriend on the real ive been confronted with the same question but what you need to ask yourself is do you want to have you boyfriend give another girl the same feeling he gives you expecially if you love him <3 think about it and in my advice dont do it because it will mess the whole relationship up in the long run trust once you say yes in there mind when you aint around it will be okay too <3 dont start something that will always cause trouble <3 now you an a girl no boi thats a diffrent story but dont bring the one you love into it just say no thats how you get mixed feelings trust me babe good luck <3 <br>  <br>  and 9 out 10 chances you two will break up one day and the next hell be out telling everyone even if he dont wait till you break up then you will look stupid because you let your man have sex with someone else if you dont care about him like that hey go for it lol its fun but if you love him and have second thoughts just dont do it say no and thats it <3 he should except it with i love you baby its okay <3 (kiss)|`|UGlrKVOOaa	First of all, you are disgusting. A baby whore. Secondly, don't ask for an opinion and then say what you DONT want to hear. Most people would think this is a bad idea. Go play with barbies or something.|`|21WWkxNRaa	 I would say try it then Ask him to try it with 2 guys and your self. <br>   than you will Know  if this is for you or not. <br>   <br>    don't do it for him only because he want to.|`|PW1EZXb2aa	This might be the worst idea I have ever heard. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Congratulations. Not many 15-year old girls could achieve that, though many have tried.|`|XcvgVC1zaa	hmm, Its not a bad idea if u want to experiment but on the downside if u break up with him he could tell his friends that ur a nasty lesbian.|`|abELhjcoaa	not a good idea, that other girl might think differently, like she can automatically get to your boyfriend.|`|foxdgfqsaa	That's a horrible idea!<br>  Sounds like your boyfriend is pushing you around.|`|xWQsLmnZaa	you really need to consider your own feelings even if you are involved you still may get jealous so don't ruin ur relationship with a fantasy but all in all it is your choice! good luck chicky! xxxx |`|g68eksvFaa	Sure, just don't let your balls touch the other girl's balls. That would be gay.|`|iUjebGoVaa	1 word, DON'T|`|qL3iB0J4aa	What a terrible idea for a 15 year old to have.|`|kcX0M3Ujaa	i say go for it, u only live once and if that's wat u wanna do then do it now while ur a teenager|`|36a7a8863eef1ee46758f389f9b14240aa	try to imagine what it's gonna be like to see your boyfriend kissing and doing things with another girl. what if he spends more time or looks more excited to be with her than you? it may haunt you forever... and eventually destroy your relationship. if you are willing to risk that, than go for it.|`|HfyPZPxGaa	-_- you're 15 and want a threesome?  Oh God.<br>  It's a horrible idea.  Your boyfriend is going to stick his d*ck inside of another, hot, naked girl.  You sure you won't care?  You'll get to watch her suck his d*ck and him eat her out.  Does that sound like you'll enjoy yourself?<br>  <br>  Sounds like a dumb idea to me.  |`|SYG30HNtaa	WOW !!! KIDS these days!!! Im speechless!|`|6cbc2a815fcf33f3ee0adefcbe3c0ea2aa	i smell a troll<br>  its a really,really bad idea...slut<br>  just letting you know<br>  :]|`|P8TsHXjDaa	wow ur a slut|`|3HVFXr5caa	Slutty lil whore...Your man is tired of you and wants to do another prettier girl....Why dont you tell him you will have a 3sum but instead of a girl have another guy???? ughhh his answer will be Fu** no!!! why? because he wants a new girl...duh...plus Your still a lil girl...a slutty one tho|`|bGhkROHUaa	Firstly, all the guys who are calling you a whore are jealous of your boyfriend because he gets to be in a threesome.<br>  <br>  Secondly, your 15 you can have sex at any age you want who cares about the government and laws and crap! It's juts a guideline.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, i'm a guy and i've had a threesome, except it was with three men, yeah, i know i'm gay, get over it. It was exciting, erotic and stimulating and my bf was there with me. When he spent time with the other guy i didn't get jealous it was good to see him enjoy himself. So if you want to go for it but it's not for every one. <br>  <br>  Good luck xx
dORUrbtFaa	Morgan Stacy sounds like an investment firm. Stacy Elaine sounds more feminine.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Morgan Stacy. :-)|`|a7b0f3b04cf7d99c5437ad1f0db9d73eaa	I like Stacy Elaine better.  |`|HBgnkltfaa	Neither combination sounds quite right to me, but if I had to pick, I'd go with Stacy Elaine.<br>  <br>  Morgan Stacy is a bit monotonous, since both names are two syllables with the stress on the first syllable.  Stacy Elaine has a better rhythm (since Elaine is stressed on the second syllable), but the "ee" sound at the end of Stacy and the beginning of Elaine tend to run together.  For a girls' name, I like Stacy slightly better than Morgan.<br>  <br>  If it's important to you that the combination of first and middle sound good, you might want to consider Anastasia Elaine.  Stacy, of course, is a common nickname for Anastasia, so you still could call her by the first name you love.  She would just have something a bit more lyrically-pleasing on her birth certificate.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	I like Morgan Stacy - still not crazy about it though.<br>  Stacy is waaaay out of style.<br>  <br>  something like Elaina Morgan would be better.|`|117ba8dee6d7175b6b3f5e2480ad6007aa	Morgan Stacy|`|fthTHYFgaa	Stacey Elaine|`|30NIoWmsaa	Morgan Stacy if you are looking for a modern name, but Stacy Elaine flows better and a little more old-fashioned. I really like both though!|`|rHZivjUGaa	Morgan Anastacia!|`|mJaEsxwCaa	Well Morgan Stacy sounds really nice for a little baby girl. |`|qmvJPRlVaa	Stacy Elaine is really cute.

I like that one best!
S7Pc5iAMaa	She is old enough. Don't take her. Besides it is good for you and your husband to stick together with discipline. I think it is a perfect opportunity actually, because Halloween is fun and she might feel the sting a little bit more than just taking something else away like a toy. SO I'd stick to it. Remind her why she's missing out, and hey she can think about that all night. Its tough but she's way too old to be tossing herself on the floor for soda. Act now.  |`|vcwk9HhPaa	In my personal opinion I wouldn't take her. 8 is old enough to understand. She embarrased you and she knows it. She went out of her way to be a brat and needs to be punished.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	Either find a sitter (grammy, aunty) or ask your husband to sit with her while you take the boys. Stick to your guns or she is likely to continue on ruling over you.|`|BzvstX7uaa	Just because she is acting 2 does not mean she IS 2. Of COURSE she is old enough to connect not going with her behavior.<br>  <br>  It's easy sometimes to think that your child doesn't understand things but they DO....<br>  <br>  In my opinion she shouldn't go. I know you feel bad, and I'd feel bad too, but if you give in, it'll just get worse. I would respect what your husband said....HE is right, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|ILcmgBtraa	  Don't let her go but definitely take the boys.  You can also tell her that her behavior about it and while you are gone will decide if she is able to even go out on Friday.  Let her know that continuing to act like a brat will result in more discipline.  <br>    I would guess that this isn't the first time that you and/or dad have not followed through with a punishment.   Both of you need to have a serious conversation with each other about what is expected of her and what will happen when she doesn't behave.  Then, when one disciplines her it will be a punishment that both have previously agreed upon.  And then sit down and calmly explain it to her.  She is definitly old enough to know what she's doing and she has figured out that it works for her.   But make sure that you are not always making her feel like the "bad" child compared to her brothers.  That might be why she's continued acting out.  Good luck|`|ZUIVl95Uaa	I would have punished her more severely than that. Behavior like that is completely unacceptable. No, she shouldn't be allowed to go. Either you or your husband or a sitter will have to stay home with her while the other kids are taken to the party. |`|mouMh76Haa	Oh that would be infuriating. Stick up with your husband, do not allow her to go to the halloween thing. She knows better, shes needs  aserious talking to about how that behavior is not acceptable ever. And that if hes going to act like a two year old then she will be treated as one. I would take away a couple other priviledges too and have her work to earn them back, work by better behavior around the house and in public and things like that. Her age is the perfect age to have a reponsibilities and priviledges chart. Good luck~|`|ptw4S75paa	#1 you should never go over what another parent has said no matter how hard it is to follow through!  If my husband punishes or I do and the other doesn't like it we talk about it behind closed doors and we still do not change the punishment so the child does not loose respect for the other. <br>  <br>  #2 No she doesn't deserve to go *punshment was she doesn't get to go b/c of her actions and by letting her go next time she throws a two yr old fit then she isn't going to believe the punshment.<br>  <br>  #3 Take the other children why should they have to seve her punishent when they did nothin wrong! At 8yrs old she is old enough to know there is consquences for our actions.|`|G9tgmXslaa	Yes, it's kind of harsh, but maybe this punishment is just the thing that will get her thinking about the consequences of her actions. You're probably feeling a little guilty about nixing the party for her, but there'll be a party next year (if she learns to behave! lol).|`|5Lmss62Laa	Since she is 8, I would talk to her about what happened and find out what's going on. Tell her how you want her to behave. <br>  <br>  If she seems to understand the talk and why she should not behave this way, tell her she has 1 single chance. Go to the party, but if there is any bad behaviour (and warn her about this) take her home, ignoring the arguments. <br>  Give her a chance to show you she can behave. Because if she was just banned, she may not learn from it at all - just sulk as you said. <br>  <br>  If, however, during this talk, she is not receptive to trying to behave, then don't let her go. |`|CP9HIoDqaa	Don't let her go! I would have done more than just that even. That behavior would never get past me. I think you should not only make her stay home, but also make her write an apology to the store for her interruption. I'm a hair stylist, so i see that often. It is disturbing. <br>  Good luck! :]|`|EmUGA5Igaa	that punishment is good she needs to learn take her next year and talk to her about her actions|`|LNnRSLdtaa	id take the boys and not take her or bring her any bag home. if you do take her something home itl teach her that even if she doesnt go to an event shel still get a treat <br>  which wont stop that behaviour.<br>  so even though shel get upset/angry dont bring her anything <br>  only way she will learn<br>  <br>  and if she does that again in a store just ignore her and be like 'okay bye im going now' and walk away <br>  shel get up and come after you|`|IHce6jz1aa	I know it will be hard for you to do, but listen to Gemini.  He/She's hit this one right on the nail.|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	Yes, take the boys and leave the girl at home.  She should not be allowed to go after behavior like that and the boys should not be punished by not getting to go because their sister was a brat and can't go. |`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Honestly, I don't think the punishment was severe enough!  I mean, I know she's your daughter so I won't be unnecessarily harsh here, but if she were my daughter, I would have spanked her bottom for that display once I got her home.  She is far too old to throw temper tantrums like that, over something like soda pop!  Does she do this at school too?<br>  <br>  Anyway, the punishment I would give is this:  rather than leave her home to sulk and learn anything useful about consequences, I would take her along, but make her wear regular clothes instead of a costume, and I'd also make her sit there on the sidelines watching everyone have fun but refuse to let her participate.  Bring her costume along and tell her that she may be able to earn her party privileges back if she behaves herself while sitting there and reflecting on what she did.  After ten minutes or so (which is a LOOOOONG time when you're 8), if she's been good and not caused a scene, go help her change into her costume and allow her to join the party.  It seems harsh, but children respond much better to this type of punishment than simply being "grounded."  Either way, definitely take the boys- don't ever punish them just because you're punishing their sister.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	She is 8 years old.. plenty old enough to be punished in such a way...absolutely the punishment should stick...by the way, she didn't act like a 2 year old, she acted like a spoiled, undisciplined child.  Two year olds only act like that if they are allowed to act that way by their parents.
Ujxrpoonaa	Diapers aren't that expensive... Its cheaper than gas right now, put it that way. There are Luvs that are very cheap, and then there are store brand diapers that aren't bad either. As far as formula goes, it is seriously the most expensive thing to buy. $75 of formula goes easy in about 3 weeks. You can avoid forlmula all in all and breastfeeding though. Also you could go on WIC. They help with formula and baby food each month. Having a baby doesn't have to be that expensive. Save up and look for good deals everywhere.|`|UACyjrtDaa	If you can, try breastfeeding - it's free and the most healthy way to nurish your baby : )<br>  <br>  Diapers are expensive, so you actually could start buying some if you truly are planning on having a baby soon. I'm due in two weeks, but I've been buying diapers when I see a good sale, or have a coupon. <br>  <br>  You could consider doing cloth diapers, which are better for the environment as well. You wash them when they are soiled. You can get these at a variety of stores. Also, becasue they are reusable, you save money in the long run I would assume.|`|MiiYQc0Oaa	Cloth diapers = less than $100 for all you'll need until toddlerhood.<br>  Breastfeeding = free.|`|7Rf1ju2Eaa	Babies are expensive. It's not just diapers and milk. They cost a hell of a lot more than that.|`|qOBYfdlBaa	I don't think diapers are too expensive...depends on which brand you get.  I did pampers til my son was in size 2's.  Then I switched to LUVS...they are just as good as pampers/huggies and are cheap.  And now for some reason Walmart doesn't sell luvs anymore so I tried "White Cloud" they are $7.50(after tax) for a 40 pck.  And I think they work better than Luvs, and that is really cheap!!  Now formula on the other hand is very expensive, I had to get on WIC and I got 9 cans a month free, but had to buy 2 a month bc my son was a piggy.  But if you can breastfeed I would do that, it will save you lots of  money.  Good luck, I'm only 21 but I absolutely LOVE being a mommy :)  My son is 18 months now...he keeps me on my toes :P|`|nti4j9k2aa	I agree with the above poster who suggested breast feeding, not only is it free but it's so much better for your baby than formula.<br>  <br>  The Walmart diapers really suck. i tried them and they leak. I don't think they hold as much, so I guess you get what you pay for.<br>  <br>  To be honest with you, even with formula and diapers, the baby years aren't that expensive compared to later. Once they are toddlers there is preschool to pay for, then when they are school age it's school fees, clothes are more expensive, sports fees and uniforms. And Holy cow, teenagers are the worst. My teens are putting me in the poor house and they really arent't that spoiled.<br>  <br>  That being said, I have a friend who says that if you wait to have a baby until you can afford it, you'll never have a baby.<br>  <br>  I'm one for planning ahead though.It's no fun telling your kid all the time they can't have or do what their frineds are doing because you don't have the money.<br>  <br>  My advice-If you are still young, take this time to get an education or work on your career. It will really save you lots of headaches in the long run. Money isn't everything, but it sure does make things easier.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|isokr9cfaa	yes it's expensive, name brand formula is $25 a can and babies typically go through a can a week and diapers are about $20 and babies go through two boxes a month. You can save by breastfeeding; it's free. And use cloth diapers. They're a hassle though so I recommend buying parents choice diapers from Walmart, they work well and don't leak. |`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	Disposable diapers are expensive but you can cuts costs with good cloth diapers. It is a one time investment but if you get pocket diapers like Tiny Tush elite they will last your child from birth to 2 years old at least! <br>  <br>  Formula is expensive too... but you can breastfeed if you want. Otherwise you may want to stock up during sales. |`|m0qOXx4Paa	I just had a baby three months ago and here is what I have spent so far...AT LEAST 11.00 a week on diapers, 2.00 a week on wipes, 25.00 a week on formula ...that is 800 dollars in three months on JUST those items...not counting bottles, pacies, clothes, blankets, toy, doctors, ect|`|TkSY2ZUfaa	Diaper are really expensive but since I breastfeed I haven't spent a dollar on formula :) I do own a pump and a few bottles
c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	Having quints is no big deal? I beg to differ. To answer your question some people, such as myself, are not so lucky to conceive with out help and need to turn to fertility treatments. Though the goal of fertility treatments is to conceive one baby, sometimes multiples are conceived and women choose not to "reduce" their pregnancy. Multiples are never intentional with fertility treatments. Conceiving multiples may seem pretty common but it is in actuality rare. And, as someone with no children, I would consider twins a miracle.|`|LfRN4Z6qaa	I recently read in my biology book that the birth rate of twins is up 83% from 1980. Its all of the fertility drugs and doctors now days. It also said multiple births are up 600% percent since then 600%! Its quite crazy how this is changing families around America. I find it funny how 8 children at once are never naturally born. The body knows what it can handle.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Fertility drugs and procedures.|`|ddP3klT3aa	I was wondering the same thing. Seems like every one is having twins. Maybe some thing in the water? haha. Oh well. There is nothing wrong with multiples as long as they can afford them.

It is very unique and adorable, yet elegant.<br>  <br>  Angelina is pretty popular of a name, and people that are named something close to that (like me) often get frustrated when people call us that, not that the name is bad, just kind of used a lot.<br>  <br>  Also, with Evangeline, there will be so many awesome nicknames! With Angelina, it's pretty much just Angie.|`|ipzJlIUkaa	Evangeline is beautiful and exotic.

bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Babies need to feed on demand.  It's normal for a 7 week old to feed frequently.  Here's an article I found:<br>  <br>  During the early weeks of breastfeeding, you may feel as though you're nursing your baby constantly, and wonder if your baby really needs all that nursing. Keep in mind that young babies have tiny stomachs — about the size of a walnut. Easily digested breast milk quickly fills their little stomach and is absorbed, so it's no wonder they need to eat again relatively soon.<br>  <br>  If your baby seems hungry soon after eating (fussy, sucking on his fist, or rooting at your breast), go ahead and feed him again. Keep in mind, too, that babies are just hungrier on some days than on other days and will want to eat more than usual. These days are called "frequency days" and are thought to precede growth spurts.<br>  <br>  While being aware and responsive to your baby's cues to feed, also be aware that some very young babies don't yet have the strength to wake up and demand to be fed. Sometimes a premature, jaundiced, or sick baby is too small and sleepy to cry, conserving energy for growth and recovery instead. If your baby's hunger cues are slight or nonexistent, be sure to wake him at least every three hours and encourage him to nurse. A newborn who regularly sleeps longer than three to four hours needs close monitoring to make sure he gains enough weight.|`|4w9gmvumaa	You are supposed to feed your baby as needed.  If you're breastfeed especially, you want to feed him as needed and he can never eat too much from the breast.  Also, make sure he is not falling asleep halfway through the feeding.  That will keep him hungry as well.  Alot of babies do that.  Feed your baby until he gets that Ugh, I'm full look on his face. =)  Then let him have a big burp and a good ol' nap. =)  |`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	breast or bottle? it's normal fo breastfed babies to want to eat a lot. they don't do it for jsut food but for comfort and to also keep your supply. up. some bottlefed babies do it too. they jsut want to suck. when they go through growth spurts they are like that too|`|cG80UU5Waa	no. if a baby that young is hungry, feed it. call your pediatrician to make sure that nothing is wrong. |`|hrMhhB4Saa	if he want sto eat every hour, maybe you shoudl try feeding him a little more at 1 feeding.. he should be able to go eatleast 2 hours between feedings|`|Xc02z608aa	feed him when he's hungry whether it be every hour and a half or every 3 hours.  Let him tell you when he needs to eat.|`|a2134372f454ba425d7b423ac42d1ed2aa	Feed On Demand<br>  |`|UmqLkwAraa	NO dont ever make ur baby wait to eat because maybe last feeding he didnt eat as much last time so hes going to be hungry again sooner i have 3 kids and when my kids were hungry they got there food or give him a pacifer because he might not be hungry how i new is i put the pacifer in there mouth and give it a sec and pulled on the pacifier if it was hard to pull out they were hungry and it it wasnt then they just wanted to suck on something hope it helps for u my kids werent really crazy for a pacifier well good luck|`|n2bQiWwhaa	how much is he eating every hour an a half?? And no, you shouldn't make him wait, if he's hungry, feed him. He knows how much he needs to eat, its just up to you to give it to him. My daughter was the same way, and she is just fine.

How do you think a potential employer is going to take some one named Elektro? seriously???? <br>  <br>  As a Mom, I would ask you to not do that to your child.

I'm not putting it down because it is unique, but I wouldn't use it for a first name. It would be a cool middle name though. When naming a child you have to think about their future.

7LjIzOJcaa	"You can make your own baby wipes. You can use something like paper towels if you just want to control what's on the wipe and for budget reasons.<br>  <br>  Or use cloth baby wipes (which can be washed along with your diapers).<br>  <br>  When you use homemade baby wipes recipes you can either make your wipes solution in a bottle or put it right in the wipes container.<br>  <br>  If you put it directly into the container your wipes are ready to go as soon as you need them. You may need to change your wipes every day using this method if you find they smell musty.<br>  <br>  If you want to put the solution into a small bottle find an inexpensive spray bottle. You can find small ones in the health and beauty section of most drug stores or beauty supply stores. When you need to wipe your baby wet your cloth wipe with warm water and then give a spritz or two of your wipes solution.<br>  <br>  You can keep a small container with a tight-fitting lid filled partway with water at your changing station if it is not near a sink. Then have your wipes stacked up and your wipes solution next to the water container at the changing table.<br>  <br>  Here are some homemade baby wipes recipes:<br>  Baby Wash Recipe #1<br>  <br>      * 2 TBSP Baby Wash (choose a natural wash!)<br>      * 2 TBSP Olive Oil<br>      * 2 Cups water<br>  <br>        Mix well in a spray bottle or your wipes box. Spritz on wipe before using if in spray bottle. Swish solution around over wipes if using a wipes box.<br>  <br>  Baby Wash Recipe #2<br>  <br>      * 2 TBSP Baby Wash<br>      * 2 TBSP Olive Oil or 1 TBSP Calendula Oil<br>      * 2 Drops Tea Tree Oil<br>      * 2 Cups Water<br>  <br>        Mix well in a spray bottle or your wipes box. Spritz on wipe before using if in spray bottle. Swish solution around over wipes if using a wipes box. Tea Tree Oil has lovely disinfectant properties along with its wonderful, clean smell.<br>  <br>  Aloe Vera Recipe<br>  <br>      * 1/4 Cup Aloe Vera Gel<br>      * 2 Drops Tea Tree Oil<br>      * 2 Cups Hot Water<br>  <br>        Stir or shake until this recipe is well mixed. Don't use until the mixture cools. Spritz on wipe before using if in spray bottle. Swish solution around over wipes if using a wipes box.<br>  <br>  Vitamin E and Essential Oils Recipe<br>  <br>      * 2 Drops Tea Tree Oil<br>      * 2 Drops Lavender Oil (Please be sure to use only pure essential oils - don't use synthetic oils.)<br>      * 2 Drops Chamomile Oil<br>      * 2 Cups Water<br>      * 1 Vitamin E Cap<br>  <br>        Cut open vitamin E caplet and squeeze into the water, and add essential oil drops. Mix well in a spray bottle or your wipes box. Spritz on wipe before using if in spray bottle. Swish solution around over wipes if using a wipes box.<br>  <br>  Cloth wipes are truly easy to use. Or you can simply use warm water on your baby's bottom unless you're changing a particularly messy diaper.<br>  <br>  If you notice that your baby is about to poop, you can always remove his or her diaper and hold baby over the toilet. Otherwise, your handy wipes are always available! Just pick one of these homemade baby wipes recipes and mix it up to have on hand.<br>  <br>  You can premix your wipes solution and moisten a few wipes when you're out and about. Simply place them into a re-sealable plastic bag, or into a travel wipes container and you're ready to go. Throw them into the dirty duds bag or a plastic shopping bag along with your diapers when you use them."|`|E0HAU5nLaa	Years ago i had a teacher in college that was kinda a hippie. And he and his wife made their own wipes. He would use the softest napkins and wet them then he would put baby lotion. He would let them soak and use them as baby wipes. I didn't like it. If you want a cheap way out i found that parents choice was great. A warm wash cloth is great also. But please never never buy a wipe warmer. It is a waste of money because when you go to get your child's wipes they are dry like a paper towel. Now that's a real waste of money.|`|VZkKC5M0aa	Well what works for me is to have 2 tuppewares on the changing table.<br>  <br>  The first one contains washcloths and water, and the second one only contains water.<br>  <br>  So I take a "wipe" out of the first container, wipe my baby, then rinse it out in the second container.  Then I put it back in the 1rst container if all I wiped was pee.<br>  <br>  If it's poo, then I rinse out the cloth in the laundry sink and let it soak in the pail of dirty cloth diapers.<br>  <br>  I don't worry that the "wipe" doesn't have aloe or whatever, I just put on some light cream on my baby's bum every time.  It's worked well so far.  |`|J9Tbun7naa	Wash cloth and some warm water...|`|aLAmvX5Naa	You can make them however you like. Take a roll of paper towel off the roll, cut it in half and put it in a plastic gallon ziplock bag. You then just grab a big pot, add water, baby soap, and some oils for fragrance if you like. When the mixture cools you pour it in the bag. The paper towels will absorb it all up.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	No. By the time you did all that you could have bought them cheaper in the store.|`|um29wkUPaa	Use an existing wipe container<br>  Cut a roll of paper towels in half.<br>  in the bottom of the container, use a little bit of baby oil, water,alcohol and dish soap.  <br>  <br>  voila!<br>  |`|FYiKgeN8aa	The best baby wipe (to me at least) is a baby washcloth in warm water.  Easy to use, easy to clean, cheap, and reusable so it's good for the environment.|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	Washclothes and warm water work very well and are sensitive on baby's skin.  You can buy inexpensive ones at the dollar store since you'll likely go through lots.|`|W8UZebRWaa	I read a while ago to cut a roll of paper towels in half and soak them in baby oil. <br>  Seems like it would be greasy to me but thats what I heard!
bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	If you google this you'll find tons of information.  <br>  <br>  Basically to sum it all up, the sex of the fetus can be determined on a regular ultrasound at around 11-12 weeks.  It is however quite difficult that early as the sex organs are just newly developed and aren't always that easy to see.  Further, to catch a glimpse the baby will need to fully "cooperate" and be in the right position.  According to ultrasound techs that I know, it's quite a bit easier to see a penis that early than the labia.  Further, the better the tech is and the better the equipment is the easier it will be to identify the sex.  Various articles I read state that at 12 weeks any gender prediction you do get is going to be between 80%-98% accurate.  The accuracy goes way up by the 18 week scan.<br>  <br>  I tested this out personally last week at my 12 week 1 day scan.  The ultrasound tech looked around for a while then all of a sudden clear as day we saw two legs, a bum and right in the middle a very clear penis and testicles.  The tech was fairly certain we weren't looking at cord that it was indeed a penis.  <br>  <br>  As for when to go for a scan, if this is going to be your only one then I'd think you should go around 18 weeks as the sex will likely be more clear and typically that's when they do a check of all the anatomy etc.<br>  <br>  (Can I just throw in that I can't imagine having to pay for a scan, I'm feeling very blessed to be in Canada where we don't pay for any medical testing/treatment).  |`|ByUS0k8waa	They can tell the best at 20 weeks. Good luck! |`|Vap2hLWhaa	At 20 weeks it will more than likely be very easy to tell babys sex and check for any health conditions. |`|LXc9tGJVaa	Usually 4 1/2-5 months (18-20 weeks) is standard with most places. They waited until I was 22 1/2 weeks, I assume because I have crappy insurance.|`|no9N3zjMaa	You can tell at 15 weeks it's not accurate till like 18 weeks but you should go before 22 weeks. |`|SfymamWtaa	4 months|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	I went at 22 weeks with both my sons.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Im haveing my baby's gender checked at 25 weeks, just to make totally sure. Womb with a view suggests the mother is between 24- 34 weeks pregnant for the ultrasound. They will do it sooner, it's just recommended then. The doctor usually does it at 20 weeks but it's black and white. I'm 19 weeks and I don't get one of those :(|`|SJkhbRmSaa	You want to go between 18 and 21 wks. If you go later, the baby can be too big to clearly see all the measurments they need to take. Some people that get amnios or other testing can be told the sex around 14 wks. But for your scenario, you should be able to get an answer at 18 wks.|`|3Q9yiimsaa	My doctors did mine at 18 weeks and they said i was having a boy and you could clearly see it was a boy.|`|lCHuXjyVaa	15 easy|`|ETvV9aypaa	18-20 weeks|`|UGBL3wREaa	20 weeks|`|kAdgwDFqaa	20 weeks|`|Bse9Ekujaa	15 weeks is a little too early.  i would wait a few more weeks.

bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	I prefer maternity clothes over larger regular clothing as they are designed to fit the body while pregnant.  They accommodate the bump, but they aren't over-sized everywhere else.  If you buy larger regular clothing you'll find the clothes tend to be big in the arms and shoulders and don't line up properly.  <br>  <br>  Now, I know it's expensive replacing your whole wardrobe all at once, especially if you need clothes for work and for leisure.  Here's what I've done to cut costs:<br>  <br>  1.  borrow from friends<br>  2.  buy at second hand stores<br>  3. buy off ebay, you need to be selective and watch the shipping charges, but often you can get whole "lots" of clothing for a bulk price<br>  4.  check you local newspaper classifieds for ads and buy out of there<br>  5.  if you're in Canada try www.kijiji.ca<br>  6.  buy a few versatile items and get a ton of use out of them, ie. a pair of jeans, black dress pants, a cardigan to layer over other clothes, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kj1md6t0aa	I'm 35 weeks and honestly, I have not bought ONE maternity item. I got sweatpants. Haha. I was the same way you are - why buy them when you might not wear them again? Or only wear them during pregnancy? Just buy bigger sized clothes, that's all I did.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Try re-sale shops, they might have cute stuff. Have you been to Motherhood? I don't know if they have a website if you don't have a store with you but thats where my mom shopped the whole time she was pregnant with my sister, and she doesn't like old stuff either. I haven't checked it out yet, but plan to soon when I get bigger.|`|70kxSyxhaa	You could get some extra large ski skins and wear them under the maternity clothes you already have. They won't cover your belly, but that won't show. Sewing stores sell panels that let you turn regular pants into maternity pants. Again, they won't show, so you don't have to be a seamstress or anything. Get a nice wrap that you can wear with anything and you'll still be able to use it when you aren't pregnant.|`|DTWEJKBEaa	You can get regular clothes, just in bigger sizes. Walmart has some, but not my taste. You could buy some offline.|`|zMbKTIo8aa	<a href="Http://www.bumpfashion.com" rel="nofollow">Http://www.bumpfashion.com</a>|`|PEnp6ZKOaa	I sometimes find maternity clothes in our local Thrift Shop and Goodwill.  Also, Target has affordable priced maternity clothing as well as many Wal-Marts.   Be sure to ask friends who have children since many of them will be willing to pass on their old maternity clothing.<br>    Don't look only for maternity-specific clothing either-- try on larger sizes of clothing that are on sale.
N51LBaQaaa	i know exactly how you feel because my boyfriends step-brother is EXACTLY the same way. its absolutely disgusting. your brother needs to be put in a mental institution because hes a danger to animals and other people. you need to sit down with them and say that something needs to be done or youre gonna move in with ur grandma or something idk make it serious let them know its hurting you alot. your brother may be a very serious danger to you because my boyfriends step brother actually has come at me before becuase i was looking at him. but he has a lot more problems than ur brother but still it can be very dangerous. idk why ur parents dont punish him. if u have step paretns a reason could be they dont feel its their responsibility. or maybe they dont want to acknowledge the fact that they have a real problem and they dont want to deal with that. but i totally understand how ur feeling and what ur going through and i feel really bad for you...and im sorry. if u want to talk about it at all feel free to email me!!|`|AcgDcQG0aa	Not all parents are good at raising their kids.  And you just have to accept the fact that your parents are not that good at it.<br>  <br>  If your parents aren't willing to do their parenting better.

Also i would try to work things out with him in arguements. He will probaly get his way most of the time because he has a learning disabiliy. Some parents over react to this though.|`|fb2f31dc5f32d93496e4794302dcf712aa	well, first of all i wouldn't put him on meds, and second i would say the dad stands up to him, be very firm and punish him. It seemed similar with my brother except he is much better in comparison of behaviour. Your parents have to show him where the line is and put him behind it.The sooner the better. They must not be cruel but if he requires a good beating on his *** or smack on the head do it. Take all his possesions, etc, but he also has to know that he is loved and your parents are willing to trust him./ SO good luck. They must not give up. Stick to this until things change.|`|sSEy6KYiaa	If your brother is hurting or intentionally injuring your family dog you should report him to the RSPCA. Sounds to me like your parents need someone with authority to give them a reality check.|`|REugdDwdaa	Oh, my! That's horrible, I feel so bad for your poor dogs; you simply HAVE to report him to the RSPCA, please, I BEG you!!! Think about it, your poor, helpless dogs are being tortured by your immature brother. Please, please, please, you can't let that go on!!! I just feel so bad for all those little doggies that aren't treated properly. As for how he treats his family, you've already tried talking to your mom, so I suggest you talk to your counselor. If you're scared of talking to them, think about it this way: they can't hurt you (they don't grade you like the other teachers in the school), and the only reason why they're there is to help you. You may find that they're a lot of help!|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	all i can say is that he's abusing your pet and you should report him for that.starting there may make him realize there are consequences to his actions.everything else is out of your control for now anyhow|`|VhrUtQc2aa	I think that your mum should hear you out because at the end of the day you are effected by your brothers behaviour everyday and I think it's wrong that your mum gets mad at you because you are telling her to teach your brother some respect.<br>  <br>  I Also think that your brother should lose some weight before he is at the stage of not being able to get out of bed and then use would need to be much more at his beckon call.<br>  <br>  I think he should be punished for his behaviour and for his stealing and I think that he should be punished for breaking things and I think they should stop buying presents for him if he just sells them.<br>  <br>  I understand that he has a learning disability so why doesn't your parents sending him to a disability  school and our like somewhere were someone can look after him for a short/long period of time and then use can go visit him everyday or week.<br>  <br>  When your friends come over take them out go to the shops, go to the library if you are going to study together, put a lock on your door and when your friends come over then lock the door behind use.<br>  <br>  Maybe explain to your friends before they come to your house about your brother disability and what his behaviour is like because when they come over they know what they are in for and not get uncomfortable and leave early.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day as well you have your own life and you need your own personal space were you don't need anyone to annoy you or desturb you in any way.<br>  <br>  I think you should speak to both of your parents and tell them how you feel and give them suggestion toward helping your brother and yourself toward letting them relising that this effects you as well and that you need something to be done about it before you get a nervous breakdown.<br>  <br>  I you are at the age of being able to move out then i suggest that you tell them that to scare them a little and if your not then discard this suggestion from your mind.<br>  <br>  hope i could help good luck to you|`|prqrQcd1aa	God, that sounds horrible. It sounds as if your parents don't know what to do with him, or else they just aren't or havent been consistent with him..either that or they feel that his "condition" allows him to act this way and he doesn't "know any better"..Yes, there are some parents out there that are like this.<br>  Your mom needs to get him some wrap around services. A tss worker, behavioral shaping consultant, and mobil therapist.. This kid needs help, and honestly so do your parents. Maybe talk to your mom about this and tell her there are other ways of helping him other than just the meds that he is on! Honestly there is. My child doesn't act like this... she has her moments but i REFUSE to allow her to act like this.. She is 7 years old and is bi polar/adhd. <br>  He CAN be helped. Maybe your parents just don't know what to do, and don't know where to turn... Have your mom contact me on here if she wishes to, i could tell her how to get him help if she is wondering how to do it, and i could give her advice on what has worked for my kid and see if maybe it would work for him..|`|zH1sg3Xraa	Your parents need therapy too. Try to get them to get therapy too. This sounds terrible. My parents refused to parent my brother and he ended up a terrible behavior disorder and a bigger problem. The bigger they get, the bigger the problem. I hope your parents get therapy too. Your brother needs discipline and children or young teens who hurt animals have a serious psychological problem that will not vanish into thin air. The problem will get worse the older they get. Get help.

I am pretty sure people will not agree, but this is my opinion!|`|kxmxJXEGaa	I am not an Obama supporter by any means but, I did not see anything on that page that says ages 0 - 5. Unless they removed it.<br>  <br>  You also have to keep in mind that he can't just wave a magic wand and make something so - it has to be approved by the house and senate first.<br>  <br>  I doubt he gets the support for the kind of program you are describing.|`|AA10278508	Look it. Obama uses the word "universal" very freely.<br>  <br>  In terms that may be easier for Obama followers to understand, his way of using "universal" is his way of prettying up the word "socialism".<br>  <br>  End of story.<br>  <br>  Universal health care. Universal education. There is a pattern here and it ain't pretty.|`|W79q3k1Maa	oh stop obsessing you crazy person..<br>  i get the point you people are obsessed and mind setted on<br>  mccain but that doesnt mean you have to go extremes making<br>  up stuff! damn you people act WORSE than kids!!<br>  G R O W   U P & stop making things up!!<br>  <br>  with you around, your kids would probably need additional education anyways|`|4yfBegSjaa	that is not true they can not make you take your child if you dont want you are reading to deep in between the lines good luck with mccain he will drag us down just like bush i dont like none of them tell you the trueth|`|TPJbEhNBaa	Nice try.|`|c0RoBi1Caa	this is the first i've heard of this|`|6frCIiOmaa	That may actually be a good thing. I have had to transfer my kindergardener to a different classroom on account of a kid in there that is 'so dumb' he affects my daughters learning. Maybe early education would have helped this child. It is obvious he comes from a home where the parents have never lifted a finger to educate him. Its sad, and in Southern Ca, the schools are doing so bad on account of so many English Learners, that it would be for the best. That way they would know SOME english before starting kindergarden and not set other children behind. Either way though I am still not voting for Obama. I am just upset about Calif. schools!|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	Your link didn't work, but I looked around on the site.  I didn't see anything about any mandatory supervision or any penalties for not taking part in the zero to five plan.  You may not realize that there are lots of poor children in this company that no one takes the time to play with or read to.  My mother and my sister both teach kindergarten.  You wouldn't believe the number of low income children who come to school each year not knowing their alphabet or numbers one to ten or colors or even being able to spell their own name.  Sometimes it is because they are low income and sometimes it is because they have parents who are too busy cooking meth to bother to raise their own kids.  Children like these are the reason we need programs like this.  This program isn't for parents who have time and resources to teach their children at home.  It is for all those kids who fall between the cracks and then end up dropping out of high school and having children of their own.  I don't think that you need to be scared.  No one is going to take your children from you and force them to go into this program.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Your link does not work,<br>  but after studying how children that young learn so easily, I am perfectly fine with sending my children under the age of 5 to "school" once a week for an hour or so.<br>  <br>  Zero to Five Plan: The Obama-Biden comprehensive "Zero to Five" plan will provide critical support to young children and their parents. Unlike other early childhood education plans, the Obama-Biden plan places key emphasis at early care and education for infants, which is essential for children to be ready to enter kindergarten. Obama and Biden will create Early Learning Challenge Grants to promote state "zero to five" efforts and help states move toward voluntary, universal pre-school.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	It's hard to understand that if you really believed that McCain was right for the country and Obama wasn't why you wouldn't be able to rely on actual facts in support of that proposition instead of just making stuff up out of nowhere.<br>  <br>  Voluntary actually means ... uh ... voluntary.  As in not mandatory.  Many people wish they could afford high-quality early education, but can't.  Kudos to those who are trying to find a way to make it possible (while still ... what was that word again? voluntary).  And no, his plan doesn't envision a penalty if you don't enroll your young child in early education.  If you don't like the plan, find something factual to disagree with.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	you know what's funny you are trying to bash Obama but your link doesn't even work! I have never heard of your so called " zero to five" thing and I'm still voting for Obama. McCain is going to lose get over it ! I don't know anyone who is voting for McCain.|`|BypjotRpaa	your nutty..that is not the case..the zero to five plan is for funding of child care centers and programs..<br>  here in floridal we have preVK which is a free program to get kids ready for kindergarten and it has done wonders..this is the same policy..and yes it is voluntary!<br>  i don't know what lines you were reading..|`|OxFV92hJaa	I don't think you fully understand his stance on things. Obama's going to likely win this election, my husband and I already voted for him, end of story.|`|GA9WEsyCaa	obama is gonna win we need a new race for a president im tired of the <br>  stuck up white ones that are all about money so yeah GO obama |`|nuBRcuwvaa	There are so many things that Obama supporters refuse to read into or research.<br>  <br>  They are happy hearing the good parts skimmed off the top of all his policies, never once considering whether or not to read the rest.<br>  <br>  People want a quick fix... someone else to take care of them... somebody else to pay for their troubles.<br>  <br>  If Obama is elected it is because of people who put themselves first, selfishness.  You can't tell me that most people are happy Obama will be taxing their neighbors less, they are happy because they'll be taxed less.  They will be happy because they get free healthcare... and they don't care about those of us that do have to pay more... for them.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	I tried your link but no luck. I do not believe that he would ever be able to make something like this mandatory. He is not the final say in matters like this and mandatory wouldn't pass.|`|TcR4EJjHaa	Go away with your political garbage.<br>  <br>  Nobody can force this upon a child.|`|nT4qEeYKaa	Hahaha is that what you think "critical support to young children and their families" means? WOW. Do me a favor... go hide under a rock or something.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Your link doesn't work but I really don't need anymore reasons to not vote for him.

They were better prepared for kindergarten than their peers who didn't go to preschool. The programs they attended were not learning intensive but a mix.<br>  <br>  We need a better educated electorate so people like you won't make these silly assumptions. The earlier our children start school, the better off they will be to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

AA11602135	I am 5'   7" and when I was pregnant with my first I didn't even look pregnant till after I was about six months and not really so much then. I was doing high impact aerobics prior to getting pregnant and immediately after I delivered the nurse asked me if I was an aerobics instructor or something since my stomach was so flat right after. I was still in the delivery room at the time.  With my third child I didn't wear maternity clothes I just shopped in Lane Bryant but people thought that I was just a little overweight and a waitress at a restaurant  where we used to frequent was surprised to hear that I  was in the hospital and just had my baby. I gained my most weight with the second one because I had a miscarriage right before I got pregnant again so I had weight from 8 weeks of a prior pregnancy and the weight from my second son.  I actually lost weight with my third and with my fourth I did ok too  So, you being <br>  5' 10" you have a few inches on me so you should do fine. I tried to stay active and at least walk during the pregnancies for exercise and try to stay away from unhealthy fattening things and  I did pretty good through out all four pregnancies. |`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	I'm 5'9" and 150lbs when I'm not pregnant.  I was very obviously pregnant from about 6 months on with my first two pregnancies.  I'm currently 13 weeks and am starting to show slightly (It's mostly bloating this early, but it's all in the belly).  You'll most likely show a fair bit.  If this is your first pregnancy you might not show until later though (like 5 or 6 months).  Further, you're fairly skinny to start with so your bump may be quite noticeable on your slight frame.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I think it depends on your body. I'm short 5'1 and at 5 months I don't show at all. My grandma 4'8' and didn't show until 8 months. It depends on your body and how you carry. Everyone is different. Also, my grandma and I are very skinny people, so we blow that myth about skinny people show early out of the water! lol|`|fb8cf1b6c2124ec3abca58d3c8ea4a2baa	I'm 5'5" and didn't start to really show till week 28ish - it really just depends on your body, hips, pelvis, etc.  <br>  <br>  best wishes!|`|9SdgcOx9aa	i am also 5'10 :)  pre preg wieght was 125 the first time.  my pre preg weight with number 2 was 135.  i lost 10 lbs in the beggining, now i am 6 months preg and wiegh 137.  my belly does look really small because i'm so tall.  (that's what everyone tells me)
ddee4fdfcea9ecef7ac3cad0bf86b332aa	If it's a good doctor it doesn't hurt. They just want to see of there is any softness or slight opening if the cervex. There may be some slight bleeding or may not. If you're dialated to 1 or 2 it means within the coming week you should have it. I was dialated to a 2 for a week with no pain & then I had the baby...I've had 4 children|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	In my experience (2 babies) they often don't check the cervix at 35 weeks, generally closer to 37 weeks.  I think all Doctors are different though.  <br>  <br>  It doesn't really hurt, it's just uncomfortable.  Basically imagine the Dr. shoving one or two fingers in you as fall as he/she can.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6Ak0kDtKaa	yeah it hurts but does not hurt to much. Its not long and you know your going to be in alot more pain later (child birth) so dont even worry about it. If it does start hurting just tell the doc.|`|efMkbRCuaa	It can be  a little uncomfortable, but I definitely wouldn't say it HURT!|`|RrTXH34Oaa	i used a midwife<br>  and she didnt check hw far i was dilatied until my contraction started..and it happened that i was already fully dilated..<br>  but it didnt hurt at all compared to the contratction pain.<br>  good luck with labor..<br>  it's painful ( i did it without epidural) but its also a wonderful experience.|`|FmSWPS7Paa	they will just insert his hand into your vagina to see if the cervix is dialating or enfaccing. just pressure and a little gooeyness afterwards, nothing to worryabout|`|e8f13fb0dee9a2e16498517a135dc66daa	Yes he will check for dialtion and he will tell you how many centimeters and how effaced you are. It doesnt hurt but it is uncomfortable. It is no differand than any of your other checkups where he check with his fingers. He will just check with his fingers but he will push a little so it is uncomftorable.
cRwuYzipaa	Oh no! That's so sad. Use nice words, when he says this, keep saying, "No, you are not, you are smart. You have a good, smart brain. You are a little genius, you are a nice kid!" Whatever he says about himself that is bad, tell him the opposite. Being positive is the key.   Make sure no-one around him is telling him these negative things. Make sure you or no-one around you are saying these things about other people. Maybe people at his daycare are telling him this if he got in trouble. A child can easily misinterpret things, like if someone said, "Hey, that was a dumb thing you did!" They make take it as "I am dumb. I do dumb things." And actually think that and behave as if they are dumb! Try all these things and positive enforcement, and if his attitude about himself does not get better, then I would take him to his local doctor to see what they think. Maybe he neds to be prescribed some drugs, to make his self-image better, or maybe he needs to see a psychatrist.|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	Those aren't normal things for a 3yr old to say.  Someone had to have said that to him or to someone else in front of him.  You need to find out who is doing it and make sure it stops.  I would also talk to him about why he feels this way.  Did he hear this somewhere?  Does someone make him feel this way.  Then I'd spend a lot of time reassuring him.  I'd consider an appointment with a Dr. as my friend had a depressed seeming 3 yr old (she was more lethargic and down, not saying things like that though) anyway, the child ended up being deficient in some vitamin (I think vitamin B) and once she was given regular injections of the vitamin her mood changed drastically.  Good luck.|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	just be sure that no one is telling him this. monitor what he watches & who he plays with. be encouraging & don't give him attention for it. it seems like he just wants attention for it....? do things with him that give you the chance to tell him how great he is.|`|m2UsYThRaa	Always use encouraging words with him.

Dans l’article précédent nous avons vu que le père a la lourde responsabilité d’élever les enfants dans la discipline et l’éducation mentale du Seigneur (éph. 6:4). Mais il est évident que la mère a elle aussi une grande responsabilité dans les soins à apporter à ces membres importants de la famille (Prov. 6:20; éph. 6:1, 2). Dans un monde où la délinquance est très importante et où la violence effrayante est soulignée par les statistiques sur les délits commis par les enfants et les adolescents, on comprend sans peine que l’éducation que les parents chrétiens donnent à leurs enfants est une question de vie ou de mort. Quand le père et la mère sont tous deux croyants, ils peuvent coopérer pour mettre en pratique les sages enseignements de la Parole de Dieu concernant l’éducation des enfants. — Prov. 13:24; 22:6.<br>  <br>  7 Quand des parents agissent de fa?on unie pour discipliner leurs enfants avec amour, ils contribuent à rendre l’ambiance familiale heureuse. S’ils ont des idées différentes sur la fa?on de corriger un enfant, ils peuvent en parler ensemble quand ils sont seuls, loin des oreilles des enfants. Les sages conclusions auxquelles ils arriveront seront bénéfiques à leurs enfants. Tandis qu’ils grandiront, ceux-ci seront ainsi encouragés à respecter les conseils et la discipline venant de leur père et de leur mère plut?t qu’à chercher à diviser leurs parents à propos de questions ou de problèmes qui surgiront au cours de leur jeunesse.<br>  <br>  8 Il est vrai que la vérité de la Parole de Dieu ne touche pas le c?ur de certains jeunes. Comme Cam, ésaü et d’autres, des enfants refusent parfois de se laisser influencer par la vérité; ils ne lui permettent pas d’être un guide dans leur vie et de favoriser ainsi l’unité familiale. évidemment, cela fait beaucoup de peine à un père et à une mère croyants. “Quelle erreur avons-nous donc commise?”, se demandent-ils parfois. Pourtant, il est des cas où les parents ont vraiment fait tout ce qu’ils pouvaient pour élever leurs enfants dans les voies de la justice en appliquant les conseils et la discipline de la Bible. Malgré cela, leurs enfants se rebellent et refusent d’être des enfants de Dieu obéissants. Dans de tels cas, les paroles rapportées en Proverbes 17:21,?25 prennent tout leur sens. Le sage écrit en effet: “Le père d’un enfant insensé ne se réjouit pas. Un fils stupide est un déplaisir pour son père et une amertume pour celle qui l’a enfanté.” Il est donc vital que les parents fassent tout ce qui est en leur pouvoir pour donner à leurs enfants ce qu’ils méritent, c’est-à-dire un bon départ dans la vie. Cela est possible s’ils suivent les conseils de la Bible sur l’éducation des enfants (Deut. 6:4-9). Et c’est un aspect important de leur coopération en vue de l’unité de leur famille.<br>  <br>  9 Il est sage de se souvenir qu’élever des enfants dans l’éducation mentale de Jéhovah ne signifie pas simplement étudier la Bible avec eux. L’application pratique des principes bibliques est indispensable. Si vous avez des enfants, il convient qu’en tant que parents sages vous leur donniez un bel exemple pour ce qui est du zèle au travail. Serait-il sage, par exemple, qu’une mère de famille reste au lit le matin, laissant à ses enfants le soin de faire leur petit déjeuner et de se préparer tout seuls pour aller à l’école? à moins d’être malades ou pour une autre raison valable, des parents qui désirent vivement favoriser l’unité de leur famille s’efforceront de se lever en même temps que leurs enfants, afin de les préparer pour l’école, de leur offrir un petit déjeuner approprié et de veiller à ce qu’ils soient suffisamment vêtus. Ils s’intéresseront à la fa?on dont leurs enfants travaillent en classe et veilleront à ce que leur conduite soit toujours celle de serviteurs de Jéhovah bien élevés. Il convient aussi de leur inculquer le respect des personnes agées et des biens d’autrui. En veillant à cela et à bien d’autres choses encore, les parents pourront élever des enfants qui ne leur procureront pas du déplaisir par la suite, mais qui honoreront leur Créateur et réjouiront leur père et leur mère.

I didn't think I was pregnant this time, and my sister got a test from the dollar store and it was invalid...the line in the control window never appeared, but there was one line, not two which would have ment negative if the test was valid....My fiancee asked me to test again because I was "acting pregnant" and I got first response and it was positive...I would spend the extra couple of dollars on a test that I know works vs buying a lot of cheap ones that are constantly invalid.|`|ykP7I3caaa	well... is the second line indicating positive [shown on the box or directions] supposed to run horizontally? if it's supposed to be vertical [in the examples] i'd say it's a faulty test.|`|7tbdtMWTaa	i would test again..get a clear blue digital test as they spell it out and are more accurate|`|rddeejFuaa	It might be that is too early to test.  Wait a few more days and buy a different test.  If two lines are coming up but one is lighter than the other might be that you are pregnant but the pregnancy hormone levels are too low right now.  That happened to me and I was pregnant.  Good luck on whatever the outcome is.|`|I68n8r9waa	I have taken a test before that had a very faint line, it was indicating positive, I retested 3 days later, darker, still faint but still there, I turned out prego in the end, I think those things pick up the amount of hcg so and line indicating positive could be a yes. So mabey try one of those early detection ones if you want to know now.. or wait it out n try again. After I got 2 faint tests I went to the lab at the hospital and paid 15 dollars for them to do a blood test. After an hour of waiting I finally got the answer!!

AA12400513	Only the female can twin.  To do this, one of two things has to happen.  1.  The fertilized egg must split into two eggs.  The earlier it splits, the more similar the twins will look.  One egg splitting in two results in identical twins.<br>  2.  The female ovulates two eggs and both are fertilized. This results in  fraternal twins which may both of the same sex or one of each sex.<br>  <br>  The tendency to ovulate more than one egg at a time or for the ovum to split may be hereditary and is passed on genetically. If your Dad is a twin, then you may have inherited the tendency from his mother.|`|857c4f3c02a3e9dad636d528ea900863aa	There is a chance that your father could pass on the gene for hyperovulation to you. I dont know the exact numbers if it would be the same as your mother being a fraternal twin. Being that fraternal twins can be heriditary then a fraternal twin is more likely to have twins.

They also must both successfully embed themselves in the womb's wall. Usually only one egg is in the appropriate place. Zygotes also often fail to embed <br>  <br>  I'm not sure about identical twins, but fraternal twins are definitely no more likely to give birth to twins than an average person<br>  <br>  Also, please don't capitalize every word, it is very annoying and unnecessary|`|OLAtwLV6aa	twins tend to come more from the maternal side of the family but hey you never know<br>  <br>  so if you mom was a twin maybe but it also skips a generation too|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	Fraternal twins can have a genetic link but only if passed through the female side.

7ZMilKYoaa	I think she must of just gotten her finger in her eye and since babies are so sensitive it just looks bad because she's a baby. Or she might've gotten an eyelash in her eye, and she tried to get it out but since she's a baby she jabbed herself in the eye. What ever it is it'll go away eventually.|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	She probably did poke herself in the eye. Babies do that a lot. Atleast my son did, hes 19months and still does every now and then and he screams like someone's killing him every time.  Hopefully he will learn soon.  I would just check your daughter's eye when she wakes up to see if you can see anything in it but my guess is that she will be just fine when she wakes up|`|2LmfQUbKaa	when my son was about a year the same thing happened but it was a bad virus in his eyes it looked like someone punched him and i never thought i would see it but he cried blood so if it gets worse to the doctor right away! good luck and dont feel bad! these things are going to happen!|`|RMYvrn1Qaa	She could have poked herself...<br>  maybe a fly flew into her eye?<br>  Just guessing<br>  if her eye doesn't get better, ask her doctor.<br>  Good luck!|`|BQEjpIibaa	she might have poked or scratched her eye. make sure her nails are trimmed. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|k8RDIiszaa	do you think maybe she got stung by something or bitten by a spider?|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	she probably poked herself- my son has done that before if it's puffy and the redness doesn't go away then you may want to bring her to be seen|`|CzKrqgmgaa	she could have poked or scratched her self... or dust could have gotten in her eye.<br>  if it doesnt start looking better within a few hours you might want to talk to the doctor about flushing her eye. i've never had the need so i'm not sure what the process for an infant is for that...|`|bkOn30I1aa	Probably something bit her, if her eye looks really bad I would definitely take her to the ER, you never know what might have been, probably a spider or something and she is just a little baby so it could be bad. It’s better to be safe than sorry, I would take her to the hospital so they could check it out. Good luck!|`|ddP3klT3aa	She could have poked herself or got some thing in her eye. Her eye could be red from crying. Crying will hopefully get out whatever is in there. Wipe her eye with a warm compress.|`|FUNhlpiqaa	Maybe it was an insect bite... you said you went for a walk, was it outside?  Check for bite marks and check her clothing.  Hope she feels better :(|`|HFWLYMD6aa	I'd be taking her into the doctor to have it checked. I hope it gets better.
ZHJuK1QNaa	Your body is in need of a lot more fluids than before pregnancy. Ice chips<br>  can really help in keeping your prego body hydrated. I'm glad you prefer ice chips, Ice cubes are bigger (surprise, some times I say the dumbest things!) and can crack your teeth.   Keep chewing those ice chips sweetie, I hope you have a beautiful healthy baby!|`|17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	Honey, craving ice chips is nearly always a sign of anemia, or iron deficiency, during pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Ask your OB to test your blood for low hemoglobin. Its a simple blood test. You should try to eat iron rich foods, start cooking in cast iron cookware if possible, and take a daily iron supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamins.  My OB recommends SLOW FE iron tablets.  You can buy them at any drug store. Just take one per day, with a glass of OJ.  The vitamin C helps your body absorb the iron.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you are already taking a good quality prenatal vitamin every day  and if not, you should be!<br>  <br>  Eat lots of spinach and other iron-rich foods.  Just google "iron-rich foods".  Don't eat liver, though, because it can be harmful in other ways.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthcastle.com/iron.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthcastle.com/iron.shtml</a>|`|hSJnaysiaa	I thought it was just me being a weirdo craving ice but I guess its not just me!<br>  <br>  I am 35 weeks and some days pregnant (I can't remember how many...but the dr says I'm due March 29th) and I've been craving ice. Not crushed, not cubed but like the cocktail ice that you buy in the bag, its round.<br>  <br>  I thought I was a freak asking my husband to go buy some, so I asked him to pick up soda too. But I secretly just wanted the ice.<br>  <br>  I haven't really craved anything else through the pregnancy though, this is the only thing.|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	i craved ice when i was pregnant. some one told me that craving non food things like ice was a symptom of low iron. i didn't believe it and my doctor was never concerned about my iron. no worries :)|`|Cxdxo393aa	man i wish that was all i craved.  lucky you, your gonna be feasting on your fav food while in labor. (:|`|g5JeSJbNaa	it is very normal everyone is different so they will crave different foods . good luck|`|LBg4DNpCaa	lol I would think anything is I want onions and I used to hate onions!|`|Qk8VQukpaa	awwwww!!! i love iceeeee!!|`|HIhhAV1Aaa	I craved ice cubes with all my pregnancy's, all six of them,I was like a mad women,even scraping the freezer just to get more by the end of term,but a big plus no infections and my skin was in amazing condition,and labours were a breeze it all that water!!|`|YKRideiwaa	I crave ice also, when I told my doctor about it he said it was because I have low iron levels. You  may want to ask your doctor about it. I was put on over the counter iron supplements.|`|LEqoMtJlaa	Well, I craved blood, so, yeah, I'd say ice chips is normal.|`|j01zBZmZaa	God, I hope so. I'm 34 weeks and can't eat enough ice...especially those crunchy little cubes from Sonic!|`|7bUCN9Qnaa	Well pretty much its normal dont worry about it at least its not junk food|`|Nm7Hy67oaa	Yep!  Perfectly normal!|`|7kosr9mcaa	I craved Ice cubes SO BAD when i was pregnant. it started at like 20 weeks. I ate 2 trays of ice cubes a day ATLEAST!!!|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Yeah, I crave em too!!!|`|9cu82009aa	Yep. I've craved ice all through my pregnancies, can never get enough of it.|`|VzsEEhRhaa	what the hell are ice chips?...like ice as in frozen water ice that pieces are being chipped off?|`|FUNhlpiqaa	Could be anemia? idk
WbsdtLgFaa	Good!! it means that your body is getting ready for labor. now noone can really say how soon, but when your cervix starts to get soft it will begin to thin out and dialate, and then get ready for your little one!! congrats!|`|qJaKF24naa	means your gonna have the baby soon!|`|kuBXTToGaa	very good that means ur almost ready to pop|`|CzKrqgmgaa	if you want to deliver your baby then its good... if you dont want baby to come yet then its time to kick back and put your feet up|`|kVIOtS5gaa	Why didn't you ask your doctor? It's obvious that it's a good thing and is expected to happen at this point in pregnancy!
F2rI3Juaaa	This age would be perfect for a Macca's Party - Don't expect them to join in too much though! They a kept in are confined space and the parents can relax there.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Aw!  My son's birthday is March 31st and he'll be 3 too!  But we're having his party on March 28th too :)<br>  <br>  Anyhow, a friend of mine had their son's birthday at McDonald's a year ago and she liked it.  It was pretty fun :)|`|2BhDBYDPaa	Hmm that might be fun!! with the little play thing your song would have alot of fun and i think they give you a free icecream too!!!|`|AA10953561	Yes, we just had my daughter's sixth birthday party at McDonalds. It was easier than a lot of other birthday parties I've thrown and attended because they provide the food and cake and ice cream for a semi-reasonable price. <br>  <br>  We had 8 children (including my daughter) and it only cost about $55 for the happy meals, ice cream, cake, and decorations. They only give you 1.5 hours though. <br>  <br>  My advice is if you're going to have a lot of kids there then make sure you also have adult supervision. If you're going to have a lot of adults, make sure they're aware that they need to pay for their own food. It's wonderful not having to prepare all the food and goody bags.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Oh and make sure you let the McDonalds know at least a week in advance.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	My daughter's birthday is the 27th! <br>  <br>  Anyway, McDonald's would be fun. I haven't had any of my kid's birthday parties there, but I've been to quite a few of them. They always have lots of fun and come home exhausted.<br>  <br>  I say go for it! If you decide no, how about bowling or swimming? Just don't do Chuckie Cheese! That place makes me want to pull my hair out.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	Yes, one year, we had my son's birthday party at McDonald's. We ordered a special cake and brought it there, and we invited everyone in his class. It was a fun party. I did a different type of party every year.|`|ce32Y7I9aa	McDonald's is a perfect place for a 3 year olds birth day party, and it is way cheaper than Chuck e cheeses! Good luck!|`|8EJfR0d2aa	I had a few birthday parties at McDonald's growing up, and I really enjoyed them & the day that was made out of it ! You could have them reserve a few tables, order in a cake. It's what my mother did. <br>  * I would also make sure you pre book your orders too if your gonna be inviting alot of people to the celebration.|`|wycisonaaa	That's a great idea, they have a cute and fun play area and food and other services are very accessible. You can pretty much find McDonald's everywhere so no problem with inconvenience there!<br>  <br>  Happy early 3rd birthday to your son!|`|RCUomvyOaa	yeah they do it all the time. the kids just hang out in the play place. most mcdonald's have a party room so yeah. i had one there when i turned 4 or something.|`|y4MZs3Wyaa	Well everyone knows kid's love McDonald's. We were a poor family and my parent's never took us out to eat but once I had a party there, To this day I remember it.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I had one when i was really little ( i do not remember it) but from the picture we had a blast. I think I will for my daughter when she gets older.|`|MqaCPXqZaa	great idea! <br>  it'll be fun for your son, and they can play around.<br>  You could ask one of the staff to sing happy bday to him!!!|`|8Bw6WTp8aa	Hell no thats a restaurant where all fat asses go. But if you must insist you should have it at bruger king instead!!
gvphnDMTaa	I like it! Alicia Patrice! Sounds lovely! ?|`|NxRjqTT6aa	Patricia sounds better than Patrice, and I agree with the person above, i like alice|`|jaUBFRn1aa	Alicia Patrice sounds lovely |`|ocSGMvb6aa	That is a very pretty name|`|bxtqu4Peaa	i like it a lot. very clever. it sounds very cute and french to me :)|`|JWT4cTolaa	Cute|`|RzwbZH6paa	I like it ^^|`|Mclot3ewaa	i like it it is very cute and elegant |`|Vrou2YMZaa	i think alicia patrice is a beautiful name. when choosing a baby name the meaning is important and since Patrice would keep both your parents name alive without pejudice of the other it makes it even more beautiful.|`|e8Bp3v5saa	Very Pretty|`|ww3eIZiXaa	I think thats great u are thinking of naming ur baby girl after ur mothers. |`|LvMbehEaaa	it sounds really nice! |`|doLyOac0aa	I like it,|`|5sYzlAjPaa	It is very pretty.<br>  |`|9Jnf5jRQaa	I think if you're going to name her after your mothers than it should be Alicia Patricia - not Patrice.  By changing it, it's a completely different name so you're not really naming her after them.  If you don't like Patricia, then just find a name you both like... <br>  but to answer your question, it's ok.  Not a huge fan of Patrice, but Alicia is beautiful. <br>  <br>  btw.. if you can't take the critisism.. that maybe you shouldn't be asking people for their opinions.|`|lVR5TcxMaa	How about Alice Patrice|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	Eh, its not bad but I think the "ees" sound in both names throws the flow off a bit. |`|yF055LGPaa	Sounds really cute! 
z6IekuwSaa	Try laying her down in her crib with the lights off. Let her cry for 5 min and if she's still crying comfort her and try again. She just may be too overstimulated|`|cfe02e6ae5ad9f610e0881cb2edcb2cfaa	My second daughter was exactly like this. SHe wanted to nurse all the time then she would fuss and power puke afterwards and cry. Turned out that she was lactose intolerant (not protein allergy like most babies have). It meant she was allergic to milk sugar (not protein) and that she was allergic to my milk. I found out afterwards (after I stopped breastfeeding) that I may have been able to keep breastfeeding if I had stopped taking in so much milk of my own. <br>  <br>  Another thing is that maybe she misses being close to you. I went through something like this with my oldest daughter and I put my nursing top in her crib under her. As long as she could smell my scent she would sleep soundly.<br>  <br>  Also maybe she's not getting enough to eat if she's falling asleep. Try undressing her to make her chilly and keep her awake or cycling her arm to keep her roused enough to eat and get the fatty filling milk at the end of the feeding. Good luck :)|`|gjn2vHyDaa	Yes first and formost if the child is crying at the top of her lungs then I would say the baby could be in some discomfort and I suggest you take her to the E.R , A.S.A.P ! It sound's like Colic to me but let's find out from a Doctor. My son had very bad colic and I would wrap him like a cocoon place him on his belly over my lap/knee's and just rock your knee's back and forth supporting his head of course. but your goal is to be putting a light gentle massage to his belly, Please very gentle, not trot little horsey. Ha,ha.! But please take the baby to the E.R if it's not keeping it's food down. Remember alway's , it's not spoiling , just good loving ! Please let me know how eveything turns out . I will be praying !|`|2LmfQUbKaa	it could be she has gas place her on the floor between your legs on her back take her leggs and not to hard her knees should be bent push towrds her belly  do this a few times if she has gas or is stopped up!lol then this might help it could be she dont want breast milk try a lil formula and see if she does the same thing if not then there you are! if so i would take her to the dr. good luck to you!|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	Keep trying to burp her, she could have more bubbles.<br>  If shes happy while your holding her, then hold her for a lil while.  Have you kept her swaddled, usually babies that young love being swaddled, it reminds them of the womb.  Good luck, I know how tough it is, my son was cholic (dont know how to spell it) for the first 2 months.|`|YXpmzeVqaa	Swaddle your baby! I have found that it really does work. Wrap a receiving blanket tightly around them.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	cuddle her and give her the pacifier?<br>  the swing? the bouncy? the carseat?<br>  swaddle her|`|xmmpqySUaa	Im so sorry!!What I would do is take her to the doctor...it would be the best thing to do because for all you guys know she could have a sickness.Take her tomorrow for the doctor to check it out....|`|0b822c825c81fdba58631516562146c2aa	Maybe she has reflux (crying and throwing up after nursing).  Or maybe she just wants to be held.  Since she obviously needs sleep, maybe using a sling or a front carrier for awhile would get her sleep and you free hands.  You cannot spoil a baby at this age, so her sleeping on you isn't a bad thing.  She has been inside of you for 9 months all comforted, being outside is a scary world!  Dr. Harvey Karp calls this the fourth trimester period (if you haven't read it, i recommend reading Happiest Baby on the Block, it saved our family and isn't crazy radical like some of these baby books). Good luck and I feel your pain, I have been there!|`|OBU1eDUHaa	Sounds exactly like my 2 babies... they were diagnosed with reflux.  Does your little one arch her back when she gets mad at feedings?  Does she spit up a lot?  Does she sometimes make her body go rigid like you couldn't bend her legs if you tried?  All of these were what my babies did.  Call your MD asap and just ask if this sounds like a reflux baby.  I talked to 5 different lactation consultants before I called our MD.  Not one of them ever said anything about reflux.  I started to nurse my daughter in front of my MD and as soon as she saw her arching her back and pulling away, she said that is reflux.  We had both our children on Zantac.  In the  meantime... take a break.  Hand baby off to a family member or friend and go to another room.  Take a long shower, read a book, sleep.  Just get away.  I know what you are going through.  Once you are refreshed you will have a little more patience with her.  Good luck!|`|cI1JShJNaa	just hold her. I know that can be frustrating cause you are probably  tired but thats the only way she can go to sleep. remember she was inside of you for 9 months or more she is used to listening to your heart beat and going to sleep. good luck and try to get some rest.|`|J4YNRrsuaa	put her in her car seat and rock her gently, that always makes mine stop crying. She might be just fighting her sleep.
Bw1h5xAcaa	If your pressure is still up, which it likely will be if you already had a high result when you are normally low, and if you are putting out protein in your urine, then yes, induction seems likely. The only cure for preeclampsia is delivery. If you're nearly 38 weeks by Friday there is no reason to wait it out - preeclampsia can get worse quickly. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|f4f5K93Raa	I had a C-section at 37w3d due to high BP and a scare of pre-eclampsia. *hugs* I know it's scary!|`|IXPqgM9eaa	his equipment might be broke and i guess it can go down|`|777aa4e0bc80de8d482529f1c6506d19aa	Pre eclampsia as per my text book has to have a blood pressure of 140/90mm of Hg.... so the good news is that you don't have pre eclampsia.... 80 of the 138/80 is perfectly alright but 138 is bit on the high side.... Plus there is a possibility of you suffering from what is known as 'White Coat Hypertension' . In this it is seen that about 25% of all people who have their blood pressure measured, have their blood pressure falsely raised when it is measured by a doctor. Ask your doctor to find out more about it.<br>  <br>  When you doc said that you were 2 cm dilated, he/she didn't give you the full picture. Whether you shall be induced or not depends on the Bishop score ( followed in my country... most probably in yours too). This Bishop score is something like giving different points to different answers in those magazine 'how attractive to the other sex are you' kind of question. Beside the dilation of your cervix, cervical length, consistency, position and how far down the reproductive canal the baby has traveled (station) is taken into consideration. If a favourable score comes up, only then you are going to be induced and then you can have your baby. <br>  <br>  So tomorrow, after the doctor has finished your examination, why don't you say ' So doc, what do you think my Bishop Score is? ' and look at the suprise in his/her face. By the way favourable score is 6 and above.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and wish your upcoming kid a happy birthday from my side.      
t0jC2o0Jaa	it might be from your pills. They do have side effects. I'd just say take a test and see what it says. Good Luck.|`|zWizRqy7aa	it can be pms too because our bodies change sometime pms symptoms change as well.. I never got sore nipples during pms until I was like 19 then I started getting lower back aches..so now I guess I don't have to worry about it for nine months.. Honestly though the best way to find out is to take a test they sell them at the 99 cents store go get one..and you can still get pregnant on birthcontrol pills I got pregnant while I was taking the ortho-trycilcyn LO religiously..|`|C7nRshsNaa	I think it's normal to have sore boobs/ nipples but go to a gynecologist or whoever prescribed the pills to you.
YXpmzeVqaa	call the bureau of vital statistics for your state and request an amendment to the birth certificate. they will send you a form and you fill it out with the correct info then send it in with the appropriate fees and they will correct the records and send you a new certificate of birth|`|4IhXjUpFaa	Minor errors in the child or parents' names, such as spelling and typographical errors, the sex of the child, day of birth of the child, can usually be corrected.   If you have an incorrect Certification of Birth, please list the information to be corrected on the reverse side under  "Corrections Desired."  It will be necessary for both parents to sign in the designated area in the presence of a notary.  A legible copy of one of the parent's valid government issued photo ID must be included with the correction request.  No fee is required if the original incorrect Certification of Birth is returned with your request.|`|QHt8fM1Oaa	take it back to the hospital and explain the problem to them, or call the hospital|`|2LmfQUbKaa	go down town and fix it city hall!|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Go ask the hospital, but I'm pretty sure you're going to need to talk to Vital Statistics to get it taken care of.  They do the birth certificate stuff.|`|Ks7lENScaa	You may have to call a place called vital records.  They are the ones that issue the birth certificate.  At least that is how it is in my state of PA.  The number should be on the back of the certificate or one of the other papers with it.|`|955YoHvVaa	Usually when you get a birth certificate they come with a form you can fill out to get a new one issued with the corrected things.. then you mail it back with the birth certificate that is wrong..and they mail you a new one.|`|z6IekuwSaa	Make sure you both go to the dept of health and fill out an affidavit to correct it. I just corrected my daughters. They spelled her name wrong. But make sure you both go. I flew all the way to Ohio from SC to fix ours and found out that the hubs had to be their too|`|c73QkZ2haa	Contact the department that handles such things where you are and ask why it isnt there.|`|3vzxSKLcaa	Try city hall.. and just ask a receptionist and Im sure they could point you in the right direction
c26320ed99e8b0867d42f5b83226d3c2aa	Most likely the result of a common mistake in parenting...in my opinion.  The mistake is to convince the child, directly or indirectly, that if people do not like him it is because he is not "NICE" enough.  Of course, we all know that is a lie and the moest entertaining people, not the nicest ones, become popular.  <br>     My guess is your child is INDEED very outgoing and determine...and probably also kind.  I also guess your child, when pushed around or asked to do something, will most often always comply.  <br>  <br>     There-in lies the problem: kids are attracted to other kids who stand-up for themselves and are adventurous.  Having many hobbies or even being immensely talented at them is not enough.  It can be as simple as interrupting someone and saying "I have another idea" or "I don't agree"...or telling a girl "I don't think you're all that I am a strong guy in as good shape as you...why do you expect me to kiss up to you?" instead of running around trying to impress people or be "agreeable".<br>  <br>    Even at age 12...sexuality is starting to kick in and self-respect is a huge issue so far as popularity.  The ability to be a leader and person who fights for himself at something not academic...for example for him to write his own song for band or start hanging around kids with the idea of learning from them IE "how do you do this..." instead of squabbling to impress them...is something that will likely help your child immensely.<br>  __________________<br>    Another common mistake; if you do things like give him an earlier curfew than most kids or not let him hang around girls alone, people are going to likely think he's a "mama's boy" and single him out, regardless of your intentions.  <br>    As you probably know, not having a girlfriend by about the age of 13 is quite often reason enough alone to be singled out as "the guy who's so dorky he can't get a g/f"...and that will cause him to lose guy friends who become scared to be seen with him around girls.<br>  _____________<br>        If you are doing this, STOP.   It also makes the child infinitely frustrated and very likely to rebel sexually in their later teens thinking "I am sick and tired of being a virgin wimp"...many of my overly-sheltered friends ended up doing that.|`|HS44HUrgaa	well i would just trust that he could make friends and get involved if he wanted to. i dont think any kid wants their parents in their very personal things. just trust him|`|O0rpPItWaa	1. you did not raise him wrong like your thinking. your letting him make the desicions, which is good. Maybe hes just shy? sure hes social and likes to go to dances and patecpate in a band (which is very outgoing, it takes guts to be in a band) maybe hes just a quite guy? he will break out of it. Sometimes people seem like an outsider when they are uncomfortable. maybe hes uncomfortable around school or around people he doesnt know very well. Its only a phase and he'll grow out of it. Why dont you have him throw a party or somehting and let him invite friends?????? that could help make him more comfortable...and its funn (:|`|d933e4b97b43aa7bfb10ac2da32dceb4aa	I really hear you on this one. I also have a 12 year old son who is dealing with the same problem. My son complains to me that this year at school the kids have started to get very mean and cliquish; I guess they are starting to get all hormonal.... <br>  In my neighbourhood it is difficult to have him socialize sometimes because a lot of the kids are very streetwise and just hanging out at all hours, which I don't allow. <br>  The only thing that seems to help is getting involved in school activities and neighbourhood clubs and teams at our community centre. And also making friends with other mothers with kids the same age. <br>  Have you tried things like scouts or soccer teams or other group activities? <br>  It is hard to hurt for your child like this and worry that somehow it is your fault in how you raised him. I will be reading the other answers with interest.<br>  |`|D5m8IZzNaa	i'd say encourage him to participate in many school activities and just make sure he's with people a lot. chat with other children's parents regularly and maybe the connection will transfer to the children?|`|HbKZzFeIaa	The first problem is that he's the only child. Kids who don't have siblings are not as good in social skills. Because they never had someone to learn sharing and communicating from. The best thing is you hang out with families who have kids his age so they can spend time together on weekends or whenever it's possible. Then I think you better talk to him about this issue and bring it up and encourage him (not push him) to invited friends over. Throw a birthday party for him and teach him how to make good friends! <br>  |`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	It's not a lack of self-esteem - it's a lack of male role models in his life. Does he see his dad? Can you get your son to spend more time with either of his grandfathers or uncles?<br>  He's at that exact age that he needs male influence. Not that you are being a bad mom, not at all. <br>  Also, some boys just don't find their niche until they get to high school, and are around a bigger variety of boys from different backgrounds, etc.<br>  Talk to him about all this - he's old enough to give you some feedback.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	he sounds fine, but if you keep pushing him to have boy friends, you might make him gay.

bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	It's likely too early because typically it's the HCG hormone that causes the nausea and your body wouldn't have started producing that yet.  The HCG starts being produced after the egg implants which is 8-10 days after conception.  Further, if you had your period on the 1st of this month, assuming your schedule is "average" you would have ovulated around the 14th which was just 4 days ago.  It's nearly impossible to experience any symptoms that soon after ovulation.<br>  <br>  Sorry to squash your enthusiasm.  Good luck getting pregnant and let's hope I'm wrong.|`|a937d2a07b4e33ee20c61ba4864ad6ffaa	i was so sick during pregnancy i think i was sick before i was pregnant lol. usually morning sickness happens at about 6 wks. good luck|`|JzVIDI4raa	i felt nausea two weeks before my period was due. I guessed I was pregnant but didn't test until i was 1 day late. It showed up immediately! I kinda knew i was pregnant because the only time i have nausea is when i have the flu . It is VERY POSSIBLE! Some peoples bodies are more sensitive to the hormones i guess. |`|LSmPH2usaa	I would think that it is to early for you to have any nausea this early. But every woman and every pregnancy are different. When I was pregnant with my boys it came later and with the girls is was right away. |`|oxxBmhV0aa	I didn't really feel nauseous just threw up all the time and ironically it started the day AFTER I found out I was for sure pregnant..It started at about 6 weeks is when I found out.

lqlfIEjNaa	Well, I haven heard that potty training boys and girls are different...<br>  I only have a girl...But I can tell you what worked for her. <br>  <br>  Yes, it makes it more difficult if you go out because usually they won't take time out and say "I need to go potty" so I stayed home about a week until she got used to it...Then before we went out I told her to go pee and we're going somewhere, and she needs to be sure and tell me she has to go, even if we are still there. And no matter what, before you leave wherever you are, take them to the bathroom. <br>  My biggest issue was going out and night time. <br>  I used to put pull ups on her all day, except when we went out, just in case she had an accident. But my sister told me to just put underwear on even when we go out. She will get used to it. Sure enough, she was perfectly fine. <br>  And at night, when I noticed that she didn't wet it at all consistently for about a week, I just started putting underwear on at night too. <br>  Just be sure they don't drink anything 1-3 hours before bed and go pee before they go to sleep...|`|Yeb2nZTFaa	Be patient and consistent.   You can't show frustration because then it becomes a control issue.  Put him on the potty at regular times, if possible when he normally would wet or soil.  Right after meals and before his bath are good times.  Make it pleasant, maybe have a favorite short book handy so he will stay on the chair for a few minutes.  Get Dad involved.   Another trick is to just put little potty in different places where he likes to be (ie, near the t.v.)|`|1SdgCkQ1aa	Mostly it just takes time - he will continue to have accidents for a very long time.  I potty trained my little guy at 2 1/2 and now he's 3 1/2 and has suddenly started having accidents again.  It is easier to stay home, but you can use pull ups or stuff his undies with cloth diapers when you need to go out.  Take him to the bathroom as soon as you get somewhere.|`|zHqVhWigaa	The most important thing is to be consistent.

qygYwdRpaa	Yes i found out i was having a Girl at 14 weeks and 3 days of pregnancy and they were right she is now 17 week sold <br>  <br>  A little tip have something sweet before your scan to insure baby is awake and prepped to show what gender it is <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	I'm assuming you're having an ultrasound as there isn't any other way to see really.  <br>  <br>  So, if you're having an ultrasound there is a chance the sex will be evident.  I found out with mine at a 12 week ultrasound (a boy).  It was as clear a day.  <br>  <br>  Here's an interesting article I read about this:<br>  <br>  Most of the time one should be able to tell the sex of the baby by about 20 weeks and very often even at sixteen. With modern equipment, the diagnosis can be made even as early as 11 to 12 weeks (see below). On the other hand, as the correct visualization of any fetal part depends of a host of factors such as fetal position, amount of liquor and thickness of the abdominal wall, I have had occasions when I cannot be certain about the sex even at 28 weeks. <br>  <br>  And just how accurate is the diagnosis of fetal gender by ultrasound? Well, I have to say that it should be very accurate (somewhere between 95 and 100% at 20 weeks), particularly after about 20 weeks, or even sixteen. However I must say again that one must remember the sonologist may not always get a good view of the perineum (private parts) of the fetus for a variety of reasons and therefore may not furnish you with an "accurate" answer. One really needs to put this question to the person who performs the scan. He or she is the only person to be in the position to tell you just how accurate "that" particular diagnosis is at that particular scan. <br>  <br>  |`|MmRCqjHraa	Some women find out as early as 15 to 16 weeks pregnant. It might be possible, but then again it's also far more likely that they will tell you one thing then it will end up being something else later. It's better to wait later at least 18 weeks I'd say. You wouldn't want to find out that your little girl turned into a boy or vice-versa! lol.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Well, if you're really lucky they will. Alot of places refuse to tell that early. It doesn't hurt to ask! I hope they'll give you something|`|zD27vFE2aa	Nope too early. |`|aFh6UgNaaa	They could, but they like to wait around 18-19 weeks, sometimes later because they can be more confident in what they see, but remember, it's not 100%!|`|tJoK6NQKaa	Is not imposible but if you want them to be accurate and their not always but is best 16 weeks+ if your little one lets you see. <br>  <br>  Congrats!!!|`|x5wbY8wxaa	i dont think so no. im 14 weeks i will be phoning them to see if they can book me in for a sexing scan probably wont do it for few weeks but i shall find out |`|9MKY0IdIaa	they most likly will not try to see the sex untill at least 19 weeks, u ussully cant ell till then|`|H0fXySX9aa	no its to early its better from 18 weeks onwards|`|pTj1T6gRaa	each time [ 4 ] we were told wait 17 weeks...at least|`|170DwLM5aa	They may guess for you but most wont that early.

Encourage lactating women to follow dietary guidelines that promote a generous intake of nutrients from fruits and vegetables, whole-grain breads and cereals, calcium-rich dairy products, and protein-rich foods such as meats, fish and legumes. Such a diet would ordinarily supply a sufficient quantity of essential nutrients... Encourage sufficient intake of fluids -- especially water, juice, and milk -- to alleviate natural thirst.

The body has an amazing way of making nutritious milk even when your diet isn't so great.  You however need the vitamins and minerals to help keep your body healthy and in prime milk making condition.  Further, you'll need energy and you'll need to feel your best to cope with an infant so vitamins can help in lots of ways.|`|cMMHGdGMaa	You must still take your prenatal vitamins while breast-feeding and you should be giving your baby a vitamin supplement as well.

He's just a baby for crying out loud. <br>  <br>  All you do is look him/her in the eyes and firmly say "NO, that hurts".<br>  <br>  Ya, sure throw them in bed, why not! Yeesh. I have used the CIO method, but i only let my daughter cry for a couple minutes in between, and NEVER to the point of screaming. <br>  <br>  So, no you don't let the baby scream themselves to sleep. |`|AA10166553	You should never hit them back. Just teach them the meaning of the word no. Tell them no hit. It would be a good age to start time outs, but, don't expect to much. They probably wont set still for long at that age. And, kids will sleep when they are tired. Don't put them in the bed and let them scream. That's cruel.Try watching how much sleep they get during the day, play with them, get them good and tired, then, a nice warm bath and something to eat before bed should help. Maybe they need a little rocking...one on one time at bedtime. JUst for a little bit, then, tell them to go night night. Make sure you have a small night light in the room. Some kids at that age get frightened.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Never hit a child no matter what! That is child abuse. Also, at 13 months he is just beginning to learn right from wrong.  If you hit him back you will only encourage the behavior, because he will think, well if mommy hits then it must be okay to do.  I do not believe in letting them cry it out either.  If they don't want to sleep at night, there is a reason.  Find out what it is.  Maybe they are not tired enough yet to sleep.  Also when they are approaching a milestone, such as walking, talking, etc. they tend to not sleep well at night.  Also with teething. He may still be hungry.  Find out the reason and take care of it!|`|SvJx5t9Caa	NO NO NO NO NO. No screaming themselves to sleep and no "throwing" them in the crib!! OH MY GOSH!! If it seems they're having trouble going to sleep get them up for a little while with some soothing activities like reading or just cuddling. Your baby needs to know that you love and care for him/her and that you will always be there when they need you. And for the love you DO NOT hit a BABY back!! Where did you hear this? Tell them no very firmly and maybe pretend cry to let them know that's not a nice thing to do. He/She is a BABY they do not know better, they don't know what hitting even is. All he/she knows is that they get a reaction out of you when they do it. How old are you? |`|9e8b9a03013448cda0a4613387659fbaaa	Remove him from the situation. I would say NO in a firm voice and let him sit in a highchair or crib for about 30 secs, but not just throw in a crib and scream. You want your child to think of the crib as a nice place to sleep, not a punishment. Otherwise, you may have sleep issues now or later.|`|WF6mVPjDaa	Please never hit a child, the child is only is 13 months which is  a little baby old so don't hit him or her just firmly say 'no' or remove yourself from the situation.|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	Absolutely not!<br>  <br>  At 13 months the only thing he'll get from your hitting him is the message that it's okay to hit.  Further, you're bordering on abuse hitting an infant.  In Canada it's against the law to hit a child under the age of 2.  Check the laws where you are.<br>  <br>  This happened with my children (it's common), I got down to their level, held their hands and said firmly "NO, we don't hit, it hurts".  Then I would show him how we touch each other.  I'd say, "we are gentle with each other, we touch like this".  With repetition and consistency your child will quickly learn that hitting is not okay.  If you're holding the child when he hits, you can set him down and say "No hitting, I'm putting you down if you're hitting".  He will soon learn that nothing positive comes from  hitting.|`|okh3hL8taa	No the child doesn't understand the concept of hitting.  As a "grown up" YOU do.  And you should not "throw" a child in their crib.  What you do is you TEACH the child not to hit.  You take hold of their hands and you say something like "We don't hit" then you guide their hands to touch gently.  Hitting a baby only enforces that it is okay to hit and throwing them is simply child abuse.|`|KXuS7fg1aa	firmly tell the child no and do not let them get away with this behavior at all, be consistant, try a night light in the childs room and try to avoid late naps in the day this way the child will be worn down and rdy to sleep, if they continue to cry and they know u will get them up then it will not hurt them to cry, again u have to be consistant and not give in to the crying if you know there is nothing wrong with the child and they are only crying to get out of bed|`|w2JsL66Xaa	omg...do not hit ur child...are you crazy...you have to explain to ur child that hitting is bad...and that it hurts and he wouldnt like it if someone hit him...also dont ever throw your kid...put him in the crib nicely and say good night until he is calm...then explain that it is bed time and that he needs to go to sleep now...and then leave the room and only go back in if it sounds like he is hurting himself or tryng to get out of the crib....if he gets out put him back in...and repeat...you have to be stirn not mean....and let him cry and scream...he will learn after a few days of this that it is not worth fighting you about it....then it will get easier...but just let him cry as long as it takes.|`|SvqrQstraa	Its a phase and it will go away.<br>  <br>  Give your child a one minute time out..NOT IN CRIB..That will effect the sleep cycle.<br>  <br>  Hit or spanking back confuses your child and will cause his or her actions to last longer..Trust me..my boy was a hitter and now at 3 he is way over it.<br>  <br>  Just be patient and talk with your child in simpole terms...<br>  <br>  "you hurt mommy"......things like that...it will end up ok.|`|eLXQTZVnaa	when my son hits, i calmly get down at his level and tell him why we dont hit ppl, it takes time but they really do listen. and sleeping at night if all their needs have been met, fed, changed, not in any pain then yeah i would let him cry it out till he falls aslep|`|MsAOrRCqaa	Perhaps spend more quality time with your child instead of wasting it on the Internet.  |`|fITbPwddaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NEVER A HIT A CHILD THAT IS ABUSE AND BE NICE TO HIM THEN HE WILL LEARN NOT TO HIT

The ear wax will naturally come out on it's own in most cases.|`|AA12243380	It's Ok for the pediatrician to do that because the pediatrician is a trained professional.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't stick a q-tip in your baby's ear.  It's too easy to go too far accidentally.  He needed to clean it out to see the ear drum for the examination, but it is Ok for ears to have wax in them.  They protect the ears.  Unless something is wrong and it gets blocked, but typically that won't happen and if it does happen by chance then you can bring him back and the pediatrician can clean it out again.<br>  <br>  Yeah, I wouldn't even attempt to clean wax out of there.  Eeek!|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	Public Health in my area advises that you don't put anything smaller then your pinkie finger in a child's ear.  Wax is there for a reason to protect the ear.  Children have tons of wax and it's okay.  If it gets to be excessive and is not really pleasant to look at you can wipe it out gently with a kleenex.  Going into the ear even with a q-tip can damage the ear drum.  In the odd circumstance some children do have so much wax that it's problematic and in that case I would go see your Dr. and ask him/her at what point is it so much it needs dealt with and how should you deal with it.|`|AA12343436	You aren't suppose to use them, even the baby q-tips.  Ask dr he/she will tell you the same.  If there is wax coming out just use your finger nail or the end a cloth to get it out.|`|2qEgeS0Caa	Ear wax is perfectly normal for a baby. He may find it to be uncomfortable so he is going squirm. My son did too. It doesn't have to be perfect. As long as you get most of it. Ear wax acts as a lining to protect our ears...although we find it to be disgusting its really good for our ears. I clean my sons every day just enough so that wax doesn't build up too much. His doctor always has something to say.. he hears fine and he's not suffering.<br>  I wouldn't try recruiting anyone else. He could find that intimidating and will want to move away more. What I do with my son is I lay him on the floor, on a blanket with a toy and that catches his attention for a few seconds.
2mOK7neraa	Maybe it was their break and they were using you for a babysitter, it does not mean they don't care..<br>  thats kind of a far stretch to assume they don't care about her.|`|qhpax438aa	Maybe her parents want her to bond with someone else her own age. If her parents arent checking up on her, i'm not sure it means they dont care, maybe they are busy...idk...but its good she is in a safe environment with u and ur son. <br>  <br>  Atleast you care!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's a fair question, if she is older then 3 and they know where she is going and know you it's one thing but even a 4 year old should be kept track of.|`|I6qfoJaiaa	3 is way to young to be going over to someone's house without the parents knowing, however if they knew where she was and there was no set pick up time maybe they were enjoying a night out,

dA9Tcp8Qaa	Wow, I hope she leaves you. She deserves a man who will support her, not a little selfish horny boy.<br>  <br>  You obviously don't care about her. All you want is sex. <br>  <br>  I met my boyfriend when I was 14. He was 15. I wasn't ready for sex until I was 16, almost 17. And he waited for me, and didn't pressure me at all. We're still together, 6 years later.<br>  <br>  If you want sex, and not a relationship, then I suggest you break up with her. And don't you dare say to her, "I'll leave you if you don't have sex with me." Cause I guareentee you she'll leave you anyways, but you're also look like an asshole |`|Osn1xpu6aa	i am waiting until i find true love, I don't know if that will be marriage or not.<br>  <br>  Don't try to persuade her otherwise you will lose her respect.<br>  Not to mention her as a girlfriend.|`|bIvsLrCUaa	If she is waiting i think that you should respect that. Don't tell her that she is being stupid just because she won't let you disrespect her and her body. Don't try and persuade her to do anything. Thats an amazing goal and i look up to anybody who actually waits until marriage, because i didn't, and trust me every girl that didn't will regret it at one point or another! You need to go cut your self, why don't you kill yourself? <br>  <br>  <br>  IF YOU REALLY LOVED HER, YOU WOULD WAIT IT OUT WITH HER!|`|EccBqsntaa	Okay wait. You think abstinence is stupid? You plan to marriage her? Its called YOU PLAN TO MARRY HER. No there isn't a way you can persuade a girl to have sex with you...You don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow. Get over yourself.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Geez, you sound like an uneducated idiot. She needs to get rid of your @ss. I really hope you don't knock someone up anytime soon, idiots such as yourself should not breed. |`|AA10186411	She needs to dump your ignorant ***.  First of all, you neednt call her stupid.  She is being VERY smart.  You won't ever marry her.|`|2ktp7dEUaa	If you really love your girlfriend, then you will respect her enough to wait until she's ready, which happens to be after your married. And if she dies tomorrow, then she'll die a virgin, so what. I don't know why people make having sex the most important thing in their lives, there are more important things.<br>  <br>  And I'm waiting until I'm married also because I don't think your virginity is just something you hand out to everybody. I want to save it for my future husband. =]|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	I am waiting for marriage and I'll give you a couple of reasons why. The first is that I am a christian and God wants (and designed) sex for the one that we marry. I also want to save myself for only my husband. You may be planning to get married but your only 16...things might change before then. Your girlfriend is right to want to save her virginity until marriage. It may be hard for you but if you truly love her then you need to respect her wishes. I know you probably think that was really preachy but that is my opinion. |`|AA10309649	You know sex isn't the only thing in life! There are other and more important things in life. I am waiting till I get married. I want to have fun being a teenager without getting depressed or scared or angry. I think having sex and everything just messes you up. It just causes problems!<br>  You should wait too. If not, you'll regret it. Thumbs up to your gf!|`|XJzyTTbtaa	If you plan to marry her the why don't you actually act like a good boyfriend and RESPECT her wishes to save herself for marriage you JERK |`|aYL70sgvaa	youre so mean! if she wants to wait she wants to wait...it is her body so leave her alone and stop trying to convince her! geez...<br>  and learn how to spell please|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	YOU ARE A JERK!!!!!!

You sound like a dirt bag and she is waisting her time with you, if you really loved her you would wait and marry her. <br>  <br>  I'm not necessarily waiting for marriage, I'm just waiting until I can be emotionally ready, physically ready, and mentallyy ready for sex. I also want to be financially stable, just in case I have a child. And, like I said, emotionally, mentally, and physically ready for a possible STD.|`|tSEA42Uraa	You are so stupid...<br>  <br>  I abstain. It means that I'm smart, I have self-control, and self-respect. You want your woman to give it up to someone that, for all she knows, could be gone once she gets pregnant? Once she gets an STD? Protection doesn't always work, you know.<br>  <br>  Fine, go to your "emo corner". You really deserve it if you want your girlfriend to be as stupid as you.|`|AA10851321	To answer the first part...<br>  I AM SOMEONE FROM THE 21 CENTURY WHO IS WAITING UNTIL MARRIAGE.<br>  As for the actual part of the question...<br>  You shouldn't push you girlfriend (or anyone for that matter) to have sex. You SHOULD be ashamed of yourself. If you really loved her, and were going to marry her (which I doubt) then you should respect her values and morals.|`|daK9RlV1aa	if you can not wait till your married like she wants then you have no buisness being with her. Cause it is probably important to her to wait and you want to persaude her that is just not cool and if you really loved her you would wait. |`|SRqlJ6VVaa	IF you really love her that much, then wait. She'll only get seriously pissed if you keep pushing her, and she should. Kudos to her for standing up for what she believes. If you can't respect her beliefs, you two need to find someone else.|`|Rff77L23aa	Something like this is sacred and very important to her and you should respect that. If you can not understand her and respect her wishes, you do not care about her or respect her.|`|hWSzVMZMaa	You told her she is stupid!?

If its what she believes let her be, and if you truly love her you will wait until you are married!<br>  uggh douche bag. |`|OUhd54Zaaa	Its called respect for herself and respect for her future.

There's various reasons for saving sex until marriage. Could be religious, I don't know. I'm not a religious man. On the other hand, she could be concerned about STDs and such, which is admittedly a more logical reason and one I'd personally have less problems with.<br>  <br>  However, what I DO know is that there is a better way to get your sex drives in tune with each other without flinging insults into her face.You need to sit down, APOLOGIZE, and ask her for her reasons. You can work something out without calling her 'stupid'. This namecalling makes me wonder if you are really in a loving relationship or just in it for sex.|`|ZEO7RhGzaa	Are you serious?  You're an asshole.<br>  Plenty of people believe in saving themselves until marriage, and if I were your girlfriend I would have dumped you by now!  Don't call her stupid because her morals are different than yours(if you even have any.)<br>  <br>  Dont try and get her to do things she doesn't want to do, she will end up leaving you.  And don't cheat on her just because you're a little horn dog and can't wait until she's ready.  She has self respect and is sticking to her guns.  GOOD FOR HER.  You need to lay off.|`|IaM5KaAIaa	i'll wait till marriage. there is no way that you can change her mind. sorry.|`|duUUY3aWaa	she probably told you that because you type like you're a retard

It has a section dedicated specifically to GAMES AND ACTIVIES and another dedicated to DECORATIONS.  You should check that out as I tried very hard to include the classics and get some new things in there, too!<br>  <br>  For the centerpiece.....consider a custom diaper cake.  I do custom work and match shower themes and colors perfectly.  I have access to many ribbons and colors and can match almost any color scheme.  Check that out, too, if you like!  (You can even email me a photo of something that is in those colors your friend likes so I can make sure it is SPOT ON perfect!)|`|fvmKx667aa	At my sisters they got those Edible arrangements. They are fruit arrangements that look like flowers, but you get to eat them. They are so freaking good and look beautiful. Maybe look into those for centerpieces.

Its simple especailly for those who cant stand shower games.|`|FvonW0Gmaa	aside from colors does she have a theme?  Like flowers? bugs? etc??

XR7E8I5Faa	You go to the court house and get the paper work, then bring them the papers along with the money. Then you have to contact places you have done business with like banks ect... Sometimes people run an ad in the paper saying the name change to cover themselves.|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	I know some people just start going by a different name.  They tell everyone it's their name, they sign it on everything, etc.  That however doesn't make it legal and that persons identification and formal stuff like school documents, etc. would be in the original name.<br>  <br>  I do know that in Canada you can legally change your name by applying to the government with your original birth certificate and a form outlining the change you'd like with a lawyer's signature, etc. and you'll get a name change certificate.

The trick is, when ever I ask my dad about a concert he always asks who else is going. Let your mom know you are going with a good group of friends (a benefit if she knows and trusts them); tell you you promise to call when you get there, etc etc. You have to really butter her up with knowing you'll be safe. Also, when she does turn you down, it's important not to get in a pissy fit because that'll discourage other chances you have for going out.

L8peUnIPaa	Normal time to lose the weight is 9 months to a year, don't rush it.<br>  OB/GYN RN|`|HSa041M0aa	I could not loose one pound until I stopped breast feeding--at least for me, once the extra fluid dried up the weight came.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	its all about calorie intake dear...<br>  if you are eating more calories then you are burning you will not loose weight...<br>  |`|GqV85Otqaa	It has been 8 months and I still have the baby weight. I am starting the Acai diet next week.|`|Np0JJI2Faa	Some women develop different eating habits while pregnant. They start to get into a habit of eating more, and often foods that are higher in calories. Because this intake becomes a habit, you don't realise after birth that this needs to be changed, and you need to eat less. Many women find this to be a very hard habit to break. What you eat affects how you look the most, you can be exercising all you want, but if you eat a lot of food, and have a high calorie intake then you will find that weight hard to shake. Try adjusting your diet. Eat meals with lean protein and lots of vegies, make sure you have a good breakfast - cereal and milk and a healthy sandwich for lunch, you can't go wrong with that kind of diet. Eat in steady intervals too - have breakfast, lunch and dinner regularly. Do not graze throughout the day - especially at night, this is the worse for weight. As soon as I stopped grazing and started eating regular meals the weight fell off me - without exercise!! I found I felt like I was eating more too, but eating like this helps your metabolism to maximise. Good luck.|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	- perhaps you're consuming too many calories<br>  - perhaps your body is holding on to the extra fat stores for breastfeeding which often happens until you wean<br>  - perhaps you were underweight when you started and your body is staying at a healthier weight now<br>  <br>  I don't understand why you can't start trying for another baby now???  You don't have to be back to your original weight to try (unless that's what you want to do, but it's not necessary).
c73QkZ2haa	The powder does not mix as accurately as the liquid concentrate does. Scoops are hard to make the same size and the powder is hard to dissolve in the water.<br>  We went from the powdered to the liquid because our babies kept spitting up had serious gas and started having really loose poos. We decided it was worth the extra money for our peace of mind to buy the Liq conc.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	my son spit up the powder bad too,  he had to go on  the rady to feed  in the same brand and then he did fine.|`|SjX72fPyaa	My daughter was the same way on powder. She spit up about half of her bottle sometimes. So we just switched her to the concentrate liquid of the same brand and shes been fine ever since. <br>  Apparently the powder doesn't dissolve very well so its really hard on a babies stomach|`|51jVOdq5aa	This actually is a concern for most mothers (gas and spitting). Just make sure the baby is in inclined position when feeding and always make sure he burps afterwards. Also ive noticed that some baby bottles helps alleviate gas and spitting or you could try mylicon and see if it works. If not, ask your pediatrician for more options for avoiding spitting and having gas.|`|YXpmzeVqaa	Make sure that you are using distilled or nursery water and not plain tap water. Also follow the directions on the can exactly... to little or to much powder can upset baby's tummy. Give it a few days if you are doing both of the above the switch may take his stomach a few days to adjust. Good luck!|`|2LmfQUbKaa	i never di dlike the powder it is just somthing diffrent about it i would change him back that little gas isnt good!
nayOFO76aa	your stretchmark will eventually fade away naturally (mine did), if you workout reguarly then you will lose your baby fat in no time.  what i did was alot of crunches as soon as possible, and about a year and a half my stomach is pretty flat ( but not completely) but just keep working out, and it'll go away before you know it!|`|7382e6436bbca0c2034d94d4e72448aeaa	Same here.  Exact same story.<br>  <br>  The stetch marks will fade and your skin will tighen up some again.<br>  <br>  But realistically...your never going to be the same again.<br>  <br>  Its sad.  but hopefully you have a good husband that sees past it.|`|weA0Xdszaa	Of course just give yourself some time before everything goes back to normal ;) Stretchmark, though, are there to stay but they will fade and become the same color as your skin...<br>  Congrats ;)|`|g5JeSJbNaa	if u exercise and take cre of your body u will be back to yr old self in no tim egood luck <br>  |`|6tBr0xtVaa	medically, everyone will retain something near 4 pounds of pregnancy weight, whether it be actual weight or stored fat. don't be so concerned with your appearance it's too early for that. it took 9 months to gain it, will take somewhere near that to lose it. stretch marks never go away. they fade up, but never go away. they're a scar on your skin. enjoy your child, don't obsess over yourself.|`|d7AaiXnRaa	It is defiantly possible to achieve a nice body again after childbirth.<br>  <br>  See your pharmacist to get some lotion for the stretch marks I highly recommend something that contains a lot of vitamin E as this helps promote skin repair.<br>  <br>  Eat a healthy balanced diet and drink plenty of water, try to avoid soda's, sugary and fried fatty foods.<br>  <br>  Go to the gym twice a week if possible the work out will help you maintain a good Weight and you will enjoy having some time out the house by yourself. Most gyms have creche or day care for you to the baby in.<br>  <br>  All the best and good luck|`|64cf4032323590ed1f92ff2209074919aa	it is not impossible, that is how i was with my first pregnancy but i was honestly too lazy to try to get into shape then. I was 135 prepregnancy and then 200 (about when i had her) i went back to like 170 right after having her (the 30 lbs went right off) and then i worked off another 20 lbs. but i didnt keep it off and now i am very overweight. it sucks, but being pregnant the third time now, i am very much planning on losing a lot of weight after i have this one cause i feel very unhealthy now.
nLt5VKp9aa	I have traveled many times with my two young children. I always packed double like you said just so I had enough in case of accidents. <br>  <br>  For the plane ride make sure to have an extra set of clothes, burp cloths for clean up, changing pad, diapers, wipes, bottles and formula (if your bottle feeding), pacifier (if you use one, it is good for them to suck on during take-off and landing to help with the pressure in their ears), and blanket to keep them warm.<br>  <br>  Also make sure to bring your car seat and stroller. The car seat you can check-in with your luggage but the stroller you can bring it with you all the way to the gate and check it there.<br>  <br>  I think that is all you will need for a 1 1/2 month old. When they get to the toddler stage that is when you need to bring more like snacks, sippy cups, and toys to keep them entertained.|`|79SdJf42aa	Definitely pack double of everything! Young kids (especially 1 month olds) can go through clothes fast. You should also pack some extra formula(unless you breast-feed). Oh and congratulations on the baby.   :) |`|IVtExrOYaa	i would honestly say definitely!!! my 1 month old has accidents where she spits up all over herself (or me) n sometimes  the poop or pee spills out of her diaper, that happens randomly. sometimes its once a week or sometimes its 3 times a day. i always make sure her diaper is on right but sometimes those things just cant b avoided i guess;}|`|XBTzRVuBaa	Double plus. At one month I was changing my daughter constantly. 
xuhTe9X8aa	You cannot lie about this. Tell them how you feel and see what happens. If you did go to combat and something bad happened, your parents would be massively effected a) because your injured/worse, b) you LIED! so it would be like a massive shock.<br>  <br>  Just man up!|`|SaMXG3EHaa	Don't lie to your parents, once they've had time to think about it they will support your decision. They'll be far, far more hurt if you kept it a secret and they found out after you get injured, right?<br>  <br>  It's a no-brainer - don't lie about something as important as this, just tell them the truth. Having a relative enter the military is always scary and worrying, but hiding it from them would be very, very wrong. And they would find out eventually.|`|0Mmqol3eaa	Depends would you go and slit somones thrat or burn them alive as I told you to... person who did nothing to you and may be unarmed?<br>  <br>  Or if in africa like to shoot kids and I mean children as thats what soldiers are there?<br>  <br>  Probably so some oil or mining company gets rich?<br>  <br>  you actually through this through or just seen the adveerts telling you how fun it is?|`|3aLLQO7vaa	Do what you think is right. If this is really what you want to do go for it. There is alot of infomative websites that may help you with this. Please check some out before making your decision. Just remember it is a HUGE comitment,  I hope you are aware. Good Luck.|`|ccvNyMtZaa	You'll have to tell them; they'll find out soon enough.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm a staunch pacifist and would advise against joining, but it's your life and you're the only one that can decide.|`|dgRTkccBaa	Chances are they're not going to be happy about it.  Joining the military during wartime makes it pretty nerve wracking for a parent.  my good friend's son joined the Marines and told his parents he would have a desk job.  As soon as he's done training he's going to Iraq and his mother is beside herself.  <br>  I will tell you this: Don't join up just because you can't find a job.  Being in the military is a life not everyone is suited for, in my opinion you have to really want to be there or you will be unhappy.  Doing it because you don't know what else to do is not a great decision.|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	I'd just tell them, your an adult they have to accept your choice.<br>  It's your life.
JnLoHaoAaa	Try Target or Babies R Us. They have some cute diaper bags|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	i have the actual vera bradley diaper bag (different shape) and it is amazing. it holds so much stuff! however, any vera bag will probably work for you. i love how they have the inside pockets. i don't think they make the one you're taking about anymore. there is a small duffel that might work for you. really, the baby bag is great though. i got mine on ebay for about half price. try the seller "hollywood bag boy".|`|TMZQ59kYaa	I see similar bags on the website rockindiaperbags.com<br>  Kinda vera bradley but shabby chic. but I saw one with a cylinder type tote shape. hope that helps.
nMeFXa9Uaa	Old-fashioned but really cute. A welcome change from the Jasmeens and Brittneys that usually get posted here. Brianna's nice too, more sophisticated to balance the folksy charm of Maisey. I like.|`|BUET39wmaa	lol nope sorry sounds like a backwoods name|`|2rOQyvaKaa	I prefer Daisy Brianna. |`|UJaCObdyaa	I like the name Maisey but I don't like Brianna as the middle name.  Because Maisey is such an old-fashioned name a modern middle name will not do it any justice.<br>  <br>  Maisey Emma<br>  Maisey Emily<br>  Maisey Sarah<br>  Maisey Rose<br>  Maisey Hannah<br>  Maisey Ruth<br>  Maisey Rebecca<br>  something along those lines would suit it much better.|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	Omagosh YES!  Sounds like daisy but with an "m" right??  soooo very pretty!  and Maisey Brianna is gorgeous!  and NOOOO it DOES NOT sound like a dogs name!  wth?!?!  It's very unique and classic.  I think you should name your little girl that...definitely.  I would.  I think to myself if that were MY name...I would love it.....|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	That is very cute!! I guess I have heard that name, but when I was looking at girl names (before I found out I was having a boy), I must have overlooked that one. I like it a lot!!|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	It makes me think of a dog's name to tell you the truth, but it's not a bad name.|`|fT6VVji9aa	No I don't.  It's old-fashioned and never was appreciated by the people who had that name.  Daisy is similar and similarly old-fashioned but was appreciated a lot more and has come back into vogue and is quite cute [I think].  Brianna is a very modern name and doesn't really go with either Maisey or Daisy.|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	I don't like Maisey as a given name. It is too insubstantial. I think it is better as a nickname for Margaret or maybe even Mary. I loathe Brianna. It is dated and harsh. What about Brenna or Brynn. They are much more modern with out being trendy and are similar. <br>  <br>  Macy Brenna or Macy Brynn would be cute.|`|9nMEmhN9aa	I actually thought of the name Maisey for a while but my husband didnt like it.  My niece's name is Brianna so i definatly like that name. <br>  <br>  <br>  Maisey Brianna sounds great!|`|4OUszQ6zaa	Yes I think it's cute. I think Brianna goes very well with it. |`|q7kiY8L7aa	If it's Maize-ie it reminds me of a mouse. If it's Macy I love it! I know a baby named Macie Leanne, I like that.|`|4ec27dca9c261de9c39abd8e0dd218f5aa	I love the name Maisey but I'm not sure about Brianna as a middle name.|`|i4orMYEmaa	Sounds cute to me :)<br>  You could call her May. I like it. You should name your little girl Maisey Brianna Last Name.|`|9FOHmjN3aa	If it's pronounced like Macy then yes. Brianna sounds nice with it!*|`|yxgoG4wqaa	LOL I love both!!!!  Maisey was my first choice of a girl name (but I was going to spell it Macy) and Brianna was my second!!!  We chose Brianna because my hubby liked it better.  I love them both and I think they go great together!|`|2DeDKdm7aa	Yes! I like it spelled Maisy better though.<br>  Maybe not Brianna. It seems a bit over the top.<br>  Try..<br>  Maisy Marie<br>  Maisy Christine<br>  Maisy Marlisa<br>  Maisy Teresa<br>  Maisy Patricia<br>  Maisy Lynn|`|VZ0xI1Jjaa	I prefer it spelled Macie, but yes, I do like it, that is if "may-cee", is the way you pronounce it|`|G3mIO4Wnaa	Maisey is cute, but she's not going to be a baby girl forever.<br>  Not a fan of Brianna, sorry.|`|d0ZVJeSbaa	I like the name for a little girl, but it does not age with the child. I wouldnt like the name for an adult|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	Macy yes, Maisey no - makes me think of corn. |`|gFiRi5xnaa	Maisey is cute.|`|PEnp6ZKOaa	Yes I do  (pronounced Maizy?)|`|vntAvpAvaa	nope-but thats just me|`|H2xNMNwMaa	that's a fab name!

r4xRkqzdaa	it sounds reasonable to me.|`|wENdWT5kaa	Severe??  A lot? NO way for both. You deserve it, and actually, you deserve a lot more. Stop your whining and next time do not text in class and dont run your bill so high.<br>  <br>  YOU are a prime example why i believe children shouldn't have cell phones till they are 18 and have a job to pay it themselves.|`|0eb11abc3f4a0aefd5bde92a2f37bfa8aa	keeping you in your room, is a bit too harsh, but taking the phone away from you is a good thing!!! Unless you can pay for it yourself then you should not have usage of it. Dont text in class as you could throw away your education because of it. try and talk to her though|`|c73QkZ2haa	I kinda think your mom isnt being hard enough. First of all didnt you learn your lesson the first time you got caught? Cmon now. Secondly 300!!! thats insane! especially if you arent even paying any of the bill...try being a respectful teenager your parents work hard to give you things...|`|50nbSv2Kaa	Wow, i don't think thats severe at all. I wish I would have gotten that type of punishment... You obviously know not to have your phone in school and you didnt learn a lesson! $300.00 phone bill?!?! Are you kidding me? Thats just crazy. 3 weekends wont kill you...|`|AA10741146	Well, let's look at this from another point of view:<br>  <br>  Let's say that you had to pay for your OWN cell phone with an after school job.  You work at Burger King making $8 an hour for 3 hours after school everyday.  It cuts into your time with your friends, TV, etc...but you get to earn some cash.<br>  <br>  You lend your phone to a friend for a month...the same friend that you buy lunch for, help out in a jam, and are basically there for 24/7.  When she returns it to you, she hands you a $300 bill and says YOU have to pay it.  When your friend see's your upset, they smart-off to you.<br>  <br>  After taxes, it will take you 50 hours of fry-flippin work to pay off that bill.  I'm quite sure you'd never let her touch that phone again.<br>  <br>  That's what you did to your mom, and she's reacting the same way you would.|`|0nLdwZP2aa	Yes, you deserve it all.  I wish you understood what a big deal a $300 phone bill is;  I have two lines on my phone and it's never over $100.<br>  <br>  She's mad because you are showing a serious selfish streak and a lack of self-control.  Enjoy your grounding.|`|AA10685564	yes you do|`|AA10098108	I will be honest and say no I don't find that to severe at all. 1) you were caught not once but twice texting in school. 2) you ran up a 300 dollar phone bill. Those 2 alone would be enough for me to take the phone away until you prove you are responsible. If it was a condition of you driving the car to have a cell phone in case something happens, then yes I would say no more car driving until I decided you could have the phone back.  And you are only grounded for 3 weekends (6 days) be glad it is not 3 solid weeks (21 days).<br>  <br>  Oh I just noticed you smarted off at her...oh yeah you were grounded appropriately. |`|HAnt6Ln8aa	Are you the same dude who asked like the same question like a hundred times under all these other accounts about going over your cell phone bill in the summer and getting spanked in front of a pool party full of people???? The one whose account kept getting deleted cause ppl kept reporting the pervy Q????<br>  <br>  Mmmk. So, if you're not the same weirdo guy, then apologies. <br>  <br>  Going over your bill by that much was pretty major, especially at 16. I mean, hello, you can check your minute usage online on and on the phone sooooo easily. I'm 16 and haven't gone over my minutes more than like $20 since I was 12. Take responsibility!!!! <br>  <br>  I would just let things cool down and then talk with her and come up w a plan to pay her back. It makes more sense for you to get a weekend job to pay the bill yourself instead of being grounded. It will be more fun for you, save money for her, and actually, you know..... teach you something. |`|k7pqisSXaa	Well, what I think really won't change your mom's mind, but I will share my feelings on the issue anyway!<br>  <br>  You really need to show your mom you are responsible.  A $300 phone bill is NOT okay!  I really feel like you should apologize to your mom (after she is calm).  I also feel like you need to help pay the bill.  Let her know that you would like to pay the bill (or at least pay the part that is above and beyond what the normal bill is) and ask her if she has any ideas for how you can go about making money.  Will she let you babysit?  Will she let you mow the yard for her?  Will she let you clean the house for her every week (a weekly maid costs about $60)?<br>  <br>  I think once she knows that you are sorry and that you want to take responsibility for your mistakes she will lighten up on banishing you to your room.  Showing her that you truly are sorry and then NOT letting the bill add up like that again will do wonders to rebuild trust and such too.  Also, leave your phone in your car when you're at school.  You're old enough to not break the rules and get yourself in trouble!!!

bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	There is a high risk of dehydration doing this.  Further, the higher concentration of formula and not enough water will most likely lead to constipation.  Babies tend to take as much as they  need.  As long as you offer her enough formula and at regular intervals, it is designed to meet her needs exactly as it is.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Nope, not safe. You should ALWAYS follow the directions on the formula can. If you're going to put an extra scoop in then make an 8 oz. bottle as directed on the can.<br>  <br>  "Adding too little water can tax your baby's kidneys and cause dehydration, while adding too much water will deprive your baby of the calories and nutrients he needs, which can cause stunted growth and failure to thrive. For better accuracy, you may want to use a standard measuring cup instead of the lines on your baby's bottle."|`|wENdWT5kaa	Now i can see how the anit-formula pple keeps saying that it makes a baby obese. <br>  <br>  You should always ALWAYS follow the instructions that is given. Don't take it upon yourself to change it.  Maybe there was a reason why the dr.'s didn't see a problem, cause there wasn't any problem. <br>  <br>  Maybe your daughter was small because that was her build. not all babies weigh the same at certain ages. <br>  <br>  You need to reduce it slowly and get back on track with the instructions. <br>  <br>  The only time i changed the amounts was when my daughter was constipated, and i was told by the DR.  to put an extra ounce of water in it. But that was temporary.  <br>  <br>  |`|LwUBqT3Paa	"I took it upon myself to add an extra scoop to her formula at 4 months old and this month shes fattened up and she looks normal and now she can fit 6 months clothes"<br>  <br>  That's fantastic! If she seems a little slow at the dinner table when she's four, what you should probably do is give her lots and lots of pork rinds, and then three times the recommended number of Flintstones vitamins.|`|qlECsz0Iaa	if you have told the doctor exactly what u are doing and he approves then that is whats important.  but do not do it with the doctors ok.  although they recommend those scoops on the can so the baby gets enough water and formula|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Good way to make your child overweight, in my opinion.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	i wouldnt do it. theres directions for a reason. theres lots of iron in formula, rtoo much isnt good|`|TJusfEnlaa	it says very clearly that incorrect preparation can make your baby very sick. i wouldnt add another scoop without first adding the required amount of boiled water. my son also has four scoops but has 240ml of water which i think is 8 fluid oz<br>  your daughter obviously isn't sick but it can be risky changing the quantities.<br>  give her four scoops but give her the right amount of water. it doesnt matter if she doesnt drink it all, what matters is that you have made it correctly as per the instructions.<br>  good luck|`|1JZaRsmZaa	Keep doing it but each day add just a little more water till you get back to the recommended amount. If you do it in increments she probably wont notice.|`|yukEUvScaa	It actually tells you on the formula carton not to do this as it can make your baby ill!!|`|v9PNCMXbaa	It might not be healthy since the baby can get to much Iron The can has Directions for a reason!!! Some people do not need to have kids!!!!!!!|`|aLHNF9peaa	I would keep on doing it. Hey, chubby babies are waaay cuter than skinny babies, right? |`|zfRBn6Smaa	I had the same problem with my daughter. She would only eat 1-2 ounces every 3-4 hours and sleep 7-8 hour a night without eating. All her doctors told to to add an extra scoop of formula to her bottles so she gets enough cal.s She was under weight. She is gaining weight. I have been doing that since she came from the hospital at 2 months. She is now almost 4 months only and she is doing great, and gaining the weight she needs. Now my daughter drinks anywhere from 2-8 ounces depending on how hungry she is. Her ave. is 4 ounces.<br>  Making a 4 ounce bottle (What we do)<br>  *ounce of water<br>  *2 1/2 scoops<br>  *mixed it together<br>  *then fill with water up to the 4 ounce line.<br>  Normally when you make a 4 ounce bottle it turns out to be a 6 ounce once you add in the formula.<br>  It works for my daughter! I have a nutritionist for her. I would talk to her baby's doctor before you make any changes because if your baby goes off of what you have been doing, your baby might lose weight. With the extra scoop it makes the formula thicker, your baby might not like her formula thin after having it thick for awhile.

p5UTPL8daa	ton urine est trouble, cela signifie que quelque chose ne va pas car une urine "propre" doit etre claire et limpide. une contamination exogène signifie qu'il y a des bactéries de la flore intestinale mais qui ne sont pas passées dans le sang (dans ce cas c'est endogène). Les hématies sont les globules rouges et cela est normal chez les femmes (surtout en période de règles ou autour de cette période). Tes leucocytes sont peu élevés, ce qui ne veut pas dire que tu n'as pas d'infections. Les cllules épithéliales sont les cellules de la peau et visiblement tu ne dois pas trop te gratter sinon elles seraient en très grand nombre. critstaux, cylindres, trichomonas sont des éléments qui, s'ils sont présents, signifient d'une infection grave. les mycéliens sont des champignons (composants) donc tu n'as pas de mycose, ce qui est confirmé par l'examen mycologique.<br>  <br>  Tu dois avoir un petit truc anormal mais pour moi, il n'y a rien de méchant... bon courage!!|`|odJtPFmMaa	Généralement, quand tu fais une infection urinaire, tu le sens...

If she has been on it since birth, then they may be missing some information that keeps her from getting her card. For example, I know when my child was born I had to call and give them her birthdate before they sent the card to me. As for how long she will be on medicaid, usually once a year you will have to fill out some paperwork to see if she still qualifies or not.|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	It goes by your income, you have to recertify annually. My son is 19 months and we still get it.

AA10167940	Walking.  I do an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening.

When I came home from the hospital I only had 6 lbs to go. I lost that, plus some, by breastfeeding for 5 months. I just got lucky I guess.

Here's what I found the most helpful (in priority order).<br>  1. breastfeed - nursing exclusively can burn as much as 800 extra calories a day, especially at the start.  Studies show that women are typically down to their pre-pregnancy weight faster if they breastfeed.<br>  <br>  2.  eat smaller meals more often and make healthier choices.  Fiber, fiber, fiber - it helps fill you up, it's typically found in lower calories foods and it helps boost metabolism.<br>  <br>  3. try to be active - join a mommy baby fitness class - this helped me the most, or walk a lot with the baby.  I also tried to use random moments throughout the day to get exercise - while laying on the floor with baby I'd do sit-ups, I'd park the car further away and walk somewhere, take the stairs instead of the elevator, etc.  If  you play a sport, get back to it as soon as possible, it's also good for the mental health.<br>  <br>  4.  I didn't do this the first two times, but I'm doing it now the third - prevent excessive weight gain in pregnancy but not seeing it as on opportunity to eat like crazy.  Stay within recomended weight gain limits and it's easier to lose.  <br>  <br>  I hope this has been helpful.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  To add on to  your add on... I gained 40lbs with the first two and was lower than pre-pregnancy weight around 6 months|`|AA10442022	i was lucky i gained less than 15 lbs so after i had my 7 1/2 lb baby and broke my water plus delivered my placenta i broke even- getting rid of the belly was easy too- i breastfed! i lost 15 more lbs from preprego weight just by bfeeding!|`|8uauS9aAaa	Not making time for myself to eat and running around like a chicken with my head cut off.

bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	I second the walk, walk, walk answer as it got me going every time.  Also, this is only my theory and take it for what you will, but with both of my children I induced multiple orgasms the day I went into labor.  The Dr.s confirmed it was possible that the contractions from the orgasms speed up dilation.  Just a suggestion and it's fun either way!<br>  <br>  Good luck just remember the baby has to come out some time right.|`|vpL67nETaa	walk walk walk|`|ACyrJQHOaa	Natural Ways to Induce Labor<br>  <br>  First and Most Important—Relax!<br>  <br>  Labor will not begin if you’re tense, worried or trying hard to start labor. Try a warm (not hot) bath in candlelight. Get a professional massage with the only goal being relaxation. Acupuncture and acupressure, because of the focus on key areas of the body, have also helped inspire labor. In addition, some women rely on aromatherapy, specifically the soothing scent of clary sage, to relax. <br>  <br>  Try to do something special for yourself every day—especially if you’re past your due date. Get a manicure, try dinner out at a new restaurant, see a favorite movie or go out for ice cream with your partner. <br>  <br>  You could also try visualization or meditation. <br>  <br>  Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths-in through your nose and out through your mouth. <br>  Get in touch with your body, starting with your toes and working your way up to your face. <br>  Imagine a flower opening slowly as you breathe in and out. <br>  Imagine what your baby looks like and imagine her being born, gently and peacefully. <br>  Not only is this technique relaxing, but it uses the mind/body connection. A visual of being open and the baby being born might be the natural way to induce labor that you need. <br>  <br>  What Gets the Baby In, Gets the Baby Out<br>  Sex is the most well-known trick to begin labor. Semen has natural prostaglandins—-a hormone involved in the start of labor. If you use this technique, don’t get up right away and elevate your hips to help the semen stay on the cervix. This will help to thin and dilate it. <br>  <br>  However, in late pregnancy, many women are not in the mood for intercourse. Simple loving activities that are part of your normal foreplay can help, too. Female orgasm has been known to open the cervix up to two centimeters. You can also ask your partner to gently stimulate your nipples, or heat up a towel in the dryer for a minute or two and place it over your breasts. This prompts the release of oxytocin. Do not do this constantly, however. For some women, contractions started within 20 minutes of doing this. If a half hour or so goes by, stop and maybe try it again another day. <br>  <br>  ”Bump” or “Swing” Your Way into Labor<br>  There are also tricks that involve “bumping” or “swinging” the baby into the pelvis or into a better positing for birthing. These include finding a park with a swing and swinging on it. You can also try driving down a bumpy road. Make a date out of it with your partner or a friend. Take a picnic lunch and do some light hiking. <br>  <br>  Walk the Baby Out<br>  Taking a gentle walk or slowly pedaling a stationary bike might start contractions. Being upright puts pressure on the cervix, which may prompt it to dilate. Make sure to drink lots of fluids, maintain your body temperature below 100.5 degrees and listen to your body. If your body is tired or telling you stop—listen to it! <br>  <br>  Talk to Your Baby<br>  Recent studies have found that the baby begins the complex hormone cycle of labor. As silly as it might feel, talk to your baby and make sure she feels welcome. Tell her about her room, about her grandparents, about your hopes and dreams for her. If nothing else, it creates some wonderful memories and gives you a chance to bond with your baby while you are trying out natural ways to induce labor.<br>  <br>  Herbs and Oils<br>  Castor oil, evening primrose oil, or blue and black cohosh can be used to begin labor, but proceed with caution. These supplements have side effects and possible complications. <br>  <br>  There are concerns about castor oil, which is primarily a strong laxative. While bowel spasms may cause contractions, they may also do nothing more than, well, stimulate the bowel of both you and baby. <br>  The most common application of evening primrose oil is directly on the cervix, not on the belly. Like other lotions and oils, there’s no telling what reaction your body will have externally, much less internally. Since pregnancy can cause adverse reactions to the most common things, this may not be the best choice. <br>  There are few medical studies to support the safe and guided use of blue and black cohash, and finding an herbal professional experienced in the application is rare. <br>  If you’d like to integrate alternative therapy into your health care, it's advisable to check with your health care provider and an herbal professional before using these or any supplements to discuss pros and cons and determine the correct dosages. <br>  <br>  Ask for Your Doctor’s Help<br>  Doctors can induce labor as well, even without using pitocin, which is a synthetic oxytocin. A slightly painful but effective way is to ask the doctor to “scratch” your membranes by going into the cervix. The doctor can also insert prostaglandin-based gel packs into the vagina to stimulate the cervix. Labor often occurs within the next 24-48 hours<br>  |`|qMI6H6Lbaa	i was 3 weeks before my due date with my daughter and i was so uncomfortable.     at 10:30 pm i took castor oil ( its a laxative in liquid form)   dont remember how much i took but i think double what the bottle said and started having contractions about 3am   went to hospital at 8 am and had her at 1:17 pm   so i had her like 14 hours after i took it. but the doctors say that it will not work unless your body is ready to go into labor. s if it doesnt work wait a week and try it again if any thing you just have to sit on the toilet |`|gccK6q20aa	well walking is what i have heard works best. sex also, and stimulation of the nipples.  their is also some old wives tales but i have heard they do not work (haven't tried then myself)|`|oxxBmhV0aa	Walk, nipple stimulation, or sex is a couple of ways..Good luck!|`|0d92507128c32cc83e05032ccd5c8b1faa	My doc (who had delivered at least 800 babies) told me to take caster oil, after I started having contractions. I did get the pill form only after jokiningly asking for them.  I ended up having a c-section tho.....only after being in labor for 72 hrs.  I was ready to do the surgery myself with a nail file (if necessary).   Good luck with you and yours though.  I loved being pregnant...but that is just me.  |`|3eed03edb625fb473af46d775c2f2253aa	If you have a rocking ottoman and exercise your pelvis, that will help to open up your cervix, it worked for my last two babies.

bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	If you're both okay with it then you could have her nurse for you.  <br>  <br>  That being said, she's still young.  In fact many moms haven't even tried a bottle yet at 3 weeks.  She may just take to it on a different day.<br>  <br>  Your baby however will not starve herself and will eventually give in and take the bottle if you decide not to have someone else nurse her.  Try different bottles with different nipples.  Try someone else giving it with you nowhere around.  This will help out in the long run especially if you have to leave again.  If she does take it I would keep it up so she sticks with it.  Maybe offer one bottle a day or every other day to keep her doing it.  <br>  <br>  Any way your baby can travel with you?|`|kQEnJpOvaa	Sure you can have her nurse her, if you both agree. But I know that breast fed babies often will not take a bottle from mom, because they know you have the real thing. I would see if daddy can give a bottle, I think it may work better. Good luck|`|AA10686742	Please have someone else try to give your child a bottle first. I know most on hear say sure go ahead but there are other things that you have to know and be completely sure about before you have someone else nurse your baby. Things have changed since the day of wet nursing.  Not trying to sound rude but I agree with another poster why not cancel. At three weeks your child needs you to be there not gone for three days. Nothing is more important and if people have a problem with it tell them to deal with it themselves you are doing what is best for your baby.|`|Y1xhv55eaa	If you both agree, then the only issue that may arise is supply, if she is nursing an infant of her own, there isnt much time now to make sure she has an adequate supply to supply her own and yours. <br>  Try to do as the above poster suggested and try to have someone else give her the bottle.<br>  Good Luck|`|B2Gki86uaa	Do you mean breastfeeding your baby? Is your SIL healthy?|`|SYBfPFcDaa	Well, is your sister in law producing milk for a start?! If so, then it is entirely up to you - are you really going to let strangers on the internet make that decision for you?! There is nothing wrong with it health wise, presuming she is of good health and doesn't drink/smoke, in the days before formula women who couldn't or didn't want to breastfeed used wet nurses commonly. One woman's breastmilk is just as good as another, so it won't harm your baby. It just depends if you are happy with this, and also whether your sister in law is. It is quite a big thing to ask and really you should have spoken to her about this long before now. But if your daughter won't take a bottle, and you HAVE to go on this 'tour' (may I ask what this is and why it is so important that you can't cancel?), then what other solution do you have? You can NOT go and risk your baby starving if she won't take the bottle still and if your sister in law won't nurse her. NOTHING is more important than your child's health, so you CAN cancel.|`|wTRWfYDfaa	just ask her if she could do it I'm sure she will do a good job at it and will say yes she is the baby's auntie|`|oTvJpXi4aa	If your both comfortable with it...why not? though if the baby is hungry it will accept a bottle eventually.
bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	I'm concerned that you and your husband don't seem to be unified about your parenting and discipline.  Your child will grow to see through this and take advantage of it!  I'd be concerned that your husband may go too far one of these times and cross over into the area of abuse!  Many children are raised without physical discipline and grow up to be wonderful children and adults.  Here are 10 reasons to not hit your children:<br>  <br>  1. Hitting children teaches them to become hitters themselves. Extensive research data is now available to support a direct correlation between corporal punishment in childhood and aggressive or violent behavior in the teenage and adult years. Virtually all of the most dangerous criminals were regularly threatened and punished in childhood. It is nature's plan that children learn attitudes and behaviors through observation and imitation of their parents' actions, for good or ill. Thus it is the responsibility of parents to set an example of empathy and wisdom.<br>  <br>  2. In many cases of so-called "bad behavior", the child is simply responding in the only way he can, given his age and experience, to neglect of basic needs. Among these needs are: proper sleep and nutrition, treatment of hidden allergy, fresh air, exercise, and sufficient freedom to explore the world around him. But his greatest need is for his parents' undivided attention. In these busy times, few children receive sufficient time and attention from their parents, who are often too distracted by their own problems and worries to treat their children with patience and empathy. It is surely wrong and unfair to punish a child for responding in a natural way to having important needs neglected. For this reason, punishment is not only ineffective in the long run, it is also clearly unjust.<br>  <br>  3. Punishment distracts the child from learning how to resolve conflict in an effective and humane way. As the educator John Holt wrote, "When we make a child afraid, we stop learning dead in its tracks."  A punished child becomes preoccupied with feelings of anger and fantasies of revenge, and is thus deprived of the opportunity to learn more effective methods of solving the problem at hand. Thus, a punished child learns little about how to handle or prevent similar situations in the future. <br>  <br>  4. The phrase "Spare the rod and spoil the child" is not from the Bible but from Samuel Butler's "Hudibras", a 17th Century satirical poem. The poem, like his novel, The Way of All Flesh, was written to expose and denounce violence against children. <br>  <br>  While the "rod" is mentioned many times in the Bible, it is only in the Book of Proverbs that this word is used in connection with parenting. The book of Proverbs is attributed to Solomon, an extremely cruel man whose harsh methods of discipline led his own son, Rehoboam, to become a tyrannical and oppressive dictator who only narrowly escaped being stoned to death for his cruelty. In the Bible there is no support for harsh discipline outside of Solomon's Proverbs. By contrast, the writings in the Gospels, the most important books in the Bible for Christians, contain the teachings of Jesus Christ, who urged mercy, forgiveness, humility, and non-violence. Jesus saw children as being close to God, and urged love, never punishment.3<br>  <br>  5. Punishment interferes with the bond between parent and child, as it is not human nature to feel loving toward someone who hurts us. The true spirit of cooperation which every parent desires can arise only through a strong bond based on mutual feelings of love and respect. Punishment, even when it appears to work, can produce only superficially good behavior based on fear, which can only take place until the child is old enough to resist. In contrast, cooperation based on respect will last permanently, bringing many years of mutual happiness as the child and parent grow older.<br>  <br>  6. Many parents never learned in their own childhood that there are positive ways of relating to children. When punishment does not accomplish the desired goals, and if the parent is unaware of alternative methods, punishment can escalate to more frequent and dangerous actions against the child.<br>  <br>  7. Anger and frustration which cannot be safely expressed by a child become stored inside; angry teenagers do not fall from the sky. Anger that has been accumulating for many years can come as a shock to parents whose child now feels strong enough to express this rage. Punishment may appear to produce "good behavior" in the early years, but always at a high price, paid by parents and by society as a whole, as the child enters adolescence and early adulthood.<br>  <br>  8. Spanking on the buttocks, an erogenous zone in childhood, can create in the child's mind an association between pain and sexual pleasure, and lead to difficulties in adulthood. "Spanking wanted" ads in alternative newspapers attest to the sad consequences of this confusion of pain and pleasure. If a child receives little parental attention|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	NO... i don't think it is. my friend has 3 children and she doesn't spank her kids (one of them is only aboit 10 months)the other two children are 8 and 10 years old and they are very good children  there are 7 kids in my family and all of us were spanked. some of us turned out good and some didn't. it's not a problem solver i think. i give my son time outs ( he's onlny 18 months) for about 30 seeconds to a minute) and explain to him that we don't climb on this because it gives booboos or whatever. children like to keep their parents happ and i think staying calm and lots of praise helps kdids to learn adn do the right thing. eventually your little girl is goign to be too old to spank and what kind of punishment will he use then?<br>  <br>   now if your child hits someone andd she gets into trouble andd her fatherr hits her- what will that teach her- if she hits she gets hit?|`|TZydDRJvaa	In reality spanking really doesnt teach your child anything but violence. yes kids can be naughty and bad of course they are kids. my son sometimes can be a little brat but you deal with IT <br>  empathy statements work for kids for disipline.. time out && then asking ur child what they did wrong and not to do it anymore yelling && screaming or even spanking doesnt show ur kid anything they will just mis behave MORE its a proven fact. I would look into something else for disipline most def. |`|2tVrEThUaa	She probably won't like her father to much. Hitting doesnt teach anything...<br>  If she is naughty try things like getting down to her eye level and talking to her straight in the face. tell her she shouldnt do that and begin a rewarding process. if she is good give her somethin like a sticker. I know time-outs never work but you have to be hard....if she runs out of her spot put her back in...and keep doing it until she stays. in this part you do have to be hard and if she crys it is probably better then knowing before it was out of pain.<br>  Haha, I am only 14 so i dont know if this helps but try it|`|FxXaBd16aa	Well this question has a slippery slope.<br>  <br>  I do spank my children, but only after timeout and me talking to them on their level doens't work. <br>  <br>  I think first and foremost talking to them about others feelings on their level.. is the best way. When they see you talking to them.. instead of just hitting them.. will make a big difference. Time out is good too, because it gives them a chance to sit and think about what they have done. If she gets up .. while in time out, put her back in it. Every time my son gets up.. he has to go back in. <br>  <br>  Now saying that.. what is naughty behavoir? I mean if she is 2/3 what is she doing that is naughty? Naughty behavior to you. .might mean a typical day for me. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong.. we do spank in our house. .but only after other ways fail. <br>  <br>  She will start to learn that it is ok to hit others. She will start to lash out against others.. maybe even you. I am thinking that you are the less aggressive parent. She will see that you have not done anything to help the situation and react to that. <br>  <br>  I would talk to you husband.. take him out of th element and talk. Tell him how you feel and see if there is a different way this can be handled. She will react one day!!! <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|3FnDVlCAaa	You should teach her a lesson, that teaches her a lesson. |`|95fba1f2b696c0c21dfcc624e3ebe088aa	I think spanking is ok - within reason.  It should never be the first line of defense (so to speak).  We have a 2 1/2 year old who, of course, gets into mischief, as children will...  she gets a time out right off the bat for naughty behavior.  She only ever gets swatted (ONE open palm swat on the bottom) if her behavior is malicious (harming her baby sister) and previously disciplined.  So if she steps on her sister's hand and gets a time out of for it then goes and does it again, she will get spanked.<br>  <br>  I NEVER spank out of anger or from the inability to control myself.  A spanking is always warned and alternative consequences are always used first.  <br>  <br>  If a child is being hit multiple times per day and is getting hit multiple times during a spanking - that is very wrong and I believe is child abuse.  Spanking is always a last resort when nothing else seems to work.  |`|9GywK3mBaa	i think itll get better, bcuz as she gets older, shell be like "omg! i dont want my friends to no that im still getting the punishment of a toddler!!!"<br>  if it doesn't get better soon, idk...but tell ur husband to lighten up a little, dont feel bad when he spanks her tho, cuz she needs to lern that its not ok to be bad.|`|okh3hL8taa	It is never necessary to hit a child.  I have never hit my children and neither did their father.  My parents never hit me or my 6 siblings.  Hitting is not discipline it is simply physical violence and it does not teach a child to respect the parent who hits.  It teaches the child to fear and then resent that parent.  A parent is supposed to protect and teach their child not hit them.|`|entwlTqnaa	NO!! in my opinion it is NEVER EVER ok to hit your child, EVER!!!!! and i doubt it will get better, my best friend has a little brother and her dad used to spank him and even after her parents were divorced, he is still a crazy little kid.|`|RdVyRaYNaa	i don't think its necessary personally, particularly as it gives her a lot of pain. you and your husband should just tell her off when she's naughty so that she understands that shes done something wrong but it think its horrible to hit her<br>  x|`|PEnp6ZKOaa	Children learn what they live.   If they are 'corrected' with spanking, then the hidden message is that force is an effective way to deal with a problem.   <br>  <br>   |`|C3pYJaQTaa	my mom spanked me when i was little and i started dis-liking her. i think there's more options than spanking.|`|YmNlPN9baa	I think this is the only way a child will learn!

I have to carry her constantly. Not sure what to do either.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	it's normal and she just wants to feel secure- try getting a sling and carrying her around in that. it will help you get some things done- it doesn't last forever so cherish it. my son was like that and now he's 18 months old and hardly ever wants me to hold him unless he's tired and doens't want to walk lol sometimes i go to pick him up and he arches his abck and wants to get down lol. you can't spoil somone with love and care. someone said ti won't hurt to let her cry but i can. crying releases a stress hormone called cortisol andd too much cortisol can effect brain growth and development|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	Why would somebody claim to love their child, then let them lay and cry? Personally, I can't stand to hear my daughter cry. When she was younger I would hold her when she cried. She didn't like me setting her down to nap, so I would hold her. We spent many hours curled up in our jammies, under blankets on the couch napping (or with me, watching TV and/or reading and snacking.) I knew the time would come in like a month (or so it would seem) that she wouldn't be that tiny and wouldn't want to be held. I still go to her when she cries, or see if she's okay (if she's with my husband or MIL). I'm Mommy. It's instinctual and it's my job. When she was nine months old, she went through a stage in which she went ballistic if I just looked as though I was leaving the room. It got worse after we moved and I spent a couple of weeks at my parents'. I kept telling my mom (who claimed that it was because I held her too much; went to her all the time) she was going through a phase to begin with and we did just move and she's in a new spot. Also, my husband wasn't there, either. (I realized that was part of her problem by Wednesday or Thursday when she got upset after I ended a call with my husband and had the speaker phone on so she could hear him.)<br>  <br>  Now, at 13 months, she happy, gaining independance (more than what I want, of course) and is currently happily with her grandmother. She knows who Mommy is. She doesn't like sitting still too cuddle, she's too busy crawling and standing (holding on to things) and exploring.<br>  <br>  I found "Nighttime Parenting" by Dr. Sears (I don't remember which one) a couple of months ago at the library. I wish I had had it sooner, but it was still a great read. I'll probably find a copy for the next baby.|`|6hA0O06xaa	I am afraid you'll probably have to wait until she outgrows this.  But keep trying (at least once she's asleep) so one day she'll get used to it.  But of course pick her right up if she wakes and cries.  She is waaaayyy too young to let her cry it out, even if you agree with that method.  You may also try swaddling her, even when she is not sleeping.  It makes babies feel less overwhelmed by the world and the snug blanket feels like you are still holding her.  You can also try wearing her in a sling or a front carrier like a baby bjorn so you have your hands free.  When you absolutely need a break, try taking her for a ride in the stroller.  Most babies either enjoy the fresh air and new scenery or they fall fast asleep when they are out for a walk.  Good luck.  She will outgrow this soon and then when she's crawling around and doesn't want to be picked up, you'll miss hodling her and snuggling with her.|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	Crying is the only way that infants can communicate what they need.  The problem is it's not always clear what they need.  Perhaps get a sling so  you can keep her close but still get things done.  If you've checked that all of her needs are met and you need to set her for a few minutes it's not going to harm her but if she's soothed by being held, what's the harm?  You can't spoil a child or develop habits that young.  Babies are not able to manipulate parents at that age so a cry is simply her expressing a need, nothing else.  Go meet the need.|`|Yn2n26zXaa	Are you people kidding me? This is a six week old NEW BORN! Six weeks! Fuc%.<br>  <br>   If your baby needs to be held, for WHATEVER reason, hold her. She needs to know she can rely on you to meet all of her needs. And if you deny her the love and comfort she needs now don't expect much of a trust to form at all. Crying isn't a good thing. It means she NEEDS something. Whether that's form hunger, wetness, or just comfort, she needs you to respond quickly and with love. Invest in a sling. Do not let your baby cry.  Babies cry to communicate, not manipulate. Don't ever let anyone tell you different. |`|MEVg0LBGaa	im apalled someone answered to let her cry.<br>  <br>  any sensible parent or someone giving advoce here know cry it out is NEVER recommended before 6mos.<br>  <br>  and if you KNOW that ALL of her needs are met, the pick her up and cuddle her.<br>   <br>  contrary to what some think, this does NOT spoil the child - at this age, its impossible. she loves you, she loves the cuddles, warmth, security. why deny her that?<br>  <br>  if it get to the point where you cannot walk away from her at all even for a second, invest in a baby sling. she will eventuall find her independence and not want you all the time - cherish her while she still wants you.

I worked right up until delivery day with both of my children but that was so I could maximize money and time off afterwards.  Do you get sick leave if you go off work early, perhaps with a Dr. note?  If so, maybe you could do that and not really start maternity leave until after the babies are born.  How long do you get after?  In Canada we get one year off, so giving up a month or two before isn't too bad.  But if you only get something crazy like 6 weeks or 3 months like in the States (I could be wrong on numbers), then you may want to save all the time for after so you have at least some time to focus on breastfeeding, baby care, getting yourself healthy, etc.<br>  <br>  Can your work accommodate you in any other way?

aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	It wasn't a decision or choice, I just followed my heart and what I felt in my body<br>  <br>  I searched as a child.  Internally. 'who are they' 'why did it happen' 'where are they'<br>  <br>  As soon as a was an adult I attempted to find information about my birth and adoption and had door after door slammed in my face and loads of negative things said to me, telling me I had no right and was doing wrong.   It really hurt and I couldn't face any more of it, so I dropped it for many years.   I left my name on passive registries and that was that.  Until,<br>  <br>  I gave birth to my first child.  It was a turning point and I realised that it wasn't just my heritage and history that was missing, it was theirs too.  What could I tell them?  "Oh people were horrid about me finding the truth, so I just couldn't be bothered"  No. I decided that my children and my First Mother deserved to know the truth of their origins/what happened to that child respectively.<br>  <br>  It was a struggle and I've been insulted and chastised by many anti-search people, but I was determined.   I didn't expect a rosy relationship, I just wanted the truth is all.<br>  <br>  Earlier this year - success.  and the icing on the cake was that my mother was overjoyed to hear from me so not only do I have the truth, but I have another person to love and share my life with (and she has 3 more grandchildren!)<br>  <br>  My mother has also been kind enough to share information with me, which has cleared up an ongoing medical problem which was previously undiagnosed.<br>  <br>  Very happy :)<br>  <br>  ETA:  forgot to add that Mom has told me all about my father.  No luck locating him yet though - still trying (he has a very common name!)|`|BH9MoOQAaa	I feel hokey answering the question because it probably only barely applies to me.<br>  <br>  I don't really have to search being that I'm participating in a semi-closed adoption.  I know where my son is and who his family is, his parents know who we are, where we are and all that.  We exchange photos and notes twice a year as he grows up, but it is semi-closed because he only knows that he is adopted and nothing really about his family of origin.<br>  <br>  Anyway, he is 12.5 years old now.  I don't really have to search for him, but still the question remains of if and when some sort of reunion thing will happen.  It's such a complex idea right now and each person directly affected has a different opinion or emotion attached to the adoption/relinquishment.<br>  <br>  This waiting sucks though.  Not knowing if there is ever going to be an if and when sucks.  I can't live my life pretending that it would never happen, my family needs to be prepared for that, but then living as if there was an if and when sucks too.<br>  <br>  Meh.  Knowing my luck it will be one of my daughters doing vanity searches that will make contact.<br>  <br>  Edit to add to answer the additional information question.<br>  My son's father is by my side through all of this.  He is now my husband and father to the rest of our children.  Also, while my husband is usually a cup is half empty type person, our son is the one topic where he is certain the glass is half full and that we will meet again one day.|`|XyU6oEVPaa	I decided at the age of 18 while laying in the hospital bed on the drugs they gave me to calm me after my last hope, my son's father, was arrested at the door of the home when he came to get us.  <br>  <br>  I filed the Consent to Contact form on his 16th birthday so it would be ready and waiting there, and then called several times a year until his 18th birthday, just to check and make sure that it was all there and accessible.  <br>  <br>  Then, I called about every month or so for five more years until we finally called the agency on the same day and got the same person who recognized the connection.  <br>  <br>  I hate them for stealing my baby. But, I hate them more for stealing another freaking 5 years from us.<br>  <br>  ETA: My son's father is dead.  There are not a whole lot of fathers who are concerned about this issue, and from the EMS, at least, if they had not abandoned their pregnant girlfriends there would be far fewer adopted adults posting here now. They were usually not put on the BC, because unless they admitted paternity they could not legally be added.  It is not that much different now in a lot of states.

cb9l7kdQaa	It depends.<br>  <br>  If you're a woman with goals and dreams of becoming very successful and living the American dream then you should abort in a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  If you want to be a stay-at-home mom, live on welfare, and ruin your bf's life and your life, then keep the child because the child will hinder both your and his future career goals.<br>  <br>  No need to tell him.  For you to tell him, he'll have pressure to tell you to keep it.  Because if he doesn't then you'll think he's a jerk.<br>  <br>  Just do it silently and keep it cool.  Not only will he thank you gratefully for it when you tell him later, you'll be THANKING YOURSELF for it down the line.<br>  <br>  Life will be tough having a child in today's economy especially if you can't afford it.  Also, if you're old enough to have a child you're old enough to pay all of your own bills - don't try to rely on your parents for the rest of your life.... it's hard for them to bring you up as is.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Next time, remember to have protected sex.  Since you've only been with him for 3 months, who knows what he has or have been with.  Use birth control pills also on top of condoms and/or even the day after pill.  Then you wouldn't have to worry about it now.<br>  <br>  P.P.S.  I hope you'll be a woman who goes to college and get a good career.  You will have plenty of time to have plenty of children later on.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|KPWT5oTJaa	Tell him, besides since you've only been together for 3 months and you've already "done it" he seems like a manwhore who's just looking for fun. But you shouldn't abort the baby. If you honestly have no way of taking care of it go to an adoption centre and give them a good reason as to why you can't keep it. Don't say "Well, I got pregnant with my boyfriend, and I don't want the baby." If you say that they will not take the baby. But whatever you do, don't kill the baby, or you'll live with the guilt for the rest of your life.|`|WcsfB4h5aa	You got pregnant, you need to keep the baby and if you don't think that you would be a good mother, then give it up for adoption. Abort=killing a baby. You should tell your boyfriend. But abortion is wrong. If you are having sex you should be smart enough to know that. It is going to be hard, but do the right thing without being selfish. There are hundreds of families out there that can't have a child. You made the mistake, aborting it is just going to be another one. |`|Z0slUXBwaa	You should tell him. His belief systems may be different than your own (in matters of pro-life) He may want to keep the baby. Since this is his child also, you should tell him, and see what he has to say, because there is nothing worse than not knowing you have/had a child. It is only fair, because you are not in this alone! Good luck sweet heart, I hope everything works out for you.<br>  <br>  My Opinion: A child is a precious thing, and an experience many other women are not able to experience, as another option, you could always give your child up for adoption. Some families will even pay for your medical bills, and give you personal expense money for having their little miracle. Just another thought.|`|Fr5xabUmaa	Think about the guy and his reaction to the news. Do you have a feeling whether or not he would have a strong opinion? Three months is not very long, but you probably have a gut feeling about his beliefs. If you think he would do whatever you want, you can tell him. If you think that he may hurt you or threaten you, then you may not want to tell him if safety is a concern. Honesty is the best policy so I probably would tell him, but make it clear that you have to make the final decision about what to do next.|`|gof1GvUuaa	TELL him! if you have a chance with this boy can you imagine having that secret from him for life. that would kill your relationship.<br>  2nd of all:<br>  has anyone told you the negatives of abortion?<br>  One getting an abortion can make you infertile.<br>  Two you don't know how much that can emotionally affect you.<br>  My mom had abortions and now she has nightmares about them.<br>  She recently had to get a hysterectomy and as soon as she got that, that's when she went down hill. The fact that she had killed a baby of her own and is now infertile broke her heart.<br>  Did you know that a baby has a heartbeat almost as soon as conception!?!<br>  My mom almost aborted me but didnt. Think about it. What is wrong with open adoption? my boyfriend put his son up for adoption and thinks that is the best thing he ever did. He still gets to see his son but is being raised in a better home than he could have provided for him<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|mzwrQStxaa	definitely use birth control. I would tell him of course after telling your family. If you both decide that you cannot handle it no matter what, I would put it up for adoption. Never abort, you shouldn't just abort it just because you can't take care of it, give it a chance. There are a lot of people out there who cannot have children who would love to adopt it.|`|FJpRKhgfaa	If I were you I would get the abortion, but I would tell him what I was planning to do. Because it will hurt your relationship so much if u get an abortion, not tell him, and then have him find out later. And don't listen to the jesus freaks who come on here and say abortion is murder. If you think that is the best decision for you at this time in your life, then go ahead and do it because it is up to you. |`|yehJu1Awaa	If he is the father then he has the right to know and voice his opinion about the abortion. I my self would not do that to a unborn baby when there are plenty of parents who would love to adopt. By the way I hope your telling your parents about this because you will feel very depressed after abortion and will need someone to comfort you.|`|AA10287946	I think you will feel better when you tell him and what your plans are.  He may feel the same way you do.  Don't be concerned whether you will scare him away or not...You've only known him for 3 months...He may be scared away by something else.  At least you'll know what type of person he is sooner than later....Responsible and cool headed or the opposite.|`|bs2KmvBHaa	are you guys getting serious, because if then, you should tell him. He was dumb enough to get you pregnant and he should help you pay for the shmooshmortion. you will get through this and i do believe your not a bad person if you get one. good luck!!|`|1JFXHf4Faa	You need to tell him eventually. Sooner is better that later because you will have more time to decide what to do. Then you both need to learn how to use contraception. Abortion is NOT a form of birth control.|`|iMYPvAHMaa	you have to tell him. believe me he will find out eventually. when he finds out it will be 6x worse then if u told him now. see his reaction. if he leaves you then he is not the guy for you anyway|`|xI9NEujuaa	no, don't abort it. that's completely ****** up. tell your bf whats up and don't abort. put it up for adoption or some ****. el oh el|`|12wQtbwkaa	Tell him. Its best to be honest than to keep secrets. Tell your family first, blood is thicker than water.|`|AA12073245	Good for you to make a choice that is best for you right now. Some young kids bring kids into this world that they cannot have the proper care for and bad things end up happening to the child. And sometimes you cannot have a child and just give it away to someone so yes you are making the right choice as ling as you are not beyonf the first trimester.  Just have a baby when you are ready. Thats why they have womens right to chose. But yes tell him he has the right toknow. I had one when i was younger i could not take care of the child. Now 10 years later, i am pregnant with a cute baby boy (with the same guys baby lol)|`|QzWHMGHJaa	Of course, he should pay for 1/2 of it!  Now learn a lesson and USE BIRTH CONTROL!|`|0M45cne5aa	I wouldn't abort your baby if i were you. If you've only been with the guy for 3 months you probably shouldn't be having un protected sex with him, or sex at all for that matter. And you should've been more responsible if you knew you definitely weren't ready for a baby, it's called maturity. If you truly believe you can not be a good mother to your baby right now, and the baby wouldn't have a great life, start looking in to adoption. Besides, i'm sure anyone would pick a not so good life over not getting a chance to live at all. But if you give the baby up for adoption he/she has a chance at a great life, to parents who would love him/her. I would tell your boyfriend and ask his views on it. He has a right to know that you are pregnant with HIS child. Who cares if it scares him, it scares a lot of people. But you can't hide to him that you're pregnant, just tell him that you are but you don't think you're going to keep it. That shouldn't scare him. |`|wBpennsMaa	You are totally using abortion as a birth control method and that is wrong. I am pro-life, but do agree that there are certain times when abortion is okay. This is not one of those times. It would be very selfish of you. I hope that if you do get an abortion-someday when you want to become pregnant you can't. Your boyfriend needs to know. I'd at least make him pay for half of it.|`|fmQIU0zqaa	Absolutely! Never hide anything from the person you love. That's the worst way to get you two separated. You two must tell each other everything, unless the relationship will not go so well.|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	You kinda have to... <br>  <br>  If you don't  and when he finds out He will Be PISSED, and probably Leave you .. I know I would |`|KL24imFBaa	tell him and if he doesnt want to be a father either you should talk to someone about adoption. abortion is murder and that shouldn't have to die just because you were too stupid to wait to have sex or to use protection. this child didnt ask to have stupid parents so give the baby to someone who will actually care to raise the baby.<br>  <br>  and if it scares him away it's because he is a loser and not a real man. neither of which you need|`|K24Jdwdoaa	Yes, I def think you should tell him because it would probably eat at you if you do go through with the abortion and don't tell him he had a chance to be a daddy. At least think of adoption as a possibility. But whatever you do decide to do I wish you the best and I'm praying for you! |`|4hxWp1WOaa	Do you know how many unwanted babies are aborted out of everyone?<br>  90% unwanted<br>  7% Health safety<br>  3% Rape.<br>  <br>  Gosh tell him, it is your fault it has ended up this way.|`|dbm6Yjneaa	Clear communication will certainly help.|`|wZtBPDLBaa	Abortion should not be a form of contraception.|`|yqRdGnl6aa	don't kill a child because you couldn't keep your legs closed or use protection! you made it now deal with your consequences!!!!!|`|Gnnx3799aa	Sex doesn't sound so cool now, does it.|`|iqWRMcNvaa	I dont not think you should abort a child unless both of you agree on it.  It may be hard to believe, even though all he did was shoot sticky white goo in your vagina, he is still a father to that child.<br>  <br>  How would you feel if you were a man and found out your gf was pregnant and wanted the child but your girlfriend had her mind set on abortion? To some people abortion is murder, to me, it is...<br>  <br>  Let your boyfriend know and ask him if it's OK to murder your baby.<br>  <br>  Abortion is NOT a "late" birth control method. It should be only used in extreme cases.<br>  <br>  Ex. Baby is going to be born with cancer, aids, diseases, or the birth would kill the mother.

That's them spending tons of money on you. Be grateful, many kids don't even get that much. Don't be spoiled and think they owe you anything. They don't. In fact, you owe them. Doing your part around the house is the very least you should be doing. :p|`|LMc23g9Maa	I can barely believe your mom does not work.

iUqqn0bQaa	bè effettivamente è vero..io sono del '93 ma mi sento abbastanza matura; certo devo ancora crescere ed imparare molto , questo è normale! comunque io ho fatto l'amore adesso col mio ragazzo, a 15 anni, non prendermi per puttana anzi per dire la verità questi tempi corrono troppo in fretta. Si basti pensare che vedo in giro delle '95-'96 che l hanno già fatto, che si truccano in maniera spropositata e si fanno tutti i piercing che vogliono. Io penso che se uno del '90 si mette con una '95 è solo un morto di figa. Non tanto per i 5 anni di differenza , ma giusto perchè una ragazzina a 13-14 anni non è ancora matura e per non deludere il moroso fanno tutto quello che gli chiedono di fare. In poche parole penso che quelli più grandi si mettano insieme solo perchè le ragazzine 13enni che ancora non ragionano la danno via più facilmente confonto ad esempio ad un '93 o '92 . Comunque è vero la tivù influenza molto..|`|XnQyWwPmaa	Anna io sono del 92, quindi faccio parte dellle generazioni dopo il 90. Ciò che ti posso dire è che la responsabilità primaria è dei genitori. I genitori dovrebbero essere coloro che spingono i propri figli ad essere motivati nella vita, coloro che li guidano in tutto e per tutto. Invece io non faccio che assistere a mamme che fanno di tutto per togliersi davanti(nel vero senso della parola) le figlie mandandole in discoteca a soli 11 anni (L'ultima volta che ci sono andata c'era gente sui 10anni) e facendole vesire, perdona il termine, come delle vere e proprie sciacquette, con tanti di minigonna e tacchi vertiginosi che fanno apparire una bambina come una donna vissuta. Ovviamente i figli non sentendosi controllati fanno ciò che vogliono.<br>  <br>  Ripeto a dirti che,secondo me,la colpa è dei genitori principalmente. Io non ho mai avuto questo tipo di problemi perchè i miei genitori mi hanno sempre educata secondo un modello di vita perfetto, senza mai negarmi niente ma insegnandomi ciò che è giusto e ciò che non lo è.<br>  <br>  Ma adesso è uno schifo totale.|`|mngCMQXEaa	no...nn è vero ke è tutto uno skifo! ci sono persone responsabili (fino ad 1certo punto xo..) ke hanno dei princìpi ed altre xsone ke la danno al vento (scusami x la terminologia...)...certo la tv da alle ragazzine degli idoli sbagliati ed io lo so xke anke io attraverso kst xiodo ma mi sto rendendo conto ke la tv è una scatola ke nn contiene nulla al suo interno cioè nei programmi, nelle trasmixioni, non c'è mai nexuno di davvero interexante (no di apetto fisico ma nella morale) xsone ke sn capitate li' x caso ke tutto kll ke sanno fare è fare le papere e basta!! x kll ke dici tu della droga...beh purtroppo nn poxiamo farci nnt...anke io conosco xsone no ke si drogano ma ke diciamo fumano ( enn sugarette) ma diciamo ke in kst caso nn si parla di droga vera e propria...cmq è la societa ke impone alle ragazze di fare determinate cose...ormai si parla di sesso sin dalle scuole elementari!!! e x il fatto di bere io nn ci vedo nulla di male...forse xke spexo lo faccio anke io... |`|H0ilbOR9aa	Sicuramente i media hanno avuto in questi anni un effetto distruttivo sugli adolescenti. Ma credo che la famiglia, dovrebbe interessarsi maggiormente alla vita dei loro figli ed EDUCARLI; se si vedono ragazzette di 13 anni che vanno in giro con persone di 20 anni di differenza, la colpa non è dei media (in quel caso) ma dei genitori che non san educarli. La televisione ha assopito molte cose... la lettura, lo sport, e interessi di vario genere; ora tutti preferiscono pensare a corteggiare i tronisti/e, a come metter corna senza esser scoperti e miliaia di altre cose che stan solo danneggiando la società intera (per lo piu gli adolescenti). Le lolite non nascon dal nulla... e cose simili... programmi come ''Lucignolo'' dovrebbero essere cancellati totalmente, perchè mostrano solo il lato ''puttanesco'' di tutto ciò che ci circonda. Però alla fine ognuno vive come meglio crede. Ciao.|`|NioTfJ1zaa	A dire la verità io ho 13 anni (fra 2 mesi 14) e qst cs nn mi sn passate prpr x la testa.

But everyone's is different, you are going to be okay.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	i thinkit is just u|`|dDGGgD8caa	It really depends on how hardcore you got my first time i was like rambo and man was i sore afterwords, and if your gasy did ya do the doggy style, that would explain that!!!|`|I6qfoJaiaa	I felt really sore after the first time and kind of crampy, but it passed. If you lost it awhile ago and are late on a period I would take a test.|`|LfRN4Z6qaa	Its funny I really did not feel any pain or anything. It all depends on the girl. Maybe its a combo of that and something else?
s4LWmcTjaa	I say it's up to the parents.  Either way is fine with me as long as you are choosing what you feel is in the best interest of your son.<br>  <br>  But I have to warn you, you are opening a can of worms here and there are some people with EXTREME views on the matter.<br>  <br>  If you want to be circumcised, you can still do it as an adult.  But it's not a requirement.  Be happy with yourself :)|`|VmSKQ40Caa	I am a male, but I just want to say, I am uncircumcised and I LOVE IT! I am happy to be intact and I know it is better to be intact. That women that said boys are not diligent to clean themselves is wrong, and let her stupid beliefs affect her son very negatively.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	I hope you realize that at this age a circumcision entails having stitches. But beside that fact, a foreskin in supposed to be there, it's protects the glans of your penis from becoming scarified, hard and insensitive. Removing the foreskin removes thousands of nerves and miles of blood vessels. The inside of your lip in like the skin on your glans if you circumcise it, your glans will become like your outer lip. <br>  My husband was circumcised as a baby and he feels that he was mutilated. He feels that his sexual and sensual feeling has been severely reduced. Please don't do this to yourself, I fear you would regret it and there is no going back once it is done.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I think the son should be what the dad is...<br>  <br>  we circ'd. it IS more sanitary and WILL prevent him from getting infections that would cause him to need surgery later on. Would you rather have a circ and a baby and not remember it or have to have one later on and remember everything?<br>  <br>  You cannot trust a young boy who showers himself to properly clean down there....most boys just aren't that diligent enough. THEN when they get to be teens some are even worse at hygiene..|`|prqrQcd1aa	Doesn't matter honestly... I don't have any son's so i don't have to make that choice! My youngest brother was not, and he's like 13 years old now, so this has been a debate for awhile i would supoce! <br>  <br>  I don't have an opinion either way..to each his own!|`|Qz3sii2caa	I think men should be left the way nature made them. Helmet and all.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	I have never seen an uncircumsized man, and I have seen alot of penises, lol. Seriously, If I were to see an uncircumsized man I would probably be confused and think there was something wrong, just because I have never seen one before.<br>  <br>  Anyway, on a serious note, I had my son circumsized because thats just not really up to debate where I am from, it is just the norm I guess. I think it depends on where you are from, some areas it is not the norm to get circumsized.|`|xp4mhkqgaa	I decided against chopping bits of my son's body, infact I didn't even think about it, it never crossed my mind to do it.  There's no need for it.  Unless there's a medical reason, then leave their willies alone :)<br>  <br>  It's not unhygienic, and they won't catch diseases.  It's pefectly natural to have a foreskin, and apparantly there's more sensation for males when their foreskin is intact.  <br>  <br>  I know people do it for religious reasons, and even though I don't agree with it I think it's worse when people do it because they think it looks nicer, or because they want their son to look like their father.  That's pretty pathetic, in my opinion.|`|m7VBQskEaa	Im unsicrumsized and i LOVE it,<br>  Dont listen to those people saying,"OHH,the baby wont remember it..."<br>  <br>  Actually The baby DOES remember it,and the baby IS traumatized,and ther IS a 40% chance of the heart to stop pumping..!<br>  <br>  so leave it alone,<br>  Its better to clean it everyday anyways,|`|BQEjpIibaa	there is nothing wrong with being  uncircumcised. my husband is and i have no problem with it. but the only thing that concerns me is the sanitary part. i am having a child very soon and i am going to circumsize if i have a boy. just for the reason of sanitary. but honestly if you are with a girl that actually does mind that you are uncircumsized than she isn't worth your time. women really shouldn't mind. it just looks different. so be comfortable with yourself. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|ddP3klT3aa	I got my son circumcised because to me it IS easier to clean. And its kind of a trend now. I kind of do prefer a man to be circumcised but its not a deal breaker. Just keep yourself clean. And I don't recommend you do it at your age.<br>  Another reason being is as your get older (elderly) your skin sags EVERY WHERE. It is hard to place the skin back around your penis as you get older. I knew of one elderly man in a nursing home who had a bath one day and the nurse did not put his foreskin back properly and it got infected and really swelled. They had to do a bedside circumcision on that man. That would be an awful thing to endure.|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	Circumcised both of my boys are|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I don't care if a man is uncircumcized or not, but I'm having my son any day now, and I am not getting him circ. My boyfriend is not circ. either.  It doesn't bother me.  My reasons for not getting my son circ is that there are no REAL health benefits to him getting it done.  Its not a hassle to keep it clean or anything, my boyfriend and the son he already has have never had any problems.  I did research and most of the men in the world are uncirc.  I wouldn't do it for religious reasons, and I understand that something like only half of the men in the US are having it done now, so really, its half and half.  To me that means that my son probably won't get made fun of for it in the locker room or anything and girls from his generation will be used to it, so it won't be an issue.  I just think its really bad to give your newborn COSMETIC SURGERY!!! They don't do it to girls.  Just because they are a baby and won't remember doesn't mean they don't hurt right now. Also, it looks the same when its erect anyway....|`|YW74O9aNaa	Uncircumsized! <br>  There is no valid reason to circumcise. My husband is uncircumsized, and has had no problems whatsoever. Where i am from its normal. <br>  The reasons given hiegenic etc are just excuses. <br>  <br>  If the foreskin is too tight , it loosens up after regular stretching. <br>  <br>  A doctor my kids went to earlier said my 4 yr old needed circumcision. We said we'll wait for few years and then decide. <br>  <br>  We moved later, and the new doc told us that he should stretch the foreskin regularly after his bath, so it'll loosen up. And then he'll be able to clean it properly. This is true because stretching causes more tissue growth (just like pregnant moms tummies).  After 2 yrs of doing that his problem of tight foreskin is solved!<br>  <br>  Its a parents job to teach kids how to be clean and just like you tell them to wash their hands before eating , you teach them to wash down there too. No big deal. <br>  <br>  Circumcision surgery is really not necessary unless you have some deformity down there or have had serious infections. Definitely not required for infants.<br>  <br>  And why should you put the baby thr' it just because he "may" have infections later?|`|tgUbWojPaa	Uncircumcised. It is not a necessity at all. Why would you not do it to a your daughter but only your son? The health reasons are just an excuse to me. Excuse for what? I don't know. Circumcision is not needed at all and I would rather not but a baby boy through that pain.
am7Ykwqiaa	Sorry to hear about your bfn. Its hurts and it feels unfair. You're right, you re lucky to have two beautiful kids and a husband who loves you. I can't help but believe that if and when something is supposed to happen it will. We've been ttc for 4 months and Im due for my p tomorrow, fingers crossed.<br>  <br>  Good luck for next month. Baby dust to you.|`|oHNrktxTaa	I know how frustrating this may all be for you. Trust me, my husband & I have been trying the past couple months for our first! <br>  All we can do is to stay positive, be calm, try to relax & hope we all get our BFP soon!<br>  <br>  Sending tons of future dust!|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	Hello....I was also due for my period March 1st, i tested,got a negative 2 days ago, then i got my period yesterday, im so sad..i already have a 3 1/2 year old son but i feel like its gonna take forever, i got pregnant with him to fast,only 1 month, im just gonna do what i did when i conceived him, have sex everyday......good luck|`|xRREAemFaa	yeah i'm due soon to like today or tomorrow  feeling some cramping  but  nothing yet  i had  some spotting monday the 23th and then again wednesday the 25th i have 2 girls already and  i never had any implantation  bleeding or anything  so i don't think that is what i got  earlier this week and then i took a prego test today  but it didn't show  negative until  15 minutes after  so  i don't know  i guess i have to wait and see what is going to happen...<br>  <br>  good luck
nBqTrmkJaa	hiya<br>  <br>  for a test to show positive, the HCG levels in your body need to have built up to a high enough level to be detected by the test. different tests check different levels. FRER tests (first response) are very good at earlier results/testing early, but even then everyones bodies/hormones are different so it could take a couple of weeks yet for your HCG levels to rise high enough to be detected even by a test that detects smaller levels of HCG.<br>  if you've had a negative result and still aren't sure, wait a week and test again.<br>  If you're still not sure after that, speak to your doctor who can do a blood test to confirm if you are or not. it's still early days so it could swing either way.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Pregnancy tests aren't accurate until after you miss your period.  I took a test everyday and didn't get a positive test until my period was 5 days late.  You will have to wait and see if your period comes and then test again if it doesn't.  Good luck!|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	The day before my period was due i tested negative (13 DPO) And 2 days after my period was due i got a BIG FAT POSITIVE (16 DPO). I am now 6 weeks and due on the 24th October. From experience yes you could be testing too early. Good luck and i wish you baby dust.|`|3OmihLtYaa	it is too early. the $ store tests are just as reliable. I used them while TTC, never had a wrong answer. I thought they were wrong when I knew it in my heart I was preggers, so I had a blood test which was negative, a week later still no period and a positive $ store test, now 18 weeks pregnant. peeonastick.com rates all different types of hpt.|`|Cxdxo393aa	u cant take a pregnancy test before a missed period and expect it to be accurate....you dont even know if your going to miss your period or not!!|`|3vzxSKLcaa	If it's positive then it is positive, if it's negative, you might be pregant still,|`|LBg4DNpCaa	I was not able to get a positive pregnancy test till i was 4 weeks
fio0cT4caa	Yes, perms are completely safe while pregnant. BUT due to the rise in hormones there is no telling how your hair will react. it may cause uneven curls, no curl, or even patches of curl, and then again it might not due anything and you could end up with a great perm. but there is no telling because every pregnant women's body is different. Perm at YOUR own risk..lol  good luck and congrats!|`|cfe02e6ae5ad9f610e0881cb2edcb2cfaa	I continued to get perms while I was pregnant with my youngest daughter. The only thing is you can't be for sure on what the hormones may do to your hair. My hairdresser warned me that the perm may not take. For me at least it was just the opposite, it took too well and I had the bushiest hair for a couple of weeks lol|`|j01zBZmZaa	I agree: perms are completely safe during pregnancy. However, sometimes your hair won't curl during pregnancy. Those hormones can sometimes make your body do crazy things, you know? Hair included. Since you're so close to the end and your hair is obviously heavier due to its thickness, I'd probably wait. It would stink to waste your money and not have curls to show for it. Good luck!|`|qJaKF24naa	I am sure it will handle it the same as before you were pregnant, But iw ould probably wait to be safe your almost to the end and get it done after you have the baby. I hear some people say their hair feels different pregnant,, maybe the vitamins or something.|`|AA11537580	it stinks, i think it would make you sick|`|La5vnxrXaa	Your hormones are out of kilter right now and the perm may not take because of that. Also the heat from the dryers and the smell of it might make you sick.  The best person to ask would be your stylist and see what they recommend.
2irmTjQ3aa	Continue to work as normal, why won't you be able to reach over counters?. I was a waitress and kept doing my job all through pregnancy, don't use it as an excuse to be lazy, the only one thing would be do not inhale the chemicals, but you can still clean with them. You are pregnant, not disabled.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Talk to your doctor and ask if there are any restrictions he/she wants you to take toward your job.|`|Nm7Hy67oaa	Talk to you r doctor, but you should be fine.  You are pregnant, not dying.  My best friend worked as a cook up until her delivery date.  I saw a lady today in fast food joint who was due in two weeks.  Wear support hose to keep the swelling down, stay hydrated, eat smart, wear yor gloves, and you should be fine|`|8THz1sp9aa	I used to work in the deli so I know how customers can be. But you have to remember you need to think about your child's safety before a stranger. If they want to rant and rave about you not being able to do something then I would call your manager or have a co-worker help you out. If I were you I would stay far away from the ovens and especially stay away from all the chemicals. good luck and congrats! :)|`|xnhwmontaa	LOL I have been to safeway and I know why your worried about the meat counters. isn't there a table in front of the high counter. The counter that is so high its too my neck lol. tell them to meet ( no pun intended lol) on the side of the counter to give them their products|`|ddP3klT3aa	Wow. You will be fine and will be able to reach over the counter. Wear gloves and wash your hands often. I took care of elderly people when I was pregnant (dressing, bathing, changing diapers etc). A lot more germs where I was.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	You should be able to still reach over the counter, but if you can't then maybe it's time for maternity leave.  The ovens are fine and you just need to make sure you wear gloves when handling any cleaners or chemicals and don't breathe them in directly.  But make sure you aren't eating any cold deli meats yourself, because they contain the bacteria listeria which can cause miscarriage.|`|5ORyLk4Uaa	i work in burger king with three of my pregnancies. sanitizer is okay to use but stay away from the oven cleaners the fumes are no good to breath in. you could work  with the oven is fine.i do kitchen work myself and rather enjoy it better then working cash. when you do get bigger the customers will see that you are pregnant and normally will respect that and help stretch to get their items. if you have any problems then ask your manager what would be best for you to handle. working with food rawl or cooked is okay as long as you wash your hands properly. congrats on the pregnancy.|`|AA11542929	my mom a deli manager for a walmart.. ur okay just take it easy dont baby urself.. thats not good.. cuz it causes more problems during labor.. chemicals depends cuz they are bad for u during pregnancy.. some not all.. but u shoudl just act urself but no heavy liftiinig..|`|3x70A8rpaa	when you are taking your breaks, try to sit in a chair for 20 mins, this will get the baby energized and so you too. <br>  What not to do is dont mop the floor, you could fall (because ur probaly tired from work) and hurt the baby and yoursleves|`|3OmihLtYaa	Your job functions are safe, with the cleaning products though, always wear gloves and keep the area ventilated. Do not eat the meat lol there have been known risks with deli meats during pregnancy.|`|gxcAc6Nxaa	You act like you are dying. Lazy.
NMjM2X4taa	put a rubber or latex glove in your pocket. the next time they throw anything at you, put on the glove and put the "evidence" in a plastic bag. then have your parents go to the police to press charges. this needs to go beyond the school. the principal really can't do anything but follow the "rules" to the letter. the bullies know this and that is why they pick on you outside of school. because this happened outside of school you can and should go to the police and threaten to press charges.|`|p0prrzf2aa	wow immaturity. i HATED middle school. but i guess do w/e you can til you come back|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Was the other kid suspended?<br>  If he wasn't thats unfair punishment.<br>  <br>  You just have to stick it out.|`|SK7MxFTnaa	Start reading a dictionary and study harder in English.<br>  <br>  No really....you should.|`|GpitqYxcaa	Suspensions are fun. They don't put them on the permanent record at my school. You can still do the school work if you go to public school, but at my school you get a zero in every class per day you were suspended and miss any tests or quizzes you have that day. I have been suspended three times: 7th grade (1 day), 8th grade (1 day), and this year recently (10th grade: 3 days) and I didn't get grounded any of the times because it was a really lame reason to suspend someone, and it wasn't really my fault.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  -Billy|`|I64JOuMKaa	wooow they were picking on you for no reason?<br>  <br>  If you're going to write to your principal<br>  I think you should say something like ..<br>  <br>  " Dear Principal _________________, <br>  I just wanted to explain to you what happened in my perspective. When I hit _____________ back all I was doing was defending myself because they were picking on me and he hit me first. I really don't think I deserved to get suspended for defending myself when I did not hit him first.<br>  <br>  Thanks ! _______________ , <br>  <br>  tell the group to stop picking on you or else you will get your friends to back you up . : )|`|oENe16luaa	I don't think it is right at all.  Clearly from your spelling and grammar, you can't afford to be missing any school.|`|CC4fUcRsaa	If you feel like you have been punished for something and feel that the other person needed a similar punishment include this in your letter with a explanation why you felt this way. If you feel like he should get the same type of punnishment you did feel free to mention this in the letter and give a reason why you feel that this way. You should write about the event itself in your perspective and give it to the principle as soon as possible. You maybe suspended from class however this does not prevent you from speaking from the principle about the event. As for who is in the right I do not know.|`|E3U9kHCBaa	This is tough. I do feel bad for you and understand what you did was the only thing you could do. Judging by you pic you a girl and he def shouldn't have hit you and he should be suspended longer 4 that. it always seems like some1 in your situation shouldn't get punished but once at my school a kid pushed some1 with a broken arm over and the kid with the broken arm got back up and pushed him back and they both got in trouble. You might be able to appeal it to the school board but idk if it would be worth it
QKGuNLb4aa	you will more than likely need a shot otherwise your baby will need a transfusion at birth...that is if the baby is + instead of -
0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Counseling would be a good place to start, kids that young (preschool when he began this behaviour) aren't by nature liars and stealings. You can usually depend on a pre-K kid to be very honest. Ask yourselves what was going on in his home and school life when these behaviours began and you could find your answer. He needs to be sat down and explained to why lying and stealing is wrong; how it hurts the victims and how it can hurt him. Talk with a juvenile detention officer about having him come visit the center to see what his life could be like if he continues taking what's not his. This boys needs the right kind of attention, try not to give him too much when you find out he's committed yet another offense- definitely give him a consequence (writing a letter of apology, returning the item in person) and then don't go back to him and needle. Give positive attention when he makes good decisions so he can see that he will still get all the attention he could want, but only for doing the right thing. <br>  Definitely find a good counseling, it sounds like this child may have an obsessive compulsive disorder that is driving him to steal, even though he knows he shouldn't. Hiding away food can be indicative of an eating disorder, but in this situation I don't think that's the case- but I'm not a professional. Get him a visit to a juvie hall and into counseling with someone who has worked with kids around his age with the same kind of problems.|`|h7x9CnEFaa	Parents need to take a look at what is going on in his environment as they might be in need of help. I don't believe ADHD is as rampant as many believe. Yes, a counselor could help him but the whole family needs help in dealing with these behaviors and avoiding such future behaviors.|`|fb2f31dc5f32d93496e4794302dcf712aa	hmm, how about positive reinforcement, and maybe also teaching him how to earn the things he wants?|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	add  doesnt cause stealing and lying, sounds like a discipline problem to me.|`|AA12327015	Sounds like he has difficulty in controlling his impulses. The impulse to steal something he likes at the moment. It doesn't sound like a morality issue or that he's a bad kid. It's just something he can't control, the impulse is too strong. Why else would he need a paint cake or extra food?<br>  <br>  This is classic ADHD/ADD symptomology. Get him evaluated before things get worse like the law involvement or further school probs. It's always trial and error when trying new psych meds so give it time, don't give up.
2irmTjQ3aa	Make sure that you get your prenatal vitamins. You don't have to wait until your next appointment. And sorry but there is really nothing you can do about your morning sickness. I had the same kind of morning sickness up until my fourth month of pregnancy, I tried everything and nothing helped. It's the price we have to pay to have babies :)|`|GxlkhRfoaa	I was horribly sick for the first several weeks of pregnancy.  My Dr recommended vitamin B6 25mg 3x a day every day.  It helped me alot.

But, I found something in the drug store called Nauzene, chewable electrolyte nausea medicine. It worked pretty well for me, althought I could tell it was pretty salty. I also would suck on a piece of ginger root, or make hot tea with it. It's always best to go with your dr, but just for a small relief, try to get some ginger hot tea, and see if that eases the nausea. Good luck to you, and I had it all day long in this pregnancy too! Yikes! good luck and congrats!|`|nwuL7M7saa	Morning sickness is not harmful to you or your baby, but if you experience excessive vomiting and cannot keep your food down, you may have hyperemesis gravidarum. Hyperemesis gravidarum can be harmful to you and your baby if severe and left untreated, due to the possible lack of nutrients and electrolyte imbalance. The most important thing is to inform your health care provider when these symptoms appear and discuss possible options for treatment.<br>  <br>  Morning Sickness:<br>  More than half of all pregnant women experience morning sickness. Morning sickness is the nauseated feeling you get during pregnancy. Morning sickness can be, but is not always, accompanied with vomiting. The nausea is often a result of the increased hormones in your body. Many health care providers think morning sickness is a good sign because it means the placenta is developing well. <br>  <br>  There are a number of do's and don'ts you can try to help alleviate your symptoms.<br>  Your purchase supports the APA<br>  Helpful Do's and Don'ts:<br>  Do:<br>  <br>  Eat small meals often <br>  Drink fluids 1/2 hour before or after a meal, but not with meals <br>  Drink small amounts of fluids during the day to avoid dehydration <br>  Eat soda crackers 15 minutes before getting up in the morning <br>  Avoid foods and smells that increase nausea <br>  Ask someone else to cook for you and open the windows or turn on fans if the odor bothers you <br>  Get plenty of rest and nap during the day <br>  Avoid warm places (feeling hot adds to nausea) <br>  Sniff lemons or ginger, drink lemonade, or eat watermelon to relieve nausea <br>  Eat salty potato chips (they have been found to settle stomachs enough to eat a meal) <br>  Exercise <br>  Don'ts:<br>  <br>  Do not lie down after eating <br>  Do not skip meals <br>  Do not cook or eat spicy food|`|LnVZW2Qvaa	DOCTOR<br>  <br>  just remember, the people on this sight are not proffessionals.. and some i think might just say they are...<br>  <br>  trust me.. thats the only thing that will help!
Yeb2nZTFaa	This is very normal.  The warm water trigger the urination response.  In a few months you can sit her on a little potty chair while you fill her bath.  I used to put my girls feet in a warm wet wash cloth while they sat on the chair, and that's how I started potty training.|`|65RZ441Zaa	lol I use to do the same with my first. but i realized that he peed in every bath, and I started thinking that i would dip him in the tub and stick him on the potty. thats didn't work he would freak out. Then i read the "confessions" part in my parenting magazine, and one confession was " i don't change the water when my kids pees in the tub". Then there was an article explaining that urine is sterile and would be rare you would need to change the water. So i stopped :) and now with my second, i just accept it.|`|EnBPpbcHaa	Well it has a little something to do with this:<br>  <br>  Remember when we were kids, when it was a nifty practical joke to have a girls sleep over, and the first one to fall asleep got her hand put in a bowl of warm water? She ended up wetting herself?<br>  <br>  It's just some sort of reflex. Don't tell me that even if you urinate before taking a bath, you don't get the urge with that warm water, regardless of whether or not you urinate or not? She just thinks it feels nice, that is all.|`|FfGHHhqBaa	you don't need to drain the tub, the pee is not going to hurt her, and there is nothing you can do, it is phase and she will grow out of it. conserve your water, and just wait it out...|`|1SdgCkQ1aa	You might try giving her a "spit bath" - washing her off with a warm washcloth - that way you'll save yourself having to clean the tub.  I know they like to play in the bath though.  It's actually good in the long run, eventually she will go when you set her on the potty and that will be the beginning of potty training.|`|CdJs7rikaa	I think it's funny that you would even worry about this.  You do know that urine is sterile right?  It won't hurt her one bit to bathe in her pee water and she will eventually grow out of it.  Quit wasting water it's just baby pee!!  Try just putting her in the tub while the water is warming up, then let her pee and wash it down the drain, then fill up the tub.|`|8RfmosODaa	lol sounds like my son I think alot of kids do it|`|AFi5kTiEaa	My daughter has sensitive skin so i was told by the doc to not let her sit in soapy water in the tub.  So... I put her in the tub and run the water, not to fill the tub, just to clean her body and hair.  She always pees while i am cleaning her.  then i fill the tub with clean water.  She is 3 and still does it and wont, or cant go before she gets in the tub.<br>  <br>  Not to be a "green" freak, but it is a waist of water to fill the whole tub and drain it.  I understand why you do it but it really wont hurt her.  You could clean her after her bath is drained, like i do before it is filled.
nfzQkvqraa	The word "hate"  is a very bad word in our house.  I also tend to agree with shut up.  We don't put massive amounts of stress on cursing.  I grew up with a pretty bad mouth and I turned out fine.  Lo and behold, my children don't curse.  We never made a big deal out of it, so it didn't become a "test our boundaries" kind of thing.  They have no interest.  My kids have thankfully never uttered an I hate you.  We have stressed how strong those words can be.  Yeah shush up has come out once in a while.  (sort of ur version of shut up- like darn or dang instead of damn)  but that's about it.  If the worst things my kids ever do negatively in this world is say a few swear words (the other offensive kind- not what we don't like) i'll be a happy mom.  What I'm saying is a few foul words don't bother me that much and it's so far worked to my advantage.    Sorry so long.|`|AA12145826	The normal curse words, racial slurs (obviously), and anything that falls under "name-calling" (stupid, idiot, moron, etc.) Its kind of funny to see how everyone comes up with other things to take the place of the "no-no word". Instead of "that's so stupid" we've started using "that's just not right!" Instead of swear words you might hear "Some Beach!" or "Schnauzer!" or even "Awww pickles!"<br>  <br>  My daughter has also been banned from uttering the phrase "It's around here somewhere." Which is her choice phrase when we ask her to look for something but she's not really looking for it.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	My daughter is 2 and has just learned shut up. Every time she gets a time out. She learned it from my god daughter and her mother thinks its funny for her to say that and I hate you and alot of swear words. She just flicked off her new step dad and again she thought it was funny, he was heart broken and put her on a time out. At last this little girl has a good parent in her life.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	no cuss words were allowed in my house one time i really hurt my toe and i wanted to say fuc* but my lil sister was in front of me and i screamed FUDGESICKLES! it was cute and funny and made me feel better but anyway i could cuss just not at my mom and not infront of my lil sibiilings|`|xp4mhkqgaa	Americanisms.  Apart from the obvious, pretty bad, swear words, I'm not too hard on my son, as they're only words.  But, it did my head in when he used to say words/phrases that we don't even use here.  Luckily he's stopped it now :)|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I agree we dont allow shut up or I hate you. We dont allow anything that is degrading to someone else. If it can hurt their feelings or self esteem then its not allowed. Family is suppose to be your soft place to fall the world is cruel and mean enough|`|bdWO9wSAaa	No no-no words in my house.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	Ann Coulter is a swear word in our house =P My husband likes to say it just to make me squirm.<br>  F"a"g or any sexuality related insults, retard, racial slurs, anything hateful basically.<br>  I try to discourage bathroom humor, but kids will be kids. They'll grow out of it soon, so I'm not fighting that battle.<br>  <br>  We don't say "shut up" to people, but all 4 of us who can talk (and I'm sure our youngest, it'll be one of the first phrases she learns) shout it at the dogs if they're getting too annoying. We have a wolf/sibe mix and two shelties, so it's necessary or the barking would never end.<br>  <br>  ETA: We replace typical swearwords with other phrases too. SH--- becomes "shiitake mushrooms!", fu-- becomes "fudgemonks" (no clue where that one comes from). Damn and hell aren't swear words to us, but we seldom use them anyways.|`|nbSvz7tqaa	I don't get why curse words even exist. They're just normal words. They never became part of my vocabulary because my parents never used them, but why can a kid say drat or darn, but not damn, crap, or whatever else s/he feels like saying? Don't they all have similar connotations (depending on context)? <br>  <br>  I can understand why "I hate you" and "shut up" would be banned since they show disrespect for others, but why do we teach kids that some interjections are naughty?|`|gNKW86ueaa	Fart- we use "passing gas"<br>  Yeah- we say "Yes"<br>  Shut Up- we don't use at all<br>  I Hate You- hasn't been said yet but we will deal with it when the time comes-- will NEVER be tolerated though<br>  Stupid,Dumb,Retarded<br>  Gay- when used derogatorily ie. "That's gay!"|`|q2Y9SzpXaa	I think poop is funny inside or outside the bathroom.  Unless someone is calling me poopy face in a mean way!<br>  <br>  Stupid, shut up, hate and anything else I deem to be inappropriate at the time.|`|Iv8WwN2gaa	im very lean on rules. my two kids only aren't allowed to just throw around the word. F- -K. my teenage daughter and son know what to say when they are around me and around their friends.|`|pPKhVRXJaa	shut up, i hate you, you're stupid. etc., or any of the normal swear words are forbidden in my house.|`|im3vWyv6aa	What a fun question. We don't like "shut up" or "I hate you" either. We also don't allow... butt head, butt face, butt crack or anything related to butt. Same with fart face, fart head... or anything related to fart. We pretty much ban name calling of any kind. If it sounds mean... or mean spirited... it's means for grounding.<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .|`|M6c0hUefaa	Well, for me, even when I was a kid, it was "I hate you" or the word "hate" in general. I never told my parents or friends I hated them, ever, so I plan on teaching my daughter the same thing as she grows up....|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Swearing AT someone or around my brother is kinda the only things. "I hate you" isn't something that can leave my throat when talking to my parents, I'm seriously one of the only children I know that didn't say "I hate you" to my parents. My mom HATES when I say shut up to her or my brother but she doesn't care if I say it or swears to my friends.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Let's see... Well, "Money" is a pretty "touchy" One... And Personally I don't care for "Bush"- if there happens to be a "George" in front of it... The word "Limbaugh" gets my wife pretty upset... And I could do WITHOUT hearing  "Octo-mom", for the 758th time this week... Yes, there ARE some Nasty words "going around" these days- I daresay !!!  :)|`|prqrQcd1aa	shut up, i hate you, your stupid, your dumb, your the "r" word, those are just a few off the top of my head!<br>  <br>  idiot|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	You can only say "poop" in the bathroom.
cAtWxJG1aa	nobody.  it sinks into oblivion.  can you rent somebody like that?|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Either Riley or Connor.  Those kids have this weird uncanny way of emerging with your long lost item at the weirdest times :)<br>  <br>  About a year ago, my mother in law left her bluetooth sitting on the desk.  Well, we are pretty sure my son (then just about 22 months old) had gotten ahold of it and hid it.  We looked for DAYS literally in every nook and cranny we could possibly fathom.  To this day we still have no idea where he hid the thing!  Anytime something goes missing and we have no idea where it is, we just smile and say "It's with Nana's bluetooth", LOL.|`|j2mRop0laa	It used to be me and hubby would both look.<br>  <br>  Now, I just make it a game. If it's Barry the Bear that has gone missing, I tell my youngest to help me find him. Then we search all through the house going "Barryyyyyy? Where are youuuuu?"<br>  The toys have a way of turning up. lol<br>  <br>  Oh.. if something of MINE turns up lost. They remain tight lipped. They will give away nothing. I once found a remote (that I replaced because I was going nuts) clear behind the pots and pans months later. My youngest said "Ohhhhh now I remember!"|`|TQW5E6olaa	Bella, but she has an unfair advantage, she's the one who hides it!|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Me. EVERY SINGLE time. They make me look for it.|`|1s3nddaYaa	usually my mother, i lose glasses, shoes, socks, pacifiers, clothes, can openers. make up, nail clippers lol. not sure how i lose it. but the pacifiers are a mystery i really dont know where they are and no one can find them, had one one morning that afternoon poof tis gone and havent found it since lol|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	Who is it always? Mom of course! Kids expect things to jump out at them. Funny watching them walk around the house "looking" for their lost items. The one that really gets me is when my 13 year old calls her cell phone to try to find it, but then just sits there excepting she will hear it 3 floors away. Ah, kids!|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	My mom has always had me find anything that's been lost. It would take me about two minutes. Now that I'm older I tend to misplace things all the time. Luckily I can still find them pretty easily. It's just me though. When I have kids I will probably never know where anything is. : )|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Me. I think Moms have a natural talent for that.<br>  My mom is the finder, and in my house, I am the finder|`|k9VvIG3gaa	me or my sister..<br>  She has found my mothers cell phone today lol.it was in the car the whole time|`|prqrQcd1aa	The 17 month old "vaccum cleaner"!!! LOL|`|a8IRxC4raa	Usually, our cats.  :D<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	My husband. I don't have the patience to look for the needle in the haystack|`|XOtOMncwaa	If I didn't live here I swear our phones wouldn't have chargers, no TV would have a remote, and we would never have any salt. I ALWAYS have to look for stuff, I wish I could count the times I hear "hey Hillary, wheres the remote?" Or "Hillary do you know where I put my shirt" And now my son even comes up to me and says "cup, cup" so I now have to go on the endless search for his sippy cup. <br>  Maybe I should just stop looking, but if I did then the world would probably come to a halt.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Me, my husband can be looking right at it and not find it. The one i remember most is i had asked him to toss me the Tylenol. It was on the desk right in front of the computer mon and he was sitting there. He was looking all over the desk and I kept telling him where it is. He finally turns around and yells at me that its not there. I get up walk over and pick it up. He was pretty embarrassed. He does this alot. Im lucky in my daughter doesn't hid things.|`|2fB383F2aa	Our 2 year old daughter finds everything for us lol. Whether it was her who hid it to begin with, or we actually misplaced it she seeks it out. The odd time our dog finds things, like the toys we hid months ago because they were annoying! When in doubt we look in the fridge of our daughters play kitchen, things always magically end up in there!|`|2YBwc4LFaa	Me. Because when anyone else looks for something it's "Mom I don't see it" or "Mama I looked everywhere". Miraculously I just walk into the room most of the time and whatever is "lost" is right there in plain sight. SuperMom to the rescue again.|`|ijDfRIyoaa	Haha its normally my 2 year old, she normally is the one to take the stuff in the first place, so she normally finds it again when she is playing. But its often something like "oh there's that chicken nugget that fell off my plate 6 months ago"|`|bYaxOfWOaa	My 18 month old niece. Dada's keys, Mama's wallet, Aunty's mobile, they all go into Bubba's bag! But then she finds random stuff that's been missing for ages- invitations under the fridge, books behind the cupboard lol she's the best.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	The thirteen month old....because he is the one hiding it in the first place.<br>  <br>  I swear he's like a little monkey hiding things in his "nest" LOL|`|PW3hcVZiaa	I"m with Manda- I find EVERYTHING.  Hubby can't find a darn thing, even if it is right in front of his face.  Drives me crazy.|`|AA12145826	Well we usually ask Hannah if she took something, but most of the time the cat finds it before we do and she sits on it....making it that much harder to find! LoL|`|zH1sg3Xraa	The maid or a neighbor. It depends who is here to find lost keys, etc.|`|iiMQhey6aa	no one.<br>  once its gone.<br>  its never meant to be found!~ <br>  O:|`|xVEqBjDVaa	My 11 year old son, he can find anything! lol.|`|im3vWyv6aa	MY PUPPY... we are always fishing things out of her mouth or finding things tucked away under her blankie. It's a good thing she's cute!<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .
B1mEwSXWaa	My dear Stacy...<br>  <br>  The above 15 answers SHOCK me....frighten me and stunn me to the max, because it proves, that our society becomes MORE and MORE  apathetic !!! As a matter of fact the opposite of LOVE is NOT...."hate"...it is APATHY!!!<br>  <br>  That's exactly what I "gear" in ALL the answers above...People just don't  C A R E  anymore about their "next-door-neighbor", which is an alarming signal of todays society and scares me "to death" !!!<br>  <br>  You've brought up such a relevant issue, Stacy and NOBODY (besides you & me) seems to "give a damn".....HOW SAD !!!!!!<br>  <br>  In my first few months here at Y/A I've spend all my time in the section of Family relations, adolescence, etc. and the oint you're making is exactly the reason, why I gave up giving advice to these YOUNG teenagers because they seem to be in a state of DINIAL to the "facts of life" and no one wanted to even take my advice (when I mentioned "preventive measures for example), so I "gave up" and meanwhile I don't even "enter to that section anylonger" if all my suggestions end up "in vain".....<br>  <br>  However, you've addrressed a SERIOUS problem which WILL affect (as you very well stated)ALL OF US within the next 10-20 years and I am DEEPLY CONCERNED about the matter !!!<br>  <br>  Just last week....the case in England comes to my mind, where the 13 year YOUNG boy is supposed to be the "father" of this 15yrs.YOUNG girl...and in the interview the reporter asked the Q.:"How do you intent to support the baby financially"? And.....I couldn't believe my ears when the kid asked:"WHAT IS FINANCIALLY"????? I mean he did NOT know the meaning of the word "financially", but he knew how to ******....and get the girl pregant !!! That's NOT "only" ridiculous...that's pathetic and beyond "compare"....Meanwhile 3 other young boys have proclaimed to be the "father" of the baby !!!!<br>  <br>  I do not intent to be "old-fashion" and try to nove "with the time" (even though I barely knew that there were 2 "different genders" at age 13)....-smile- BUT: the answer to the dilemma lies in :PREVENTION and EDUCATION --- Sociologically all these teenage pregnancies occur out of "socially deprived" families...out of an (uneducated)environment with mainly "single-mother"households, where these kids are deprived of the proper care....and young girls develop the wish to "escape"this tragedy...and believe...by "having someone to love" will be "the solutuon" to their despair.....You get my point???<br>  <br>  You very seldom find teen pregnancies in families where the parents are educated....in stable relationships, etc. - So what "we" need to do is like they've started in highschools the State of NY... whereby girls attend a "child-care" project in which they have to take care of a "life-like" doll over a period of weeks (or months..I'm not certain about the length)- However, this "doll" cries like a "real baby" and needs 24hrs.attention of the "mother"....Studies showed, that 85% of teen pregnancies were reduced due to this project ! Schools STATEWIDE should invest in such a project to make young girls REALIZE HOW strainious it is to take care of a baby !!!<br>  <br>  I could "go on & on"...on the subject, but like I said in the beginning,..NO ONE (besides you & me) seem to care...So...I'll stop here....and send you all my love, care & concern for our YOUTH...your friend...Annette***|`|AhBM5w8maa	okay people years ago popped at 12-13 kids starting at the age of 13 so stop saying things about teenage mothers <br>  there is absolutely nothing wrong with them, as long as they take care and love their child.|`|DWl8nfyWaa	Yes.  It's ridiculous. I don't know how teen pregnancy is going to affect the world in 2020.|`|p3d3E75oaa	lol you seem angry maybe you need a hug|`|DkT8znckaa	No. It's always been there, it's just technology is making it easier for us to realize it.

1JbdCRdtaa	yes you can use an OPK as an HPT!  It worked for me both times I was pregnant. I had a cramping sensation at 8DPO and decided not to waist an HPT so I used an OPK and it came out positive so the next morning I took an HPT and saw the faintest line. Now that faint line is a crazy 2 year old. Good luck :)|`|WWfL5tMvaa	the ovulation kits check for the LH in urine and when you are pregnant you barely have any LH so i don't think you can use it as a pregnancy test<br>  BABY DUST TO YOU, ME AND EVERYONE TTC
5q7uPqVmaa	I teach fourth grade and kudos to you for helping her out!  Probably the most important thing for you to do at the time is to provide a calm and structured setting for her to complete the homework so that she can't put it off but doesn't get stressed about it.  If you have a book to read or work to do yourself, you could sit down and do it next to her while she finishes her homework.  Don't stress her out if she makes mistakes but glance at her work to make sure it's done correctly.  If it looks like she's having a hard time with a concept, do an examle or two with her and have her double check the rest.|`|s6yua5oxaa	I know you said you don't want to butt in,but we all have to do things we don't exactly want to do at some point or the other.I would say that the best way would be to make the learning fun.Because doing plain homework is really boring.Devise some sort of game,that involves rewards for doing homework and getting the questions right,so that she actually WANTS to do homework.If she still needs help understanding the homework,sit down beside her and explain it so that she can understand.Use your own methods and techniques to help her understand,and be sure to not raise your voice,because a young child does not need to be yelled at.as I partially stated before,do her homework with her,because you may actually re-learn some stuff too.That is the best advice I have for you.If it doesn't help at all,I am sorry.|`|XSNdj7Meaa	Sit right by her and let her show you what she is doing. Observe her to see where she needs help. Do not do the work for her though. Make sure you keep the same tone when speaking to her. When she does well praise her. Help her with problematic areas. The parents will most likely be alright with you helping after hearing the trouble that has been occurring. Maybe have a general discussion with them about wanting to just "help out".|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	getting to the point where she'd rather take advice from anyone but her parents.<br>  and your concern is valid.  (about not liking school.)<br>  <br>  in my experience, it's always better when you can talk to someone about homework.<br>  if you're willing, it's my guess it can only be good.|`|jKi4QgAoaa	did u see... v c?
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	The antibiotics aren't going to help her cough, aches, or cold symptoms.  There is a very good chance they aren't going to help her ear infection either.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_341.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_341.html</a><br>   Stunningly, however, in the first 24 hours, there is no difference in pain level whether or not the child gets antibiotics. The children deserve relief. Oral acetaminophen and ibuprofen are available over-the-counter, and do help. Topical drops specifically for earache relief are also now available over-the-counter in the eye/ear care section at most drugstores, grocery stores, and discount superstores throughout the U.S. These drops have a long history of use in other countries where antibiotic usage is not as prevalent. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_1775.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_1775.html</a><br>  The consensus, evidence-based 2004 guidelines recommend that children under 6 months of age with red hot ear infections should be treated with antibiotics for 10 days and pain relief for at least the first 24 hours, whether or not the diagnosis is certain. Remember, antibiotics do not help pain during the most painful first 24 hours, and help pain only minimally after that. Kids 6 months to 2 years should receive 10 days of antibiotics and at least 24 hours of pain relief for a red hot ear if the diagnosis of an acute ear infection is certain (it must be an abrupt onset, with physical certainty of fluid in the ears, and clear evidence of an inflamed eardrum – all 3). If the diagnosis of an acute infection is uncertain in these kids, they can be treated with pain relief and observed without antibiotics, (we’ll talk about what this means soon), unless they’ve had a fever of 102.2 or higher in the last 24 hours, or severe symptoms. Once children have reached their second birthdays, pain relief and antibiotics are recommended if both the diagnosis of an acute infection is certain and the illness is severe with a fever of at least 102.2 or symptoms of severe illness. Otherwise, observation and pain relief can be the better course of action. Most kids without a high fever don’t need antibiotics for ear infections. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_1771.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_1771.html</a><br>  Most parents are taught to think that if an antibiotic is given to their child for an ear infection, the medicine will help the child to recover. Not necessarily! Of the 10 million annual antibiotic prescriptions for ear infections, somewhere between 8.5 million and 9.5 million prescriptions didn’t actually help the children, according to the best medical research (and according to the American Academy of Pediatrics). Put another way, we have to treat between 7 and 20 children with antibiotics for ear infections before one child benefits from the medicine. About 80 percent of ear infections will clear up easily without antibiotics. For those that don’t, often the antibiotic won’t help either. Sometimes it does. In 5 to 14 percent of children, the antibiotics will take one day off the length of the ear infection. But by comparison, up to 15 percent of children who take antibiotics will develop diarrhea and up to 5 percent will have allergic reactions, some of which may be quite serious. Wouldn’t it be great to limit antibiotic use to the children who really need it?<br>  <br>  The 2004 AAP/AAFP guidelines aim to do this by improving the accuracy of ear infection diagnosis; by targeting antibiotic use for a select group of children with ear infections; by paying attention to pain relief for all children (especially during the first 24 hours of an infection); by improving our selection and timing of antibiotics; and by taking steps to prevent ear infections in the first place. A welcome change indeed!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/T081000.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/T081000...</a><br>  6. The common cold can take two courses:<br>  <br>      * First scenario. Your child starts off with a clear runny nose for a few days, and then she begins coughing slightly. Over the next few days the nose turns from clear, to white, to yellow, then to green. She can't breathe through her nose. The cough worsens and starts to wake her up at night. About 5 to 7 days into the illness her cough begins to sound junky, you hear some rattling in her chest, and she gets a fever. She may complain of sore throat, headache and stomach ache at this time. The fever lasts for 3 to 5 days yet is seldom higher than 102o. The fever then goes away, but the green nose and junky cough continue. Between 5-7 days the nose starts to seem less thick and green, but the junky cough continues. Over the next week, the nose clears up more, the cough improves slightly, but she still has episodes of junky cough off and on. After about three weeks into the illness the cough quiets down and eventually goes away by four weeks.<br>  <br>      * Second scenario. Out of nowhere your child is hit with a high fever, bad cough, headache, sore throat, and runny or stuffy nose. She may have some vomiting or diarrhea, and her sleeping and eating patterns will be poor. The fever, cough, green nose, night waking and poor appetite continue for 3 to 5 days, then the fever stops. The coughing and green nose continues. Slowly, over a period of 2 weeks the nose begins to clear, the coughing lessens, the appetite returns, and she begins to sleep better at night. After 3 or 4 weeks total, the cough is gone and everything is back to normal.<br>  <br>      * While these scenarios sound worse and may last longer than many colds, they are well within the boundaries of what can be expected during the course of the common cold virus. By understanding what should be expected from the common cold, you can decide more accurately when to take your child to the doctor, and when to stay home and ride it out. It may be tough to ride it out through the above worst-case cold scenarios. However, if your child is generally acting well when the fever is down, does not have fever lasting more than 5 days (5 complete 24-hour periods), does not have respiratory distress (such as shortness of breath, moderate to severe wheezing, rapid breathing, or chest pains), and overall seems to be okay, then you don't always need to see a doctor. We will discuss later what signs to watch for that warrant a trip to the doctor.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	The antibiotic will take a few days to kick in.  As far as her cough goes, did the MD say anything about a humidifier or vaporizer?  Are you forcing fluids?  If it is a snotty congested cough, stay away from milk for a few days.  If it is a dry cough, force fluids.  Keep up with the Tylenol.  I know I would do anything to make my babies feel better. Call the MD in the am and ask about the humidifier/vaporizer (I can't remember which one you should use with a cough, sorry) and ask about something to help with the cough.  Good luck!|`|JsqMSU9Haa	about 3 or 4 doses - what is it twice per day?  i think its usually like 2 days for the medicine to kick in.  as long as she's not getting worse, she's ok.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	It took 10 days to get rid of my daughter's ear infection......|`|bWu4p5OBaa	I think that after maybe 3 or 4 more doses if you don't see a noticeable difference I would go back in.<br>  <br>  My sister's little 14 mth old boy has just gone through the ringer with all his problems with his ears. <br>  <br>  He had a bad cold and then an ear infection too. The first round of antiobiotics also Amoxillin didn't work and he ended up getting one in the other ear too. He had to be given stronger antiobiotics. Amoxillin is one of the weakest ones there is and is often given to babies and preggo women b/c it's mild.<br>  <br>  My Sis's boy ended up getting emergency tubes put in his ears b/c he developed fluid behind the ear drum from all this mucking around with his ear infections. He had to have tubes and have the fluid drained from behind the ear drum or something like that it wasn't nice at all poor kid! This all happened in the course of 2 mths! They were even worried he had hearing damage. This is an unusual case, but ear infections certainly need to be watched carefully.<br>  <br>  Just watch her and be careful follow your gut instincts. Also watch her fever if she has one. That's not always the case with ear infections so don't be fooled by the lack of one.<br>  <br>  Anyways hope I didn't freak you out!

vnFAAJ0Qaa	it could be an effect of the pill combined with the mis use...basically the pill tricks your body into thinking it is with child. if you started the day after your period(the correct way) your effects might not be as noticable b/c each week of the pill has different level of hormones as the hormones fluctuate from week to week. Check with your dr. If you are preg. the pill could cause seriuos birth defects! also if you remember the days you had sex look to see if the were in the middle of your cycle. women ovulate in the middle of their cycle (days 12-16 of a 28day cycle) goodluck|`|n24githIaa	I doubt it's pregnancy.<br>  There are only 3 days out of the month that you can get pregnant.<br>  14 days after the first day of your period.

However, some types of nipples are harder for the baby to latch onto, especially at first, but in most cases, patience, persistence, proper latch-on technique, and perhaps a few other helpful measures will pay off.<br>  FLAT OR INVERTED?<br>  <br>  You can determine whether or not you have flat or inverted nipples by doing a simple "pinch" test: Gently compress your areola about an inch behind your nipple. If your nipple does not protrude or become erect, then it is considered to be flat. If your nipple inverts, retracts into the skin tissue, or becomes concave, it is considered to be inverted. True inverted or flat nipples also will not become erect when stimulated or cold. If your nipples protrude when stimulated as described above, they are not truly inverted and do not need any special treatment in order to breastfeed.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  TREATMENTS TO DRAW OUT A FLAT OR INVERTED NIPPLE<br>  (See article)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeeding-basics.com/html/flat_inverted.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeeding-basics.com/html...</a><br>  Mother’s nipples come in many shapes and sizes.  While most nipples protrude and are easy for baby to grasp, there are some variations in size and shape that make it difficult for them to nurse successfully.  In order for a baby to nurse effectively, he must be able to grasp the nipple and stretch it forward and upward against the roof of his mouth.  Flat or inverted nipples may make it difficult for your baby   to nurse.<br>  <br>        In women who are pregnant for the first time, it is very common for the nipple to not protrude fully.  About one third of mothers will experience some degree of inversion, but as the skin changes and becomes more elastic during pregnancy, only about ten percent will still have some inversion by the time their baby is born.  The degree of inversion is likely to become less with each subsequent pregnancy.<br>  <br>      Because your baby forms a teat not just from the nipple but also from the surrounding breast tissue, most inverted or flat nipples will not cause problems during breastfeeding.  Some types of flat or inverted nipples will cause problems, however, and there are some steps you can take to help correct the problem both before and after the baby is born.<br>  <br>       The first thing you need to do is determine whether your nipples really are flat or inverted.  You can do this while you are pregnant by performing a simple “pinch” test: Hold your breast at the edge of the areola between your thumb and index finger.  Press in gently but firmly about an inch behind your nipple. If your nipple protrudes, that’s great.  If it does not protrude or become erect, it is considered flat.  If it retracts or disappears, it is truly inverted. Nipples that are severely flat or inverted will not respond to stimulation or cold by becoming erect.  If you perform the pinch test and your nipples protrude, they aren’t truly inverted and will probably not cause any problems when you nurse your baby.|`|2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	I'd talk to a lactation consultant.  I took a class at the hospital, and they can help set you up with things to help you i.e. nipple shields and such.<br>  <br>  Also, your nipples might not be as flat as you feared, I know someone who was really worried about that, but the consultant said it wasn't as bad as she thought, and later her baby latched on without any problems.|`|WNsjy5oFaa	things will likely change - but if not you can buy nipple shields that help to bring the nipples out - ask your midwife about it they are a wealth of knowledge|`|JRXpYW3Naa	They probably won't stay flat. Give it more time.|`|g4mvfBQ8aa	You're only 6 weeks....wait to see what pregnancy changes happen to your breasts.  If they are still flat then your baby will be able to pull them out breastfeeding.  If not then they have a nipple shield to which your baby can latch to and help pull your nipple out.  But see what time brings first.
vOFdHvlvaa	That's exactly how i respond when someone says how cute my son is and thats how anyone i've ever complimented on how cute their child is has responded too.  It's being polite and it's basically like responding for ur child cuz they can't speak for themselves.  So yea it was def. the correct way for him to respond, and i dunno how else anyone would respond to someone complimenting there child.  What did u except him to say? Just wondering.|`|DBKV3g4baa	I too would thank someone for their kind words about my daughter.  In my opinion, to compliment a baby is also complimenting the parenting skills (or in this case, the parent's genes).|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	It is polite to say thank you when someone compliments your baby.  You are thanking them for the compliment, and for noticing how cute your baby is!|`|Xu1lG9Dcaa	Umm... are you kind of slow???

Whenever someone says anything positive about her I generally say Thank you or say "say thank you" even though i know she cant Kind of like teaching her and responding at the same time. I really do not know what else someone would say. She gets it from her mama?!!???!?!?!? lol but seriously it is always nice to hear someone say positive things about your child and since you are the creator of that child it only normal to thank the person just like if you created anything else and someone complimented it but with a child it is 100xs more grateful and gratifying to receive a compliment.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think you are over-thinking this.<br>  <br>  When someone tells my baby they think he is cute I say thank you.  Partly because they are obviously telling him knowing that I am in earshot.  Partly because he is the result of a combination of me and my husbands genes and his cuteness is complimentary to us.  Also, he can't talk, so how could he say thank you?<br>  <br>  What do you think she should have done?  Used her like a ventriloquist's dummy and thrown her voice to make it seem like the baby was saying thank you?|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	because the child is a product of HIM. it's his child it's much like when someone says wow your kids are well behaved or they are great and a parent syas thank you. say "i know "would be ok but it sound more ruded. when someone says my son is adorable i say thanks|`|rFtKFp03aa	It is correct of him, because his baby can't speak, obviously.. it is on behalf of his child.... <br>  <br>  When I am out with my babies, who can't speak, and my nephew who is 3 and someone compliments my babies and my nephew, I thank them on behalf of my babies, and my nephew thanks them on behalf of himself... <br>  <br>  I would think it would be weird for him to say, "yes she is pretty, huh?

kpnSKV6Eaa	the balling up is just braxton hicks contractions.. they are short and just feel like a tightening in your tummy.. the shooting pains are probably just the baby sitting on your bladder.. i still have them from time to time|`|7XBoIgd6aa	It's Braxton Hicks hunnie.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	It is the baby laying at or on your bladder.  It makes a sharp pinching pain.  I had the same thing.  I also had a problem with a nerve in my hip that shot down through my thigh.  I've read its better to lay on your left side then your right.  The baby lays better on your left.  Plus, the extra weight of the baby isnt good on your liver, etc. if your on the right.<br>  <br>  The tightening feeling is braxton hicks.  The difference is the braxton is lower and is like a muscle tightening.  True labor pains will be a lot stronger and feel different.  Braxton Hicks preps your body for the real thing to come.  Labor contractions are like a strong wave effect.  They start below your breasts and the muscles ripple down to above the pubic area.  They are less strong and then hit hard again.  <br>  <br>  It was a good idea that you called even if it was the baby in the wrong spot or braxton hicks.  You never know if it is truly something to be concerned about.  Hang in there and good luck.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	I had those same pain when I was pregnant with my 1 yr old and my doctors brushed it off also. It happened all the time. After having my son I foung out that I had fibroid tumors on my uterus and that contributes to alot of pain while pregnant.<br>      <br>      The tightening of the stomach are just braxton hicks.  Your going to feel them alot. When your stomach tightens just take a deep breath and try to relax. Braxton hicks are practice contractions. Your body is just getting ready for the real thing.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	I had that feeling of my stomach tightening into a ball when I was pregnant from about 20 weeks to the end of my pregnancy.  Those are braxton hicks contractions.  <br>  I also had that kind of pressure that you describe, but not until around and after 32 weeks. <br>  If you're not comfortable with your Dr.'s opinion, or the pain gets worse, go to the ER.  They will do a u/s to make sure the baby is ok.

Most of the people on here that ask do you think I am pregnant are not trying to get pregnant so if they were they would be accidents.|`|L4f5ONEkaa	Well i guess you could say that but its not the kids faults and thats not for everyone though.  Mostly the younger population and the ones that never heard about birth control or a condom.|`|AhBM5w8maa	You mentioned teenage pregnancies<br>  well I am 36 weeks and 3 days pregnant and I'm 17<br>  We didn't use a form of protection so we weren't preventing pregnancy.<br>  He is in no way an accident or a mistake, so don't be so judgmental to teenage mothers.<br>  Others may call their children mistakes but if they weren't meant to be here then they wouldn't be here.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	i`m gonna be a teenage mom in May my baby was unplanned but NOT a accident...His father is gonna be there for him and me like he has been there for me the last 3 years and still counting..why be so judge mental when u don't even know the girls/guys..I don't get it it`s not only Teens..and it wasn't an accident for me and my fiance it have sex..**** happens but never will our son be an accident or a mistake he was just unplanned but he has everything a planned baby would have!! he has it all already from the baby bed to diapers.and my baby shower isn't until March 21st.you name it he has it..|`|xnhwmontaa	some not all|`|ck5edW9kaa	Accidents happen, condoms break, birth control fails, blame sex ed, most kids dont use a condom efficiently.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Yes there is a lot of that. I would say for sure teenage pregnancies are accidents. My baby was very planned though.|`|0mZfOStiaa	For some like me, it was NOT an accident.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Depends on how you look at it. I believe God put us here for a reason, even if we did not intend on it.|`|B7BDyyagaa	my daughter was not planned but neither of us would ever call her an accident she is the best thing to ever happen to us.. its rather ignorant you word it that way..is it annoying to see all these teenagers having babies sure should they maybe not its not our place and it certainly is not our place to call their children accidents.. just because a guy and a girl have sex and make a baby planned or not planned weather they get along or not that baby is not automatically an accident its a human being something god gave to this world and to talk about him or her like they are equal to a piece of garbage is both sad and revolting to me.. not every baby is wanted i understand that and some may look at their child like it was an accident to concieve them but again that doesn't make the baby itself an accident people need to grow up and learn that sex makes babies.. no more then that
8SjoUQmEaa	I'm assuming these kids are younger (5th or 6th gradeish). You should explain to her that girls develop at a different rate and that this girl has no control over her chest size, and it's not nice to make fun of people about things they can't control. I'd suggest that if she doesn't stop making fun of her, that some kind of punishment be enforced, such as being grounded or take away T.V. or phone privileges. Then she will learn not to make fun of people.|`|Dvc2BGUBaa	tell her there gonna be making fun of her soon for not having any breast.|`|z296XDIraa	Explain to your daughter about the changes a girls body goes through. If a girl in her class is in that situation then your daughter needs to know because she will probably be going through the same thing before to long.|`|QZYwbChaaa	Tell her not to since she's gonna look like that soon! :)
b18c07f9ff30e5f4e3f6b6ea019c2ab3aa	Hola<br>  Creo que en tu caso es la primera vez que voy a contestar: "No, no estas embarazada. Felicidades"<br>  <br>  Te recomiendo esta pagina, sumamente instructiva:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexologia.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexologia.net/</a><br>  <br>  Y cuando veas al medico pedile que te oriente sobre si sabe de grupos de educación sexual para jóvenes.<br>  Saludos<br>  <br>  PD:<br>  -Omar T, cerra el pico y no seas tan ganso<br>  -Bien PP|`|73e571acd7561ed90f89ecfece307ed1aa	perdonate a ti misma,<br>  todo mundo coge, asi que ni se espanten<br>  no es nada malo, es como comer, o ir al ba?o, una funcion natural de nuestro cuerpo.<br>  <br>  y lo mas importante: "no hay argumento mas persuasivo que la verdad" B.Franklin<br>  <br>  por esos prejuicios sobre el sexo, hay tanto traumado por la vida, tanto embarazo no deseado, estres, culpa y demas idioteces que los animalitos no sufren, como me voy a sentir culpable de sentir placer, si mi cuerpo es suceptible de lo mismo, entonces tambien me voy a sentir mal por comer rico, o dormir placidamente......... todo esta en la mente........ tu siguele dando, pero con responsabilidad y cuidado.<br>  <br>  saludos!!|`|KvAxogDgaa	Tan solo tienes miedo y temor!<br>  Trankilizate ya veras que todo saldrá bien amiga y si no te sientes segura de mantener relaciones sexuales por temor no lo hagas amiga!<br>  Nadie puede obligarte y si tu novio realmente te ama sabrá esperar hasta el momento en el cual al menos tu mamá no se moleste tanto!<br>  Si es cierto eso de que con 3 meses puede bajar aun la regla de echo los 9 meses pero trankila eso a ti no te sucederá ;) por ser responsable! Relajate<br>  Suerte =)|`|ea1a6a058bdd8206fcfb8f5aef18d3d6aa	No dices cuánto tiempo dejaste pasar antes de hacerte la prueba de embarazo. Si ya fuiste a un laboratorio, lo mejor era que te hicieras una prueba en sangre, son súper seguras (99%). Si dices que ya sangraste dos veces después de la relación y de haber tomado la anticoncepción de emergencia, al parecer no hay indicios de embarazo. Para estar segura y si es que sigues preocupada, puedes hacerte la prueba de sangre si ya pasaron unas tres semanas de la relación sexual sin protección.<br>  En cuanto a lo de tu mamá, es lamentable que tome esa actitud, pero tú no puedes esperar que ella siempre te proteja y te lleve a todas partes. Uno debe de aprender a hacer las cosas por sí misma, sobre todo en estas cuestiones íntimas de la sexualidad. Sé que siempre hace falta consejo. Yo crecí sin mi madre que murió cuando yo tenía 8 a?os, tuve una tía muy cercana a mí pero no tanto como para platicar con ella sobre relaciones sexuales. ?Qué hice? Busqué con amigas, fui a los servicios de salud pública de planificación familiar y finalmente busqué un médico particular (incluso en la Sección Amarilla), ginecólogo, y acudí a él cuando inicié mi vida sexual a los 19 a?os. No trabajaba entonces, guardaba el dinero que me daba mi papá para mis gastos de la semana.<br>  Te lo digo por experiencia, una no debe detenerse por nada, ni siquiera esperes el apoyo de tu novio porque no sabes cuándo éste realmente va a estar contigo. Toma las riendas de tu cuerpo, de tus decisiones y de tu vida. Quiérete y cuídate.|`|662d9cfd758ba9ad9c6419f4371298f9aa	Al tener la regla, se desecha el óvulo que no fue fertilizado, por lo tanto, si estuvieras embarazada, no hubiera menstruación.<br>  <br>  El efecto de las píldoras anticonceptivas es de retrasar la menstruación.<br>  <br>  Sería excelente que buscaras algún especialista en el tema para que aclare todas tus dudas, o acudir a una conferencia de este tipo. <br>  <br>  Por la información que das, en mi punto de vista no estas embarazada|`|NIHWBGFWaa	No estás embarazada. Utilizaste muchas medidas: condón, píldora y un examen de orina. Por si fuera poco, te sigue bajando. Lo mejor sería, para evitar estas broncas, que evitaras tener relaciones amiga, por si las dudas, tu mamá sabe de lo que habla cuando te dice que las tengas dentro del matrimonio. Sé que suena anticuado, pero cuando te cases y vivas enamorada de tu esposo sabrás por qué, sabrás a quién te hubiese gustado entregarte por vez primera. Además, los riesgos que se corren fuera del matrimonio son muy angustiantes, como bien ilustra tu caso. <br>  pero, como siempre digo a las familias convencionales cuyos hijos e hijas tienen vida sexual activa: si ya no pueden detenerlo, de dos males, escojan el menor: informen a sus hijos e hijas, protéjanlos y háganles saber las medidas a tomar, es mejor que hostigarlos, o vivir preocupadas. Si eres una muchacha que no le gusta la abstinencia, pues sigue mi consejo: de dos males, escoge el menor: infórmate acerca de todo.|`|bBrN5SSraa	Tranquilízate primero, si haz usado condón (preservativo) correctamente debés empezar a disminuir posibilidades de estar embarazada, además que no estabas en tus días fértiles, debes entender que la píldora del día después en estudios reciente muestra un gran porcentaje de alteración de períodos, te recomiendo que trates de dominar tus nervios esto también produce transtornos en tu período que no te baje cuando corresponde... sinceramente no creo que lo estés... mucha suerte!!|`|f4c98d9dd8c8acb2e2209fb6883386b9aa	Creo que tu misma te das la respuesta a tu pregunta: la presion familiar es enorme! <br>  <br>  Es muy normal que las mujeres sintamos culpa por tener relaciones sexuales, respuestas que nos culpabilizan realmente nos calan y nos hacen sentir mal, hay muchos "Omar" en el mundo, y tu mama tampoco es la unica que trata de controlar la sexualidad y el cuerpo de su hija. Esto que vives nos toca de maneras similares a todas las mujeres, se llama patriarcado, machismo... se sataniza la sexualidad femenina y el resultado es culpa, anorgasmia, embarazos no deseados por falta de informacion.<br>  <br>  Cuando existen embarazos, no baja la regla, ese es un miedo que nos andan metiendo a las mujeres. A algunas mujeres embarazadas se les producen sangrados pero bastante diferentes al menstrual. <br>  <br>  Te recomiendo usar un metodo anticonceptivo como la Mesygina, una inyeccion mensual que no van a encontrar en tu cartera como las pastillas. <br>  <br>  Miedo al embarazo? todas lo tenemos, las voces de la madre las tenemos en la cabeza!!!! Me alegra que aca encuentres un espacio para salir de dudas, te paso una pagina que te puede dar mucha informacion. Suerte!|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Ten por seguro que no estas embarazada, te tomaste la pastilla del día anterior y te bajo, te hiciste la prueba y salió negativa y luego a te volvio a venir. Asi que imposible que estes en cinta.<br>  <br>  Para que sigas en paz, te aconsejo que te cuides siempre con preservativos y si no lo deseas tomate tu pastilla anticonceptiva o te mandas a inyectar en la farmacia el anticonceptivo que dura creo 3 meses no se, preguntale a la farmaceutica.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a tus preguntas que no puedes hacerlas a tu mami, creo que es normal, ya que la mia tampoco es así, pienso que ellas creen que siempre seremos ni?as. Puedes tu solita o acompa?ada con una amiga ir a un ginecólogo quien te evaluará y te indicará que anticonceptivo debes tomar. También te sacará de dudas de lo que te está ocurriendo y te orientara con palabras y folletos en cuanto a las relaciones sexuales.<br>  <br>  Cuidate para la próxima y ten relaciones sexuales seguras. Un beso. Y no sigas martirizandote que no te ocurre nada.|`|1d6fb64ccaa527e522d203d93790bee7aa	Siento mucho que estes en una situacion asi,a mi me pasa,mis padres no me dicen nada sobre el tema aunque en su momento insisti.No te preocupes,no deberias estar embarazada,todo lo que comentas como las medidas de protecion,el resultado del analisis de orina y demas apuntan indudablemente a que no estas embarazada.Solo me hace dudar que tu medico aparentemente dude.Si tu medico te dice algo hazle caso,pero te digo que me extra?a mucho que tu medico dude en las circustancias en las que estas.Por si acaso,buscate una medica que se sea mujer(obviamente pero bueno XD).Por si acaso.No es por dudar del medico,ellos saben en principio mas que nosotros,pero yo me jugaria una tableta de chocolate lindt(nose como se escribe pero esta buenisimo :P)a que no estas embarazada.<br>  <br>  Asi que deja de preocuparte,si tienes dudas el medico puede ayudarte,sigue sus consejos.Tambien creo que te pueden ayudar en un centro de planificacion familiar,al menos en Espa?a.Enterate de donde queda el de tu ciudad.<br>  <br>  Toma nota de todo lo que has hecho para evitar ese embarazo que no deseabas y esa posible enfermedad de transmision sexual que no has contraido.Usa SIEMPRE preservativos,ya que es lo unico que te puede salvar de las enfermedades de transmision sexual como el SIDA.Cuando tengas experiencia y mas confianza como para decidir usar solo las pastillas sin usar preservativo y sepas a lo que te enfrentas y por tanto cuando hacerlo con la seguridad de no contagiarte ya podras jugartela por tu cuenta y riesgo,pero de momento deja pasar unos cuaaaaantos a?os.Si el preservativo no se rompe en principio no necesitas tomar pastillas ya que pueden afectarte a tu salud si abusas de ellas,no las uses innecesariamente pero tenlas siempre a mano.Consulta a tu medic@ sobre el tema de las pastillas para saber como te podrian afectar.<br>  <br>  La regla despues de una relacion sexual,siempre es sinonimo de un no-embarazo,tomalo como una prueba.No obstante consulta si quieres de nuevo a tu medic@.<br>  <br>  Por mi parte te aconsejo tomar todas las medidas posibles antes de abortar.<br>  <br>  Y nada mas animo y a disfrutar de eso que vosotros podeis XD.Que los habemos mas solos que la una XD.<br>  <br>  Cuidate de las ETS(enfermedades de transmision sexual)y los embarazos no deseados!

ArDBlPKYaa	I would definitely look into getting a midwife, and possibly even a home birth.  As long as you know there is a hospital nearby in case it's necessary, a home birth is a wonderful way to go.  I have many friends who have done it, and it's a much more relaxing, much less invasive way to go.<br>  I live almost 45 minutes away from the nearest hospital, so I choose to have my baby there even though I had NEVER been a patient at a hospital before, and almost never to a doctor.  To be honest, it took a few days to get over the trauma of being plugged in, monitored, strapped up and constantly have my "vitals" checked for several hours.  <br>  As far as the regular OBGYN visits, you can say "no thanks" to almost all of it.  As far as what to expect, I had to pee in a cup and have my blood pressure taken, but I refused all blood tests and diabetes testing.  I also had a really great doctor who was very chill about things.  He started checking my cervix (a simple, but internal exam) at 36 weeks, and continued to do so every week until the birth.<br>  <br>  To wrap it up, you should definitely "live your dream of becoming a mother," but it's ok to not go the fully medical, hospital and doctor route.  Check the laws in your state, and do what you're comfortable with. :)|`|OgzHcNMsaa	Theyre not bad. I  had one pap and everything else was just routine. Its all worth it in the end anyway to see your beautiful baby|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	get a woman doctor ,,,,,,,,,,,,,and keep on with therapy    good luck ,,, hope you become a mother one day soon..........|`|AA11885437	prenatal visits last like 5 min.They take your weight and your blood pressure, they ask you how things have been going so you can ask any questions you may have, then they measure your belly and listen to the heart beat and you are done! Actually it might be a good series of visits to help you overcome your fear because they are so short. The first visit you will have some blood work and a pap smear too, but its not bad. Have your hubby or someone you are close too come and hold your hand if you need. My hubby came in with me even during the pap smear. My doctor also did internal exams the last 4 weeks of pregnancy, but if you are not comfortable with that discuss it with the doctor and just decline to have it done. In some places they dont do internal exams at the end, because checking for dilation doesn't really tell you much anyways. The only other poking and prodding is the ultrasound, which is fun to see your baby for the first time, and the diabetes test at 30 weeks or so where you drink some sugary drink, wait an hour and then have your blood taken. You can also always explain to the nurse you are afraid of needles and ask for an experienced "blood drawer" ( I dont know what else you would call them..vampires maybe?? :) ) I look away whenever they put the needle in and I could barley even feel it. They are used to people being afraid of needles, and wont think anything of it, I promise. Good Luck, I wish you the best!|`|fa60257b056e6393028d193602d295a6aa	since you have so many appointments, you would probably get over it pretty quick.  plus, i looked forward to all my appointments, just to hear her heart beat or to talk about the baby!  like you I HATE needles.  I was even going to try to give birth drug-free just so I wouldn't have to have an epidural.  but, in the end the contractions about killed me so I gave in and got one.  Let me tell you, I didn't look at the needle, but I didn't feel it at all!!  I was really proud of myself about that!  And all the appointments leading up to birth are painless.  Most of them are just hearing the heartbeat, height, weight, pee in cup.  Even the internal exams (I think there were 2 or 3) didn't hurt.  Good Luck.  Don't let your fears stop you.  You will actually surprise yourself if you let yourself just give in!|`|955YoHvVaa	The first appointment is just an internal exam..and lots of questions..the ones after that aren't bad at all..they check your weight, blood pressure, have you pee in a cup..and measure your tummy..then send you on your way..my worse appointment was when I had to drink that disgusting room temperature orange stuff that tasted like stale sunkist..and that was to check for diabetes..they basically do the same things at each appointment..the final one is like the first one..another exam to see if you are dilating and it really isn't that bad at all..|`|57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	One of the reasons I had two homebirths with midwives is that I don't do well with poking and prodding.  It was much easier to deal with it from one person I knew and trusted who respected my need for space.  And I have two healthy wonderful kids!|`|Xu1lG9Dcaa	You won't be seeing a doctor, you will see an obstetrician. You won't be prodded with needles... maybe twice your whole pregnancy. big deal. you'll be fine! pregnancy appointments are fun, at least in my opinion. i love going, knowing my baby's growing and healthy.|`|Rx31LHjbaa	Well, if you have a true phobia of going to the doctor, an OBGYN visit probably won't be any easier than any other visit.  At the earlier visits, they do a transvaginal ultrasound, a pelvic exam, breast exam, etc.  It's not really any different than a women's check up, though.  This was only done at my very first visit.  I've had three more visits since then and they've only checked for the heart beat with a monitor on the tummy.  Other than having to show your stomach, nothing invasive or anything<br>  <br>  When you get later in pregnancy, and especially related to delivery, there are a lot of invasive things going on.  Lots of physical exams, checking the cervix, etc.     <br>  <br>  There are other options out there though.  There's been a huge movement lately towards more natural birthing processes, out of the hospital.  You could talk to a midwife about this type of pregnancy and delivery.  Natural births get a lot of negative feedback from mainstream society in the US, but it really could be something to look into in your case.|`|VZf7MTuYaa	Be careful, Angie.  I too was a doctor phobe, but got pregnant anyway because I wanted to have a baby so badly.  As if there wasn't enough poking and prodding associated with becoming pregnant, once I became pregnant, the doctor poked and prodded me incessantly.  I still thought that it would be worth it, to have a little one, and toughed it out as best I could.  Ugh!<br>  <br>  Finally the day came to have my baby.  The biggest shot of my life, with a needle that looked like a turkey baster, and lots of poking and prodding in my most intimate areas.   They even cut a slit so that my vagina and my anus were joined.  Nasty stuff.  This is called an episiotomy.<br>  <br>  But the real horror was when my baby was born, because he was born---wait for it--- a DOCTOR!  The little lad ran around the house in a white coat with one of those little mirrors on his head, poking me and prodding me daily until I thought I would die.  I had to give him up for adoption.  He was just named Surgeon General, but I can't bear to see him.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	get a midwife- they tend to be a lto nicer and spend more time with you becoming almost like a friend. most of the time when i went to the doctor while i was pregnant it was just pee in a cup listen to heart beat and he felt my belly- there were a couple times where i gave blood but you can refuse that|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I have two babies and haven't been to a doctor -I use a midwife and one that practices EVIDENCE based prenatal care.<br>  <br>  Assuming that you don't need an HIV test they don't need blood from you.  You may want to, before you get pregnant, be checked to see if you need any vaccines and see if you are immune to toxoplasmosis.  That will require a blood draw, and of course if you need more vaccines those will be needles.<br>  <br>  If you need STD screening you can use a self-test kit.  There is a blood test for cervical cancer in the US otherwise there are self-kits for PAP tests.<br>  <br>  The midwife will need to measure fundal height and fetal position by pressing on your belly BUT they can also show you how to do it.  You can certainly do the fundal height measurements.<br>  <br>  There is never any reason to do an internal exam unless you are in preterm labour.  The is really no reason to do internal exams in a full term labour but sometimes it is nice to be reassured that you are getting *somewhere*.<br>  <br>  I really think you need to find a respectful midwife who is willing to work with you to make you comfortable.

Tight or fitted jeans aren't that comfortable to begin with.  Can you imagine being a baby and having to wear them?<br>  <br>  Just because your baby is 9 months old doesn't mean he needs to wear 9 month clothing.  My little girl always wore a smaller size than what her age was.  Like now she can still wear 24 months in some things (not all) even though she's 38 months old.

I will wait one more period and buy the ovulation tests and have my husband get a sperm count even if he doesn't want to.<br>  Good luck.<br>  PS: I can tell if I'm gonna have my period. That's when I get a zit on my face that hurts a lot and gets a white head on it. Even if my boobs are sooo sore to touch, I can tell I am nor pregnant. Do you have something that tells you wether you will have your period or not?
dnG7fhnbaa	We built and practically lived in a very rickety tree house directly over the "old railway" which was actually the active railway...<br>  <br>  My husband scratched his name onto the side of his neighbours brand new BMW...lol, he was only 4 and used to write his initials on the bottom of his match box cars...he didn't think scratching them onto his neighbours car with a stone would hurt...<br>  <br>  I used to love "swimming in the lake"  although it was more like paddling in the fast flowing ditch that carried sewer and other nasties through a little backtrack...<br>  <br>  "Jumping into trees" ~ That was a fun game...where we lived you could walk along the cliff, and see the tops of trees about 2' below and the sea about 20' below that...we used to jump from the cliff into those trees with no regard for the danger that we were putting ourselves in...<br>  <br>  My daughter isn't due till July but I really hope she doesn't put herself in the danger I used to!|`|prqrQcd1aa	yeah i've been known to cause mischief..and wash my babby in the dishwasher, and even now what my alfabet is..onstly i do.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	I did climb many trees.

BVoFot3Maa	the easiest way to tell if it's a contraction or not is to lie down and press on your stomach while you think it might be happening, it should feel super hard and tight...like you could bounce a ball of it. Then compare this feeling to when you are not getting any of those sensations, you should be able to easily press into your uterus (in places where the baby isn't located anyhow). <br>  Sometimes during a contraction the baby will get scrunched with your uterus so you will feel him pressing up really hard against you belly in places...those spots will be hard as well so try pressing different places to make sure it's your whole belly (a contraction) versus just the baby (regular fetal movement since he's running out of room these days). <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|B7BDyyagaa	first  of all 12 weeks is not near the end lol sorry that's still 3 months.. and a contraction you would not be able to move at all so sitting down wouldn't take it away you wouldn't be able to move.. they sound like braxton hicks but you should time them if they are steady and around the same time they are contractions and you should talk to your doctor if they jump around and are not time able they are BH and everyone has them pretty much.. good luck.. the big belly does get sore it is for me... but your about to get even bigger so try to make yourself comfy if you can|`|M9pwlsVbaa	well i've never been pregnant but i think that is a contraction...especially if it sorta of hurts and u can feel your stomach get tight when this happens|`|MOsStEbqaa	If it only happens when you are moving i don't think that it is a real contraction. It could just be braxton hicks. A real contraction your belly is going to tighten and you are going to feel cramps. I think it is just you moving around and your body not used to the extra weight. I would walk more or get more exercise, this will not only help you out now but it will later on for the labor as well.|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	You are probably overdoing it, especially if it goes away after you sit down for awhile.  Slow down and take some time.  You may also be experiencing heartburn.  Contractions are much lower and you will know when you start having them.  Sometimes if I am out of breath, it helps me to go outside and get some fresh air...<br>  But, no, I don't think it's a contraction.
2f6diQBiaa	I would not recommend using vitamin C. First, it's not going to help. Vitamin C will not bring on your period. Second, after so high of a level (100-200mg) your body just urinates it out anyway, so it has no added effect on the body.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do would be to call your doctor and explain the situation. There are prescription medications (like prometrium or Provera) that will bring your period on. The medications are not expensive (I paid $10) and do not have many side effects.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!

aJLx0nhNaa	Not any more, but when he was 3 and 4 months old there was an hour, usually between 6 and 7 when we could do almost nothing to soothe him.  The only thing that really seemed to work was to put him in the stroller, in the living room, facing me, lock the wheels straight and then rock him back and forth vigorously.<br>  <br>  It's normal.  My son outgrew it, they always do.|`|PUUXbVK2aa	my mom said I used to when I was 3 or 4.<br>  from 5 until 7 or something I would fuss and whine everyday.<br>  <br>  she said it was just a phase though, and that it only lasted a few weeks.|`|yCwPxulYaa	Yes my baby was like this unitl around 3 months old. <br>  <br>  Why do babies fuss in the evening?<br>  <br>  One frequently-heard explanation for baby's fussiness in the evenings is that milk volume tends to be lower in the evening due to the natural cycling of hormones throughout the day. However, Dr. Peter Hartmann, a breastfeeding researcher, has said that in the women he has studied, milk volume is not low at this time of day. Even if milk volume is lower in the evening, fat content is typically higher in the evening (particularly if baby is allowed to control this via cue feeding), so the amount of calories that baby is getting should not be significantly different. Milk flow can be slower in the evening, which may be frustrating for some babies. <br>  <br>  Doctors often attribute evening fussiness to baby's immature nervous system (and the fussiness does end as baby gets older, usually by 3-4 months). However, Dr. Katherine Dettwyler (who does research on breastfeeding in traditional societies) states that babies in Mali, West Africa and other traditional societies don't have colic or late afternoon/evening fussiness. These babies are carried all day and usually nurse several times each hour. <br>  <br>  So perhaps none of these explanations is a complete answer to baby's evening fussiness. For many babies, the fussy time seems to be characterized by a need to have small quantities of milk at frequent intervals, combined with lots of holding, cuddling and movement. Babies who are offered as much expressed milk or formula as they will take by bottle [note: this practice will decrease your milk supply!] often behave in exactly the same way in the evenings. Baby takes a small amount and dozes (and fusses), then a little more, and so on. Perhaps babies "remember" mom being very active during her pregnancy at these times, and want to be held, rocked, and nurtured constantly again.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	That's funny you asked this because my daughter is also a month old and get fussy for no reason between those times.

I still have cramps and pains like I'm going to get my period every once in a while and I am 24 weeks pregnant.  Unless there is bleeding, or the cramps are persistent and do not go away after 45 minutes of rest, there usually is no problem.  However, if there IS bleeding, and a woman is having cramps that do not go away after resting or using the bathroom, then she should be seen by a doctor.

yxbwwYgFaa	I like it :)|`|Elxuvon8aa	Not my type but I do know a young womwn by that name it is a Southern name|`|AA10325228	It is weird, no offense|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	Dixie is a southern name and although it isn't a name I would choose, it is a cute name. The point is, you are not happy with it, and i feel as though everyone should be happy with their own name. If you are still young, I think you should tell your family, friends and teachers that you plan to change your name. What is your middle name? Do you like it? If not, I think you should choose a 'D' name, and go with it. In school, a classmate did that. As kids we thought it was great fun and we all went along with it. If we'd forget, she'd gently remind us. My daughter has a friend whose little girl, age 7, named Brittney,was embarrassed when her classmates called her Brittney Spears. The little girl announced to parents and teachers that she was changing her name and she now goes by her middle name.<br>  I can think of many pretty D names: Dayna, Dale, Diane, Diana, DeAnna, Deirdra, Deandra, Danielle, Dawn,   Good luck|`|hyG0c5Nnaa	It kind of makes me think  of a Dixie cup, but there are definitely a lot worse names.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	I like it.....|`|xLabGD6Maa	It sounds  very southern.

Cx5Zo7IIaa	No, I don't think it hurts worse the older children get, the reaction is just more severe is all. Older children probably have a slightly high infection rate because they touch it all the time as oppose to infants who lack the coordination to do so. Get her some clip ons if your not sure about piercing them right now.|`|p0prrzf2aa	the only reason it would get infected is if you didn't take good care of it. it should be fine|`|7F0zA7ARaa	I think it would be fine. I would pierce them myself if I were you though. Every time I got my ears pierced as a child the gun hurt sooo bad. And it seemed like the ends were on to tight. My ears were so swollen and hurt from it. Finally I decided I would get a needle and pierce them myself and it honestly didn't hurt at all and didn't even bleed. I just got one of those ice things that you put in a lunch box and numbed my ears and pierced them. Make sure the back ends are not on tight so her ear can breath. When they are on to tight it can cause irritation and infections. Keep her hair pulled back! Hair can cause it to get infected! So put that hair in a pony tail! Clean 3 times a day especially within the first week of piercing! Keep in for at least six weeks!|`|uj1A73ZGaa	My oldest daughter is two and she just got her ears pierced. She sat on my lap they cleaned her ears off, marked them with the marker, lined them up and pierced them.  She cried when she heard the click than they cleaned them off and than they showed her and she started laughing. She loves them and hasn't had a problem with them. I just recommend cleaning them at least 3times a day. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AFi5kTiEaa	My daughter is 3, she loves earrings but I have not gotten her ears pierced.  For me, i am going to wait untill she is a little older.  I am afraid she will pull them out, if they hurt,  or she gets angry.  She does have clip on dress up earrings that she loves to wear.  They also sell stick on earrings which do stay on pretty good.  They sell them in Clairs, and the accessory stores.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	I got mine pierced when I was 6 years old, and it didn't hurt that much.  Whether or not you should let your daughter get her ears pierced should probably depend on her.  Does she get scared easily, and what kind of pain tolerance does she have?  She sees your earrings and wants to wear them, but she probably doesn't fully understand that in order to wear them, someone has to pierce her ears.  I know I couldn't have done that when I was 2, because I was a pretty paranoid kid. lol.  Even when I was 6, I was terrified of getting it done even though I really wanted to.  The lady piercing my ears gave me a teddy bear to hold to calm me down. lol.  But if you don't think your daughter would get scared go for it!  But if you decide to wait until she's a little older I don't think it would hurt more than if you did it now.|`|0fa106467f70c70a63459a6f8bf4c1a8aa	We got my daughter's ears pierced at 4 months and she did just fine the only problem now with her having her ears pierced is she likes to try and take them out, or pulls on them.. So that's something to keep in mind, she's old enough to know that they are there.  As long as you keep her ears cleaned and make sure she has surgical steel posts she should be ok.|`|wTkvkWscaa	Well, she's probably going to want them pierced at some point. And you're right; if you get them done now, it will be over with. The only thing that would suck is is cleaning them, because YOU would have to do it. I had to wait until I was 12 to get my done. I'd get it done now if I were you, but really, it depends on what you think. My niece got her ears pierced when she was an infant. It works pretty well that way.|`|yGgFvd2Haa	she'll be   ok they'll   explain   the step to you|`|2fB383F2aa	If you do decide to go ahead with it (and it is your decision), go to a jewelry store that will pierce both ears at the same time. That way, she won't be left with once ear pierced and too scared to get the second one in. I got my daughters ears pierced when she was almost 4 months old, they did both ears at the same time. She only cried for not even 5 minutes, and it wasn't even the actual piercing, but the click sound it made when it was already in that made her cry! It healed up real quick (about 2 weeks). She's 2 now and doesn't know she has them unless I check to see if they're clean! Always use clean hands to clean them, and turn them every now and then so they don't get crusty.
z5JkgFOyaa	Implantation bleeding, also called implantation spotting, does not look like a regular menstrual period. Implantation bleeding is scanty and usually pink or brownish discharge. <br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding normally occurs a week to a few days before your period would normally start. Spotting that occurs around a week after ovulation is likely implantation bleeding, whereas, spotting that occurs very close to the time that your period would normally start may not be. A normal menstrual cycle generally starts off light and then gets heavier. Spotting can sometimes be the sign of an early period. If this is the case, the spotting will pick up to heavier bleeding. If you have spotting right around the time your period would normally start, it can be more confusing. You will need to take the wait and see approach or take a pregnancy test to determine pregnancy.<br>  Implantation bleeding is usually bright fresh blood like that which you would expect to see if you cut your finger. It can also be in the form of a pink mucous stain.<br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding is fairly common with pregnancy. Twenty to thirty percent of women will have spotting during early pregnancy. If you have some light spotting before your period would normally start this is not something to worry about and may be a sign of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there is no way to tell for sure whether you are pregnant or not until you are 1 day away from your period (at the earliest and more accurate results) or you have missed your period and then to do a test to see whether you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope it works out the way you want it to. :)

Sorry|`|BjoBZvDLaa	Not bad... I would quite like it if I actually knew someone who was called that - so if you choose it, it might take people a while to get used to it. He might get teased at school tho, it's quite an unusual name.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I recommended it to some one that had other earthy names for sibs  I would not use it just not my type|`|AA10325228	It is an ugly name... no offense|`|vAF4wgVDaa	hey if you like it then go with it. You cannot please everyone. There is always someone who will not like the name that you pick.<br>  <br>  As for me, it's not that bad.

bo2cCAKkaa	You know whats funny...? I have come acrossed some that are like that and sometimes i will answer and sometimes i wont it depends on how bad it is. <br>  <br>  Some questions are just so bad you really don't wanna answer because you don't wanna be rude. They just don't want to hear the harsh and rude truth.|`|MOsStEbqaa	That's what i think. Anytime i see those questions i tend to be a bit more harsh then i normally would be. It like come on grow up you are asking a question you think might get rude answer get the balls to take them.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	Well i don't think it's nice to be giving people **** on here. Clearly they are too scared to speak with someone they know in person about it. If you don't want to answer their questions then don't answer them. Some people ask question because they are wanting to hear others experiences in similar situations.
YPQ6XaKRaa	Well, I had two chemical pregnancies and I can tell you that I did NOT have cramping at all before I lost them.  I just started spotting.  Also, I read that if you make it past 18 DPO, there's no chance of it being a chemical pregnancy.  I would make an appt. with your ob/gyn and have them start bloodwork to check your hcg levels and progesterone and make sure they are increasing appropriately.  Good luck!|`|2yusiREnaa	Yes its the baby attaching its self and its making your muscles freak out ha =] its just fine!<br>  <br>  congrats!|`|ROJans2Taa	I had bad cramps with my second, completely normal, it felt like bad menstrual pains, best luck and congrats|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	Hi, dear. The cramping is normal. It is your baby implanting and your uterus stretching and growing for the baby. I had those really bad when I first found out I'm pregnant and I still get cramps sometimes. It's normal.

XOtOMncwaa	In my baby book there is a section for each month for the first year, and it has things like, I learned this this month, I went here this month, I tried new food this month, and I sleep so long now... I really like doing it like that, it seems more organized, and I also make sure to include his milestones on that page too, then theres also a separate page for milestones and places for pictures of him doing those. I have an awesome baby book, and it doesn't miss anything else that I would like to include. Also another thing I would think about putting in there that I thought was neat in mine there is a page for the prices of stuff when my son was born, and top singers, who was the pres. etc... I thought that would be neat to look back on. You might want to include a section for the dad too, like what the dad thought what the dad said when your baby was born etc. Also including a pic of what you baby looked like at each month it was born is a good idea too.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	uhm in my baby book it has the theme of the room & how we prepare but u pretty much got it all
am7Ykwqiaa	I'm in the same situation. But I've decided to wait it out til AF. I wont be using cheap OPK or HPT's again, I've had no luck. Ive tested for ovulation every day, at the same time for the last 60 days - nothing. I know I ovulated, as I had blood tests done. If you want to check again, I'd try at 13dpo. Best of luck!|`|p0prrzf2aa	you took that test kinda early. see if you miss your period 1st|`|QKGuNLb4aa	wait till its closer to your period to test again. its still possable. good luck and baby dust
U4bpcK7Caa	That could be a huge sign of pregnancy.  My first symptom was sore breast it was about a week before my missed pregnancy.  Which was normal for me so I really didn't think much but I know how you feel because me and my husband had been ttc for about 9 months so I was scared to take a pregnancy test because I didn't want to be let down...I was a week late so I finally got the courage to take a pregnancy test and I got 2 pink lines....I am now 12 weeks pregnant!|`|2mOK7neraa	Mine were a little bit n they grew.. but i also got headaches like everyday for a week or so and i started forgetting things in mid-sentence|`|ROJans2Taa	cramps mainly then my next symptom was light headiness.|`|rjVALevtaa	That definitely could be a sign of pregnancy. My breasts didn't start aching until after I had missed my period, but everyone is different. <br>  <br>  My earliest pregnancy symptoms were fatigue and nausea.
QlNpfz6paa	This is actually one of the first symptoms that show up. <br>  Though there are many others.<br>  This is a good site it think <br>  www.I-am-pregnant.com|`|8RfmosODaa	Yep I had sore breast b4 I took a test, thats how I knew!|`|aPscVrOoaa	Mine were in extreme pain too. In fact, it was pretty much the only early pregnancy symptom I had. I never dealt with morning sickness or anything else.|`|YxcBk1uLaa	Well, I hope you are ready, because yeah, it could be true!  That was the first symptom of my first, and now my second pregnancy.  I got sore before my cycle too, but this feels a bit worse, and very sensitive nipple area.  It might not be too early to take a test, when mine got sore, I waited a week to take the test and it was very much positive.  The doctor confirmed I was already 5 weeks along!  Good luck!|`|BAbwV25qaa	My breasts were extremely sore almost immediately into my pregnancies with all three of my children.  On the other hand if you have been using those muscles (such as lifting over your head or pulling up) that could create sore muscles in that area and not wearing a bra could attribute to the sore nipples from rubbing up against your shirt.  Hope this helps!|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Oh yeah! That was my first symptom. Although I thought my breasts were sore/swollen from PMS, but sure enough I was pregnant. It only got worse too. It felt like needles were stabbing them when barely touched. The soreness faded around 14 weeks.
HM0cxcahaa	could be anything, constipation, gas, etc etc etc

OgzHcNMsaa	Not if you wean them before toddler years|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	If they continued until the were like 5, then yes, but if it's taken away at a normal age then no!|`|bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	I asked my son's Paediatric Dentist this question recently.  He advised that using a pacifier for the first 2 years of life has little impact on teeth.  However, if the child continues to use it beyond about 2 - 2.5 years the teeth and the jaw itself starts to change and somewhat forms in the shape of the soother.  He highly recommended we toss it out by age 2.5.  He also mentioned that the impact will depend on how hard your child sucks, if he/she sucks it all night long, or just uses it to fall asleep then spits it out and how much he has it in total.|`|PJX8OD5Aaa	yes try not to use it because it does damage their teeth and also it is very hard of them to let them go ...believe me im going through this riught now :)|`|Rbm99GOcaa	They come out straight.....sucking on the pacifier for a long time will make them crooked, its called bottle mouth|`|JRXpYW3Naa	KT is right, get them off of it by a year.
2P5WRadhaa	Does he know what causes pregnancy? If he's had sex with her, she could be pregnant; If he hasn't had sex, she's not pregnant (at least, not by him).  Tell him to proceed with his life in accordance with whichever one applies to him! By the way, birth control isn't fool-proof; abstinence is!<br>  <br>  That's about as clear as it can be; but, "after-the-fact" is NOT the time to start asking these questions.|`|n24githIaa	She probably shouldn't have taken so many birth control pills.<br>  If your friend used a condom, then the chances of them making a baby together is pretty unlikely.<br>  Peeing doesn't effect anything.<br>  It was probably caused from the vagina pushing on the bladder.|`|aIhTFmDUaa	She shouldn't have taken that many birth control pills at once. That is alot of hormones at once which can cause kidney failure if i'm not mistaken. Peeing has nothing to do with it. No condom is 100% safe. I got pregnant on the pill. She can very well get pregnant. Next time tell her not to be stupid and take her birth control the RIGHT way the first time!|`|vnFAAJ0Qaa	nothing is fool proof but chances are slim. however you should never use a condom twice as it is only made for a one time use...even if he didnt take it off and reuse it its possible to over load...|`|078c9269781f249b467d399b49c9e6b1aa	i don't think she is pregnant.she went over board taking 4 birth control pills.so your friend can relax|`|Abl3r1T9aa	uh... i'm not a genius or anything but your friend is a f*ckin retard.
g5JeSJbNaa	you should be taking folic acid everyday while trying to conceive and right through  pregnancy good luck and baby dust to you|`|lTkYWiy5aa	Although timing is important, it doesn't guarantee pregnancy. Just keep doing what you are doing and will happen eventually! Since you will already be 2 weeks along when you find out you are pregnant, it is a good idea to take a prenatal vitamin to ensure a healthy baby from day 1!<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust!!!|`|8RfmosODaa	When I was pregnant with my son my doctor told me to take flinstone vitamins. So now I have been taking some again since my last miscarriage. I got off bc pills in September and I was pregnant in December but miscarried. It can take a few months for you to get pregnant after stopping bc, so 3-4 months isn't that long although it can FEEL like FOREVER! lol|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	Start taking folic acid three months before you start trying to conceive!   Since it's too late for that apparently, start taking it right now.  You want to have plenty of it in your system when you do conceive, because the baby's heart forms very early, as does the neural tube, and folic acid can be very, very important in preventing problems.|`|d7bJIgqlaa	Hi Grace,<br>  I'm new at this too so, I'm not expert enough to tell you about charting, but I do know that you should take a multivitamin with folic acid in it.  When I told my doctor I was going to start ttc she prescribed me a multivitamin for hopeful moms.  You can also get them over the counter.  Best of luck to you!|`|GTcqiMpoaa	Folic acid should be taken daily for the 3 months before you get pregnant and the first 3 months of the pregnancy. Our fertility specialist said to have sex every other day. Most sperm can live up to 3 days. Also sometimes it takes awhile to get the pill out of your system. It took me 3 months but it took my mom 1 year. If you are not pregnant this month, think about using OPKs and/or BBT. The calendar is for people who O on day 14. You may not be one of those. I O on day 18.
g5JeSJbNaa	folic acid and preseed|`|oHNrktxTaa	Unfortunately, there aren't pills to take that will get you pregnant. <br>  <br>  But, you can take prenatal vitamins or a multi vitamin that contains Folic Acid which can help prevent problems & ectopic pregnancies.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
aJLx0nhNaa	Relax, she's still a newborn.  She'll do them when she's ready.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my son was a little later on the normal range too- he hated tummy time so i just did the airplane thing all the time and put him on MY tummy- he liked doing that so he spent more time trying|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	She is very young still to have that much strength in her neck muscles. Tummy time is only for a few minutes at this age. She seems like a normal newborn!! As for rolling over to her side is something babies usually do at around 4 mos onwards.. so I wouldnt rush her at all. And besides every baby does things at their own time!! No baby is the same and it doesnt mean anything if one baby does something earlier than the other-my daughter for example never really crawled -she scooted on her bum and leg... she walked at 16 mos... now she just turned 2 and is very smart!! She runs around the house like a tornado!! She goes to daycare and sings songs, and a bunch of other stuff. So what Im saying is Every Baby is Different so DONT WORRY: D And Enjoy her!|`|zATQaiwIaa	my god! what do you expect out of an 11 week old INFANT?!  Yes that is completely normal that she cant hold her head up and it still wiggles, and she wouldnt be able to roll yet.<br>  <br>  The best you can do for her right now is just make sure she gets some tummy time daily.  Dont be is such a rush!|`|JRXpYW3Naa	My daughter is the same age and she won't lift her head either, she can lift her butt up though....just keep up with the tummy time to get her muscles stronger.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	my sons 4 months and cant lift his head when hes on his tummy.. he holds his head up when im carrying him..|`|qKEKLOaEaa	babies generally don't have strong enough neck muscles to control their head till about 4-5 months.. rolling over can happen from between 4-6 months and sometimes later. babies develope at their own pace, whatever you do, don't force her to do anthing that she isn't comfortable with. If you are ever concerned about her development, call her Doctor.
vdXnvJwMaa	For sure the 12, 13, 14, 15, 16n and elevate your hips for about 20-30 minutes after sex to keep the semen in there as long as possible.  Good luck, you go girl!!|`|am7Ykwqiaa	In 13 days you should be ovulating. I would have sex on day 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th days (count from the first day of your last period) - just to be sure|`|GUlnV2oIaa	typically around day 14 but cycles may be different.  mine was a 31 day cycle and i didn't ovulate until day 21.  one way to determine when you ovulate is to take your temperature every morning before you get out of bed.  When you see a spike of about .3 or .4 that means you're ovulating and if it stays high you may be pregnant.

Sounds like you are pregnant:D<br>  <br>  It may still be light because your HCG levels are not super high yet.<br>  I would now call your OBGYN & make an appointment to have a blood test confirm.<br>  Also, in the mean time, I would take another HPT first thing in the morning, b/c your urine will have the highest hormone concentrate in it.<br>  <br>  Have a safe & healthy pregnancy.|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	It's very rare to get a false positive, so if there was a line then there is a baby!!!!!|`|c13261f58d48f2f1acf21bbee37c0bbbaa	it doesnt matter how light it is your knocked up its only been 6 days so the test is right on|`|cfRPJ0spaa	My line was barely visible and now I have a beautiful little girl ...<br>  <br>  CONGRATULATIONS!!!|`|WWfL5tMvaa	Sounds you got your BFP Congrats<br>  Wish you a happy and healthy pregnancy<br>  send us some baby dust please|`|fsrLp3HMaa	hopefully youre pregnant!<br>  congrats!!|`|sK67bBy5aa	If you saw a line then....YOU ARE PREGNANT!!!

Take it again in a cpl of days, with the first morning urine.Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!!!!|`|67082a9c920bb435db63ebbdfd15a43baa	That line indicates that there was hCg detected in your urine, a hormone that is only detected when you are pregnant.  The line may have been light because you are testing early, or even because you had a lot to drink which diluted your urine.  Bottom line is that the hormone wouldn't be in your urine if you were pregnant....CONGRATS!!!  =)|`|AA11764194	if you saw 2 lines other line however light it might be .. Then you are pregnant..<br>  <br>  congrats..|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Pretty good possibility you are pregnant. Definately wait until another day or two to take in the morning.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Go to a urologist he will get a large needle and stick him in the sac, most likely he  still has viable sperm but it's just not getting out. This procedure can get you the sperm you want. Not pretty or comfortable but it'll do the job and it's cheaper than getting the vasectomy reversed.|`|be5b6f02c20b23ba0ebd00d8685794a0aa	Not all that likely.  Reversals seldom result in pregnancy, and they cost a lot.<br>  <br>  Think about it this way... You won the lotto.  Now you have the perfect excuse.  I am child-free by my own choice.  I love living that way except when morons jump my case about it.  Nobody will harass you and call you a communist like they do me.<br>  <br>  Once you think about it, you will see that children are just vanity.  You may discover that the only reason you want one is because it seems like everyone else does.  Well, that is just peer pressure.  What do you need with that headache?  If you really think about it, there are better things you can do with your life than contributing to overpopulation.  <br>  <br>  Talk to more older people who have grown children.  They can give you more insight into it.  You will see that children are grossly overrated.<br>  <br>  Also if you do not have children you will be able to own things that are not broken. You know, collectible things.<br>  <br>  Show the world that you are more than a "cave-woman".|`|MoUtk7cUaa	i am adopted, and very lucky to have had the parents id do.  to them, and myself, i am their own child, as is my other adopted sister.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	I would first ask him to have it reversed. And if he agrees to that, try to have children naturally.|`|tUeH8HDdaa	He can have his vasectomy reversed.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	Oh no thats awful. I swear it really isn't fair to you. I think if you do stay with him you could do a sperm donor. They are listed on the internet, but I would think over time you could become resentful over the fact that you never had kids. He should have told you earlier also, so you could have time to decide if you wanted to stay with him or not. But by staying, you are shorting yourself of a very precious part of life.|`|ttyKkUcDaa	well, their is a way to get his vasectomy "reversed" in lack of a better word.<br>  if he is not willing to do do this-sperm banks with artificial insemination is the only other way. unless you go and physically go and have sex with someone who knows that they are only the donor.<br>  <br>  hope this helps <br>  xoxo|`|jKdVtDx7aa	Alternatives; Artificial insemination<br>  <br>  Adoption<br>   They will be your children and you will love them no less.
fLBzhsYSaa	Breast milk is best for baby's health, it is recommended by pediatricians everywhere that they be fed breast milk alone for at least the first four months, some recommend six. <br>  <br>  What you can do is get a good breast pump, pump and store in sterilized plastic bags, in the freezer. they can be thawed at room temperature when ready to use or warmed a little in a teacup of hot water. Take the pump with you, pump as much as you can during your time away and discard it. This will help to maintain your supply.|`|1Mtb4DQtaa	While you are away keep pumping so you wont lose your milk supply

You turn your head, someone sees a child, they take it and run.|`|atmDaT61aa	It is irresponsible parenting because every parent is aware that their child can run off in the one instant that the parent takes their eyes off of them so you would think they wouldn't take their eyes off them atleast that would be the responsible thing to do.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	I would consider the parents to be quite irresponsible....because think about this logically. Only way your kid would get lost or kidnapped if you are out somewhere or they are playing in the yard. If you at home, lock the doors and etc and you are safe. So, when you kid is outside...it's pretty idiotic to leave them to themselves or let your mind wander while they run off somewhere. You need to make sure where they are...stay nearby and watch them!<br>  I know it can be hard at different ages, but I think as a parents its a responsibility one MUST handle.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Has ANYTHING ever Happened to You- and You found yourself wondering WHY- it Did ?!  Well the Fact IS, bad stuff "happens". And it makes NO Difference WHO you are, HOW you were raised, or WHAT you could've done to prevent it! "Stuff" JUST does! And you can be as "careful" as ALL get out... -But you never know what could happen "Next"- on the Moment you take your eye off the ball...  It's a "Lesson" we ALL learn- sooner or later...    :o|`|prqrQcd1aa	It's not always irresponsible parenting honestly. There are cases where the kids are snatched right from the home!|`|2YBwc4LFaa	It's a good question. It happens all the time though. I try not to let my kids out of my sight EVER. Occasionally they go to the neighbors and play but if they're outside, I'm outside. If I can't see them, I better be able to hear them and them me. They're pretty good about staying where they're supposed to though and making sure I always know where they are. I'm so scared of being one of those parents so I try my best to prevent it but even at my best I know there's always the possibility. It's a scary world.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	predators ARE MASTERS of what they do, dont sit there and say how can a parent let that happen or YOU might find yourself in that situation one day<br>  <br>  I dont let my kids out of my sight either but one day in  a small store my hubby and I had a small miscommunication on who was watching them for a few minutes and we turned around and couldn't find my daughter,  I was going crazy but she had found another little girl to play with<br>  <br>  sometimes predators use other children to lure other children, it happens, thats why my kids are getting gps watches soon|`|0mZfOStiaa	Well, little people can get away fast.<br>  lol. You turn your back for one second and they could be gone.<br>  It's really that easy. I never let Ava out of my sight. And she's my little cousin. I will be so protective when/if I have my son.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	Sadly. all a parent has to do is just look away for a split second and that's all the time needed.

Non per il discorso sessuale, se ti senti pronta fallo, ma per un discorso puramente ormonale...il preservativo oltre ad essere un ottimo anti concezionale è anche l'unico sistema per prevenire malattie veneree tipo HIV... Quindi non fare MAI a meno del preservativo e se puoi aspettare ad introdurre inibitori ormonali è meglio. Ciao.

tOwoQbfPaa	do you have any kids? because this is my 3rd and ive been leaking colostrum since around 16 weeks or so. it may have something to do with if youve ever breastfed before, or it could just depend on the person.|`|K8sBjRBsaa	i leaked as early as 6-8 wks also that is how some women find out they r pregnant. there is no particular time it could be late or early-u will have  an ultrasound to confirm how far u r at about 11 weeks.|`|AA11109728	For me, it was the day I came home from the hospital after having my baby.|`|ca03c4dbfbf739cc439141f60d700173aa	It varies between different women. I only started when I was 39 weeks pregnant!
pzLDXL6gaa	I think it shouldn't be done to infants, the choice should be left up to the guy when he's old enough. There's no reason to mandate doing it to a baby plus it hurts and has the risk of complications. I wouldn't do it if I had sons.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I don't really think it makes a difference.<br>  <br>  My children are circumcised though my husband is not. He has some hygiene issues (yeast infections, etc.) that he didn't want our boys to have to deal with. <br>  <br>  Yes, he keeps everything clean but when working 12 hour shift and having an hour to and from work everyday, that's a lot of gross build-up.<br>  <br>  Appearance, again doesn't matter to me. I've seen both...and they both just look like penises.|`|prqrQcd1aa	doesn't matter<br>  <br>  not shure as i have only girls<br>  <br>  i'm shure there are<br>  <br>  doesn't matter|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century. This slide show takes you through the rise of circumcision.... <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA</a><br>  <br>  Finally, you should watch a video or two of the procedure so you are fully informed of what your infant will go through. I will warn you that these are graphic. If you can't handle watching them as an adult, why would you expect your infant son to endure them?<br>  Gomco Clamp- <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=..." rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  Plastibell- <a href="http://newborns.stanford.edu/Plastibell...." rel="nofollow">http://newborns.stanford.edu/Plastibell....</a>|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I did not have my first son circumsized because the hospital he was born in refused to do it. I am half Jewish and not overly religious as having opposing religious parents meant I learned about all cultures with an open mind.<br>  <br>  When my son was 4 he had to be circumsized because his foreskin would not retract. It was horrible for him because he had to be alseep for the surgery, he had a ring of stitches all the way around the top of his penis and was shocked at how "different" it looked afterwards. Only after he as told that his penis looked the same as daddy's, he felt a little better. The recovery at an older age was hard for him though.<br>  <br>  We made the choice with our second son to have him done at birth. He didn't cry, we had to put a TON of vaseline on him at every diaper change for a week and then it was perfectly healed, he just had some longer soaks in the tub.<br>  <br>  That was my choice as a mom.<br>  <br>  My husband is circ'd as well, and from that perspective, no matter what anyone says about how un-circ'd men are just as clean, they're not. There's always stuff under there. Its gross. No woman should ever have to put her mouth on foreskin LOL Ew. (Just my humble opinion)<br>  <br>  As a woman, circ'd is preferred.|`|ck5edW9kaa	1.) Yes i believe a man should be circumsized.<br>  2.) I have two boys and they were both circumsized at birth.<br>  3.) Yes, it is hard to care for an uncircumsized penis especially when you have to teach a little boy how to care for it. Also, it has in a small percent of cases been linked to cancer, not many, but I didnt want to chance it with my son.<br>  4.) Not that I agree but honestly out world is critical, guys compare size and I wouldnt want my sons feeling as though they were different.<br>  <br>  This is just my opinion, not saying its right or wrong, just how I feel.|`|cI1JShJNaa	When we had our son we actually thought about this and asked our doctor. according to our doc there were no benefits and it was more of a cosmetic procedure than anything else, so we didnt have it done. She also mentioned that if you are not familiar with taking care of a circumcised penis there is a HUGE risk of an infection (for an infant).  As far as appearance, it doesnt matter to a crying infant....it really is only a parents choice not the child's.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	The doctor did it in the hospital after my son was born. They did not even ask me. I was told the doctors here think it is cleaner and more healthy. My parents were born at home. Some who have their child at home do not do it. It depends on whether you are born at home by natural child birth or born in a hospital.|`|3884ed81dd37e4db9226c11478973595aa	I personally like Circ better. <br>  And the advantage is less chance of infections.<br>  My son was circ.

I had it done with my son and will on my next one coming mostly for the fact that not having it done can lead to possible infections down the road.

There is nothing wrong with the human body exactly as it is when born.  If there is a God, I don't think he made a mistake putting the foreskin there.  <br>  <br>  Our son is not circ'ed.<br>  <br>  I have heard that there are myriad nerve endings in the foreskin that add immeasurably to the pleasure of sex<br>  <br>  The usual reasons cited for circ'ing all seem ridiculous to me:<br>  <br>  "I want him to look like dad" - ummmm....  circed or not, I hope that dad's penis doesn't look like a baby's/toddlers/youth.  After they're adults, I don't think there's much penis comparison going on.  <br>  <br>  "He will get teased in the locker room" - who's going to get teased more, the guy with the 'different looking' penis (and with the circ rate falling daily, it's not all that different these days, anyway) or the guy who's going around looking at other guys' penises?  <br>  <br>  "Girls won't like it" - I'm hoping that he isn't involved in any long-term relationships that are based solely on physical appearance, anyway<br>  <br>  "It's hard to keep clean" - once he retracted, it added about 3 seconds onto his bath/shower as he pulled the foreskin back & rinsed underneath with clean water.  Before he retracted, there was no extra cleaning to do at all.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	My son is circumsized, i more or less left it up to his dad, dad is NOT, but he decided it would be better if our son was.its cleaner, and honestly a LOT of women prefer  circ....i never had  a real preference as long as it done its job lol..but then ive not had very many to compare ha.<br>  <br>  appearance wise i guess it depends on whether you like the cute  little mushroom head...or  looking like a snapping turtle  that just jumped back in its shell when its not hard....<br>  <br>  to me its all personal preference, and tradition has alot to do with it sometimes.

Some wait several days and others wait a couple of weeks. I know what you're going through. My husband and I are trying for number 2 after the birth of our daughter in 2007 and two miscarriages. I started cramping at 1 am this morning and it's enough to make me say ouch or bend over weird. I have also experienced frequent peeing, food cravings, dizziness, hot/cold flashes, and gas and fluttering movements in my stomach. I knew I was pregnant with my daughter because I was very light headed and couldn't sleep through the night without peeing. I haven't had a period since Jan. 31st though and I am due for one tomorrow so fingers crossed for both of us. I wouldn't put your guard down and would tell your boyfriend that these things just don't happen over night. He has to be patient as well as you. But you're right, you could possibly be. Your body knows when it's pregnant, not early signs of pregnancy. It's your feeling that you are. Baby dust to you and congrats if you are.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're not, have sex every day for one month and every other day the next month. Also missionary, side by side and doggy style are the most effective methods because it places sperm closer to the cervix with the help of gravity. Sperm can live for about 5 days if the conditions are right. Good luck!|`|0NX1vnSKaa	i took one 2 days before my period was supposed to start. i am now 6 days late and just took another and it was positive! so dont give up hope, just wait for your missed period and test again<br>  <br>  **lots of baby dust! :)|`|LBg4DNpCaa	Awww my fiance and I were the same way we were trying for like 5 months and no pregnancy.

3cLE5L7Saa	Theres still a lot of time for your baby to change position.  I've heard of women being dialated for WEEKS.....THis lady at church told me she was at 3cm for 5 WEEKS!  It really doesn't mean anything, except that your body is getting ready for the big day.  You can't put a time on it.|`|BVoFot3Maa	If your doctor isn't concerned about dilating I wouldn't worry about it. Especially since you've probably been told what to look for as far as labor actually starting. I'm assuming your baby is transverse right now (across your belly, versus breech or head down). I wouldn't worry so much about that right now, Your water typically doesn't break until well into labor (only a small percentage of women actually have thier water break prior to being in labor), and for you to be in labor, the babies head would have to be engaged in your pelvis already, which eliminates the problem of cord prolapse. The danger for prolapse really comes in when your water's are artificially broken (the baby was to high up when the water was broken).|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	I'm sure you'll be fine just don't do anything strenuous and if you get more and more braxton hicks or real contraction take it easy. i started dilating at 32 weeks and at 33 i was 2 cm and 50% effaced. i ended up having him at 36 weeks
bc7e0ec8c3bc5dbc9ec1cdd56e6ebe81aa	First of all I would absolutely STOP checking your cervix.  This can cause irritation and could cause it to dilate prematurely.  The cervix changes as the pregnancy progresses.  Also each woman is very different.  <br>  <br>  For example:  with my second pregnancy my OB noticed that I was dilated 2cm at 30 weeks so I was put on "modified bed rest" to get me through to a safer point in the pregnancy.  I ended up staying at 2cm until I delivered at 38 weeks.  I increased my activity to a normal level at 36 weeks and still didn't go into labor for another 2 weeks. <br>  <br>  This pregnancy (my third), my cervix shortened and started funnelling at 27 weeks so I again ended up on modified bed rest.  I'm now 31.5 weeks and my cervix has actually gotten longer and stopped funnelling (called a dynamic cervix).  I am watched very closely and I have weekly ultrasounds to measure my cervix.  My OB doesn't want to touch it at all for fear it could cause dilation.  <br>  <br>  If I were you I would read all the articles on the internet about pre-term labor so you know what to watch for and what to react to (ie. contractions becoming painful or regular, bleeding, change of discharge, lower back cramping, period like cramps, leaking fluids, etc.).  If you don't have any of those symptoms I would just wait until your next pre-natal check up and ask about it then.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|xnhwmontaa	wow when i was 30 weeks i wish i could reach that much lol|`|33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	I wouldn't mess around with your cervix.  If you feel it needs to be checked, head to the hospital.  If you aren't trained its impossible to tell what you are looking for.|`|5ORyLk4Uaa	you are fine. you are closed and have not lost your plug yet. the mushy feeling is normal for pregnancy. i am 15 weeks along with my fourth and i was having really bad pains but were not sure if it was the baby laying in a really bad spot then i started to get sharp pains in there so i ran to the bath room to check to see if i was opened in anyway. if it is mushy and you cannot feel any hole then you are closed with your mucus plug in tact. try not to check yourself to much because it can irritate the uterus and make you contract. What you are feeling is normal for the pressure and the brackston hicks contraction. they will continue until labor and birth.|`|B7BDyyagaa	are you stupid.. sorry but you should not be shoving your fingers up your vagina and messing with your cervix.. for one thing you can not check it on your own for another you could really do something to yourself an for what reason bc you can't go to the dr. call our dr and get your fingers out of yourself sterile or not you and your husband are not drs an your asking for something to happen/.. sorry that sounds rude the fact you would mess around like that irratates me why you would stick your fingers up there rather then go to a trained professional NOT SMART
0Ha3Jbmmaa	everyone has different signs..hormone changes effect your body and yes it can cause constipation/runs. it is very normal.
dyFo9oE4aa	Seriously pray that you are not pregnant!  First of all why do you want to mess up your life so soon? I assume you are a teenager? Been there an done that, and I can tell you this from experience, DONT, waste your life away on empty promises and that you want to make "him" happy, it is so not worth it.  All that energy should be spend on being all you can be, be somebody, stay in school and take care of yourself first, trust me having a child now will only make things complicated! Your freedom will be all the door, and with the economy the way it is now, you can forget about ever having anything in life, I am serious. Take care of you first, get that education, get the degree, get that car, get that career, get that house, travel a little....then think about having kids.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	You are fine, DON'T double up on your birth control pills, take them as directed. Next time don't let the guy get that close !!!  just tell him no way. Either he will respect you and still like you or not - in which case, good riddance.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	Even if you are not pregnant, please remember for the future that when he enters you, even a little, that pre xxx is very potent with sperm so do be careful.|`|VhrUtQc2aa	I really think that you might not be pregnant because finally came out of your vagina and basically the sperm dies outside so there is a possibility you are not pregnant.<br>  <br>  I say if there is another week until your period then don't panic finish your BC and if your period has not come in a weeks time then get yourself checked out by your doctor.|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	first of all, if you are on birth control, you need to take it faithfully and on time and everyday and how you are supposed to or else it won't be very effective.  Second of all, if you took plan B you are more than likely safe.  Make sure you take your birth control the right way and you won't have any worries.|`|vjC5FVDaaa	Here's how it works, ALL girls overreact untill they are positive they want babies. When you're finally ready to have sex you should double up on the birthcontrol. AND NO, I do not mean taking two pills, I mean make him use a condom, and take the pill. Why? Because it sounds like you have really high anxiety, and that really helped me.<br>  But in the future, plan B doesn't always work, so mainly just rely on taking your birth control diligently, and ontime daily.<br>  <br>  Breathe, relax, you're definately not pregnant.|`|5cPkhf6taa	Yes you are, you are not pregnant relax there is no possible way if everything you said is true|`|nBqTrmkJaa	if you didn't have vaginal intecourse then it's extremely unlikely you're pregnant. semen/sperm needs to enter your vagina for you to conceive, even if he had some on his fingers and entered you with his fingers this can cause pregnancy but is extremely rare!!! as you're on bc pills it would be even more unlikely, but what concerns me more is that you are taking the pill without a break. as a woman, you neede to have a proper/full period so the lining of your uterus can shed. if it does not shed each month, this raises your chances of conditions such as cervical cancer. the companies that make these medications tell you to have a week break a month for a reason... so you can have a period caused by a break in the medication. you need to be careful with messing around with meds, you could do yourself some damage... just ask your doctor or pharmacist if you're not trusting what i'm saying.<br>  <br>  if you're really worried that you may be pregnant which as i said is extremely unlikely, then you're only option is to do a pregnancy test. if you need further advice, speak to your dr. they're the best qualified person to deal with your questions on contraceptives and conception of course.<br>  <br>  good luck, and blessed be

2irmTjQ3aa	Wait until you miss your period, if you do and then take a test. That is the only way you will know. Nobody on here can tell you if you are pregnant or not, we are not pregnancy tests.|`|4HhzKHl0aa	I would cound 50 days from the last time you had a normal period if you want to wait for 2 missed periods. <br>  <br>  If I were you I'd count from the last time you had a normal period and if its longer than 28 days I'd take a test right now. The sooner you find out or not the sooner you can get on prenatals. <br>  <br>  If you find out that you aren't pregnant start taking prenatals now. If you take them long enough you can decrease your chances of morning sickness. I think vitamin B12 or something in prenatals if taken long enough is what takes away morning sickness. Good luck.|`|vdXnvJwMaa	You could probably take a test now since you are five days before your expected period.  You need to do a fresh morning urine for hte best results.  i recommend clearblue easy digital tests.  Try tomorrow morning and if its negative wait until you either have a period or miss it.  Good Luck!|`|0Ha3Jbmmaa	what worked for me was i took my temp every morning and logged it down before i even got out of bed. when my temp was slightly elevated i knew i was ovulating. and when it stayed elevated i knew i was pregnant. i did this for 2 months and then i got pregnant.|`|5ORyLk4Uaa	from the first sight of blood would be your first day. if you got pregnant last month and then spotted which is normal in early pregnancy then you could test now and get a result. good luck|`|AwVfywAGaa	When I was pregnant I spotted the same way it just might be that you are!|`|44fdrVIDaa	You count from the first day of spotting. You can take urine pregnancy test few days after your expected period. Good luck!
F3dWvVy5aa	aww yes, me babies would moan to sing to themselves as I was patting them to sleep. I bet if you sing to her instead she will be quiet and just listen.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think that babies that are not big criers (and my son was not) do this for pretty much the reasons you described.  My son does it when he's going to sleep.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	my son does this for about 5 minutes right before he falls asleep for a nap or for the night. he has done it since he was only a few months old. its the cutest thing ever! i love it!|`|bef68894c6c158e56dfd305f51801d35aa	My son makes little moaning sounds while Im holding him. He usually does it for about 5-10 mins before he nods off to sleep. I think its just their way of soothing themselves to sleep. He also does it sometimes if hes really tired but he cant fall asleep because of a gassy belly.
hfodUPg9aa	Sounds like Bi-polar disorder.<br>  <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/bipolar_disorder/article_em.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/bipolar_d...</a><br>  <br>  She should see another therapist and see what they say. A doctor saying that a 13 year old girls attempted suicide is just stress sounds strange to me. Unless the stress was caused by something traumatic like rape or something of that caliber. They should have at least put her on an antidepressant. Good luck. I will pray for her.|`|nxHjSKTTaa	Something is wrong and you need to go to a mental health professional that will listen to you and take you seriously.  I would keep talking to different doctors until you get to the bottom of this.<br>  <br>  Also, why aren't you keeping her in school, she needs her education and to go to college.  You need to make her finish school.  She needs consistency and routine in her life. I also don't agree with her staying out all night. She's 15 not 25.  She is still a baby and needs the guidance and protection of her family.  Good luck!|`|ozATw7s0aa	I don't think this is healthy. I don't think it's very normal, either. You need to establish more rules, and if there isn't really something wrong with her, like that she takes medicine or pills for, then she can't be like that all the time. I'm a teen and I know sometimes we freak out, but this being constant isn't normal.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|L4f5ONEkaa	Did you ever get her checked to make sure shes not bipolar?<br>  <br>  Also most people who have bipolar have a lot of those symptoms when its left untreated.  Some people turn to drugs as a solution to feel better and make the problem go away but not everyone who has bipolar does.<br>  <br>  Just get her checked out and dont start making assumptions it will just make things worst.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	sounds like she is bi polar or manic depressive|`|DkT8znckaa	This sounds like bipolar to me. I'd have it checked out. I've read up a quite a bit on bipolar, and these are all very clear symptoms. (Severe mood swings, suicidal thoughts, high energy, etc.) Bipolar people will often go out all night and not need much sleep and then totally crash and burn. You need to document all her mood swings and describe things in high detail to your doctor because disorders like bipolar can often be overlooked. It is obviously something more serious, and you need to make this more clear than it has been made in the past.|`|iCvG9kHqaa	You will need to talk to a professional who deals in psychology and will be able to tell you the answer. She may have a slight mental disorder such a manic depression or a bad case of clinical depression. It doesn't sound like normal behavior at all. I have dealt with a lot of mental illness in my family, my mum being manic depressive which is pretty close if not bi polar disorder, myself having gone through depression, my aunt is also manic depressive, my uncle who suffers depression and my partner who has also gone through clinical depression. Even if there is nothing wrong, mood swings as bad as this can be controlled, is she on the pill or any other medications or  vitamins?? Anything in any of those could be effecting her moods. Hope this helps a little. xx|`|Ve0Wl3QNaa	I'm not positive but take her to the doctors again lor take her to a counselor and tell them alll of the symptoms. The happy, the sad , and the mad. Maybe it is bipolar disorder which is fairly common. Also it could be autism. All of these are fairly common conditions. But don't take my word for it go to a counselor or get a second opinion from a doctor. Good luck!|`|Nyc2WH9Baa	go to a doctor. there is something called rapid cycling bipolar, when you have SEVERE mood swings, sometimes changes by month, sometimes week, sometimes even day or hour. this is a serious illness, please take her to a professional. good luck!|`|fb2f31dc5f32d93496e4794302dcf712aa	spend more time with her, as a family go out somewhere, camping, trips, hawaii, etc. Maybe she needs your attention, that is why she's doing it. Take a class together, plan something together, get to know her better.Let her know that you are there for her.|`|VEXKK1neaa	Ask other doctors. I've seen cases of thinks that aren't discovered until they go to 7 different doctors. Go to different doctors and psychiatrists and see what each of them say. Maybe you find anything out until you try different doctors.|`|ZgwmK14Aaa	I'd go talk to someone...a professional, and tell them all of this. Even if it costs money, I'm sure it's worth it. <br>  <br>  I don't think its normal...|`|7DhI2CWGaa	She sounds bi-polar to me. I suggest you get a new docor, this one isn't much help to you.|`|5EQdzWuUaa	she does drugs|`|93dSKaH9aa	honestly seek professional help immediately for her she sounds like shes bipolar or something worse or something might have been done to her and shes having a super bad time with it..take her to a mental hospital if need be you might not want to but it could help her alot and she may need the extra help right away...cuz she sounds like shes been tramatized by something or someone..just take her to a very good therapist that deals with her age group only and she might pull out of that but your right it dont sound normal at all...good luck
QKGuNLb4aa	it depends on the clinic you go to the amount of meds you need and if you have insurance that covers any of it. i had mine in texas and it cost me 9000 for the procedure and almost 3 for the meds.|`|GUlnV2oIaa	It depends on where you go but typical cost is 10,000- 15,000
YxcBk1uLaa	No, however, if that sort of thing worries you, you shouldn't be messing around.  one thing can very easilly lead to more things that could lead to sex and pregnancy.

Cx5Zo7IIaa	You may be having one, I'd go to the ER if it's accompanied by a fever, it could be a sign that not all of it has passed and you may be getting an infection from that. If it is this, it could be deadly; get yourself check out.|`|8RfmosODaa	With a miscarriage you would still get a positive pregnancy test. When I had my miscarriage I had no cramps but a good bit of bleeding. I don't think a fever is part of a miscarriage sign. You should go to the er to be sure you are fine!|`|XCazFZr9aa	If you were having a miscarriage this early in the pregnancy chances are you wouldn't even realize it. You should probably go to the doctor and see if something more serious isn't wrong. Those can be symptoms of an STD that needs to be treated and if you are having unprotected sex then your chances of contracting an STD are pretty high.|`|vJ97L5FHaa	It does not sound like a miscarriage. You may have some type of infection. You should see a doctor.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Probably not, miscarriages have grey matter in the blood, and no fever.|`|aIhTFmDUaa	I would defiantly say get yourself to the doctor...that doesn't sound normal...I hope everything is alright.|`|CnaPlbiIaa	sounds like you may have this:<br>  <br>  Hepatitis B <br>  Mild fever.

uGinKU6Baa	It's been three years as you have stated, to some Doctors you are only a number..but this has been the story of YOUR life, after investing tears and frustration..maybe you should consider investing a small trip to a neighbouring State in order to visit a Reproductive Endocrinologist which is basically a fertility specialist who would be able to put some pieces together for you and to shed some light.<br>  <br>  A Hysterosalpingogram might not be your answer..you might want to ask if it would be better to have a saline sonohysterogram preformed.<br>  <br>  Also check your progesterone levels to ensure that they are normal.<br>  <br>  Wishing you all of the best|`|Wzws8v8daa	i have irregular periods and i went to see a fertility specialist and he told me that almost all women with irregular periods are not ovulating on their own!! you have to be put on medication to force your body to ovuate.  my doctor put me on a medicine called Clomid.  since your gyno isn't helping, you should go see a fertility doctor.|`|1JbdCRdtaa	OK.... It's been 3 years (something I know all about) and now it's your time to figure out what the heck is going on!  The fact that your HSG didn't come out stinks but you should at least get a progesterone check to see if you are even ovulating! If I were you I would schedule a fertility appointment with your doctor ans just say "look, it's been 3 years, it's time to figure out whats going on with my body"  The longer you wait the longer it's going to take.  I have two boys thanks to clomid. I was having regular cycles but wasn't ovulating on my own. The clomid will help regulate your cycle. I wish you tons of luck!!!<br>  <br>  Hayley

When you hit him, he won't do it in your present but he will do it when you are not there.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yea im just fine with spanking, maybe a slap in the face for back talking, foul language, smacking hands for touching things they are not supposed to when they are little.<br>  <br>  Younger children spanking is the best form of punishment, since they are to young to know right from wrong, they associate the physical pain with something they are not supposed to be doing<br>  <br>  Older children, time outs, take things away, grounding, and spanking, slapping, smacking as a very last resort. Children should fear their parents to some point. Without fear there is no respect, fear is needed to keep the child in line. If they dont fear the parents they are more likely to misbehave, not listen, and walk all over you. Now we are talking about "spanking" not getting out the belt and beating the child until they are black and blue. I was "spanked" as a child, as well as beat and i was afraid of my parents when i did something wrong, because i knew i would get in trouble, and for that I was a very well behaved child and those were the words of my parents not mine.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	My mom slapped me and hit me when I was a kid and I turned out fine. Sure I can't stand her for things she says and does now...but its only recent. My dad never hit me, though. He was always the non-violent parent. I think my mom's words hurt me more than any of her slaps/smacks. <br>  So should parents hit their children? I don't think it's right. Parents need to show authority and be strict enough that their children won't do something really bad. But not strict as in beat their child and say extremely mean things. I think emotional abuse is worse than physical abuse. (only my opinion).<br>  But parents do need to be strict. I have seen children with extremely lenient parents and they are off the wall! and the parents don't say much.  In that case, the parents deserve beating.|`|prqrQcd1aa	some parents are completely against spanking<br>  <br>  some parents choose not to do it to their children, but do not judge others if they are not abusing<br>  <br>  Some parents are all for spanking, and use it often<br>  <br>  Some parents are just down right abusive..<br>  <br>  I'm somewhere in the middle..

Yes I have spanked my children and I was spanked as a child.  It IS NOT ABUSE to spank your child.  I know my sister works for DFS as a child abuse investigator and my brother in law is a attorney.  It is not abuse. Yes if you hit your child upside the head with a brush or something then they may take your child. BUT if you swat your child on the bottom then there is nothing wrong with that.  I only spank my children if they do something that can hurt them or someone else. Or if they act like they don't have any sense out in public. As you said there is a big difference between spanking a child and abusing a child.|`|un1TTKf1aa	parents have different methods , i dont think you could call it abuse.<br>  however i dont agree with it i dont think slapping a child is right and i think if anything it only encourages their bad behaiveour. i think a child needs to behave because they want to , therefore they must be tought to behaive not forced to by physical abuse.i think this in some cases this just leads to children resenting their parents.|`|pPKhVRXJaa	a sharp slap across a child's bottom is okay for unruly behavior. slapping a child's face or mouth is abuse.|`|EzOlEHsHaa	Yeah. I'm 15 though.<br>  I mean it's just like slapping their hand or spanking them. Some parents ground and take away, some parents spank and slap. It depends which parent you are. I think both aren't too bad.|`|Rp6rMDSeaa	My parents always spanked me with a paddle like they do at school. I don't think you should slap though because that is promoting violence.|`|Ptj0zw17aa	I don't think it's okay because it can go into abuse. First you're hitting a kid because they knocked off a vase, and then you're beating them. I mean not you personally but there are just some people that will submit to beating because they submitted to hitting. Some children can't take the hitting either. Everyone has different minds. People have to refer to parents as abusers for slapping their kids because it may be abusive to some children. No I don't consider it abuse to just spank a child. But if someone constantly does that to a child until they become stronger than the parent is, then that's just uncalled for. Find other ways to punish your kids. If society starts telling people that it's okay to hit your kid, well, then people will start hitting their kids. Some parents can't handle that and some kids can't handle that. Hitting children is just messing with everyone's minds. Just don't do it. It's not safe. It's sort of like how some people can become crack addicts because they try a little crack and some can't. Just don't try the crack at all. Okay maybe I should shut up now. But basically, don't screw up your child because you're screwed into no other way of punishment.|`|xp4mhkqgaa	I think there's far more effective ways to discipline your children, than smacking them.  <br>  <br>  I was punished in that way when I was growing up, and it didn't make any difference.  I wasn't a bad child, but smacking just made me resent my family.  They didn't take any time to speak to me, and didn't understand me, so we weren't close at all.  <br>  <br>  I bring my son up in a totally different way.  I never smack him.  The odd time that I need to punish him, I just take away his privileges.  I give him respect, therefore that's what I receive from him.  If there's problems, then we discuss them, and if I need to punish him I'll explain to him why he's receiving a punishment.  <br>  <br>  It takes a lot more patience, and consistency, but I believe that it works a lot better in the long run.  Smacking may be effective short term, in that they stop misbehaving immediately because they've been smacked, but most of the time they'll just resort to the same type of behaviour. <br>  <br>  So, even though it's not always abuse, I think it's just lazy parenting.
wWkfASTNaa	You may be showing some signs by now, it depends on when you ovulated, not necessarily when your period is due. The white goo is a normal discharge, most women get that at some time during their cycles, its sometimes a sign of impending ovulation, but also is a pregnancy sign in some. Since you are 17 days late, I would get a blood test to see why you are late, because if you arent pregnant it could be a cyst or something like that delaying your period. GL I hope you get the answers you are looking for.|`|taOckxHxaa	You can get some accurate pregnancy testing at a pregnancy resource center, which you can find by calling 1800395help.  They will also provide caring support.<br>  It seems that the worry over this is not worth it.

It can take a while for your HCG to grow and some time a HPT wont pick it up at all, If you period dose not start in a week go to the doctor and get a blood test done. <br>  <br>  Best thing to do is not stress it can make your period be even later! <br>  But good luck and god bless|`|5puE2Qfpaa	No-hun, you would only be like 4 weeks and you would not be showing.

But some people can get pregnant on the pill (so some people say). if you're worried about it that much then check w/ your doctor or take a test. Then again, it could all be in your head too.

It takes at least 3 days for the sperm to meet the egg, fertilize the egg and then for that egg to head towards the Uterus.  So you'd not even be pregnant at that point anyways. <br>  <br>  You have the stomach flu... or bulima...|`|cca9d24d24f2535c8254b1cc98778e08aa	You said u had sex while on your period....Now that's just disgusting you could have waited were you that hard up for some sex??

Chances are that you aren't pregnant but mainly because most women do not ovulate immediately after their cycle. It's usually 2 weeks before your period begins. Pregnancy occurs in the falopian tubes and it takes about 7 days for the egg to finish it's cycle through. Sperm can live for three days after sex. It is too hot for sperm inside a body, that is why a man's testicles are outside their body. So don't fret too much, be careful (just in case), wait for your next cycle, and drink plenty of water and cranberry juice. It could be a bladder infection. Women shouuld ALWAYS pee after sex to kill any bacteria, then go back and cuddle.LOL|`|6ae2f072d1aa4c5ad3b45f388352d5fbaa	No way, Jose!  Unless you're an alien.|`|AA10158430	no cuz u already ovulates.

What you may have in a urinary tract infection (UTI) or bladder infection though.... Go to a doctor & have them do a urine test. They will check for pregnancy & infection at this time|`|a49e5199d791fbe6243acd675c39141aaa	I doubt it.  I think it is in your head.  But take a test if you don't get your period.
30a0d8759ef625d25ea4af5d98d913e8aa	ok is been almost two months since your last period, if you had sex it is very possible that you are pregnant, on the other hand if  you have been stressing about school that could delay your period too. I think the best thing to do is go to the doctor, get a blood test done and find out if you are pregnant, if you are not pregnant then they should be able to tell you why your period is so irregular. Good Luck!|`|aace5a5d2e678289f56d60cfde135e4caa	I think if you don't want to have a baby you should use the pill and try some protective sex. If you have sex and you haven't got your period for that many months you should get tested by your doctor, and if the doc's test comes back  negative maybe you can get to the bottom of what is really wrong. Girl use protection or don't have sex it's your responsibility.|`|f2fec922ee37662faef3d8fb99443c68aa	I could be stress. You should take a pregnancy test at the doctors office and see if you get the same results.

Thats the best way to tell if you're pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have the most irregular cycles anyone could have.  My doctor put me on medication to regulate my cycle.  There are different medications you can take, depending on if you do/do not want to get pregnant.  Then you dont have to worry about missing a cycle.<br>  <br>  <br>  It could also be the stress.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8b4313f99ba73c4b6694760d558f57d2aa	home pregnancy test|`|AA10151003	It could be stress related.  Go to your doctor and have them run a test.  If you are you need to be under a doctors care.  If you are not, you need to find out what is going on.
41f3f511fdae8607c1e4c4ccb58ae109aa	When I started Met I had my period right away, and then skipped the next month, then had it again - so basically I've been getting it every other month.  But now, I havent had it for 3 months, and I think I'm pregnant (which is my goal :))<br>  <br>  See the link below for a great support site for women with PCOS and taking Metformin.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|49892371523f1ade581d5cc9691969f4aa	You may need to call your obgyn and talk to them about it.|`|AA10246911	Metformin doesn't always help with irregular periods it is use to counter act the insulin levels (insulin resistence) that accompanies pcos, you need to ask your Dr. about Provera this drug is used to enduce menstral cycles.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind you have only been on it for 3 weeks could take some time to get in your system completely, also your Dr. may need to adjust your dosage not sure how much you take but i do know they start you out at 500 mgs a day for a week then up to 500mgs twice a day some times more.<br>  <br>  Hang in there PCOS is extremely tough to handle, another suggestion i have is find chat groups etc. to join us pcosers find comfort in numbers.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless

The baby is not going away, if your b/f says he loves you and has given you no reason to believe otherwise then you are worrying about nothing. It is quite possible for him to love his child and Love you at the same time. I think what you are really worried about is will this cause him to get with the mother of his child. This is a possibility but if she is his ex there is probably a reason.|`|10c0de42f0817fc6eac72bed14281e42aa	he can love both. I mean what if this was your kid would you want him to choose?

a0b60bc1f58fe0b39411770a64af9342aa	You can only get preg if you are ovulating and it only last for 24 to 48 hours. After that the egg is then released and thats how you get a period. you might want to talk to gyn. and see about getting on something to make you regular. birth control pills help, but if you are trying to get preg then ask about something else. Three or four weeks ago you had a period, and you have another one thats pretty regular. every twenty-eight to thirty days you have a period.|`|894f46e8f885bd2c93a7a85b11a82562aa	When you have an irregular period, your ovulation days may vary causing it to be difficult to determine ovulation!! The best way to tell is to use an ovulation kit or to constantly have sex!! It's possible that you're ovulating or you were ovulating because ovulation usually takes place 10-14 days after the first day of your menstrual cycle! If you're irregular, your ovulation days may take a little longer!! The best way to determine if you're pregnant or not is to take a HPT in about a week or two or you can go to see your doctor and get your blood drawn for testing of the pregnancy hormone HCG which can be detected as early as 6 days after conception!!! It's hard to say, but you could have gotten pregnant! I would wait to see if you miss your period, but you could also take a test now if you wanted to, but prepare to take another one to be sure!!|`|41f3f511fdae8607c1e4c4ccb58ae109aa	You can still get pregnant.<br>  <br>  With an irregular cycle it is hard to tell when you actually ovulate.  If you are trying to conceive, there are several methods you can try to tell when you are ovulating, like montioring your temperature or using ovulation predictor kits.
69b9097a08427151c827aca92eda8e90aa	It really depends on your height, weight, and how you're carrying. Some women do show earlier then others. Every woman is different.<br>  You can start to show early with twins although that is not always true. At this early stage in pregnancy, even if it twins, the fetus(s) are very small. You may just be bloated, that does happen in pregnancy or you could be carrying up front, which may cause you to appear more pregnant sooner :)<br>   I started to show at 5 months when I was pregnant with twins, and by 7 months I looked like an overdue person pregnant with one. When I delivered at 37 1/2 weeks I was measuring 56 weeks :) Typically, with twins you really "pop" around 4-6 months <br>  <br>  If you are a Fraternal twin, then your chances of becoming pregnant with Fraternal twins does increase. If you are an identical twin, then your chances are just as likely as anyone elses.<br>  Only an ultrasound can tell you for sure whether you are carrying twins.<br>  Good luck!|`|1395112a68f48986d4e846c669c50e74aa	It really depends on your body type.  You may be right about being further along.  I got pregnant with my second child on our anniversary but I didn't find out that I was pregnant for 2 months because I had an irregular period the month after conception.  Being a twin yourself does up the chances of twins, however, I would wait for that Dr. visit.  <br>  You could also show earlier if this is not your first pregnancy.<br>  Good Luck, I hope this helped!|`|a1241cb26dc63250c2730aad0a5f495faa	i had friends who were pg w/ twins  and they showed early and were very bigggggggggg|`|41f3f511fdae8607c1e4c4ccb58ae109aa	My cousin is having twins - she is showing, buying maternity clothes, and is 7 weeks along

This usually isn't cause for concern.  If he can say words clearly without sounding like he has a speech impediment and he knows what you are saying (even though he doesn't repeat most of it) it shouldn't be a problem.  I mean, if he knows what you are talking about that means he is grasping it, right?  My daughter is 13 months and she already says about 20 words, but I've noticed that when I'm trying to teach her to say new words, she just moves her mouth without speaking.  I think I've figured it out...she is just trying to perfect the sound and the movement under her breath before she actually says something.<br>  <br>  If your son is saying 20 words, that's not bad.  If I were you, I'd follow your doctor's advise and see a speech therapist...but this is only to get a second opinion just in case.

AA10624857	This is actually a hard thing to answer as each baby is different.  If the baby is doing well, he/she may be released around their due date.  Some babies need to reach a certain weight before they are allowed to go home.  If there are health concerns, then the release date my hinge on when they are able to do a certain thing such as breathe on their own or be able to nurse from breast or bottle.  Each premature baby has a large team of doctors, nurses, specialists, and other health professionals that decide when he/she can go home.|`|AA11657209	It depends on how premature they are. My son was born at 34 weeks and didnt have to stay in the hospital. He came home with me when I left the hospital 2 days later. My cousin had her baby at 30 weeks and she stayed in the hospital for 3 weeks.|`|3af50cb1ceffef2000edc43fa4591f00aa	it's different with each hospital, but usually, assuming all health problems have been taken care of, the baby stays in the hospital until the due date, or until the baby reaches a certain weight.  the weight limit was 5 lbs when i had my daughter.|`|41f3f511fdae8607c1e4c4ccb58ae109aa	Usually until their original due date.|`|AA11203120	Noramlly until they are in the safe zone with their health. This is on an average around their original due date. But my cousins were born prematurely at week 30. Being that they were twins they were even smaller and the girl was in the hospital for about nine months after birth and the boy was in there for twn months but was discharged under the care of a 24 hour home nurse. He had a lot more medical problems then she did. They are now like 12 or 13 and they are the most normal kids even other then their scars from surgeries. <br>  <br>  So on an average around their original due dates.|`|f20f37f3cba2e13898e267d4d98c8aaaaa	Quite often they stay in until around their original due date.

EKiOQJj2aa	No. If you're already having your TRUE period, I don't think you can get pregnant. Remember, you are shedding the "placenta" as well as the unfertilized egg. The egg could not survive without a full uterine lining. You probably just had an irregularity in your period. Relax. There is a possiblity that if this was just small bleeding that's around your ovulation time, it might not be real menstruation. If you're, sure, though...

ujGq2YcHaa	The patch is actually the method that worked best for me.  The pill gave me migraines, and extreme nausea so that I was unable to take it for more than a couple months.<br>  <br>  Only downsides of the patch:<br>  <br>  - weird hot-flash / dizzy-hormonal sensation when you initially apply it each time (like, you may need to lay down periodically for the first day a fresh one is on).  I may also just be a bit sensitive...<br>  - gummy residue remains on your side, bum, tummy, or wherever you stick it<br>  - can sometimes come off while showering, etc. and you have to rush to the pharmacy to get a replacement patch<br>  <br>  I've been on the pill, the ring, the shot; and other than depo, the patch has had the least crazy-making hormones in it for me.  Most of the time I felt very level headed and well protected wearing it.|`|2WUKnRQyaa	Well i used the pill for about a year and just couldnt remember to take it on time, so after my 3rd child i decided to use the patch, it seemed easy enough and simple to use. well it was a BAD idea! i never had any probs with the pill, but about 2-3 months after being on the patch i developed a small blood clot in my intestines, which caused HUGE amounts of pain, as a result i was hospitalized for 4 days. please think about another kind of contraception, i do NOT reccomed  the patch! good luck!
jaP0TANdaa	Sounds promising! I had a similar situation yesterday... when I checked in the afternoon it was SUPER low, probably only half a finger before I could feel it (sorry if TMI) and I was pretty scared, it's never been that low and I thought for sure AF was coming. Then, I checked later and it was back up again (but not as high as you're describing). I asked a friend who is an RN and she said that it can vary throughout the day and if you do any activity or a lot of standing it can cause your cervix to drop lower. So, I was majorly bummed! I know you're not supposed to use your cervical position as a "sign", but I was hopeful for a minute. I hope for you that this IS a sign and you finally get your BFP! Good luck TTC Fairy and TONS of baby dust your way. Be sure to pass along some of that baby dust when you get your BFP and don't forget about us TTC'ers.|`|ikPKFCscaa	I have heard your cervix can move back down the day you start your cycle or even the day before that so don't get your hopes up.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	oh i hope so so little fairy lol xxxx<br>  <br>  i love ya and heres a massive amount of ust from me xxxxx***********************************... xxxxx lol.<br>  <br>  im not up 2 the whole cervix thing, may try it this month though xxxx|`|shKc7lZcaa	Yayyyyyy!!!!!

Her kids were young (like 10 years ago) and they wouldn't move from the TV and she needed to get going. She kept threatening this and that and all the sudden she said "That's it, I'll get papaw to come over with his belt." They looked at her shocked, tears in eyes and started shaking and said "What would you do with a belt, Mommy?" She said they were never so terrified and it was the first and last time she ever made an empty threat so bad. <br>  My sister actually DID get spanked with a belt when she was little and she said it hurts BAD. She actually would not have followed through with that. <br>  <br>  I think it's totally unnecessary.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	It's not wrong if you think it's ok to teach your child that violence solves a control/behavior issue and that said violence is ok coming from the person(s) that are supposed to love you unconditionally.  <br>  <br>  I don't agree with spanking of any kind and using a belt is way beyond a spanking with the hand.  That takes the abuse (and yeah it's abusive to do that to a kid don't care what anyone says) to another level.<br>  <br>  You can have well-behaved, mindful, respectful kids without hitting them into submission.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Whoa.. Yes, i think it's wrong and don't consider it to be in the same realm of spanking!|`|h59Bc4wfaa	My mom used a belt on me every chance she got (she also used race tracks, extension cords, coat hangers, shoes, and when I was older, her fists). I still have a scar on my leg from a belt buckle 22 years later. I grew up in the 80s and she was into all those 80s hair bands, so you can imagine the kind of buckle I'm talking about: HUGE. <br>  <br>  Because of this I will NEVER hit my child, even if it's not with a belt. I don't believe in hitting a child. I also learned in one of my psychology classes that corporal punishment is only effective, if at all, between the ages 2 through 5. Well I got to tell you, I didn't learn not to do things, all I learned was to be fearful of my mother...|`|e8yt5PrGaa	not unless you use it to abuse a child its not wrong|`|qES5f0tqaa	Well I will tell you what child protection said to me once. If you are going to spank. Make sure that it is on their bottom with your hand. Nothing else no other thing then the hand. And never ever use your hand any were else. Be careful in public there are people that don't know what is right then wrong. Also life is short remember you once were a kid always there are other ways to teach your kid from right or wrong. And remember they grow up fast. Some children when spanked will remember and you may pay latter with out them talking to you. Love and only love the right way talk first. If the kid is that bad get counseling . thanks and have a good day CHILDREN ARE A GIFT FROM GOD|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes it is wrong.  I consider that child abuse.  I have no problem with spanking a child, but hitting them with another object is wrong.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I wonder if the person who said it's not wrong would mind if their spouse or boss used a belt on them for punishment? Yes, I think it's wrong. I think my reason is pretty self-explanatory.|`|GpR5MI5raa	personally, i think its wrong. Even if you dont hit them with it, its still a from of pshycological abuse.|`|VY4LqfLpaa	I think it all depends on the situation.  Most of the time when I would get a spanking as a child it was with 1 of 3 things...flyflap (flyswatter), shoe (el-cheapo thing with a rubber so and cloth upper part from Wal-Mart), or hand.  On occasion (maybe 3-4 times growing up I got the belt...but that was when I was being completely stubborn and kept doing what I wasn't supposed to be doing.  I wouldn't break it out for the first spanking, but if it came down to it, yes, I would use the belt.  By far though, if the shoe came out I straightened up...the shoe hurt worse than anything else...|`|AA12145826	Once again, if you want to keep their pants up you MUST use a belt...or suspenders but those just look silly. I'm pro-belt myself...oh wait you're talking about in relationship to spanking.<br>  <br>  Honestly I've never been a fan of using an object other than the hand to spank a child, but that comes from the 2 times I can remember being made to go out and cut my own switch from the tree out behind our house. However, I know adults who will immediately correct their behavior at the sound of a belt clearing belt loops....so who knows. My MIL once broke a wooden spoon over my hubby's butt when he was little, not really sure if it got the point across but he still clearly remembers it. My personal belief is that as long as you are using an open hand (on a clothed bottom....I'm not even going to get into the nekkid bottom discussion), you will be able to refrain from hitting the child too hard because you will feel it in your hand (its also how I can be honest when I've said to Hannah "this hurts me just as much as it hurts you"). I welcome to criticism & thumbs down I'm about to get.|`|GEIRkfAeaa	It doesn't work as well as a cat of nine tails...|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Yes.  I think ANY kind of hitting a child is wrong.  How can you teach a child not to hit if you yourself are hitting them?  It is abuse to me and it is punishment, not discipline.  I just explained this in a question earlier.  Punishment is putting fear into the child and saying sternly, "NO.  BAD CHILD!"  But discipline is telling them what they did, explaining to them why it was wrong and teaching them about their mistakes therefore helping them to gain experience.<br>  <br>  Think about it...if the world worked on the premise that hitting was an effective learning tool for discipline, it would be kind of messed up.  You forgot to file your paperwork so your boss comes in, pulls down your pants and takes his belt to your butt.  It doesnt make sense in the adult world, why do some feel like it makes sense for children?  Is it just because they are smaller and helpess??  Maybe. I think it also has to do with the fact that parents dont know what else is effective and they lose their tempers.  there is never any excuse to hit a child, ever.  Or any other person for that matter.  I have not spanked my children in YEARS (I used to, and realized it was not working.)  and now i have rules that are set, boundaries that are not to be crossed and if they are, i do timeouts.  It is effective and constructive and i have very well behaved children.  yes, its a lot of work for me.  Multiple time outs per day, but its worth it knowing that i am teaching my children, helping them work through their feelings rather than just smacking their butts and telling them their feelings are wrong.<br>  <br>  Anyway, thats just my opinion.  While i can understand how most parents think spanking is effective, i disagree and i think the world could be a better place if parents could offer discipline instead of punishment.|`|67EaIAvbaa	yes it is..logic is better.|`|FLpMShKNaa	I'd say don't do it. My parents are good people, but my dad did use a belt on us when we were little and my sis and I still remember it 30 years later. Things have chnaged alot since then, not crapping on my folks, we turned out fine but I think it is too harsh for a child of any age.|`|nfzQkvqraa	Sorry I'm late.<br>  <br>  I think it's wrong.  I didn't even bother to read the other answers, because....well I read your question which pretty much summed it up. <br>  <br>  Yeah, belts are no good.  But then I don't like smacking or spanking either.  I actually don't like belts for anything.  My kids butt cracks still show when they have them on so they're useless to me.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	I dont think it is right at all. Yes kids should be spanked but use your hand if you think they need a spanking. My dad was spanked with a belt when he was a kid and it made him afraid of his father and he swore he would never use it on us. And he never did.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	I think using a belt is wrong.  I do spank my children when it's needed, however, I have never left a mark or really hurt them.  I really don't have to spank then anymore at all, I just ask if they want spanked:) that usually does the trick.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	to a certain extent it can be wrong...one good smack would be ok...belts are mainly used for threats.. my dad when i was younger always folder the felt over and snapped it.. that alone thought me a lesson. i only got spanked once with one.. that's all it took :) my two brothers, a whole diff story, its not wrong if its absolutely necessary. "im not usin the belt on my baby! noo way.."<br>  <br>  39 weeks and 5 days|`|QveBSjFSaa	I think so.<br>  What does it accomplish that a hand couldn't do, for those who are pro-spanking?<br>  Myself, I've never understood the significance of the wooden spoon, the belt, a tree switch, etc. A smack on the bum is a smack on the bum.<br>  ~EDIT~ I'm a hippy, too then!|`|B82wuWx8aa	it is. it is used as a negative force to influence children. like, you stop running or i'll belt you.<br>  <br>  <br>  many things can be used to be a negative force. andi find a belt to be a little to extreme to be one.|`|JwnHKTabaa	I think it's terrible...I mean, seriously? Spanking is okay...in the WORST of a situation.<br>  <br>  But a belt? That's child abuse.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	In Canada it's considered child abuse and your child can be removed from the home if you use any object to hit your children. <br>  <br>  I agree with the law.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	that should be classified as abuse really using anything other then ur hand is abuse in my opinion|`|caPFpkqSaa	I think using a seat belt on a child is absolutely wrong|`|TcMa4a7paa	Yes, it is wrong.  There is a huge difference between using your hand to spank a child on their rear end and using a belt.  When you use your hand, you: <br>  (a) know where it is going to land<br>  (b) know how hard you are spanking because you can feel it.<br>  <br>  When a belt is used, you:<br>  (a) have less control of where the belt will land on the child because of the large range of motion.<br>  (b) can wind up hitting way too hard, especially if you are angry, because you cannot feel the pain.<br>  <br>  .|`|91RnlgScaa	NEVER USE A BELT!!! never use a belt to smack a child i am not a parent but never even smack a child i would get down to your child's level and speak in a calm but firm voice to let them no that what there doing is wrong not that they are wrong. how old is your child? if your child is old enough to no right from wrong then they should be reminded again or if there a teenager then you should possibly ground them? or confiscate a toy? <br>  <br>  hope this helps but NEVER HURT A CHILD! social services may visit and take your child off you..don't let it come to that!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	My opinion is that, yes it is wrong.|`|sxsx9sHNaa	a belt is wrong.  its too much for anybody.  and its child abuse.  A child is a blessing from God to be protected and cherished, and after all is only a child.  Children make mistakes, make us furious, make us laugh, make us cry.  hazards of the game.|`|yKS2UI87aa	You betcha it's wrong. Open handed spank only on rear end. --and that only works until a certain age. Then it's easier to restrict privleges|`|64f9613dd1a4452e24f6f8f603fab217aa	YES, it is abuse, and very very wrong,|`|JivuAmfiaa	Yes very, my view is that if you hurt your child, your child will hurt other people. Belts were made to hold up trousers, not to hit children.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	YES it is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Nothing in my mind will ever make it right and that's my opinion. If someone wants to use a belt on their child then they can but they should expect cps to be called if they are caught. Just saying.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Yes, in my opinion it is.<br>  <br>  I was spanked w/ a belt as a child and can tell you it was not effective.  That said, I don't feel that I was ever abused.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Yay, I'm a hippy too!!<br>  <br>  Using something to hit your child seems wrong to me...|`|723QHuicaa	Its child abuse and assault with a weapon.<br>  <br>  If I were to go out, take off my belt and start hitting someone with it because I didnt like something they done - I would be arrested and charged.<br>  <br>  Capital / Physical punishment is not the way to go when disciplining. How can I possibly make my child understand that its ok for me to hit her, but its not ok for her to hit hit someone in her toddler group, or at the pool.<br>  <br>  Its lazy parenting and its hypocritical.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	When I see the friends I grew up with. One of the first things they talk about is on those warm summer nights. With all the windows in the house open. Just around suppertime. Almost every night. Is the slap sound of the belt echoing through the neighborhood followed by my wail.<br>   What do you think my opinion is?|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	It's OK to use a belt to help a kid hold his pants up.  Or to help him build a fort.  Or to let him pretend his stuffed animal has a collar and leash.  <br>  <br>  It's not OK to hit anyone for any reason besides self-defense.
pXSKSS3daa	Growth spurt? Teething? Is he learning anything new such as crawling, sitting, or cruising?<br>  <br>  Those are reasons why my son wakes at night when he normally does NOT. It usually only lasts 3-4 weeks at the most and then he's back to sleeping through.<br>  <br>  Also, if he sleeps with you, have you tried him out in his own crib? You certainly don't HAVE to but I'm just trying to think of options to help out.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	it could possibly be teething? is he drooling? red cheeks etc. maybe intrduce an extra meal or bottle during the day only as giving him at night might be making him uncomfortable.|`|Ka52nbhNaa	My son is 6 months old and just started doing the same thing . . . we think it he is teething.  The Hyland Teething Tablets seem to be working for us - he is still stirring every few hours but we went from every hour to every 4 hours.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this will pass soon so we can all get some more sleep!|`|83nHy2PXaa	it could be different things:<br>  teething - may take up to 1-2 weeks which last forever and drive you crazy, the baby is cranky during both day and night.<br>  new milestone - makes him very excited and having trouble to fall asleep on his own<br>  some illnes, like ear infection, allergy, etc - try to consult with your pediatrician<br>  try a night time routine<br>  We had the same issue, although our son was sleeping through the night in his own crib since he was 3 months old (and I do breastfeed him), but started to wake up around 5.5-6 months<br>  We used this book:<br>   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Solve-Your-Childs-Sleep-Problems/dp/0743201639/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235588575&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Solve-Your-Childs-...</a><br>  it worked miracles when he was around 7 months old. Even if you are against the "cry-it-out" method, I would still recommend to read it to get an idea of sleep cycles in baby.<br>  Good luck!|`|AA11100991	Around 6 months, sometimes sooner or later, teething sets in. A baby that might have slept through the night before becomes restless. It stems from the discomfort but could also be from congestion. I would ask his doctor if there is anything you can do to soothe him and encourage him to sleep. It's not a fun stage, but eventually, the teeth do pop through and the child will sleep better. Still, find out what his doctor suggests. It could be that he is developing an ear infection, which could also make him restless at night due to the pressure in the ears when he is lying down.

Her bottles must all be grouped accordingly---in the same place in the cabinet, with large bottles together, small bottles together, sippy cups in the back, glass bottles on right, plastic left etc. also, this is kind of neurotic, but whenever i strap her in her carseat, i ALWAYS look back again at her when i get in the driver's seat to make sure shes still strapped tightly in. <br>  <br>  as far as food goes, i cannot drink milk with any food. I like milk alone, just not with food, idk why. and i HATE water and only drink it when there's nothing else terrible i know. i can't have eggs without orange juice, no other kind of juice, and food like hotdog etc i must have with pepsi or coke (unhealthy to go with unhealthy lol which isn't too often thankfully).|`|cYRZpGkqaa	When eating multicolored food, I won't eat it unless I can separate it by color first... ex- M&Ms, Froot Loops, I know they all taste the same, but I have to eat certain colors first. <br>  Another one is that when I eat raviolis, I take out the insides and put them to the side and eat that part last. I do the same things with pierogies.<br>  And when it comes to eating a meal, I have to finish one food before I start another. And my food cannot touch.

She would need to be shaken so hard that her head just flops around during the shaking. Afterwards, she would most likely lose consciousness, start vomiting, have dilated pupils, etc. If you are concerned with your MIL playing with your daughter like that, tell her that you don't allow rough play like that and would prefer you find another way for her to interact with your daughter.

If these symptoms are more severe, meningitis may be suspected.<br>  <br>  Severe symptoms<br>  In the most severe cases, a child loses consciousness or stops breathing right after being shaken or thrown. The caregiver may attempt to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and later claim that the CPR caused the child's injuries. The caregiver responsible for the abuse may put the child to bed, hoping the condition will improve after the child rests. By the time the caregiver seeks medical attention, the child may be comatose and unable to suck, swallow, smile, make sounds, or follow the movement of an object with his or her eyes. The child may also have great difficulty breathing or may completely stop breathing, have a slow heart rate, and require CPR. These children usually either die or have long-lasting problems from severe brain injury.1<br>  <br>  Other symptoms<br>  Bleeding inside one or both eyes is a common symptom of shaken baby syndrome that can be detected by a pediatric eye specialist (ophthalmologist). Also, a child may have broken bones, often in the ribs or arms and legs, from violent shaking. Sometimes a child will have signs of other types of physical abuse, such as bruises or burns.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are at all concerned after reading these symptoms get her into your pediatrician right away! If that is not possible take her to the emergency room. and tell your mother in law to abide by YOUR rules! You are the mommy now, not her.|`|CbkQEek4aa	That sort of play (especially with a 16 month old) would not give her shaken baby syndrome. Absolutely not. Your MIL is right, she's absolutely fine. You would have to physically pick her up and violently shake her. She's fine.|`|PeEIuzP5aa	I would take her to your dr. and explain what happen.
qdFrJ21waa	My husband does the same thing! Like when the moment is all passionate he wont use a condom or anything and says everything would be fine if we had a baby...but then when I ask him about having  a baby, he'll say "not right now". So I asked him what is the difference if we make a baby in the "heat of the moment" or during a not so passionate session....either way we end up with a baby right? So, I don't know what their deal is...one day he'll go for it and the next day he'll say we aren't ready. My guess is they're just slightly behind us in wanting it so bad and they need more time to adjust...who knows....men!<br>  <br>  <br>  For some reason he seems ok with it if it just happens...like it was meant to be or something...but he doesn't actually want to actively try because it would really mean it was going to happen and he's probably a bit scared, and tell me yes we can have a baby, is the same as trying.|`|XXZFf1AYaa	Guys are very weird sometimes when it comes to this stuff. Have a talk with him about it, and yes, one would think that if a man chooses to not use a condom and knows that you are off and on with bc pills that there's a chance he'd get you pregnant. But no, never assume when it comes to communication with a man.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	The main problem with all of this is lack of communication. <br>  Yes it seems like he wanted to have a baby, but you can't know for sure if you didn't discuss it with him. He probably wants to be married and THEN try for one, which is completely normal. But I don't like how he said "we're not going to try and have a baby", he just decided that and didn't even want to discuss it? You HAVE to talk to him and find out his reasons, because what if he never wants kids? That's something you have to know before you get married. Otherwise, if his reason is "We need to be married first" then you should drop it, because he's right.|`|d7bJIgqlaa	Yes, I would have thought the same thing.  Did you ask him why he suddenly stopped using one?  I understand where you are coming from.  I was ready before my husband.  It wasn't until his friend and his wife got pregnant that he would even really talk about it.  We are going to start trying in April, but it's a different feeling for him than it is to me.  I drug him down the baby isle in Target last night to get him in the mood.  hahaha!<br>  <br>  It is really hard when you aren't on the same page.  You two should sit down and at least get a timeline for when to try.  Then, you have something to look forward to and he won't be getting nagged about when.  :)  I hope he changes his mind soon!|`|LY2LSzPJaa	I would think that to. <br>  I think deep down he wants a baby , that is why he stopped the condoms , but he is also scared and thinking about to hard. <br>  Keep discussing it with him , tell him your side of it and make him respond with a REAL answer , and not just "not right now" <br>  say why? we are financially stable? I am ready to be a mom! stuff like that. <br>  Like I said he wants a baby , just when brought up he is scared|`|s5l6D5Sfaa	He's probably just scared.  My husband goes through stages.  He'll say he wants a baby, but then he'll tell his friends he's not ready for one.  I got tired of him going back and forth on telling me one thing (and he stopped using condoms and I'm not on anything either so I assumed we were both on the same page too) and then telling his friend another.  I sat him down and we had a heart to heart and he decided that "he wants to try but not try"  which in his words means just what you said, doing nothing to prevent it but not taking temps and such.  Obviously being a woman who so desperately wants a child I'm trying to do everything I can.  I did not want to be one of those people that trick their significant other into having a baby so I was always completely honest with him up front on when I was and was not taking my pills.  Now I think I may be pregnant and he couldn't be more thrilled.  He said it came down to the fact that he was just scared out of his mind because it was something neither one of us had expeirenced before.  I admit, being completely responsible for a child does seem scary so I can see where he was coming from.  I'd suggest sitting him down to have a true heart to heart.  Sorry for rambling on.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	yea it would make me think he wanted a baby. you should ask him why he stopped using the condoms and let him know that you are confused.|`|kT7GVOosaa	that is what I would think but respect his wishes. if you try to get pregnant behind his back it could put a huge hole between the two of you. just talk about it often and try to understand his opinion for why he doesn't want a baby.
ZM9dPpENaa	I've never had a child before but my best friend has, she found out the sex and was really disappointed afterwards.<br>  It was the excitement of not knowing, and it gave her something to look forward to.<br>  <br>  Of course there are upsides, you can let people know (a granny knitting a jumper etc :D) oh and fo the nursery/clothes/toys and stuff, either 'girly' or 'boyie' :)<br>  <br>  Oh and congratulations!<br>  <br>  Good luck, Meerkat x|`|4kX61Y97aa	last friday i asked and im having a boy its made things more realistic and no it hasnt ruined it i couldnt wait another 20 weeks to find out lol its your personal if your having second thoughts then reconsider. but personaly finding out asnt ruined it for me i now can get blue things instead of just plain. if you wanna keep it old fashioned then dont find out<br>  <br>  all the best<br>  x|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Its up to you! If you are one of those types of people that doesn't need to plan ahead and wouldn't mind having others buy you clothes all in yellow or green, then wait & be surprised.|`|o2ehEqinaa	I can only speak through my personal experience.  My husband and I decided to find out the gender and are SO happy we did!  From that point on, we were able to call the baby from an "it" to a "she".  It helped narrow down the names and decorate the nursery.  It made selecting items for our registry easy and my baby shower was pink and purple.  It was beautiful.  My husband was hesitant in finding out at first but admits that he's so glad we found out because, for him, it became more real.  There is so much to prepare for in having a baby and finding out the gender and selecting colors made it easier for us.  Now we can concentrate on more important things to prepare for like labor/delivery, vaccinations, child care, pediatricians, and whatnot.  Ultimately though, it's your own personal choice and you should decide either way based on your comfort level and how your personality is.  For me, I need to plan ahead and be organized so finding out was in my personality.  I'm leaving the actual labor/delivery for the "surprise" since it's so unpredictable.  Good Luck in whatever you choose. - Congratulations!|`|AA11626766	I didn't know with my first child and was surprised.  I wanted a girl at that point, but had it in my head that I was having a boy.  She was a girl and it was a lovely surprise.  For my second child, I really didn't mind as I'd had a little girl and would also like a boy... so I had the test - another girl.  It gave me the chance to prepare for her properly - making sure that I had the right colours, etc!  To be honest, I'd say to you, if you really don't have any preference, it's a nice surprise!  If you're set on one or the other, I'd have the test as it's a chance to get your head around the idea if it's not what you're expecting!!  However, I do feel that having the test made me KNOW my second daughter earlier.  She became a person at that point.  I could give her a name and she became very real!|`|tecPZUq2aa	Well Its Either Going To Be A Little Boy Or A Little Girl, So It's Not Going To Be Much Of A Surprise Lol.<br>  If Your Want To Find Out Go Ahead I Would! Because If You Don't Then You Might Regret It For The Next 20 Weeks!<br>  <br>  Haha.<br>  Good Luck ! X =]|`|em8A42Bqaa	It made it more exciting for me, it was finally real.  She has a name, and I can buy things now.  It's exciting to find out!|`|xY1kohVRaa	I have a scan in about 2 weeks and i've decided i'm going to find out - i was like you at first, i actually asked the same question but i've decided to find out as it is my first child and lets be hoenst, i've never had a baby before so i'm VERY excited and new to everything, i think finding out will help my nerves and remind me what is coming at the end of this as me and my husband are going through a rough patch because of the baby and he no longer wants a baby! Stupid men.<br>  <br>  But i personally think it will help me bond with the baby more :)<br>  <br>  Its up to you though, i think if i could hold out i probably would but i know i'd ask the sex at the last minute anyway!|`|rC6gL7KOaa	It didn't spoil it for us. It made my husband and I even more excited. We could finally settle on a name and I'm going to start decorating her room this weekend. It feels good to finally be able to refer to my baby as "her" instead of "it". It depends on the person though. Some people don't want to know the sex and want to be surprised when the baby is born. It's up to you though.|`|758cDKEFaa	i found out last time round.<br>  for me it didnt spoil things it made me that little bit closer to my baby like i was getting to know more about him and everyone stopped called my baby 'it' which i hated.<br>  it also makes it seem more real and you can buy exciting colours and more colours.<br>  i could buy blue things, prepare his room properly for his first day home, i didnt have to pick out two names and it was just as much of a surprise at the scan as it was when he was born|`|V8JoRHnnaa	i am still TTC but right now i think that when i get pregnant i'll keep it a surprise and choose some neutral colour for my baby like peach, baige or maybe green. The feeling that u can experience, imagine u r in the labour room and then u know what u have, its amazing but my husband is like noo we'll know it before. soo lets see  what we go for but for me right now surprise would be fun :)<br>  Best of luck|`|A68od1sbaa	i find out what im having in 3 weeks and i cant wait!!<br>  at least then i will only have to think of a boy or girls name and not stress over both names. lol<br>  and i'm not going to be limited on the colours to choose. <br>  part of me wants to keep it a surprise but right now i really wanna know if im carrying a little boy or a little girl!|`|79eRDIbXaa	No either way as long as the baby was healthy was all that mattered not the sex!<br>  But when you know the sex it brings you so much closer to them I personally think. She is now my daughter and not just my baby!<br>  Hehe I love her so much and its so exciting shopping when you know too. Good Luck xxx|`|7fh3JCVxaa	my mom found out, and it didnt spoil it at all, we spent the time picking a name and getting the right decorations, it was so fun :)x|`|AA11593134	I guess it is up to you... For me, I would want to know. So I can be ready -- the crib, the baby clothes, etc... before the baby comes.|`|RizlnGVYaa	I never found out i what i was having<br>  and every one guessing was fun<br>  my family thought it was a boy & bf's family thought a girl<br>  every one guessed even at doctors and hospitals and most said boy, but they were wrong she was a girl!<br>  it was fustrating right at the end because i wanted to know,<br>  i just brought white and neutral colours, and chose a boy and a girls name..<br>  but when i gave birth everyone wanted to know what id had, and were all as excited as me when i went into labour!  and i was happy after it all that i kept it a suprise because when she came out i was soo happy, when i first saw her i thought she was a boy and my bf said its a girl! it was so exciting! =] xxx|`|185431bf2d462938a17318fe8510b2c0aa	personally i think having a surprise is the best thing,<br>  i didn't find out the sex when we had out twenty week scan<br>  im 35wks and 5 days now<br>  Its the best decision i have made as  its making it so much more exciting for me my partner friends and family.<br>  And not knowing makes giving birth a bit less scary.<br>  I know loads of people who have found out and its not so exciting when they give birth.<br>  The only disadvantage of not knowing is buying clothes for a boy or girl .<br>  we decorated the nursery in neutral colours,which wasn't a problem.<br>  But when he/she is born friends and family said they cant wait to buy baby clothes!!|`|FfGHHhqBaa	i found out the gender with both of mine because i wanted to know if i needed a pink or a blue car seat if you don't care about your baby items being gender neutral for a while then wait, i couldn't do it... lol|`|rsWO3Xl0aa	Well sweetie. It is really up to you x When I had my baby girl, it didn't spoil anything finding out the gender, so it is really up to you. x<br>  Congratulations BTW x|`|gePSDmu5aa	it depends? i would want to no because of buying things etc...but i do think a surprise is nice... i just hate surprises and like to no...that's if i no im getting a surprise ha ha

fHjSonssaa	I'm 28 years old and a parent myself (to an 11 month old).  <br>  <br>  At 12 years old, I went to over to "boys" homes all the time- we were friends and they usually lived within biking distance.  I always told my parents where I was, and they never had a problem with it.  I was a trust-worthy individual.  <br>  but<br>  It was at 15 years old that my dad got a little more protective.  I had a "boyfriend" as a sophmore in highschool and was allowed to over to his house.  <br>  <br>  Personally, if you're husband becomes too over-bearing, you're practically asking for your daughter to start to do things (I don't mean sex)- go places behind your back, without permission.  That's not to say she will that for sure, but the situation would more more primed to do so.<br>  <br>  I think it's great that your daughter wants a purity ring.  Maybe that's her way of showing you guys how responsible she it, and therefore would like persmission to just be in the company of the other sex.  You cannot always assume kids want to hang-out to have sex.  That's ridiculous.  I have always had a lot of male friends and am certainly NOT a promiscuos (sp) person- nor was I was when I was younger.  I never did have sex with my boyfriend from when I was 15 years old- and we were dating for 1-1/2 years.<br>  <br>  I think you should learn to trust your daughter- and give her permission to play a game, hang-out etc with members of the opposite sex.<br>  <br>  If your daughter is telling you she wants a promise ring, I think it would make for a much healthier relationship with your child if you (your husband) trusted her a little more.<br>  <br>  She obviously did not think it was a big deal when she asked your husband for permission- she didn't mention the fact it was a boy at first- but then didn't hide it from him either.  That to me says she's looking at this kid like any other friend- <br>  <br>  I would talk to yur husband.  I think being TOO strict with kids is asking for trouble.<br>  <br>  I was mild mannered as a kid- and my parents were protective, but not over protective.  <br>  <br>  It keeps the lines of communication open between child and parent- which is ALWAYS a big plus.|`|qES5f0tqaa	12 years old to be going some were is wrong if there were a bunch of friends yes. If the parent was there all the time watching the kids yes. But really start to listen to your husband he knows right come on I don't care if you go to church or not. Hormones grow and things happen don't risk anything they will grow up fast effort thanks|`|JsqMSU9Haa	if your daughter is going to choose to be sexually active or things like that, you cannot stop her.  he can do it in school, sneak out at night, on the way home from school, seriously, there are many options for kids.  the only option you have is to teach her to respect her body and things like that.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I wouldn't let my 12yr old son/daughter go to anyone's house who's parents I did not know or who did not know me, to know if we were of like minds when it comes to children. My kid oldest kid is 10 but even if he were 14 I would still feel this way. The only places my son goes, other than family, is to a friend's house that he knows from school. I know the boy's parents and although I have never actually been to the house, I know the parents well enough to know that my son wouldn't be in any danger and that they would monitor my son the same way I would monitor their son at my house. <br>  <br>  Therefore, I would've let my child go. At 12, it isn't likely that either your daughter or the boy would've had anything in mind but playing games. I do know kids that age who experiment with kissing or rubbing or things like that but if you know your children, you know if they're ready for something like that. I know that my son is not so it would not cause me worry for him to be at a girl's house. He's not yet into girls like that so he wouldn't be trying to sneak off somewhere and do something. My daughter is only 5mo but I would feel the same way about her at a boy's house at your daughter's age. You have to trust that if you have good kids, they'll do the right thing. That's how they learn to independently make good decisions.|`|TcMa4a7paa	I would base the decision on how well I knew the boy's parents, and if they will be home while they are playing.  If I knew the parents well, felt they held the same standards at their home as I do in mine, and knew they would be home, I might consider it.  But the door to the room where they will be playing must remain open.<br>  However, I can completely understand why a dad does not want his daughter going to a boy's home at any age!  :o)|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Your husband is being a little too protective but maybe you could have cut your call short and called the boys house and let the parents know that she wanted to stop by to play video games with their son. Sometimes a little communication is all it takes to let them know you have your eyes and ears open.|`|yKS2UI87aa	I would have let her go IF one of the boy's parents was going to be home and supervising. Home does not always mean supervised. I have mixed feelings on the purity ring, while if the teen wants it it's good (however, they can still change their mind) If forced to get it then it does not do much good.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	I would trust my husband's judgement, this time, and be glad he cares. :) I would probably talk to him about it, though, when daughter wasn't around... I had plenty of guy friends, growing up, and never once did it cross the line! (Although, there were a couple of times when it *could* have, as an older teenager.)<br>  <br>  I agree with another poster, about being okay with it, if the parents are right there... Why not call his parents, and find out? <br>  <br>  Also, though it's just a few houses down, I'd have her call, when she gets there, and when she's about to leave... I may be a bit paranoid, but there have been plenty of cases where 'just a few houses down' amounted to a missing kid.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	When I was 12, my girlfriend and I went to a boy's house after school to hang out. The boy took my girlfriend in the basement and fingerbanged her (sorry for the graphic language). She welcomed it, and she was one of the most innocent girls in our school.<br>  <br>  If that boy wants to hang out with your daughter that badly, have him bring his game to your house and play there when one of you are home.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	It doesn't matter what you believe your daughter is highly committed to. Don't let her be put in a possible situation.
qStmw7qgaa	I used to sell these when I was working for a health food store.  The reason that he is falling asleep is because yes, he is no longer in pain, but the other reason is because there is chamomile in it, which is supposed to help people relax and help them go to sleep.  It wont hurt your baby and I promise you aren't drugging him.  :-)  They do work wonders!  I love that brand of baby items.  :-)|`|ae5106e0ddfd7ecb434859ce61fcdd18aa	Keep using the tablets. My son's doctor recommended them. She told us NOT to use the Orajel.|`|PeEIuzP5aa	why would you use tablets? in stead of teething gel that worked for both of mine.|`|JgZwvXXJaa	there are no drugs in those tablets!! They are homeopathic medication.
w5y4BTjkaa	They are all so CUTE!<br>  <br>  My favorite boy name EVER is Tristan, so I gave Tristan Riley Brown a big thumbs up. I also liked:<br>  <br>  Austin Conley Brown--I love this name! 2nd fave!<br>  Tatum Alaina Brown--my favorite girl name on the list! Great choice!<br>  Lillian Emily Brown--It sounds so sweet and beautiful. I really like it!<br>  and<br>  Bailey Marie Brown--I really like this name and Bailey sounds so unique and cute. I love it!<br>  <br>  Just one suggestion for a boy and girl is:<br>  Teegan-Rose (girl)<br>  Logan Reese (boy)<br>  <br>  For a brother and sister I think Tristan Riley Brown and Tatum Alaina Brown sound adorable together! The both start with the letter T and they are both two syllables. I also like Tristan Riley and Teegan-Rose if you like that name! Hope I helped and good luck!<br>  <br>  Always,<br>  (-:Tabbykinz:-)<br>  <br>  P.S. I just had a thought! What about Tatum Rhiannon Brown? This way, both Tritstan Riley and Tatum Rhiannon have their middle names starting with the same letter. Also, I wasn't a big fan of Alaina, but you made it sound nice with the nameTatum.|`|UJHKyg7kaa	I will put them in order from best to worst<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  <br>  Tristan Riley - 9<br>  Sebastian Jacob-9<br>  Austin Conley- I really dont like this name, the others are very good-0<br>  <br>  Girls:<br>  <br>  Bailey Marie -9<br>  Lillian Taylor- 8<br>  Alaina Tatum- 7<br>  Lillian Emily- 5<br>  Tatum Alaina- 2<br>  <br>  Tristan and Bailey<br>  Sebastian and Lily (nick name)|`|1dEAWAUMaa	My favorite boy name is Tristan Riley Brown<br>  My favorite girl name is Lillian Taylor Brown<br>  <br>  I think those sound the best as brother and sister, too =]|`|pDrdCRQcaa	I do not like any of the names unless you change it up.

zBz10IiOaa	i wish i was like you lol with my first pregnancy i got em at 20 weeks after i had my son they went away :) so yes they go away hun<br>  and with me being 6 months know i have had em since 4 months ugh but i don't have that many and there not dark! but yes they will go away it might take a few months but yea hun they will don't worry just know what caused them strech marks is the best thing in the world|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	You can't get away from stretchmarks no matter how much cocoa butter you use.  They do fade to a silverish color once the pregnancy is over though.  I got them early right around my hips with my first and I am 27 weeks pregnant with my second and they still haven't turned bright red yet and crossing my fingers that they don't.|`|DLDweOcYaa	With my 1st pregnancy I didn't get any stretch marks until I was about 32 weeks.  With this pregnancy I haven't got any new ones.  You can never get rid of stretch marks but they do fade with time.|`|sEihaeLNaa	it doesnt look bad, but the only thing is that you cant get rid of them. they will turn white after pregnancy but those you cant get rid of.|`|P7tue78Aaa	It doesn't look bad. I don't have stretch marks yet but I have a feeling I am going to get them. My doctor told me that people are more predisposed for them. My doctor also told me that the best thing you can do is gain weight at a slow and steady pace. I don't know if that's reasonable though... After your pregnancy is over ask your doctor about Retin-A because it's supposed to be good for stretch marks.|`|EzuYExM4aa	My body is prone to stretch marks so I know that I am capable of getting them ( I have a few on my legs and back from my teen years).  BUT I have been using curel pregnancy lotion and I am almost 28 weeks and not one stretch mark from pregnancy.  I just make sure my belly and legs are caked with lotion every morning and so far so good.|`|AA11542929	i just noticed i got some maybe at 31 weeks and on my tatas i just noticed them maybe a week after.. .i used palmers stretch marck cream with that prego lady on it. as long as they red they say u can still get rid them..  idont know tho all i know is that i can only see them on my sides.. and i got like 4 on one side 3 on the other and well my tatas.. lets not go there.. but try that cream.. its a cocoa butter type one and it works cause i havent found many more since i used it..<br>  <br>  <br>  btw i just looked at them there not bad at all.. if thats all u got right now at this time of the pregnancy then bless urself.. i know someone who was 2 months and had them and still to this day she is 5 months and has them reall bad|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	the only way to completely get rid of them is through surgery...But creams can make them less visible and time will allow them to fade but sadly there is no miracle cream that will make them go away...But try not to worry about it too much just because your body changes doesn't mean that your husband will find you less attractive...My hubby says he likes my post baby curves..Wider hips and larger breast! ha ha|`|euUZZcM3aa	Awww my little girl is due june 8th also! =]<br>  <br>  Well there's not much you can do about them. They don't look too bad to begin with. Some women get them and some don't, and lotion doesn't neccessarily keep them away. Just think of them as trophy marks for going through such an amazing journey to make your precious angel =] congrats and good luck!

DCKOlH13aa	It sounds like the cramping you had could have been implantation. Implantation usually occurs approximately 6 - 10 dpo. I was where you are last week. My cervix too felt different about the same time in my cycle. I was confused as well because I had ovulated the week before. I am now late and waiting each day hoping for a BFP. Good luck and lots of baby dust.|`|Gn4iNKPSaa	sounds like ovulation.
Ldvi6UPOaa	I love this book!!!! I haven't gotten pregnant yet (beacause I have PCOS and am taking Clomid & Metformin to help with ovulation) but this book has information on every part female reproductive anantomy. It even has information on Clomid, Metformin and other ovulation drugs. It teaches you natural birth control, and how you can choose the sex of your baby.<br>  <br>  It's a great tool to have. I got mine new on amazon.com for about $25. It also comes with a cd software for charting but I don't use that since I'm charting on fertilityfriend.|`|kLQ6J4QKaa	I bought the book and it has helped me understand my body and everything it goes through during my monthly cycle.

Good Luck!|`|VHHis05Naa	Have it on my book shelf and swear by it for getting pregnant AND avoiding pregnancy.  Every woman needs this book!
84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	Some people here have already said it, move out!!<br>  Although I know from experience it is easier said than done. If you wanna talk, contact me!|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Even if it’s only next door, you need to try and do something about this. For you and your son’s sake. <br>  <br>  My father was emotionally/verbally abusive to my mother, my sister and myself. That’s just how we grew up. Constant yelling, belittling, and making us feel like we were nothing. Luckily, we had each other and we stuck together during all those horrible times. <br>  <br>  It took my mother 21 years to leave my father. I wish she could have had the strength to do it sooner. Because man oh man, I don’t ever forget how my father treated us or the things he’d say and do. I’m now 26 yrs old and I will never forget those things. I don’t hate my mother for it, I respect her for finally leaving, but I just wish I didn’t have “those” memories. <br>  <br>  So you’re doing the right thing. Worry about the details later and just leave. But do so properly, (legally) and meet with a lawyer FIRST because you have a child. Just cover your *** basically. Because the last thing you need is for anything to bite you in the *** later down the road regarding your child. <br>  <br>  I think you need to go to Mom’s house. It doesn’t matter where she lives. You and your son matter most and if you can prevent that little boy from living ONE more day with a mentally abusive Dad, then please do so!<br>  <br>  ** ADD **<br>  I don’t think it’s as simple as just “kicking him out’ with it being your parents property. Do you pay rent? Do you have a “lease” or anything? Because regardless, there are laws in place to prevent people from being unfairly evicted. I’m NOT saying he doesn’t deserve to get the boot, just saying you guys need to seek a lawyer and find out ALL information. Don’t screw yourself when you’re trying to do what’s right!|`|TQW5E6olaa	I've been there. Reading your additional details I can honestly say, I would leave at this point.<br>  <br>  I would pack a bag, and and go to mom's. <br>  <br>  I would go get counseling, with him if possible, definitely by myself.<br>  <br>  If after doing counseling together and by myself if I found this was not a healthy or save-able relationship, I would move forward with my life. Living with my parents until I got on my feet again.<br>  <br>  Good Luck in whatever decisions you make!<br>  <br>  BTW in my case, t's better to be a single mom and happy that married and abused.|`|723QHuicaa	If its your mothers property ask her to tell him to leave.<br>  <br>  In fact, no.<br>  <br>  You sit down and ask him to leave. Tell him you cannot stay in this relationship as its not good for your mental state.<br>  <br>  If he refuses. Get your mum to tell him to leave.<br>  <br>  If he still refuses - calls the cops, and they will get him to leave.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	File for divorce, have them serve him the papers at home when you're not there. You can request a police escort be sent to your home to watch him pack his things and get out. Get a restraining order if you're worried he'll come back and hurt you. Good luck!|`|qES5f0tqaa	You need to listen to your parents If your man is doing you wrong kick him far away from you go somewere and get help now|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Move next door and get a restraining oder. Now!!|`|yKS2UI87aa	File for divorce and tell him to leave if he has a problem with this have your parents formally evict him. Been there done that. I am glad your family noticed and is supportive of you. Good luck!|`|94da8fe67f0c5641825912cfda8d23a9aa	why not simply file for divorce?  you may have to move into your parents house until all is settled....get a restraining order while your at it.  <br>  <br>  I will monitor and feedback to additional details if necessary as well<br>  <br>  <br>  You obviously already know and have your mind made up that you want an end to this relationship.  You need to get your butt in gear and act on it.  Mental abuse is equally harmful as any other, even physical abuse.  So do what is best for you and the baby!|`|FLpMShKNaa	I have been there but I did not have children which made a clean break easier. It took me 7 years to realize how emotionally abusive my ex was, even tho everyone else could see it. He won't change. Ditto the people who says move next door and set boundaries, If he hasn;t abused your child physically, unfortunately he will still be a aprt of your life unless he gives up his rights. The law favors joint custody in all but extreme situations. Call your local legal aid office to find lawyers who take cases pro bono (free) or on a sliding scale basis.|`|P4LBygv2aa	I was right where you are 4 years ago , wish I could email you , I was in a relationship for 2 years and got preg with my son , when he was 2 yrs old my now ex started drinking heavly , he also had bipolar , when anything ever happened I was quick to forgive for my sons sake , I can tell you right now , you are thinking , if I leave he will get him on the weekends and I wont be there to defend him or help him , right ? thats why I stayed till he was 9 years old and could dial a phone.its so hard to be where you are now. the only way out is to go but thats easier said then done. I know , your stuck.<br>  the best thing I can tell you is do not give him the power anymore, you can only get hurt if you give them permission to hurt you , like if he puts you down , really think about it , does what he say really matter , you know the truth , if you run into someone and he gets jelouse , tough for him , thats his too bad , and by all means do not feel like a bad mom , see what I mean , you are letting him demeen you and tell you who you are , don't give him that power , look him dead in the eye and say who do you think your are? what gives you the right to speak to me that way ? <br>  yes that could be dangerous but thats not what he expects from you , the one who backs down , it may shock the hell out of him but thats what I did , and then I went to my moms , two blocks away ,I was scared out of my mind ,he cried to me and the whole nine yards , and at one point threatened me when the sobbing dident work , stick to your ground give into nothing , get strong and stand tall , he is like this because you allowed him to , now take back your power and strength , get back to who you are , and do not be afraid of him  , thats his power . <br>  get the police involved if nessacery ,|`|XOtOMncwaa	Wow I'm really sorry to hear that! <br>  I think telling him in person would be a hard thing to do, it would just lead to more abuse, and him trying to tell you he will change, which will never happen and chances are the abuse will only become physical if you stay there longer... So does he work? Just wait for him to go to work one day, pack your things, and your sons things and head over to your parents house... Leave a note for him explaining things, and make sure someone is home at your parents house at all times while you are there, just in case he decides to stop in for a visit. Work on everything you need to do for a divorce there, and have the police take care of delivering all of the paper work, or maybe your dad, or if you have a brother that would work too... and work on getting a restraining order as soon as possible... he might violate it, but that will put him in jail, so if he does say anything to you then just remind him that if he violates the restraining order then he will be in jail, which I doubt he wants to go there... good luck to you, this will be hard, but hang in there, you don't want to have to deal with that for the rest of your life, and it will only hurt your son even more to see that because eventually he will understand!<br>  **I'm sorry I missed the part where it was your parents property... then just have your dad come over, tell your usband you want a divorce and have you dad tell him he has so many days to get off of the property.**|`|ibWLdXlJaa	If it's your parent's property he has no right to stay. Get a lawyer and file for divorce. If you are afraid he will become physically abusive have the police escort him right on out the door. Or better yet have your parent's do it call the police to have him removed. He made you suffer so don't do him any favors. Kick him out and get what you need out of it. As a mother I know I wouldn't be able to sit by and watch my son verbally abused and I don't think you could either. Stand up and fight back before it's too late and more damage is done.|`|jHH3G56Jaa	If you and your husband are staying on your parents property then tell him to leave and go file for a divorce.<br>  All lawyers have to do so many cases of their choice for nothing or nearly nothing a year.This might help if you don't have much money.<br>  Some lawyers do all criminal cases but some will do domestic cases to meet there quota.<br>  Once you file for a divorce they will have him served and you will get your first court date. Mean while I would go and get a TPO ( temporary restraining order) even if you are scared or not, and I say this because you will most likely go to court for this first and you can ask for a temporary order for child support until the divorse is final and they set you an amount.<br>  I wish you all the luck!|`|M2yERqNSaa	just leave and the meddling family members can take you in|`|1RRcFT5Yaa	I would tell him he has to go befor it gets worse. I was married to a man for 8 years that was like this in the long run I ended up getting beat several times and if I told him I wanted him gone he would try to take my kids and so on. I would bring the baby somewhere safe have a cop or someone their to enforce him leaving. I still would not stay their for a while stay with your parents. Even with a restraining order that doesn't guarantee him not trying to get in or the cops making it their in a safe amount of time. Good Luck and stick to your decision. As wemon we usually convince ourselves to try again or things may go back to the way they were. They can at first so that your not upset but it always goes back to the way it was and gets worse.|`|WHBSlhuOaa	there is no easy way.  you have a son together.  he is not physically abusive to you - so getting a restraining order really doesn't apply.<br>  <br>  you live in your parents' property.  I assume you are renting or your parents retain control of the property.<br>  <br>  you are young and when you have a child at a young age in this day and age - complicates situations and scares people because of the added responsibilities.<br>  <br>  i would talk to him - ask him if he would seek counseling if there is any chance he wants to salvage the relationship.  if he refuses, then it's time to get parents involved, including his.  <br>  <br>  you have a child who is witnessing all the stress and abusive (albeit verbal).  will your son grow up to do the same?<br>  <br>  if your parents own the property, they can legally say who they want and don't want living in the house.<br>  <br>  and you have to think about your son knowing his father.  he has rights to see his child and maybe you both just need to talk - really talk and find out why he has changed (to some degree - you probably have changed too).<br>  <br>  best of luck to you and your son.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	Quickest way, is to tell him you're done, and that he'll need to leave your parents' property... In the meantime, you can move in with your parents, while he gets his stuff together/finds a new place.<br>  <br>  Then, don't be fooled with promises of change... One doesn't just change! IF it were to happen, it would take time, and probably counseling, so, if you're serious, please don't return to him, and confuse your son, if he makes a promise. <br>  <br>  From your parent's house, you can file for divorce, and start getting your life together, without him... Good luck!|`|dG3V2roaaa	Don't file for divorce, yet. This country is way to fast to dump marriage like its nothing. If he is not physically abusing you, get counseling. Give him the chance to fix this. It may be possible to fix and you owe that to your son to give his father the chance. <br>  <br>  I know from my own experience that living near / with family changes the marriage. Your parents may be what has kept you afloat, but it also may be causing a strain. <br>  <br>  Get help first, then consider divorce.
ACc1skbPaa	I would be grateful for any gifts and particularly something that I can use for myself before and after the baby comes...It wouldn't offend me, but only you know how your friend is going to react...if she is the type of person that would take something like that as a jab at her than hold it back, but if she is someone who enjoys receiveing gifts that are creams and soaps and personal items than I would go for it--personally, I think that is a very thoughtful thing to do when you give a gift to the mom that is not just about the baby...good luck...|`|DRb4Qlypaa	It is not a bad gift, because everyone else there will be getting stuff for the baby, it is good that you kept mommy in mind too.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I wouldn't be offended at all.

Very nice idea, and not your average gift that everyone always gives.  Definitely include it.  <br>  <br>  Kelly|`|OLW0Irbhaa	I don't think I'd include it in the gift.  If you want to give it to them ask if they would like it and give it privately.  That can be a very sensitive issue for some women.

kRui5wGtaa	I just had my first "regular" period since having my son 5 months ago. I also had these same cramps. I think that it is just your body trying to get itself back to normal. I spoke over the phone with a nurse from my doctors office about it and she said that it is normal because your body is still changing. A lot of woman say that their periods are never the same after they have a baby. I never had these cramps before and I just had them with my first postpartum period.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	this is normal. i found i had this aswell as all the other cramps etc ten fold. it was horrendous. all i will say if it does continue see a doc to rule out IBS etc:)|`|FKR45WLPaa	Probably so.  I had wicked diarrhea with my menstrual cramps after I had my daughter.

ITs great that ur baby is kicking like that. I didn't feel my son until I was at least 21 weeks really. and the where very lil hits everyday.. then the gradually keep getting stronger and stronger. So there isn't anything to worry about.. yesterday my son's grandfather went to touch my belly and when he did touch hit.. he scared him and he moved to my right side really FAST AND HARD! so its okay its normal.|`|em8A42Bqaa	My little girl is very active also, at 20 weeks the kicks were light tapping, but now she is really going.  It feels like she is doing somersaults in there!  She is gonna be a gymnast I suppose!|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	that's fairly normal. your little guy is just strong. be happy that he's active and healthy.|`|CFFuFof1aa	Yes, that is completely normal. My little girl did the same thing. Don't ever worry that the baby is moving too much. It's when they aren't moving for a few days that you worry. Actually my baby quit moving so much at around 30 weeks, because she didn't have so much room to move around in. Enjoy the movement! That was my favorite part of being pregnant.|`|AA11795652	Depends on the baby.  With my first, at 20 weeks it was still flutters.  With my 2nd, my son, he was already kicking me like you described.  He's 10 months now and still a kicker and mover and gets into everything, whereas, my first, my daughter, was an easy baby.  It's a sign!|`|hoX7hoINaa	I felt flutters at 17 weeks, then more and more movement as the weeks progressed. Now I'm 35w 5d and I dont think he ever sleeps! Lol. Its normal. Its when he doesn't move at all for 24 hours that you should worry.|`|s2Dv9NRGaa	It isnt normal but it is good. This just means if your baby come before the due date that he will not be premature and he will be healthy. You should be happy, you have a very strong baby. :) good luck|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	It varies from baby to baby and also by how thin you are.  The thinner you are the more you can feel the movements and the stronger they feel..|`|EzcQOTPtaa	It is very normal. The only time you have to worry is when you don't have a lot of movement.|`|zcSAWWCkaa	i didnt feel anything at 20 it was more like 22 or 23 for me but yea the little kicks are powerful! she kicked my cell phone off my stomach one time. its normal :)|`|uAZlvHgiaa	My first child never moved. My second didn't stop moving.|`|ImaC8uvdaa	lol sounds like my baby, i am also 20 weeks! she kicks and punches and flips and shes definately strong. I would say it varies with each baby but sounds like your baby is doing good and is healthy! :)
JUXAK0euaa	First off it was probably not the nicest thing to see first thing in the morning for him. At 37 weeks it's possibly your mucous plug and nothing to worry about.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	lol to ur last add...it might be "bloody show", so u're partially loosing ur mucus plug, this usually leaves a little bit of blood in the mucus that comes out, so u need to watch out for the rest of it to come out.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	First of all - you need to learn how to flush the toilet. It takes what - 1/100th of a second!? As for the blood, only your doctor can tell you if its cause for alarm. good luck!|`|59GymH27aa	Probably just a bit of a show.  I'm sure if there was a lot then he would have been concerned and showed you...plus you know what men are like, they aer always exaggerating|`|qfuhHeDjaa	towards the end sex can irritate the cervix... not a big thing i wouldnt think...|`|IuJjYz6gaa	LOL, it's better than waking him up 500 times with the toilet flushing all night... :)<br>  <br>  Definitely could be bloody show or just from having sex.|`|3L7D2TVWaa	well, heres my story, i dont know if it will help you or not!<br>  My son is four months old right now, i had him in October 08. About a week or so before i had him, my husband and I had sex also, and I also got blood in the toilet and on the tissue, thats supposed to be relatively normal, its your cervix that was iritated. I ended up with a c-section, because my cervix was too swollen for my son's head to fit through. He weighed 8.5 at birth. which is bigger than some, but not big enough for me not to be able to give birth naturally. so im not sure if the swollen cervix had anythiing to do with having sex. ; )<br>  the doctor recommended we stay sexually active for as long as its comfortable for me, and he explained that i might "spot" a little afterwards towards the end of my pregnancy. <br>  hope it helps!
Mkok6omUaa	I like it! Usually I don't like made up names, but this one's actually nice|`|DUxUndv8aa	Hmm, I like the idea of it but it when you pronounce it, sounds like the person is not able to say Joseph correctly. And he will always be called Joseph regardless... I know how frustrating that can be to live with for your entire life, TRUST me!! And yes I agree it is much better than Nevaeh. :)|`|h17G3paiaa	Different, I like it|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	nope. it sounds like saying  joseph with a lisp.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	yes I do like it,|`|jwIdq5qkaa	I like it and its very unique.
ngiTDGT2aa	i been having the same problems and im confused idk but i been getting my period but it hasnt been normal. but it been normal my whole life. we dont mind if we get to have a baby but this been goin on over a yr idk whats wrong.|`|FKR45WLPaa	There are some pregnancy tests that can detect HCG in your urine five days prior to your period's start date.  But it sounds like you don't have much to worry about.  You won't ovulate if you are pregnant either.  And I would definitely look into getting different condoms.|`|1jpi9Jlcaa	theres every possibilty, if the condom broke, it broke. you never know.<br>  take a test, or see the doctor about it, or just wait until your due your period, to see if you get it.|`|hXNuyTKaaa	Doubt it. I thought the same thing one time and went to wal-mart pharmacy and picked up Plan B pills for 40.00 and went on with my life. Its not too late to run and pick some day after pills up just in case.|`|50caa439c1f866ae9ac541c515cc5514aa	no need to worry if you guys are pretty sure that *** is not inside !<br>  anyway to be on safer side you should consume emergency contraceptives (tablets) to prevent pregnancy within 72 hours of unprotected sex !<br>  please be adviced , sooner the better !<br>  so stop worrying and go for tablet , nothing will happen !<br>  also dont make it a habit of having those kind of tablets as they have really bad side effects if consumed frequently !<br>  thanks|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	You wouldn't get a positive test result until you missed your period by at least 1 day.|`|ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true- people dont want to share their experiences- they only want to tell you take a test- its sad- why ask the question if that is the answer you are going to get?<br>  people on here cant and wont help you out except give you the most obvious answer.
98WKYtfwaa	They usually come around the time your period is due.<br>  I'm sure mommy of 2 knew what you meant but is just being a b*tch about it. We all make slight mistakes ya know.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Ovulation cramps happen when your body releases the egg. I think you mean implantation cramps. That usually happens when you are about to start your period, but no period comes. They are usually stronger than regular cramps and last longer.|`|AA10071149	You would ovulate first, then conceive. I never did have cramps or spotting with implantation. If I did, they were minor enough for me not to notice.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Ovulation pains happen while you are ovulating not once you conceive...that just doesn't make sense....do you know what you are even asking?|`|b3CwObBdaa	i never had implamentation cramps at all.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	Im sure you knew what you were asking, but if your pregnant you might be experiencing preg head. I had it totally bad. I got the implantation cramps at about 1 or 2 weeks after period was due. I think. It was horrid and i worried for ages that i was having a miscarriage, but was totally normal.

Risultati di recenti ricerche hanno rilevato delle correlazioni tra l'intensità dei disturbi e alcune caratteristiche psicologiche della donna, che possono influire negativamente sui sintomi della dismenorrea amplificandoli. La dismenorrea può essere primaria o secondaria.E' detta primaria quando il dolore non è giustificato da una patologia pelvica, secondaria quando il dolore ciclico è causato da una patologia sottostante.<br>  Riguarda circa il 50% delle donne.<br>  <br>  Cause<br>  <br>  Causa della dismenorrea primaria sembra essere la produzione di sostanze dette prostaglandine nell'utero durante la seconda metà del ciclo mestruale che determinano contrazioni spastiche e dolorose.<br>  <br>  <br>  fragolina: più sappiamo come funziaona il nostro corpo e meno abbiamo paura e allora ben venga anche il fatebene fratelli!|`|3QcYecLlaa	Si è normale stai tranquilla!

L'unica cosa che posso consigliarti è di passare i momenti di grande dolore seduta/sdraiata in una posizione comoda. Devi cercare di distendere i muscoli del bacino che sono la principale fonte di dolore nel periodo delle mestruazioni. Inoltre cerca di bere bevande calde o a temperatura ambiente per non contrarre i muscoli intestinali che possono provocare ulteriore dolore. si, è possibile che sudi, in particolare d'estate, per l'ansia provocata dal dolore o per (come ho detto prima) la contrazione muscolare.|`|wc8Sbnb8aa	Il bagno caldo NO, fa aumentare l'emorragia!!! Anch'io soffro tanto come te, a parte Buscofen , Tachipirina e Aulin (se proprio non resisto), quando sto da cani una cosa che mi fa temporaneamente passare è una corsetta o una passeggiata di buon passo!

Certo che si suda. Se non prendo un analgesico alle prime avvisaglie, io sudo, mi viene la nausea e vomito.<br>  Se hai paura di prendere qualcosa che ti faccia male, fatti consigliare dal medico. In linea di massima, comunque, gli analgesici da banco non hanno troppi effetti collaterali.

I always had pediatricians who were caring and answered all my questions.  Your children deserve the same.|`|pXSKSS3daa	You need to TAKE her to the doctor, not call. Go in and demand she be seen and don't leave until you're satisfied with their reasoning why she's not taking the right amount of formula.<br>  <br>  ETA: Then take her to the ER or an urgent care clinic. Honestly, if I were in your shoes I wouldn't care how the procedures are usually done. I'd be finding a way to get my son(daughter in your case) the appropriate care.|`|1JGj56TFaa	I would definitely speak to your health visitor or doctor about it.  Try and give her the milk in different ways - make up custard with it or baby cereal or anything else that she can eat that you can add milk to or thin it out with milk.  Im having the same problem with my 6 mth old daughter! Good luck x|`|deIzFnV8aa	How does she drink her milk? If she is still using a bottle, try getting a faster flow nipple. It might be that she is just frustrated with how hard it is to drink milk vs how easy it is to eat solid food.  Just a shot in the dark, but easy to try out, esp if she is looking frustrated with her bottle|`|IDS64Eh8aa	Insist to see a doctor, or go to a hospital if you have to, she needs her milk!<br>  <br>  Ethel: It's 28 weeks, not months
LKIhUMCgaa	probably some bug, maybe u ate something bad the night before or something. but then again, some women get morning sickness not just during 1st trimester, but later on too. i'd call a doctor just in case and see wut the nurse says, if u should go in and get checked out or not.|`|uuHPneEcaa	everything is fine I believe I have woken up like that sometimes and he is perfectly fine. I am sure everything is okay.. IF u want to call ur doc to be on safe side I would do so. Its normal when ur pregnant.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	It's also the time of year for the stomach flu...  Everyone in my house had it about a week ago.<br>  <br>  I don't think your baby is in any danger, but call your doctor to be sure.<br>  <br>  Make sure you stay hydrated, that's probably the greatest risk to your baby.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	Stomach flu??  Take it easy, and you should be fine (as long as you have no bleeding along with it)  Don't ever hesitate to call your doctor/midwife if you're worried|`|HrDcaocMaa	Always call your doctor!  But I think you're fine... I had symptoms like that too with both my babies pregnancies - and I even spotted a bit...  ?  Congrats and Good Luck!!!|`|ikPKFCscaa	Welcome to being pregnant!|`|sxsx9sHNaa	Your fine.  Diarrea is also normal.  thing of how much your insides are moving around to make room for the baby.  Nausea and cramps are usual that early.|`|Q2IbbjGxaa	CALL YOUR DR.  just in case
pXSKSS3daa	What is his temperature? If it's above 100 then he needs to be seen by a doctor.<br>  <br>  Your age has nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  ETA: If you don't have a thermometer then how do you know he has a high temp.? Go purchase one and take his temperature. Every parent with an infant should have at least one thermometer in their home.<br>  <br>  ETA: No one is hugely overpaid. You can purchase one for about $5-$10 and it's not a waste, it's to ensure your son's health. There is no need to get defensive, people are just trying to help you.|`|AA11878029	You need a thermometer,  and then you can tell your doc how exactly high your baby;s temp is.....All babies sweat when they sleep and tend to feel hot just don't over dress and take him to the doc for his check ups !!!<br>  <br>  No hospital can deny you in the USA,  If your son is getting repeated fevers he obviously has an infection somewhere.  Please take care of your son.  It could be an ear infection which is very painful and can cause permanent hearing loss !!|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	You need a thermometer to take his temperature, you cannot guess. You can get one at the chemist for around ￡1 or less. Or ask you health visitor for one. We were given lots of free ones in the packs we got given from the hospital/ midwives when pregnant. Do you have one somewhere?<br>  <br>  It is very important to check. Not to scare you, but my daughter was in hospital for a week in December with a bacterial infection which i had thought was 'just a cold' at the start. It was only the fact that she was still running a high temperature after 3 days of paracetamol that made me realise she wasn't getting better. The hospital took straight into A&E as soon as they saw the notes i had made about her temperature.  <br>  <br>  You really can't guess these things when it comes to your childrens health<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  x|`|ySKK7lCyaa	take him to the emergency room or get him to the Doctors. <br>  <br>  You made the choice to be a mom so act like one. A easy way to tell if he is running a temp. is use the inside of your lips on his forehead. But you need to take him to the dr.'s as soon as you can. <br>  <br>  Go to the dollar store they should have them there, or ask someone for one like your mom.|`|paerqxfMaa	You need to take him to the doctor - babies "thermometers" don't kick in until they're 6 months old - he should not be running a temp.|`|PeEIuzP5aa	this one is a though one, not sure what to tell you sorry. other then going to your dr.|`|cRI99L8Waa	If his temp is 100.4 or higher he needs to be seen at the ER immediately. My baby girl wouldn't be alive if my husband and I didn't follow this advice. You must have a thermometer, they're really cheap for the store brand digital and pretty acurate. You don't say how old yours is, I'm assuming under 3 months. But a fever can indicate a very serious illness and it's important that a doctor check it out. Good luck to you.|`|A3AKLHz6aa	was it premature ? that could have something to do with it

5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	My daughter had the Vtech Vsmile.  It didn't even last a year.  She wasn't rough on it at all, it just stopped working.  For a couple months before it conked out, it would only work intermittently.<br>  <br>  She got the Leapfrog Didj this last Christmas as well as the Tag Reader and she hasn't had any problems with those toys.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	We had the V-Tech first. When the kids were 1.5 and 2.5 years old.  They hated it.  They never used it; it was a fight to get them to try.  Something about it they didn't even want to try.  They liked the Leap Frog learning pads in the stores though, so we got one for Christmas (2 months after the V-Tech).  They both love it and play it all the time.  The oldest is now 34 months and the youngest is 22 months.  We still have the V-Tech, and they still to this day refuse it.|`|4H4APii1aa	My 4 year old has had a leapfrog since she was three.I think it can be very educational and keeps her attention.

ibeYAlwpaa	I would say the zoo. :) Once it gets warmer here ill be taking my little one to the philly zoo! She’s already been to smaller ones and she LOVES it! (she’s 14 mos btw) .|`|zvrbrNfgaa	zoo, but if you could i'd suggest something inside instead of the zoo or sea world. my son is 17 mos old and he gets restless easily. he still takes 2 naps a day and all of the crowds and walking around make it hard for to take a nap even if he's in the stroller. i wouldn't take a child that age to either.|`|2ibfQbLcaa	OK I have been to both with my toddler, We took my daughter at 12 months, and at 22, both times she has been bored and uninterested.. some things were alright but its hard for her to take the time to really look at an animal hiding at the back of an exibit, not to mention the bathroom at the zoo are DISGUSTING!!!!!!!! They have not even clean floor to stand on and change her standing, no changing tables, and over crowding, the food was gross and nothing was stroller friendly, a ton of crowded pathways and hills and a bus to see the polor bears, it  WAS NOT FUN. Seaworld however had her in awe both times, they have a whole place dedicated to sesame street where you can play with the characters go on rides for SMALL children including toddlers. and a big play house and bounce house, they have aquariums and shows. My daughter LOVES seaworld as a matter of fact everyday she yells at me about shamu lol.. not to mention one ticket is good for the whole year.. we plan on going back in two weeks! I also recomment aquarium of the pacific. Her and my best friends 9 month old were mesmerized!!<br>  <br>  And whrn i say zoo i mean san diego, We have been many times and twice with her. It was horrible, better for when theyre a bit bigger.. like 2.. i mean all kids are different though So maybe they will like it.. But it was gross and not toddler or baby friendly when it comes to food, getting around, changing, etc|`|goMRvk0oaa	I would say sea world......Some kids are scared of the zoo to many really really big and new animals for them....I took my daughter 21 months to sea world she loved the play area their and the two rides we went on were fun for her (the two that give you good sites to see you ride in one and it goes up and down the other just shows scenery) ON the other had i took my nine month old son and he didn't like it he was not intrested....They both were totally afraid of the zoo so depends on your kid i guess. I would way sea world though good luck and have fun!|`|guAwifbBaa	Well they are both pretty crowded. Probably the San Diego Zoo because Sea World has rides. San Diego Zoo the 16 month old will be able to see the animals better and possibly interact with them by feeding them or watching someone feed them. Hope i helped =)|`|FfGHHhqBaa	zoo, sea world has rides a 16 month old cant go on

Keep your head up ur dumpling will playing again in no time.|`|DKqsFGymaa	You've received a lot of good suggestions, but I'll put my two-cents worth in anyway.<br>  <br>  As a daycare provider, I wash my hands more per day than the average person or the average mother.  I also live in Minnesota, so winters are extremely hard on my hands and they used to crack no matter what lotion I tried.  (And I would try anything anybody suggested.)<br>  <br>  What works best for me is Gold Bond Ultimate with Shea Butter.  I love it and if I remember to put it on daily, my hands don't crack.<br>  <br>  I also had a friend of mine just give me a bottle of lotion that she special orders from Walgreens.  It's called Atrac-Tain Cream.  The supposed secret ingredient in it is Urea.  I haven't used it too long, but my hands haven't cracked using this cream either.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|vYG0Hi0iaa	its a bit sticky and messy, but you can try putting on petroleum jelly at night before bed. then using lubriderm (extra dry skin formula) during the day.|`|QikvnTnqaa	I use Lubriderm. I started using it for my tattoos. I had never used it before because it's so expensive. But  now I wont use anything else! :D|`|TvCloid9aa	try going into body shop they are really helpful!<br>  <br>  or you could try boots they have lots of dry hand cream<br>  <br>  <br>  i would recommend norwegian formula hand cream.<br>  xx|`|chvFhu8aaa	I don't know if there is any lotion out there that won't wash off, but the  absolutely best lotion (and I've tried many) to bring instant relief to dry, cracked hands is Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Lotion. I have a 4 year old and a 1 year old, and am constantly washing my hands, this really worked for me and seems to last a while.|`|2f4vPmUQaa	find some "corn huskers lotion" i know dairy farmers that live by this. it comes in a little yellow labeled bottle. probably able to find it at a co op near ur town.|`|yWPsQYPMaa	grapeseed oil|`|5ZwIASCgaa	Lubriderm works good...but the best thing out rite now is aquaphor or eucerin!!!|`|AA11109728	Yes - I don't know if they still have it or not, but I used to use Vaseline Intensive Care's Water Resistant Lotion.  I used to work in fast food, and often had my hands in water from washing tables and dishes - my hands get dry in winter, but were even worse from the water.  Someone suggested that lotion to me, so I tried it, and loved it!  You can still feel it after you have your hands in water, no need to keep reapplying it like regular lotion.
2MKvrydWaa	it sound like eczema to me.my child has the same thing and that's how her's started off.and yes u should take him 2 the doc and they should prescribe something.for now just use Vaseline or baby oil.good luck with the little one:-)|`|39qec43kaa	My son has the same thing.  At his last checkup the doctor said it was eczema and not to use baby lotion, the fragrance actually dries out the skin (I didn't know this).

It has really helped!|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Check this link, and you pediatrician should take phone calls.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.riversideonline.com/health_reference/Healthy-Baby/FL00090.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.riversideonline.com/health_re...</a>|`|AA10368738	Eczema?|`|Wa44n8RCaa	Yes take him to the doctors. i don't want to alarm you but if a baby gets a rash it could be menigitus.

No point taking a chance.<br>  & no one will be able to tell you an accurate cause on here.|`|u94HOVz7aa	it sounds like you are describing eczema.  i would take him to the dr. and don't use baby lotion it has bpa in it.  pediatricians recommend not using "baby" lotion anymore.  just use regular lotion that is for sensitive skin, fragrance free, and dye free.   what you are describing sounds alot like my son's rash, which his dr. diagnosed as eczema yesterday.
UghJ0XROaa	Well, Shyla was only 2 months old and the she just rolled over, it's like wait you are too young for that. But sure enough she kept rolling over and over the last 2-3 weeks she is an expert at 4 months. <br>  <br>  Gabriella is constantly surprising me with her words, she starts talking and saying stuff i didn't even know that she knew!|`|XOtOMncwaa	My son shocked me when he started walking, he didn't want anything to do with walking, and one day he just walked from the coffee table to another toy. I sat there for like 10 minutes with my eyes as round as quarters and then grabbed my phone to call his dad. I was in utter shock that he just took off walking. Also one day I told him to give me a kiss, and sure enough he did, I thought he would have just looked at me with a puzzled look, I was really shocked then too.|`|qStmw7qgaa	Well my daughter is only 3 months and 1 week, but last night she just about killed her daddy and me w/ laughter.  She was sitting on her Daddy's lap playing with her glow worm.  She had her pacifier in her mouth when suddenly she spit it out...I'm talking her launch the damn thing.  It was hilarious and it made it even better because both my husband and I saw her do it.

jgU4g6kGaa	I would trust the Doctors and keep your scheduled appointment.  If during the next week you feel anything abnormal or you have any concerns you can always call the office and ask to see the doctor.  It's normal to be a little paranoid at this time in your pregnancy but everything will be okay and the little one will be here happy and healthy real soon! Good Luck!|`|QSodlfMraa	if i were you  i would have still make her give me my doctors visit, the baby can come anytime they want, you should call her and set up a visit. <br>  congrats and good luck :).|`|j083iujcaa	I think you need to call your regular doctor and talk to his nurse,just to give yourself some peace of mind. You might also want to keep in mind that each doctor does things a bit differently. For example my doctor doesn't even start checking for dilation until 38 weeks unless you have been having contractions|`|z5dN9B3Iaa	Just to put your mind at ease I would call you regular doctor and schedule and appt. nesx week. There is nothing worng with you saying I would really like to be seen next week.|`|H0fXySX9aa	im in the uk and we have fortnightly visits from 36 weeks instead of once a week and don't check for dilation until 40 weeks<br>  its your choice to whether you make another appointment|`|DRb4Qlypaa	It does not hurt to call your regular doctor and ask, or just tell the receptionist she messed up and you were supposed to come in next week and she will change it for you.<br>  I am not there yet but it does seem like you would be going every week at this point.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I don't think it is necessary to go in every week.<br>  <br>  They're just going to check your weight, blood pressure, maybe urine and the baby's heartbeat.  That's it.  You won't be getting anymore internal exams until you're closer.  Maybe at 37 weeks.<br>  <br>  They don't want to do them too much too early to make sure that they don't accidentally set off labor, because at 35 weeks, your baby would be premature.<br>  <br>  Waiting 2 weeks is fine.<br>  <br>  And if you have any concerns or problems, you can always be seen then.
0SIhrYCbaa	I had my grand kids when my daughter was in basic training. We had a notarized paper stating that the kids were in my care and that I was able to have them treated at doctors, hospitals, etc. One of my grand kids stays with me and I have never had an issue taking her to a doctor. They have never questioned me. Her mom does take her most often so they see us both and know I'm the grand parent.<br>  Some one has told your MIL a tale and gotten her upset.|`|vue9NOhYaa	She is correct. You need to give her a letter (notorized) stating that she has the right to seek emergency medical care for your child. It's called a nondurable power of attorney.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here's an example.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.legalhelper.net/power-of-attorney-health-child-care-nd.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.legalhelper.net/power-of-atto...</a>|`|otFCWMuUaa	that a little obsessive if you ask me to file for guardianship for 3 days..<br>  <br>  <br>  but i would get some kind of notarized document giving her legal rights to have her treated in case of emergency and make sure you leave her with all the babies important papers like social security card and birth certificate..<br>  <br>  and most of all just make sure you have a number you can be reached at all times so the hospital can have full communication with you if an emergency occured.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	All she needs is a medical consent form (notarized)in case your baby is ill while you're out of the country. My sister and I do this when we leave our kids with each other (when traveling far from home) and our mother. Perfectly normal and very responsible for her to think of.<br>  <br>  We've never had to use them thank God. She probably wont either. Won't you feel better knowing that while your gone your baby is being well taken care of? What if something happened and you couldn't be contacted? I'm sure all will be fine but its a good safeguard. <br>  <br>  Good luck and have a fun trip! :)|`|q1Swxe3qaa	I'm pretty sure thats a load of crap!|`|dzyJw0cvaa	She is not thinking clearly...all she needs to know is the childs birth date and full name and she can take the child anywhere for healthcare if she needs to...which is unlikely in three days.  <br>  <br>  If you want a little more reassurance, you can leave your childs insurance card with her while you are gone.  but no, she does not need temporary gaurdianship or whatever...she doesnt know what she is talking about.<br>  <br>  Have fun in jamaica!!  i'm jealous!|`|GgMMvHI8aa	Write a paper stating that you have travel plans and SPECIFY the dates. State who is caring for the child. And authorize any medical treatment should it be needed. Include the pediatricians info, as well as your contact info while out of town.  Again specify the dates for your travel. And both of you go to the notary and have it notarized. Notify the pediatrician that you are going and who is caring for the child while you go.  <br>   <br>  And temporary legal guardianship is taking it a bit far. You have to go to court for that. And it would give that person the opportunity to take your child away from you. After having that experience myself I am warning you to make sure the person is one you trust.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	No, it is NOT true... What you need to do, however, is fill out a form that states that she---or whoever is caring for your child---is allowed to get medical care, in your absence... This is what my brother signed, in order for me to potentially get medical care, when I was watching his son.<br>  <br>  Ask your pediatrician or local hospital; they should have forms available.<br>  <br>  (I'd be leery of anyone who stated they needed 'guardianship' of my kids! No way!!)<br>  <br>  *edited* If a child needs *emergency* care, he or she WILL receive it, regardless... The form is mainly for cases which are non-life-threatening, such as broken arms, etc... They prefer to have parent's permission, if at all possible, but again, if a life is at stake, they will be treated.|`|iLLoc003aa	Its true...God forbid your baby gets deathly ill and needs a blood transfusion and it needs to be done ASAP with no time for you to get back from Jamaica...she needs to have that right to say yes or no...only a parent can do that, grandparents have no rights over a child :)|`|GqI8wY8Iaa	Old people get paranoid. Make her happy. Stop at the bank and write, she has permission. Include the dates. No big deal. Or don't include the dates and never return.
eD7qRBKHaa	You are probably in the early stages of labor.  You might continue to have this happen on and off until it really gets going.<br>  <br>  Hip to hip - oh honey, I had that, too.  My baby was transverse.  I can't even tell you how bad it hurt.  I had my husband pushing with all his weight on my hips to relieve it.  He said he thought he was going to break me, but I could barely feel it!  Maybe yours will turn before the big day.  All that being said, I did get through it without drugs, so it can be done!|`|532XA7lkaa	Honestly, and I don't meant o sound harsh, but if you were able to fall asleep, like you said, then trust me....it is not real labor.  It could be the beginning of labor...but the thing is...contractions will be amazingly and perfectly spaced apart...so the 6 and 4 minutes doesn't make sense, unless you are timing them wrong.  You will literally be able to hold a stop watch and watch them 5 minutes apart within a few seconds...And again, there will be no sleeping when it's real!!!  Braxton Hicks can be incredibly painful...not near as painful as the real ones...but very painful nonetheless.|`|AA11049977	Call your Dr.  you could definitely be going into labor.
GxYtTjUbaa	Could be implantation bleeding hun u might be pregnant wait till u missed ur nxt period then test|`|AA12022579	I'd say it's a possibility. Although Im not really sure.<br>  Maybe you should stop taking them and see if that changes back to normal.<br>  But dont be too worried about the spotting - it happens to most women.|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	It sounds to me like you are just ovulating.  For me, that happens every month around two weeks after the start of my last period, but every woman is different.  During ovulation (completely normal) you have discharge more than usual, sometimes tinged with blood.  I don't really think it's the vitamins.  I think it's normal, but call your doctor and ask him.  It's always better to be safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|Fa130w6Gaa	Vitamins should not cause that. Sometimes women get breakthrough bleeding during their cycle. If it continues, check with your doctor.
ozWi3TJlaa	She was my easiest pregnancy and easiest labor out of the three kids.  I gained the least amount of weight (21 lbs.), and she was a really happy baby who slept through the night after the first month.<br>  <br>  She was the easiest to raise.  She was the kind of kid every parent wants because she stayed away from drugs and alcohol, she was in concert band and Marching Band.  Because she also got straight As in every class and even took college classes while in high school, she was accepted with full scholarships at six colleges and universities.  The hardest thing was choosing.<br>  <br>  Now she is a grown woman and is my best friend.<br>  <br>  I wish all of this and more for you!|`|wFe7L1XJaa	Im currently 10 wks and 3days with baby number 2 before i got pregnant with my son i had a misscarriage and then i got pregnant with him right after....he's 3 1/2 now and he is so excited about bein a big brother, and so am i, i didnt think it would happen so soon but i guess a 4 year age difference was good. But my pregnancy with my son was alot easier and the best part for me was seeing his little face and he looked just like his daddy but this pregnancy has been a little rough so maybe ill get my lil girl lol|`|mL07bInfaa	Hey girl, I totally understand having more worries and anxiety with a second pregnancy...with my first I was so niaeve and I didn't think anything could go wrong, thankfully nothing did (just a very tough delivery) and then when I got pregnant with #2 I was immediately so worried about everything!  I even had bleeding at 6 wks and thought for sure something was wrong, but it turned out to be implantation bleeding, and I am now 31 wks along and doing well!  I am so excited for my son to have a brother or sister, and am looking forward to meeting my new little one, BUT I do have to admit, I am totally scared for labour and delivery after my last one!  I am more wary this time, but it makes you appreciate the miracle of it alll the more!  Try to rest, relax and not worry, things will all work our according to God's plan!!  Congrats!|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Don't stress yourself or baby with unnecessary thoughts on miscarriage... <br>  <br>  My story in finding out about expecting the arrival of my 2nd child:<br>  Was late. Woke up with chest pains. Decided to go to doc for EKG and also to take pregnancy test. <br>  <br>  This was my first time seeing doc - and the last...<br>  I gave my urine sample and took the EKG which was normal. I did these things with the nurse. After the testing, my kids's dad was standing in the doorway of the room chit chatting with me while holding our daughter. <br>  The doctor came in and said, "So you're pregnant. How far along are you?" We both yelled, "What?!?" They slammed the door in dad's face.<br>  The doctor turned to the nurse and said, "You didn't tell her yet?" She replied "no" by shaking her head. <br>  <br>  What kind of a f*ckin doctor just barges in like that, no introduction to who he is or anything; releases personal information in front of someone that is NOT the patient (HIPPA LAW?) and then tries to blame the nurse when she just took the test a few minutes ago, and why was the doctor asking ME how far along I was when he should be the one telling me?? <br>  Now you see why this was our first meeting and our last. <br>  <br>  Never the less, I was extremely happy with the great news! I laugh about this today. Turned out my new baby is a boy and so I had my pair. They are the best 2 kids ever (now 10 & 8) and I'm on my way to have number 3 (by surprise but a great surprise!) <br>  <br>  Congratulations, mom!|`|VvAOuXTCaa	I had a c-section with my first and got pregnant with my second when my first was only 9 months old! I thought that it was way to early because It had only been 9 months since I had the c-section. But my baby girl got here safe and sound. I carried her for 39 weeks & she was born 7.2 oz with red hair :) Good luck to you!|`|HrDcaocMaa	My daughter was #2 - I won't mention my expeirience because I know you want "Happy" stories....  BUT Let's just say that the happiest part for me was when she was finally out and I had my body back to myself!
EAzyjftKaa	Sice you stop brestfeeding becarfull the mini pill does not work. You might be pregnant again. It can happen. Use condoms in the mean time and then once your doctor changes your pill if posible (notpregnant) then you will be ok.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	it may have something to with the fact you stopped breast feeding last week...all your hormones are still adjusting you just had a baby and now your on th epill and now no breast feeding. im sure your body is just trying to sort itself out:) best to ask the doc anyway goodluck:) also watch out for any unusual large clotting.
rI9hlmWtaa	This is a beautiful and happy time of your life, i think you should just relax so you wont stress, since we know stressing is the worse thing you can do. Just be glad that you eat healthy and dont smoke or drink. your only 9 weeks prego and doing that a couple time wont harm your baby. Congrats!|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Probably not anymore than putting the phone close to your head is going to harm you or your child.  And activiated or not, it still receives radio signals...<br>  <br>  I have never read a reliable study that says that cell phone use is dangerous.<br>  <br>  "Current scientific evidence doesn't indicate any adverse health outcomes associated with exposure to radio frequency energy from cell phones," said U.S. Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman Peper Long"|`|eU5Eth2aaa	You are completely fine!

Good luckkk!!|`|robYLjhTaa	your cell phone will not harm your baby!!! otherwise they would be banned!!! or come with a health warning!<br>  <br>  relax because stress can effect your unborn!! x|`|rC6gL7KOaa	No. Relax!|`|ARUVea4yaa	its not like cell phone give off radiation...|`|zBz10IiOaa	no hun will not hurt baby at all if it did they would be warnings about it your totally fine no worries!|`|OuuYoSBeaa	Referring to the study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman Peper Long says there isn’t any scientific evidence to indicate adverse health outcomes linked to exposure to radio frequency energy from cell phones.<br>  There were studies done that suggested cell phone use could cause behaviour issues in children later, like hyperactivity, but the results are arguable. i wouldnt be concerned about your two times of useage. <br>  The end of the article i read, states "Whether use of cell phones while pregnant is harmful for babies remains to be confirmed by other studies." <br>  Its up to you whether you want to continue using your phone or not.|`|oojO4WAraa	No. That won't hurt anything.  Relax.|`|v3LnJycKaa	no your cell phone on in your pocket will not affect your baby at all, first at that stage the baby is tucked neatly behind your pubic bone, and second, I dont think phones give off the level of radiation that would be necessary to cause defects such as an xray machine would.
AA11542929	go to the hospital or call the doctor and tell them u want to be checked.. if it went thru ur body imagine what it could do to the baby..|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	If it didn't affect you at all then your baby will be fine since he/she is more protected then you are.|`|01vMpHkWaa	minor meaning do you have a burn mark? if no, then you are perfectly fine. dont worry at all!|`|WPI0Z47saa	If you are really worried then I would head to the ER to have an ultrasound done immediately to check on the baby. I always would rather play it safe then sorry.
kiAQi91laa	I would include some form of cardio to your routine.  This will speed your weight loss plan by burning calories faster.  If you have enough room in your house, consider purchasing a cardio equipment such as a treadmill, stationary bike, or elliptical trainer.  If you don't have any room and your toddler insist in participating in your routines then get some aerobics DVDs or stay dedicated to a aerobics workout of FIT TV channel.
d6e11chxaa	I think Finley is a lovely choice for you. I personally don't care for it on a girl, but it does work. Rose is a sweet, feminine choice that balances out the masculine feel of Finley. For your boy, I'm not sure Liam works in the middle, though. First of all, your first is already named after your husband. It seems to me Riley got left out. You have other lovely relatives you can name him after. I think Finley Jonathan sounds the best and keeps with naming your children after your family. I personally love long names. Also, Finley Liam sounds kind of awkward to me. The more I say it, it starts to sound like "Fin Lee-lee yam". It's not an awful choice at all, but you have much nicer options up there. Besides, do a family name count. Brody William -your husband. Riley -your family. James, his family. That's two for him and one for you. Finley isn't a family name that you've mentioned. Rose makes two for you and two for him. Jonathan does the same. Plus, Jonathan is a classic, clearly masculine name. It balances out the modern, unisex feel of Finley. That one's my vote!|`|uV4eDIaQaa	personally, I like Finley WIlliam|`|1jtMIrUiaa	I like Finley Joseph :) :)|`|LOH6UVh7aa	Finley Liam<br>  Very good celtic/Irish name. I like it!|`|5vtVsqx6aa	First, I like Finley Liam together. It flows nicely.<br>  <br>  Second, I do not like Finley for a girl, but just my opinion. Sounds slightly more masculine.<br>  <br>  Third, I am confused about your question about Liam being too close to William?  If William is your husband's middle name and you want to name a boy after your hubby, then what's wrong with Liam?  It is a nickname for William in many cases and seems to fit perfectly if you intend on naming the child after your husband.<br>  <br>  Fourth, Finley Joseph is okay, too.  Finley Jonathan is too long in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|B7NPXRoqaa	I like Finley Liam and Finley Rose, but I think if its a boy you should go with Finley Jonathon. I don't really like it as much, but your husband as two kids after his side of the family! You should have at least one!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I think Finley Liam sounds great with the other children's names.  I wouldn't use Finley on a girl though.|`|AA11946005	It's almost a tongue twister (with the ley ending of Finley and then the Lia in Liam).  I'd go with Jonathan- your hubby got his namesake already with Brody William, so give your dad a chance.|`|6yD5k9Azaa	Finley Liam is ok but i only like Finley for a girl<br>  i love Finley Rose|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No!|`|LoP2CRE2aa	Well first off, I absolutely adore finley on a girl! I had never really considered it before but I love it, especially with Rose. i also really like it as a boys name. Finley Liam souinds great, as do your other choices, and I don't see it as being too close to William at all. especially since they are both middle names. <br>  <br>  I have never really been one to think sibling names need to "go" together...unless were talking Anne, Beth, and Octavia or something (that sounds a little weird), so yeah, I think Riley, Brody, and Finley go well together!<br>  <br>  Good luck! Are you hoping for a boy or girl?
OaOf4oxQaa	I have two teenagers one is 18 and the other is 14. I never have this type of problems. I usually talk to them a lot, constantly show them my affection, love and care for them. I usually tell them, I will be with them no matter where life takes them as long as they make the right decisions. Such as go to school, get good grades, etc. One is already going to graduate, and the second is an 8th grader. He seems tired of school. He usually goes to the ranch with my father in the weekends and gets paid for that and he is also in boxing. If anything goes wrong at home he gets punished not doing what he likes. Anyway, enough about me, I think your son just wants freedom. Maybe you are being too hard on him. Try to keep calm when you talk to him, they need to feel that they are being treated as grown ups. If you loose control, he won't listen, if you are too demanding he won't pay attention and ignore you completely. Why don't you ask him, what he likes and what is he willing to do to develop his interests and abilities. That might work and open up some type of communication. It will probably get you to know him a little more, and he will start seeing you as someone who cares for him. Good luck.|`|d8ATUY76aa	me and my mom just had a huge arguement wich even included physically fighting. I am not a bad kid at all but i feel like my mom never listens to me and it hurts me alot dont yell at him. try not to tell him what to do just try asking. mayb you should try doing somthing together just the two of you. or ask him whats going on in his life. yes you are the parent but its still nice to be able to talk to you about things that are bothering us............good luck|`|qES5f0tqaa	Maybe you can get counseling they seemed to help me when I was going thur this.

As hard as it is maybe he is drinking or doing drugs. hope I help some life is hard I went thur the same thing girl you are going thur just stand by good luck hope he grows up soon for your sake as his|`|nTDlqdHIaa	Well he obviously looked up to his older brother and once he was gone he looked at that as an opportunity to be the "man" of the house and do as he pleased. You should have his older brother talk to him and explain to him that what he's doing is only hurting the both of you.

Many females including myself forget to take the pill once in a while although it is not an excuse it happens. But a male always has an option to protect himself as well.

I used to be an english teacher so I am very into saying things correctly. I do not blame that on my previous jobs but, it is almost comman sense not to say things like "lol" it is so annoying when people do this. I do believe it has something to do with texting and the fact that children and teenagers cannot stop themselves from using bad speech now-a-days! <br>  I do agree it is because of the downfall of an educated society. <br>  It is very sad and nobody thinks anything of it but people like you and me see it everyday and wish something was done about it. <br>  I really hope I helped you and thank you so much for pointing this out to everyone on here, maybe we can get a point accros to the Yahoo Answers community to make better choices while submitting their questions and answers on here. thanks so much. <br>  Carrie|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	It's just the way things are changing.

Everything changes, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's wrong.<br>  <br>  I do agree though, most of what I read on Yahoo Answers, and most other forums, is almost impossible to read. <br>  <br>  Short cuts don't bother me, but illiteracy makes me sad.|`|lBw50ySpaa	In this forum, I think some of it is just wanting to be quick and not caring.  But I agree that it has become more relaxed over the years.  I find that the same has happened with cursing.  I can't believe the words I hear parents and even coaches say in front of kids.  It may be somewhat the fault of the schools, but I think most of it lays in the hands of the parents.  These days it takes 2 working parents to support a child.  Then parents get just a few hours a day with their kids, and they don't want to spend all that time fussing and picking at them.  It is a shame.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I don't think the "it's the internet, it doesn't matter" ideology was taught in schools, so I doubt it's the education system, and most of the adults I know don't really text.  I think it's just laziness.  The perceived value of efficient communication is evidently dropping.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I think that just the internet in general is responsible for it. My niece is almost 12, and she recently just started going on the computer about a year ago, and her teacher called her mother in and told her she was writing in some weird slang. She was writing words like because as "bcuz". She was using internet slang on tests! I think we can all thank the internet for that.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	I think the system is bad. But sadly I am one of those bad spellers. Thank goodness for spell check. Just do not understand why people don't use spell check. I'm still working on my grammar too, since English is not my 1st language.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I think a lot of people are either just typing to fast and don't care to use the spell check or they just don't care period.|`|cA3DDRGraa	I agree 100%!!!!<br>  <br>  gram|`|6A62bmI9aa	I have five kids between the ages of 3 and 11.  I think the school system is not the problem as they speak pretty good english.  Rather, it is all the texting and instant messaging.  <br>  Therefore, my kids do not have cell phones and have very limited access to computers other than for research.  As far as how children speak, I think every generation has its slang.  The key is to know when using slang is appropriate.|`|fecUjSr1aa	Oh so true about your observations ... and yes, who is to blame?<br>  <br>  Modern technology is one culprit ...let me explain .. texting - where typos are legal and the main object is get the message across ..., lol, lmao, u're, etc. etc<br>  <br>  Today's society ... we have celebrities who call themselves modifying (i said modifying not murdering, ok? we're clear on this?) words line "Soulja boy" instead of Soldier Boy ..<br>  <br>  Well, Education is also to blame ... how much is spelling, essay writing, sentence construction and grammar emphasized in today's education.  I've been with people who could hardly write English when this is the language they speak.<br>  <br>  Parents? why not, after all, "Charity begins at home" we (i said we because i'm a parent) should be mindful on our children in their education. often time, we leave the television to take care of those "responsibilities" that we should be doing.<br>  <br>  TLC - Tender Loving Care ... there's no substitute for that ..|`|wUooHVU3aa	Yahoo posted an article on "is cursive dying out?" regarding the use of computers and abandoning of penmanship and use of cursive. The same seems to be true with texting. It's basically starting to replace actual written language. Strange and sad, all at the same time.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	It doesn't do any harm. It doesn't dumb anyone down. It doesn't effect learning ability, and it is just a harmless short cut, people use instead of talking formally all the time. <br>  <br>  It's a broad question you've asked, and you don't give any points, facts, or statistics to prove text language is the reason for downfall in grammar.... It's yahoo ... I' don't worry about my grammar much on here !!|`|UTb5chyJaa	I BELIEVE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM HAS TO TAKE SOME OF THE BLAME. HOWEVER, I MUST ADMIT I CATCH MYSELF TYPING THE WAY I TEXT QUITE OFTEN, I TRY NOT TO BUT IT'S JUST A BAD HABIT I GUESS. MOST OF THE TIME I AM IN A HURRY AND IT REALLY JUST COMES NATURALLY TO TYPE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. SO WHO'S TO BLAME, I DONT KNOW, BUT I THINK IT'S A COMBO OF BOTH. JUST MY OPINION. HAVE A GREAT DAY!|`|s2Dv9NRGaa	well i dont think texting has anything to do with it. Kids know how to spell they just choose not to use it all the time and if they HAD to then they could do it. Its just a hell of alot easier to use text talk rather than regular grammar.|`|iwUInpC1aa	I agree with you.<br>  <br>  I tell people that if they wish to text or email me they use the full CORRECT spelling or do not bother, as I will not answer them.<br>  <br>  The English language has gone to pot since Mobile Phone s came into being.|`|XMDN8N27aa	I type totally different from the way I text. On aim I don't use capital letters or punctuations. It  doesn't affect the way I write.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Texting, AIm..all of that.<br>  <br>  If i tlked how I tlk in txt then alot of ppl probly wudnt want 2 even read my answers lol
Wjdpm4xNaa	No, I dont see how that would make me take an answer more seriously.  And I answer questions if they are interesting, not because of the baby in the pic.|`|723QHuicaa	I think it draws you to the answer, like it stands out. But I dont think those answers are better or worse than the ones with the Y!A avatar, or none at all.<br>  <br>  It does help me recognose my contacts quickly, but then they change it and it throws me off a little!<br>  <br>  I have my daughter there because I love her and I wants her pic to represent me on this section, not because I think Ill get more best answers.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Nope. I answer questions that look interesting or seem like ones I''ve been through. Doesn't matter if it's a "cartoon" avatar or a real picture.<br>  <br>  I like having my son up and I like seeing my contact's babies but that doesn't mean I go through the questions searching for them.|`|ROJans2Taa	it doesn't matter to me either way, I have one of me and my kids, just because I thought it to be more personal, but for awhile I too was just using an avatar, I know some dont like having pics of their kids posted, for me though I already have public photo albums since my family is spread all throughout canada, so I figure the pics are already out there. I love seeing the babies people do put up, but in the end I just read the question and determine if I could be of assistance|`|iH2whFkHaa	Haha. I hadn't ever thought of this but maybe. It could subconsciously influence you. I don't actually consciously take anyone more seriously based on their avatar though.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	No. I just took the picture of my son off.|`|u94HOVz7aa	no i dont.  i uploaded a picture of my son on here because i got tired of getting other peoples avatars confused with mine because alot of them look alike.  just wanted to be a little diffrent.  i anwser questions basted on  wether or not i have any information i think would help or not.  and as for answers i read all my answers and base my thought on what they have to say not their avatar.|`|VY4LqfLpaa	yes and no...I'll answer any question that seems interesting to me, but I do catch myself looking for baby pictures that I see on regularly and tend to pay more attention to them I guess...doesn't mean that I'm necessarily going to answer though...<br>  <br>  I'm just glad I was finaly able to get a picture of our little guy on here...|`|E5CnUdhsaa	no not really. all i think of pics is aaaaw thats cute or hmmm that avatar has nice hair maybe i should change mine haha. i take all questions seriously in the parenting section as you never know except of couse the obvious i had sex with my clothes on and now im preggo troll questions;)|`|OuuYoSBeaa	i dont look at the avatar nor do i read the names most of the time. its irrelavant to the question in my books.|`|AA11795652	No, because not everyone uploads pics onto here.  I've had my account forever and never put pics of my kids on here.|`|DKfScL8taa	No not at all. I just recently changed mine from an avatar to my baby, but it doesn't make any difference to me.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Makes no difference to me! But I do like seeing other cute babies and getting to show my beautiful children off.|`|nmu6coapaa	No of course not|`|FKR45WLPaa	I don't think so.  I haven't put my daughter's pic on here because I feel funny about it.  I don't want the world to have access to her picture.  But I really enjoy looking at other people's pics. But I pay attention to the question.  If it is something that I can help someone with, I don't care whether there is a picture or not.|`|83nHy2PXaa	no, why would it be so? It makes no difference for me..<br>  I do answer seriously and do not have a picture at all...
S1gJJHNzaa	your test would be positive by now for sure if you were pregnant.<br>  <br>  i suggest seeing your dr to have blood drawn and possibly find out why your period is off.. that in itself will make ttc harder.<br>  <br>  good luck and God Bless!|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	definitely go the next step and get blood test to confirm pregnancy.. im 18 days late and also getting bfn from hpt but that being said I feel like I am pregnant and have many symptoms.

KyFCYs0Yaa	Yep. That is perfect breast milk poop. congratulations on your little baby!|`|hVVALFAPaa	That is absolutely normal for a breast fed child!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Very normal,   my son always looked like cottage cheese with a mustard color while he was breastfeed.  Its just curdeled milk.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	Totally normal.. Gross though huh?
xLNl0f14aa	with my daughter they did an ultrasound at 38 weeks and said it said she was only 4lbs 9 oz and the dr said give or take a lb.. well she was almost 3 weeks past due and was 6lbs 10 oz..granted i had a lot of trouble gaining weight with her..i only gained 13 lbs all together..|`|b3CwObBdaa	well, i only had one ultrasound at 20 weeks.  however, i have heard that the ultrasound can be wrong by up to 2lbs, so i wouldn't even take the amount that they told you as gospel truth.  as long as she is within 'normal' range than don't worry about it.|`|v3LnJycKaa	last few weeks babies puto n an ounce a day, so just right around 7 pounds.|`|33fa67ba937f7dc93091ebd71003e511aa	The ultrasound tech can only give you an estimate about how much the baby weights. They can not tell you the correct weight of the baby. Your baby could weight less or could be more. At my last ultrasound they said that my son was some over 7 pounds. He came out 2 days later weighting almost 6 pounds. And they was about 12 ounces off with my daughter as well.  But they could right. Congrats on the baby!|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	hard to say for sure. But ultrasounds have been wrong, if this is your 1st pregnancy you might be surprised. My doctor estimated 7 lbs for my 1st baby boy and he came out weighing 8lbs 6 oz! Congrats!|`|5ZwIASCgaa	My last ultra sound they said about 7lbs 7 oz give or take a pound so my son had a chance of being 6lbs 7oz - 8lbs 7oz.....i ended up being a week late and was induced he was 8lbs 5 oz....ur baby might be 7lbs when she is born they just do and estimate...Good luck!|`|kT7GVOosaa	if she is over 7lbs it shouldn't be by much. Congrats!|`|HMPdnhApaa	It's hard to tell...they told me my daughter would be close to 8 pounds and she was born 6 lbs. 6 oz.  As long as they are a healthy weight and can go home I wouldn't worry about it.|`|hTP75xwTaa	yes that's about how much he weighted the day b4 i had him but he came out 7.14oz and 19.5in long
a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	I would just get a car seat frame.  It is inexpensive(unlike systems that are $200-400), easier to use and not as bulky as a whole system.  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5246102" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  Then you can by a separate lightweight reclining stroller that is slimmer and easier to use that the travel systems when your baby is old enough.  We have the Phil&Ted but this one looks nice.<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10196552" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  My friend has a travel system and when we go somewhere like the mall, she gets stuck wedged between racks and rows.  It takes her about 30 mins to wrestle the stroller part out, open it and then attach the car seat.  It takes me less than 5 mins  :)   <br>  <br>  The less you have to lug around with a baby the better.|`|sxsx9sHNaa	I bought the Graco one from walmart, it comes with an infant seat that is also a car seat.  I still use it (baby is 2) and really like it.  As baby gets onder (about two) you will want one that is less big and heavy (but not an umbrella stroller unless you are really short).|`|cf510fbc79fab61d326781329455381eaa	I used the Evenflo Journey travel system. But if I had the money I would get the Chcco set...wonderful!
ZEYEmYRtaa	Some ppl get very early preg symptoms so yh your could know,,,<br>  Only one way to find out... <br>  I hope u get the answer u want x<br>  Gd luck x|`|k4c24zblaa	Hey girls I found out I was pregnant when I was only about 2 weeks along. Go buy a test and if it's negative wait about a week or so and take another one, what do you have to lose, I know you may be anxious but trust me this has been the longest 12 weeks of my life, since I found out so soon!lol But like I said you don't have anything to lose buy one of those double packs take one and save the other or you may not have to! Anyways tho good luck!|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Depends on when you ovulated, I would say CD 19 is a little early, when implantation occurs (which is 6-12 days past ovulation) that is when the HCG hormone is released and symptoms can begin.  There are some women who can feel slight changes in the first week, but I don't know how much would really change.  If you just "feel" like something is different, then it probably is. <br>   Good Luck!!|`|txSiQc7Waa	I really wish everyone could just "know". Would make this waiting game SO much easier lol. <br>  <br>  I've read about a lot of women saying around the time of implantation that they just knew something was up. But as far as symptoms go, those usually don't occur until hcg is built up in your system.. so it really depends on when your ovulation/implantation occured :) Good luck to you and baby dust! I hope you do just "know"!|`|d1csiCLKaa	LOL to the smelly oxsters bit<br>   <br>  I have been feeling the same for the last 2 days and im on CD13 today.<br>  <br>  I guess you will just have to wait and see if AF arrives and of not do a test.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|0upnZ6hSaa	I'm in the same situation!!!  It's day 22 for me!  I've been reading all day on line that some women may experience it early---especially if it's your 2nd.  (this will be my 2nd)  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK to both of us!|`|82SVxof9aa	I think that if you have a "feeling" it is a good possibility you are pregnant. When I was pregnant with my son I knew it in my heart first....good luck|`|Gn4iNKPSaa	Only time will tell.....
BUOJJpaCaa	Congratulations for you.<br>  <br>  Your friend will now have to start her waiting period over.<br>  <br>  Cops moods change.  The distance between your house and the destination are also factors that play into it.|`|yV8fog7Paa	exactly what the first poster did, depends on the mood of the cop and your attitude. But, I do think you should have gotten a ticket for doing that as well.|`|hswTS1jVaa	Because it depends on the cop and what kind of mood he was in and how you acted when you were stopped.|`|hGY08GjRaa	Every cop is different.  I have gotten stopped 3 times for forgetting to turn my headlights on at night (You know...I just came out of a store, the city was well-lighted, and so I didn't notice that I hadn't turned them on yet.) One cop gave me a verbal warning, one gave me a written warning, and one almost gave me a ticket.. they're all different. <br>  <br>  Cops are also trained, I think, to detect subtle eye cues and body language that indicate a person  is lying.. that may be why your friend got busted.|`|ySKK7lCyaa	all depends on the cop, what she was doing when she got pulled over and how she talked to him. <br>  <br>  To get to the point you both made a risky decision and now she probably will not get her license till she is 18,|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Maybe the cop was smart enough to know she was lying!|`|lTsPX04jaa	it depends on what cop stops you|`|UZKfRM8naa	You definitely should have gotten in trouble. The cop may have been in a good mood and let you off because he could tell you were at least honest.<br>  <br>  Do you understand that you only have a permit? This means you don't know everything you need to about driving. This was a stupid idea that could have cost you or someone else their life.|`|8CuQa2OJaa	Most cops are different. Maybe he didn't beleive her, or maybe he was in a bad mood. It was probably a different cop though.|`|lApcAlzmaa	prolly because she was lieing and she wasnt very convincing.<br>  you werent lieing so you werent trying to convince someone!!!<br>  idk sometimes things just turn out like that!|`|FERfSYtzaa	well that's because it depend on the cop that pull you over, sometime they just be on there daily mood swing and giving out tickets for free days:)

Fa130w6Gaa	It could be implantation cramping. It's actually kind of early for AF too. Usually it does take longer to get many symptoms but some women get them sooner. Don't give up! Wait and see, this could be your month! I'm at about the same place as you right now. This waiting to find out if you are or not really sucks! Lots of baby dust to you!|`|e5a8ca9a40c842fd6f909812078000a7aa	Awww hun, i hope the pains don't last for too long!

I am sending you a dump truck full of baby dust!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOOD LUCK HUN!!! keep me posted!!!!!|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	It is very possible that you are at the implantation stage, the symptoms you have can be from either or. I know it sucks and it's confusing I'm right there with you right now. I personally with my first child don't remember having symptoms untill about 2 wks after i got my positive result i was about 6wks along already that's when the nausea started really bad, at first i just didn't have an apetite finally my family forced me to eat and i threw up right away. I was really sleepy and tired all day long! but every woman is different you may very well be having symptoms already! in most sites i've checked it says nausea doesn't normally start untill you're about 4wks. but either way don't lose hopes! good luck<br>  ~*BABY DUST*~|`|6lKbDEFDaa	I wish you the absolute best of luck **BABY DUST**<br>  I have actually been experiencing some cramping since 5-6 dpo. They still havent gone away. AF is due on the 2nd, so maybe this is our month! :D<br>  Again, all the best ;-)|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Don't give up hope yet dear!!!!  I read from somewhere you can have implantation as early as 4 dpo.  Just because it says 6-12 dpo, doesn't mean you can't have implantation earlier then planned!  =)  Lets hope that's what it is!  Awwww!!!!|`|yznZqcznaa	Well my boobs started hurting about that time. Then at 10 DPO I got a positive test but was cramping pretty bad so I thought it was a MC again. The doctor said not to worry it is normal.  I am now 11 weeks 2 days and the baby is very healthy so far.  So who knows it may just be your month.

I have one baby boy and am now currently  pregnant ... it's a miracle drug! <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|MHgm9bysaa	i don't see anything wrong with having sex anytime of the day,week or month. If you want to know when you're ovulating while on clomid, go to www.babymed.com , there's a clomid ovulation calculator in there. Just input the first day you took the first clomid pill, and it'll give you an approximate date you should expect to ovulate.  Good luck!
fYMWDQLGaa	Hi I am on TTC from feb. I ovulated and BDed on the fertile days. <br>  <br>   My period is due march 4th. in btw i had many symptoms like sore  nipples right form 2 days after i ovulated. and 2 days later lotiony discharge and mild cramps here and there around uterus. <br>  <br>    I dont have my hopes up cos the conception happens after 5 days after ovulating. so im confused and cant wait. <br>  <br>  2ww is really a waiting game. <br>  <br>  goodluck and baby dust  dear,,,|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	I am at 11 DPO - but I had to get up early this morning, so I can't tell anything from my BBT this morning.   I took a Dollar Tree test with fmu this morning, but it was negative, and I should know better - since with my previous pregnancy I did not get a faint positive on one of those cheap tests until 18 DPO! (I got postives on Answer and Walgreens tests earlier).  If I am not pregnant, my period should start in another two or three days (my luteal phase is consistantly 13-14 days long).|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	Mine ends this weekend. I am trying to wait until Sat. I ovulated Valentines weekend and had some spotting about 5 days after we BD'd and my skin has been clearer and I am still having a little bit of EWCM every day since. We will be fine with either outcome I just want to know! Baby dust!|`|xayYdIfHaa	I wish I even knew when my 2ww was! I'm all over the place with my cycle and its driving me insane! Last cycle was Jan 24, and since my loss my cycle has been about 43 days. I'm pretty sure my body just has a mind of its own, and does what it wants when it wants lol.<br>  Good luck, and baby dust to you :)|`|SwyxANphaa	My 2ww ends on Saturday, and I currently have menstrual cramps (but no AF), sore breasts, breakouts, general mood swings, and a bit of nausea.

0nIwKd5Uaa	Give the kid something to do. Sounds like he is bored out of his mind.<br>  When my kids have been outside, to sports, or just exercised they listen better and are less destructive. <br>  <br>  Take him outside to play.<br>  Go to the YMCA and let him swim or run off some energy.|`|3928ccf010c3c956e363056a7e98cce0aa	A little smack on the butt checks does not hurt.|`|KOqaRmJQaa	First, I would stop referring to him as a trouble son. That doesn't help him. Take a deep breath and remember that he is just a kid and you are just one person trying to do the best you can.<br>  <br>  OK....now that I'm done sounding pious, my suggestion (which has worked well in my three boy household) is to make him clean the mess. It may take several minutes or even an hour or two, but once he sees that you will not back down he will think twice before making another mess that he has to clean up.<br>  <br>  You are not alone. Every mom in America has this problem. Just try to remember that he is a good kid.|`|1KKXD1tMaa	just leave him alone he just wants the attention if u leave him alone he will stop what he is doing|`|7B4vcBTvaa	Beat him until he faints
wObFm9B4aa	prob the onset of UTI or just increased activity <br>  all else fail go and see your Doc they don't bite and if they do find another
5ZwIASCgaa	My doctor told me my son can go on anything except a boat to wait AT LEAST till he was six months!!|`|G2auAv1Saa	With a life jacket<br>  <br>  <br>  Statistics show the accident risk is exponentially lower than a car. Do you guys think twice about putting your child in a car?|`|Vad64Jjoaa	No I wouldn't personally, but I have an abnormal fear of boats. We went on vacation a couple of years ago in San Diego and went on one of those 1 hour cruises that takes you around the bay. I panicked the whole time with my then 8 year old son running around the boat and looking over the edge. My husband was so embarrassed, LOL. But if you feel safe and the baby has the right safety gear on then I don't see any reason not to. The baby might get sea sick though, I don't know.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I took my son on a boat at 3 months. And he was on a jet ski at 6 months (not by himself, obviously, and it was going very slowly). As long as the baby is wearing a life jacket and whoever's watching him knows how to swim, no big deal!|`|ZVCm3XAEaa	My daughter was 8 weeks old when I took her on a boat but it was on a passenger ferry.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	With a properly fitting infant life jacket to be worn at all times.|`|N3uuSIBBaa	This is a tricky question.  I would base it on several factors.  <br>  1)Do you have a life jacket?<br>  2)What are you going to be doing on the boat?<br>  3)What kind of boat are you on?<br>  4)How big/choppy is the body of water?<br>  5)What do you feel in your gut?<br>  <br>  Babies don't often like wearing bulky life jackets so be sure YOU are wearing one!  That way you would be able to stay afloat if something happened.  Wear one even if you don't normally wear one on the boat.  Also, don't take the baby on a crazy ride on choppy water.  If it is a slow boat ride around the lake that is better...or if you are just going from the boat launch to the beach or something.   If the boat has a cabin that could keep the baby out of the wind and sun that is better too. It also keeps them away from the water!  I took my baby on our family boat when she was about 3 months old.  I was pretty nervous the whole time...but she was fine.  I think if I could do it over again, I wouldn't take her though.  It was stressful for me.  I would totally take her if I was just going from the boat launch to the beach or something really quick.  But not if we were going out to ski, tube, wake board, etc. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps! Have fun boating...|`|jhPlVj0oaa	Hi, since the question is 'would you take your baby....' then my answer would be NO.  But, I guess there are guidelines that tell you whether or not you should do so.  I was invited to a wedding that involved going on a fairly small boat when my son was 10 weeks.  I declined. hope that helps.
ZL92cpPJaa	Wow. that sucks.<br>  OK, big decision for you two.<br>  On one hand, you both want a baby, there' s nothing wrong with wanting to have that.<br>  You do need to consider that your money will be tight, and you're working AND in school.<br>  You both have cars, so transportation won't be a problem.<br>  On the other hand, you can wait. Save up some money for a couple of years, graduate, get a flexible, well-paying job, and when the time is right, have the baby.<br>  I won't give you a decision, but those are what you two should consider.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Don't abort the baby. Find someone who will adopt the baby. Do you really want a doctor to suck your baby's brains out of it's head? Is that what it deserves because two grown people are too immature to take care of their responsibilities?<br>  <br>  Ages 20 and 21 are more than acceptable ages. Your parents are talking like you guys are 15.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	you two are legally considered adults. despite what your family thinks it was YOUR choice (and the g/f) to have sex and make a baby and i think that the two of you should hold up your end of the deal and take care of the baby.(even if you give it up for adoption) as for your parents i think they are being idiots. i would NEVER tell my kid to abort a baby, whether or not they are married. you really need to talk to your g/f about what the two of you want and what the two of you can handle. if you think you and her can really make a go of it on your own (but together) and you think you are ready for a baby then by all means do it. who cares what 'the family' thinks? if your family truly loved you unconditionally then they wouldn't be trying to make you make a choice like this|`|eF6HTt0gaa	As someone who was given up for adoption this is a very good choice over aborting or not being ready to keep it. Your parents arent treating you like the adults you are and shouldnt be pushing you the way they are. Its yours and hers decision not theirs. So sit down and think long and hard about this before making any type of judgment. I still to this wonder why i was given up but figure it was because they where not ready to be parents and knew someone would love me as much as they did creating me. Good luck to you both
Fh4B88ZGaa	It's all normal- more of your blood flow is going to the baby, and is diverted away from other things. Shortness of breath is also normal, partly from less room in your abdominal cavity and increased need for oxygen.<br>  <br>  Read "What to Expect"- goes over all of this stuff, then you won't have to worry.|`|utfoP7GWaa	I just started with this about 2 weeks ago. It's MISERABLE! I had childhood asthma, and this feels very similar! <br>  <br>  I think it's gonna be worth it though...LOL!|`|bfmoMc4Haa	this is perfectly normal during pregnancy,<br>  <br>  its uncomfortable and worrying but it occurs alot and i've been to the hospital many times complaining of dizzyness and shortness of breath and sometimes fainting and was told that its normal.<br>  <br>  your heart is working overtime to pump blood to you and your uterus so it will beat fast to keep you and little one in good health,<br>  <br>  most pregnant women do need iron supplements which can help you feel stronger and more energised. your pre-natal vitamins have iron in them but i also take a added supplement and it helps and keeps baby well supplied with essential iron,<br>  <br>  im 38 weeks preg and still feel faint and light headed and im having a healthy pregnancy so dont worry too much!<br>  <br>  good luck and congrats!|`|AA11542929	its normal.. im at the end and well i run outta breath fast and i can be sitting down and have shortness of breath... its ur uterus pushng up on ur lungs and growing...|`|P7tue78Aaa	I have also had shortness of breath. All your symptoms sound normal but you should tell your doc about them the next time you have an appointment.
Ka52nbhNaa	You could put a few saline (just non-medicated saline) drops in his nose and then use a nasal aspirator to suck it all out.  Here is a kit:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.diapers.com/Product/ProductDetail.aspx?productId=5997" rel="nofollow">http://www.diapers.com/Product/ProductDe...</a><br>  <br>  You cannot give a 5 month old any cough medications.  Keep him warm, lots of snuggles, run a humidifier and maybe some Vicks Baby Rub on the chest.<br>  <br>  You can also hold him in the bathroom with the shower going on hot so that the steam will help to clear his chest some.<br>  <br>  Hope he feels better!|`|pXSKSS3daa	No medication.<br>  <br>  Try some nose drops and a nasal aspirator to suck the mucus out. If he's congested too you can put a bit of Vicks baby rub on his chest as well as using a humidifier or sitting in the bathroom with him while a steamy shower runs.|`|YEqQZgs5aa	also if you have him sleep sitting up, like in a bouncy chair or something it will help it to drain better down his throat n not get as clogged up.. I put the bouncy chair right in his crib so he still in his regular surroundings!|`|JgZwvXXJaa	no meds yet, just saline spray for noses also I noticed works good is use the nose spray then do tummy time it is grouse but the snot will run out.
856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	My advice is to make a doctor's appointment.  There is no way to tell if you don't.  If you are older, you could just be experiencing the change of your body. I am 39 and have always have periods like clockwork, but the older I get, the worse it all gets....the symptoms are WAY worse than they ever were with the headaches, migraines, cramps, irritability, and such.  My doc says that is normal for my age.  The bleeding itself is a little different too.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you could also have an infection of the uterus or bladdar or female parts.  You can buy tests to detect infections like this at your local drugstore also.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Is there a reason you haven't taken a test yet?<br>  <br>  Of course you could be pregnant and you could be almost 3 months...|`|NNwEuC8paa	I think you are pregnant Id get a test and take it first thing in the morning if that comes negative then call your doctor tell her whats going on and she'll do a blood test. Good luck!|`|xTcIshYvaa	you could be. the spotting could mean you have a high risk pregnancy & could have a miscarriage, but it could mean other things. I had this happen a few times early in my pregnancy so I was not allowed to work & had to rest. have your doc do a pregnancy test and be sure to tell them everything you included here. good luck!
vqUVWPBAaa	You have to take the pill a month before you are protected, I think. You should contact your doctor.|`|ARUVea4yaa	those symptoms could be from the pill i knew a girl that was nauseous the first three months of taking the pill|`|xTcIshYvaa	I would call your doc because birth control shouldn't be taken if you are pregnant. Good luck!|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	You definitely have some of the major symptoms of pregnancy.  If you feel you may be pregnant and would want to keep the child, then STOP the birth control pills immediately or they will give you a miscarriage.  I have been pregnant 25 times in my life and every time my breasts are sore, and I am very tired.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, I never had a brownish discharge from being pregnant either.  You may have some type of infection.  The only way to tell is to visit your doctor.  He will know right away, and set your mind at ease.  But again...stop taking the pills immediately if you think you may want to keep the baby (potentially).  They will hurt the baby.  Sorry I wasn't much help.<br>  <br>  Kelly

kT7GVOosaa	I just got diagnosed with broncitious and I am 25 weeks pregnant. I was told cough drops are ok if you use them very sparingly. I use sugar free jolly ranchers. they moisten my throat and don't have anything harmful in them. for the headache try relaxing, resting your back (I know that sounds odd but resting my back always helps my head) the sore throat will pass in time it just may be a miserable few days.|`|3Se5nlJtaa	Try taking a warm bath. Use some kind of relaxation bubble bath. A lot of times the aroma will help with the headache. As for the sore throat I do not have much help for you there. I am not pregnant and have had a sore throat for five days and can not find anything that helps could not imagine being pregnant looking for something. Hope that bubble bath helps you to relax,|`|AA11795652	In your question you typed "bed" instead of "be" and that's one answer.  You probably need some extra sleep.  Also, for my headaches, caffeine helped me so I would drink a cup of coffee or a soda and that help my head a lot.  One cup here and there during pregnancy won't hurt.  As for the sore throat, keep gargling and if you can tolerate some orange juice go for it.  I couldn't stand orange juice while pregnant.  Good luck!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Go to the doctor!  If this could be a bacterial infection, there are antibiotics safe to take during pregnancy.|`|AA11901821	warm up a heating pad, put it on your shoulders and relax. take  a nap and rest. your body sounds like its out of whack, and needs to rest to rejuvenate itself so that it can be well again.<br>  If all else fails, buy some white grape juice and drink that. works well for sore throats without resorting to medication|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	For me I drink as much water as I can stand and try to get some sleep. It always makes me feel better right away. Try drinking tea.|`|dn2UCOkqaa	Go to the Doctor. That should be common sense right there.
wOSv0Y2gaa	after having a baby u bleed for 6 weeks...and even tho u just stared bc u can get preg. because ur body is trying to get back on track of not being preg.

I still do not like her name,i love her but Riley no matter how its spelled is a boys name or i think of Fort Riley Kansas.<br>  There are so many pretty girls names i just do not know why anyone gives them boys names or made up ones,whats the point really?<br>  To each their own i suppose,just my opinion.<br>  If you like unusual names that are girls there are plenty of those to choose from also.Audra Grace<br>  Mitzi Katherine<br>  Frieda Rose<br>  Elsa Maureen<br>  Cordelia Renee<br>  Azra Gwendolyn<br>  Magnolia Desiree<br>  Nora Corrine<br>  Lorena Darlene<br>  Robyn Leigh<br>  Viola Cathleen<br>  Sylvia Noelle<br>  Sybil Rochelle<br>  Quida Roxanne<br>  Nola Gayle<br>  good luck,keep it real!|`|UjsQRzAfaa	I LOVE the name Harper and wanted it as my daughters name for a long time... but it is getting popular. We are now pregnant and if we have a girl we are naming her Finley. BUT Harper is gorgeous. And I love the name Riley, as it was my grandmothers maiden name and my 8 month old sons, name. But usually the rule of thumb is do not start the middle name with what your first name ends with. Too tongue tied to say. HarpeR Riley. Two 'R's.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lyn|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I think they are fine together. How often will you call her by both names? Harper Riley is fine.<br>  <br>  As a side note: I don't think Harper is a good name at all. First, it sounds somewhat masculine and second all I think of is "harp" - to dwell on persistently <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11946005	Seperately yes, they are great names, together, too much trendiness for one girl to endure.  Since Riley has special meaning I'd keep Riley in the mix and find another first name.  Use Harper for your second child, if you should have one.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	I like the sound of it! I absolutely love Harper and, though Riley is getting quite common, I like that it is for a special reason.<br>  <br>  Harper Riley is a great name!|`|e4e2b4a25d405bbec926275fa608dc53aa	I am glad you said it was for a girl in the description because just by looking at it I would have guessed you're naming a little boy. That definitely isn't my style...doesn't sound feminine AT ALL. Good Luck!|`|6yD5k9Azaa	I think Harper Riley is a beautiful name :D<br>  <br>  Harper Rose <br>  Harper Mae<br>  Harper Grace<br>  Harper Leann|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I think that they flow great and that is a beautiful name, congrats & good luck~
uFrqC4Y2aa	It's very good for you. It's made of soy. I only like it when prepared certain ways. Not a fan of the texture|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	Tofu is also called Bean Curd, and it's made from soybeans.  It is high in protein but it's also high in estrogen, and personally, I avoid anything made with soy, as it is so high in phyto-estrogens that it should be considered a drug.  Especially if you are having a baby boy, avoid the soy.|`|AA11294818	It's basically a whitish sponge looking food that is usually sold in a small brick size at the grocery and will be refrigerated. It's made from soy beans.<br>  I love tofu. But eat way too much of soy products. I love steamed edamame beans, tofu, soy milk, soy icecream, miso soup, all things made of soy beans. So when I fell pregnant, I stopped eating soy products because one reason I eat them normally is their hormonal effects which clear up my skin... which means that they probably mess with my hormones and I don't want to do that while carrying a baby just in case. So for you, I think eating soy in moderation would be fine, however studies show that the most beneficial soy products healthwise are actually the fermented kind (like fermented soy sauce or miso). Anyhow, for me, soy had to be cut out because I eat waaaay to much of it otherwise. I also read a study on penis size (no joke) of babies born to soy-crazy moms. Didn't make a huge difference but there was one anyhow. That kind of confirmed my suspicions on how strong its hormone effects really are. So if you have any, be very conservative with it.<br>  <br>  Tofu can be bought in a package at the store, you can cut it in chunks and fry it in your stirfries with veggies, you can do anything with it! It doesn't need to be fully cooked so no worries on poisoning if you're not sure how to prepare it at first. One cool thing you could try with tofu is go to a Thai food place or other restaurant and order a dish with some tofu in it, or get tofu to replace, let's say, beef if there's a vegetarian option.<br>  <br>  If you're thinking about trying tofu for health reasons... consider edamame beans.. they can be steamed  for 5 min in their pods and then sprinkled with sea salt. Then I eat them sucking them out of the pods and discarding the pods. They have a buttery bean taste to them, hard to describe but very delicious and pretty healthy I'd say. (and it's the raw source of tofu!)|`|DDFSITiYaa	Tofu is soybean and it should be ok.  Check with your doctor.  <br>  <br>  It is generally tasteless and absorbs the flavor of other foods it is cooked with.  I have made it in stir fry in place of chicken.  I will warn you it has a spongy texture which is why I really dont use it anymore.  I did feed it to my toddlers tho, when they were young.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I heard it is great to eat during pregnancy but I can honestly says I can't stand the taste of it.  I am a southern girl and like alot of seasoning...it is just bland.

Pero, sabes, eso solamente pasa cuando no hacemos nada por cambiar las cosas, se que parece que tu mamá tiene la obligación de acercarte a ti, pero  talvez ella tampoco encuentra la manera, recuerda que no hay nada que te ense?e a ser hijo o hija y tampoco hay algo que te diga como ser mamá o papá, lo que trato de decirte es que nosotros somos responsables de nosotros mismos y si quieres que pase algo tienes que provocarlo, no esperar a que pase, si lo que que quieres es tener una relación más cercana con tu mamá tienes que buscarla, y no esperes que  si ahora no existe, se dé con uno o dos intentos de tu parte, es algo que tienes que estar trabajando constantemente, y es importate que trates de decirle a tu mamá lo que sientes; creeme que ella te entiende más de lo que tu te imaginas, tal vez no estes de acuerdo en lo que ella te diga pero el tener una buena relación con tu mami, no quiere decir que tengan que estar de acuerdo en todo, pues al igual que con los amigos, los padres cometen errores, toman desiciones equivocadas, y tienen diferentes puntos de vista, pero siempre están cuando realmente los necesitas, "ojo" dije cuando los necesitas, no siempre que tu quieras, recuerdas que te dije que nadie púede estar en las buenas y en las malas, es lo mismo. <br>  No te tires al drama y te la pases preocupandote de todo mejor ocupate y busca actividades que te permitan convivir con más gente, amigos no necesitas tener por cientos, puede ser uno solo pero de verdad. <br>  <br>  Te mando un abrazo.<br>  <br>  Saludos y suerte!!!|`|5aNMm9B5aa	bueno, pues aver yo te aconsejo que hables con tu madre y que hagas amigas, eso si, no intentes hacerlas haciendote la chula, insultando a otros/as... porque así lo unico que vas a conseguir son enemigas!!!<br>  <br>  Suerte!|`|9nc8p2xtaa	si  tu  edad  es  una  etapa  difícil <br>  pero  piensa  que  eso  es  lo  que  piensa  tu  te  sientes  incomprendida  <br>  yo  a pesar  de  que no  me  escuchen  o no  me entiendan <br>  cuando  quiero  algo  insisto  una  y  otra  vez <br>  puedes  pedir  ayuda  en  tu  colegio  hay  un tutor  de los  alumnos   <br>  a  pesar  que  dices  que tu  madre  no  te  entiende habla  con  ella  <br>  en  cualquier  caso  para  que  te  hagan  caso  tienes  que  <br>  empezar  por  pedir  por  favor  que  necesitas  hablar  que  cuando  tiene  la otra  persona  un  tiempo  para  escucharte  <br>  y  todo  eso  No  hacerlo  como  con una  rabieta  de ni?a  tonta  o  mimada  si  no  que  con responsabilidad  y  seriedad <br>  le  dices  a tu  madre  que  quieres  como te  sientes  que  te pasa y  con  el  tutor  o  tutora  de  colegio  tan  bien   en  los  barrios  suele  haber  un  centro  social  con una  trabajadora  social   también    puedes  pedir  en  ellos  cita  para  hablar  con la trabajadora  social   y  ella  tan  bien  puede  orientarte  informarte  de  que  cosas  tienes  cerca  de donde  vives  para  relacionarte  con  mas  chicas  de tu  edad|`|JGSbQTltaa	No seas boba!!! por favor espero que te arrepientas de lo que estas diciendo, se que tu vida es triste pero no hay porque bajar los brasos, aunque tu mamá no lo demuestre no es el fin del mundo, a parte la vida de uno no tiene precio, vos pensaras que nadie te quiere pero no es asi, por favor no hagas cosas que pueden lastimar mucho principalmente a tu amiga porque por algo esta al lado tuyo, tambien debes pensar en el futuro, algun dia vas a conocer al amor de tu vida, vas a tener hijos y vas a ser realmente feliz, uno muere cuando la vida lo dicta asi, ahora no es el  momento debes enfrentar tus problemas. que se yo buscate un trabajo, sali de tu casa. sali a bailar, conoce gente, pasala bien, pero no pongas cosas en tu cabeza tan feas como las que acabas de decir, no te conozco pero conoci a una chica que era asi como vos. y sabes el triste final que tuvo, es hasta el dia de hoy que nunca me voy a olvidar, es el sufrimiento mas grande que le podes dar a tu entorno no hagas una estupidez. TODO TIENE SOLUCION HACEME CASO!!! <br>  NO TE CONOZCO PERO TE ENTIENDO. SE QUE ES DIFICIL UNA VIDA ASI, PERO DE TODO LO MALO. AL FINAL DEL CAMINO HAY ALGO BUENO.<br>  Espero te haya servido mis palabras.<br>  cuidate mucho<br>  Marifer04_justinlove@hotmail.com <br>  cualquier cosa escribime|`|LjWVBQHDaa	NO PIENSES EN MORIR lo mejor que tienes es la vida, piensa en todas las cosas hermosas que aun vas a experimentar, hay veces que si se siente esa frustración, desesperación, angustia, etc. a mi me pasa algo similar pero con mi papa, mi mama ya fallecio (ella si me comprendía) tal vez suene algo tonto y dificil pero HABLA CON TU MAMA haste escuchar por ella aunque no quiera debe saber lo que sientes, si ni asi consigues alguna mejora, entonces apoyate de tu amiga y esfuerzate en tus estudios aprovecha si te dan esa oportunidad y veras que muy pronto serás independiente de ella, pero para esto debes tener buenos conocimientos que te hagan salir adelante.<br>  Bye, echale muchas ganas, suerte.

Yo se que estas pasando por una etapa dificil, mas yo se que también tienes la capacidad y la madurez para soportar esto y más. Platica con tu mamá, trata de expresarle tus sentimientos, si ves que no se abre, pues no te preocupes, simplemente hay gente que no se abre en cuestión de sentimientos. Recuerda que con que tengas un buen amigo, vale la pena, ya que en ocasiones nos rodean mucha gente que llamamos amigos, pero a la hora de la verdad nadie esta ahi para acompa?arnos. Disfruta esta etapa que tienes, no vivas con la ansiedad o depresión, recuerda que siempre sale el sol para todos, simplemente estas en un momento de angustia y desesperación. <br>  Yo te recomendaria que visitaras un psicologo, para que con este puedas desahogar todas tus penas. Cuidate mucho y recuerda que por el simple hecho de nacer y estar en este mundo eres especial, la vida no siempre te va a tratar de esta manera, creeme que no, esta solo es una etapa mala. En un futuro van a venir mejores momentos y estos momentos te garatizo que no te los vas a querer perder. Suerte y estoy a tus ordenes.<br>  borregoeegz@yahoo.com.mx|`|cE6Ohh6Vaa	Por Dios!!!!!!!!! cómo vas querer morirte, la vida es lo más bello que hay. Mira yo también pase esa época en la que creía que era el centro del universo, sentía que porque mi mamá me reprendía era porque me odiaba pero no es así las cosas hay que hablarlas intentalo y por favor no le vuelvas a decir eso de "porque no fue capaz de abortarme", es horrible.<br>  Si te sirve de algo aquí voy a estar contigo para que te distraigas asi sea a la distancia.<br>  <br>  Uan beso y cuidate.|`|dImmb20Qaa	trankilizate wapa k todos emos pasado x ay sobre todo teniendo novio y mas si el es mayor k tu x mas de 2 a?os pero todo pasa y no tomes mas pastillas|`|f1d84e7ded85677db3c996f9d942dd6faa	Hola, dudo que tu mama no te quiera, estas atravesando una etapa muy dificil y cada vez te encierras mas. No sera que tu mama no se acerca porque tu estas muy agresiva, y cada vez que te pregunta algo como para entablar una charla tu contestas mal? En un punto reconoces que tu no sabes expresarte cuando dices que no eres capaz de decirle que es lo que sientes. Porque no tienes vida social? no vas a la escuela, no sales a ninguna lado, porque te encierras? Creo que deberias ver tus puntos y resoonderte algunas preguntas, busca alguien que te oriente, a veces creemos que la felicidad es eterna, pero no es asi en la vida siempre hay altibajos, solo debes tener valor para enfretarlos, y seguro que tu puedes. Que dios te oriente y no te suicides hay muchas cosas lindas en esta por disfrutar.-|`|gVx45ITDaa	no te preocupes yo pase por lo mismo que tu, y la verdad es que en ese momento no me comprendia ni yo misma, sentia que necesitaba ayuda pero no me ayudaban ni buscaba ayuda donde podian darmela, sentia que mi mamá era como un enemigo, y aunque esos momentos hicieron que me fuera de mi casa, ahora me arrepiento un poco de no haber comprendido a mi mamá y sé que ella tambien se arrepiente un poco,pero para consuelo, paso el tiempo, me casé y tengo un peque?ito, y la persona que siempre a estado conmigo sobre todo en mi embarazo, mi maternidad, con mi bebé y en todos momentos es la persona que sentía que nunca estaba conmigo, (mi enemiga) ahora es mi mejor amiga.<br>  lo unico que te puedo aconsejar es que tengas calma, que este tiempo pasara y si ella no pone de su parte no vaz a estar sola, demuestrale que vaz a salir adelante apesar de todo y eres capaz de demostrar tus sentimientos hacia ella, demuestate a ti misma que te quieres.gracias por hacerme recordar. y cuenta conmigo.<br>  suerte:)|`|jjLhBhHvaa	holas! no ni?a! no te kieras morir! mira..mi vida social tmbn es pesima! no tengo muxos amigos..yo diria q ninguno solo tengo a m i novio! al q amo muxo y cuido y mi relacion cn mi madre es nula! x eso vivo cn mi hermana y mi cu?ado!!!!!!<br>  pero no es motivo x el cual te kieras matar! oie ni?a! pues... intenta salir adelante! has algo..q te haga salir de ese poso! mira que las amistades las puedes encontrar en el lugar menos esperado! y las verdaderas amistades no surgen asi no más! ya que hay q demostrar que es verdera amiga! a vecs puedes encontrar a tus mejores amigos en otros paises aunqe te paresca increible a veces podes querer muxo más a una persona a travez de una computadora de cartas.o por el tel que en persona! intenta por lo menos a travez de la computadora llevarte con otra gente la cual te puede ayudar muxo pero muxo!!!!!<br>  Por cualkier cosa..stoy dispuesta a escucharte okas???<br>  Espero q te mejores y no decaigas ni?a!<br>  Besotes cuidate! no cometas locuras de las cuales te puedes arrepentir!!!|`|xI619vQ2aa	sinpre los padres te parecen que no te escuchan,pero estan ahi tenes que tratar de romper la pared de hielo si ella no viene vos tenes que ir a ella,pensas morirte pero no pensas en pelear por tu vida hay muchas cosas mas alla de la muerte en la vida,seguiintentando hacercarte y decile tus problemas,y si te falla nunca pensaste en acercarte a Dios,pesnaslo suerte JD.-|`|20e43dcf63d4921ba8d1971123ccadeeaa	debes ser fuerte y salir adelante tu sola, demuestraselo al mundo, a tu mama tb, no t arruines x culpa de terceroz...., se feliz! hay muxa gnt q esta ahi para ti si tu tratas de hacer amigoz..., pero buenos amigos ahhh, tampoco t lokees con los malos jajajaja. bye!|`|5MCNFE3qaa	hola no se que te ha pasado para que te sientas asi apenas estas empezando a vivir la vida y Dios es el unico que nos la da y el que nos la quita, asi que no cometas ese error tan grande sabes que dice la palabra de Dios: que aunque tu padre y tu madre te dejen con todo Jehova te recogera y tambien Dios muestra su amor para con nosotros en que siendo aun pecadores Cristo murio por ti y por mi,y dice que de tal manera amo Dios al mundo que ha dado a su unico hijo para que todo aquel que en el crea no se pierda mas tenga vida eterna.

A veces nuestros padres no nos comprenden  y en ocasiones es mejor q ni nos hablen, tal vez la embarren o lo peor ocasionen mas dilema en uno. En verdad piensa con actitud positiva, busca a alguien de confianza para que te desaogues, ve a una iglesia, distraete, no importa si es sola, no crees q es eso, q necesitas estar sola para pensar mejor las cosas?

em8A42Bqaa	My doctor used to make me feel bad for gaining weight 6 pounds both times, but then it kinda stabilized and was 2 pounds or 3 pounds from the last visit.  I felt the same way, but really if you're hungry you have to eat.
m001xWWKaa	As someone who is going through IVF I know how this woman feels.  I was invited to a baby shower for a woman I spoke to a handful of times in my life, just after my third failed attempt. At the time I didn't feel up to going to celebrate someone else's pregnancy.  With that being said..she wasn't my close friend. If it were a good friend of mine I would have been there with bells on!  <br>  <br>  When I threw a shower for my friend, who had an invite list of 50, so many of the guests offered their help with out me even having to ask. I am sure it will be the same in your situation. When people offer...accept their help!!! Get a list together of things people can send or bring!  That way if the woman doesn't want to help she won't feel obligated to. <br>  <br>  Also, I asked my friend who's shower it was if there was anyone who expressed interest in helping out and she did have a few friends who were disappointed that they weren't the first to offer. So I emailed them and we worked on it together. That way you don't have to email everyone...just those who specifically mentioned it.<br>  <br>  It is really sweet of you to be considerate of her feelings though.  A lot of women don't really think about how hard it is on a woman to go through this!  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ACc1skbPaa	I would ask her how she feels about it first and be honest that you are concerned about hurting her feelings...I am sure she will appreciate you thinking of her and she may be happy for the opportunity to help full on or she may be interested in doing smaller behind the scenes type of arrangement, ordering food, cake, getting your mutual friend to the event, etc.  It sounds like you are a good friend who is trying to do the right thing--being honest with this person about what you are trying to do and why and what you are not trying to do is the best first step!  Good Luck.|`|mL07bInfaa	it's really sweet that you are so thoughful to your friends feelings...I am sure it may be a little difficult for her to be at the shower and help with the arrangements, but you know what, it may have been more difficult to not be included at all, she doesn't want her friends to start discluding her from events and things because she is having fertility trouble...I am sure she would want to help, and be involved...it will give her something to work at and maybe take her mind of things, and I am sure she wants to help her friend regradless if she is having trouble conceiving or not.  Just ask her casually, and tell her you could really use her help, so she feels needed (which she is!)  Good question though, it's a tough call, but in the end I would ask her!|`|HrDcaocMaa	I would just straight out ask her and tell her that this is totally up to her and in no way is she obligated to say yes - regardless of how close she is to the pregnant friend... You are very sweet for being considerate towards her feelings because you know that just being at that baby shower is going to make her pretty upset and putting on a fake facid that she's happy when in fact she's crumbling inside... BUT you are doing the right thing by including her...|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	You should ask her in a delicate way if she would feel comfortable helping out.  She will understand your concerns.  <br>  <br>  I have a friend who had tried and tried to get pregnant for years when I got accidentally pregnant for my fifth son.  She was so jealous and angry with me that she would never have wanted to do something like that.  It's pretty much all about the kind of personality you are dealing with here.  Every woman is different.  I would bring it up to her and simply tell her your concerns....you know something like,  " I would love for you to be a part of this, but wasn't sure if it's something you would want to do or not"...sort of thing.  Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|rC6gL7KOaa	If you're sending out a general email asking for assistance then it's ok because then she won't feel left out, nor will she feel offended. Send the email out to everyone. But I don't think you should ask her directly.|`|xTcIshYvaa	just be honest with her. tell her you weren't sure if it would upset to participate but you wanted to let her make that decision because you don't want her to be left out. good luck!|`|noH3sj77aa	Yes. I have one child but I am unable to have another and I recently found out that my sister is pregnant again. Finding out bothered me a lot at first and I am obviously very jealous and dealing with all my own issues, but I am also so excited and want to be involved any way I can<br>  <br>  I think the best way would be to talk to her friend privately and ask if she is interested in any of the planning or co-hosting. Explain that you know the situation may be hard for her but that you want her to have the option to be as involved as much as she is comfortable with. She may not be up to helping but at least she knows she was thought of.|`|v3LnJycKaa	Ask her if she wants to participate, i am sure she would if this girl and her are friends, also she may b e conceiving soon and wouldnt want to snub anyone, as she most likely wouldnt want it to happen to her... I would just ask, and let her decide cant hurt anything|`|GxYtTjUbaa	Yes def envite her. She will feel completely left out just becuz she has fertility problms doesn't mean she doesn't want to be apart of her friends special moment.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	I would want to help with my friends if I was having those kind of problems. I had a miscarriage this year and helped plan one of my friends. It was hard but I wanted her to know I was there for her. You could tell your friend that if she doesn't feel up to it than she doesn't have to but you wanted her to know that she was more than welcome to co-host.|`|vbwnLB8Gaa	Thats a hard one. I guess you could send out the mass email to everyone, and then leave it at that. If she responds and wants to help then you will know that it's something she can handle and wants to do. If it were me, I think it would cause too much pain, but everyone is different.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Yes, it is ok to ask, she will know that you thought of her, and if it is too much to handle then she will say no. Email is the best way though, because it is not so much of a confrontation and you are not putting her on the spot.|`|GpR5MI5raa	it depends on how sensitive she is about it. Some women in her situation would start crying, while others would just be happy for her friend. You know her, so go with your "friend instinct"
d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	DON'T LISTEN TO THESE WOMEN SAYING THERE IS NO HOPE!!! THEY ARE WRONG!!!<br>  <br>  This happened to me!!!<br>  <br>  I was getting negative pregnancy test for a week past my late period. Finally I got a positive blood test. I was having some spotting and pain. So the Dr ordered an u/s to make sure there wasn't an ectopic.  They did a vaginal ultrasound bc they couldn't see anything with the tummy one. The saw a sac in the uterus measuring 5 weeks and 3 days but no baby or heartbeat. (I was almost 7 weeks according to my last period) The ultrasound tech said it might have been too early and to come back in one week. So we did. This time with the vaginal u/s they saw a sac measuring 5 wks and 4 days, so no growth, and still no baby or heartbeat. She said she was sorry but she thought I had a blighted ovum and to expect a miscarriage. We were devestated. My Dr called me later that afteroon to tell us she was sorry and we could talk about my options. Meaning we could schedule a D&C or misacarry on my own and have another u/s in a week to see if there was any change, but in her experience there wouldn't be. She said by 8 weeks we should have seen something. So we chose to wait the week and have another u/s. That was the worst week of my life. I thought "how could this be happening? I am having no symptoms of a miscariage" So we went back for the u/s a week later without much hope after what the Dr and tech had said. They still could see nothing with the tummy u/s and had to do a vaginal again. When they did, there was a little tiny baby and it's heart beating away!! The baby measured at 6 weeks and 4 days. (according to my period I should have been almost 9 weeks) My Dr said I jsut ovulated and got pregnant late in my cycle and wasn't as far along as we thought. I have had 5 ultrasounds since to make sure everything is going good and so far it is! So don't give up. Unless you have an infection, there is no need for a D&C. Go to www.misdiagnosedmiscarriage.com they have a ton of stories like this. I know that not all stories turn out for the better, but try to have hope. Dr's don't always know everything. They think their equipment is 100% an it obviously isn't always right. You may not be as far along as you thought you were. My thoughts are with you!! Best Wishes!!|`|c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	It is great that you are waiting. There is always hope. Do know that doctors can be wrong and machines can be wrong. When I was almost 6 weeks (IVF so my dates were not off) I went in for an ultrasound and the doctor found nothing. He told me that it was over. I saw my regular doctor the following day who did another ultrasound with a different machine. My peanut was right where it should be.<br>  <br>  Check out the MANY misdiagnosed miscarriages <a href="http://www.misdiagnosedmiscarriage.com/mycommunity/viewtopic.php?t=11318&sid=527ffa06d57aab099319842e1a485ebf" rel="nofollow">http://www.misdiagnosedmiscarriage.com/m...</a> You can find many women who were in your shoes who ended up having healthy pregnancies. <br>  <br>  I would wait and demand a blood test. That is the best was to check if this is a viable pregnancy. Do a second blood test to check if your hCG levels are rising normally. <br>  <br>  My thoughts are with you!|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I have heard a lot of stories about there being an empty sac and then a few weeks later seeing a baby :)<br>  <br>  Search for missed miscarriage stories, there is a website full of stories that start out as you describe and have a happy ending.<br>  <br>  Good for you for holding off to be sure, doctors aren't perfect and they aren't always right. Good Luck!|`|HXfHkoSHaa	If your doctor was confident enough to schedule a D&C then things look grim.  I am very sorry.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Ask your doctor to check your HCG levels 2 days apart, and see if they are doubling.  That may be a better determination if there is any hope.<br>  <br>  The difference in size between a 6 week sac and a 7 week sac can't be very much.  And sometimes you can see something at 6 weeks and sometimes you cannot...<br>  <br>  Definitely don't get the D&C until you know for sure.|`|Q2IbbjGxaa	honey im sorry to say but there is no hope. if there was a heart beat and now there is not one. then you have to go do that d & c because if not you can get a very serious infection in your body which can hurt you badly and might stop you from having any more children trust me i no. after losing 2 kids i didnt no about the second one until they told me about the baby. but thank god i have 3 little handsome boys after they told me i couldnt have anymore children because of the infection if any more questions feel free to email me|`|GE9dgLXKaa	You might not be as far along as you think.  I went in for an ultrasound at 6 weeks and they found nothing so I knew there was no hope for me.  Your baby is probably fine in there.  Sometimes the heart does not start to beat until 7-8 weeks.  I would NOT do a D & C until you have another ultrasound in a week or so.  Good luck and I will be praying for you.|`|YuA7a08Maa	It could be possible that you've got your dates wrong, but barring that, it's unlikely.  I'm so sorry for what you're going through.  This happened very recently to a girl I've gone to church with all of my life.  Take comfort that this usually only happens to someone once and they go on to have a normal pregnancy.  Good luck to you.|`|xTcIshYvaa	I'm not trying to be negative, but I don't think a doctor would schedule a d&c if there was a possibility that the situation could change. BUT, doctors are humans & we all make mistakes. Maybe you should get a second opinion. I would definitely wait until i had another u/s before having the d&c done. Good luck!|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. YES wait until your abs sure b/f u get a d&c. Its VERY possible that you ovulated later than you thought b/c everyone doesn't ovulate on CD 14. So you wouldn't be able to see nething now. How long are your normal cycles?? Bc if you have longer cycles that would explain it. Are they monitoring your b-HCG? they really should. Just hang in there hun. Please keep me posted. GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!|`|033f40451fbbba0a0ade72d26567f043aa	There is a website that is called misdiagnosed miscarriage or something to that effect. There are stories on there where a heartbeat did show up at like 8 or 9 weeks, though, it is rare. I think they can typically tell by the hcg levels and size of the sac if the heartbeat etc. should be visable by a certain point. Though, it isnt a 100 percent exact science.<br>  <br>  I went through this exact same thing a year ago, and can tell you that most times, it really is the missed miscarriage. Though, also understand wanting to hold out for hope. It is truly an emotionally trying time that you are dealing with - actually the worst part as if it does end up as a miscarriage it is horrible, but at least you can start dealing with it. Personally, i choose to wait until my body had the miscarriage naturally. It took several more weeks. The doctors frown on this, but it is actually much easier on your body should you want to try to conceive again as it takes several months after a d/C to be able to try again whereas your body does know what to do (eventually) if the pregnancy isn't viable. i did end up taking some miprotosol (i believe) at about 10 weeks, but it didnt work (probably due to dosing issues) but at about 101/2 weeks had the miscarriage 9after learning of no HB at about 6 1/2 weeks. Anyway, hang in there and we will believe with you. If you have any questions, need support, feel free to email me at kelly head at cox . net. hugs to you and sorry for what you are experiences right now. On the bright side, i did go on to have a healthy, beautiful baby girl who is now 7 months old. All the pain was worth it even though it was hell going through that and i wouldnt wish it on anyone. I hope you are just conceived different time then you thought and that you see that HB in a few days!|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	you could possibly be earlier than you thought you were. i had my first ultrasound when i thought i was 6.5 weeks and things did not look normal, and i was told if the next ultrasound and hcg level test didnt come back with certain results i would need another d&c. 2 weeks later i had another ultrasound and there was a heartbeat and the baby was developing. turned out i was only 4.5 weeks in the previous ultrasound. unfortunately it could also be what's called a blighted ovum. i've had 2. that is when the sac forms but the baby does not. both of my previous pregnancies were terminated because of this, and they suspected this one would be also, fortunately that wasnt the case, i just ovulate later in my cycle. if you are actually 7 weeks, they would have found a heartbeat if the baby was forming correctly. i can tell you from experience it is a very traumatic experience to lose a baby. the worst was when the doc kept telling me 'there's no reason to be upset, it never formed into a baby'. that was so cruel of him because in my mind it was. i hope this works out for you but if it doesnt keep in mind you can try again when you are ready. like i said, i had 2 blighted ovums before this pregnancy and now i'm 9 weeks 3 days with my third attempt to become a mom. if you do lose the baby stay around positive people, have them do research on miscarriage and blighted ovums to better help them understand how you are feeling. i will be saying prayers for you and your little one|`|FGjanFY1aa	I've heard of many women not seeing a fetus until about 10wks. The baby just likes to play Hide & Go Seek at times =). With me, I saw my little one at 6wks3dys, but everyone is different & misdiagnosed miscarriages happen all the time. You did the right thing by requesting another u/s. I hope your little one show his/her face! <br>  <br>  Please let us know what happens.|`|v3LnJycKaa	you could be earlier than expected, and you may see yolk or baby next week, but where they said you had the "normal" size sack for 7 weeks gestation, I would not get your hopes too high...
Ka52nbhNaa	It would be best to start with a fertility clinic - you will have to apply, provide info on yourself, medical history, family history, mental history etc . . .  Then you need to hope that someone selects you . . . Yes, you can make large sums of money for donating eggs but there are many more women willing to donate than couples looking to purchase.  So, you may not even be selected especially if you have anything in your background or family history that would make you a less than ideal candidate.  Couples that use an egg from a donor are looking for near perfect - sometimes a certain ethnic background similar to their own, intelligence, healthy, no history of disease, no history of mental illness, not overweight etc . . . <br>  <br>  If you are selected to be an egg donor, you will need to do it on their time - so be prepared to clear your schedule (potentially miss a class here or there).  They will have you go on fertility meds, line up your cycle with that of the mother, you will do daily injections to overstimulate your ovaries so as to produce many eggs -these meds come with some pretty tough side effects, you will have regular ultrasounds and bloodwork and then you will go in, they will put you under a light anesthesia and use a hollow point needle to extract the eggs.  You need to be ready to do it at a moment's notice.<br>  <br>  I would not go into this lightly . . . . this leads to a child being out there that is biologically related to you.  It is a tough process, it is emotional, etc . . .  <br>  <br>  I would contact a local fertility clinic, get all of the info and go from there.|`|qwVtHWmIaa	<a href="http://answeringonly.allnight.nl" rel="nofollow">http://answeringonly.allnight.nl</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Over the counter pregnancy tests are extremely accurate these days!  They can detect just days after conception. Go buy one and see what it tells you.

HCmAoNjzaa	You are actually on CD 29 and you got a + OPK on CD 13 which means you probably ovulated on CD 14 so you are now 15 days past ovulation and a home pregnancy test should show up now if you are pregnant.

GWveqx61aa	i have pcos have pretty normal periods, been trying 8 years, healthy or plagued with pcos some woman are just lucky and some are not, id talk to a dr about clomid, that will help regulate some hormones and cause you to ovulate, sorry i dont know if you ovulate, i think for a period you have to, at mid cycle i know i ovulate because it feels like im going to get my period, something to help your chances is to familiarize yourself with your cervical mucus, stretchy mucus is good, good luck and baby dust to all of us

f9b33ba3df2d6021264ea140c36d61a5aa	I am not sure if you mean she is upset because she is used to sleeping in your bed with you and not used to a crib at all, or if she is just used to her crib being in the same room with you.<br>  <br>  But either way you can try a few things. One is simply to let her cry herself to sleep. I realize she is making herself sick. The boy I nanny was prone to doing that himself. If you are concerned about this you can buy a rather cheap web cam and put it in her room. That way you can literally watch her, though she will not know it, and so if she does spit up you can take care of it. When you do, do not offer to much comfort (don't be mean or yell), you do not want her to think that getting sick is the way to get you to come back and give her attention. Simply go in there, clean up the mess, and say goodnight and leave. Dealing with the crying will be very hard for you, it would help a lot to have the camera, but if you tough it out, camera or not, you will be surprised at how much more  quickly she will be willing to fall asleep each night. The major crying should only last a few days. <br>  <br>  If you give in to the crying, she is learning that <br>  crying = sleeping with mommy. <br>  She won't stop doing what works. <br>  <br>  Another thing you can try first is that when she falls asleep in your room, is to take her to her crib so she wakes up there. She may still fuss when you eventually try putting her to bed in her crib, but at least it won't be such a strange unknown place to her. <br>  <br>  Oh, and one more piece of advice concerning her making herself sick. I do recommend you doubling her sheets with a cloth diaper in between in the areas she commonly vomits, and possibly keeping a spare crib bumper around. That way you can quickly take care of the situation by just taking off the sheet and the soiled cloth diaper, and possibly change the bumper if she soiled that to. You will not even have to take her out of her crib to do it. <br>  <br>  Anyway you go about this she will cry and essentially try to torture you into taking her out. But if you do not give in she will, much quicker than you think get used to it, and it will stop. <br>  <br>  And remember that she will not hate you for this! I know it will not feel that way, the guilt is probably harder to deal with than the crying but she will not love you any less for getting her to sleep in her own crib. She really should be sleeping there, she is just not used to it yet. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps.|`|ouUti34faa	Best thing to do is let her cry. I would suggest setting a schedule. At a certain time, for example 7:30, give her a nice warm bath with lots of toys and attention from you. Dry and dress her, brush her teeth, give her kisses, read her a book, turn on some low lullabies, cover her up, and leave, closing the door behind you. No eye contact after the good night kisses, just leave and DON'T GO BACK. Let her cry. She will go to sleep when she's tired and this will teach her that she has to be self-reliant when it comes to comfort. It must be done with every baby, but most of the time it's around 4-6 months. She is older and will be alot more persistent but remember, consistency is the key. If you cave in once it will take that much longer for her to get the message. Good luck.
FUBNkpwSaa	you're probably definitley pregnant, and you could be spotting. or even miscarrying. take it easy and take a pregnancy test asap!!<br>  Goodluck!
jrVlzffeaa	It's up to you how you delivery your baby, I delivered my son who was 9lbs 6oz vaginally without pain relief, and I was only 17, no one even offered me a c section and I certainly wouldn't have had one. C sections are supposed to be used only if the baby and/or mother are in any danger. Good luck and you do what you choose Xx|`|rC6gL7KOaa	I think you should listen to your doctor. Just because your aunts and mom delivered big babies, doesn't mean you can. You're 1 week overdo and haven't dilated at all. You really need to go through with the c-section.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Just because you have a larger frame doesn't mean your pelvis is big enough.<br>  <br>  That 9lb 6oz baby could really be 10 or 11 pounds. He could also be 7 or 8 pounds... Their estimations can be way off.  But family history does play a large role in determining baby size.  Both of mine were 5lbs, and I was 5lbs and so was my mom and grandmother...<br>  <br>  The baby needs to come out soon.  You're approaching the time when it can get dangerous for the baby.  So maybe ask them for an induction?  Of course you may end up with a c-section anyway, but you never know...|`|eNkVSd9aaa	Yes, you are crazy!-you would rather subject your baby to a shoulder dystocia then to have a C-section? Good grief, this is why doctors go to medical school-they are trying to help you choose the safest route which will have the best outcome in the end -this means you have a good doctor! A bad doctor would go ahead and let you try, then exhaust yourself, possibly putting the baby in distress or injuring him/her, odds are you can't do it yourself and then it becomes an emergency C-section with more risk involved to both you and the baby. Just follow your doctors advice-they do this everyday and you do not!|`|OuuYoSBeaa	i think doctors can be off a few pounds when estimating weight. my doc told me i was having a 7lber with number one but she was closer to 9 and with number 2 they said 8lbs, but she was 6 and a half...<br>  You do whatever it is you feel is right, its your body, your choice. people deliver 9-10 pound babies everyday.|`|uTEr67Bhaa	Have you ever thought that it wasn't only because you might be having a big baby, but that as you go further along past your due date your placenta will eventually stop working the way it is supposed to?|`|sSRHQkROaa	my sister in-law pushed out my 9 lb 6 oz nephew and she has a smaller frame. I would ask to be induced since it's taking quite a while, and only have a c-section if it is extremely necessary.|`|8zhFPCo3aa	youre hitting the point where the placenta is going to stop producing what the baby needs to survive inside the womb, i would do the c-section if it meant my baby would be born healthy.|`|dG3V2roaaa	Ask for pitocin to see if you go into labor. I weighed 300 pounds when I delivered my first with pitocin.|`|H0fXySX9aa	its up to you my friend delivered a 10 pound baby vaginally no tears no cuts nothing i would go with what you want|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I was a 9 pound 6 ounce baby, my mom had to have a c-section for me. she went in to natural labor and I went it to distress, I swallowed my first poop (for get the medical term).  Could you ask for an induction since you are over due with a big baby and try to have a vaginal birth.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	My boyfriends family have all had big babies, the smallest was 10lb! <br>  <br>  They all had natural births, except his nan had to have a c-section for one of them due to size or positioning in the womb, I forget which now sorry.<br>  <br>  I don't see why you should have a problem unless your pelvis is small.<br>  <br>  Only opt for Caesarian if you have to, healing time is much longer than a vaginal birth.
AA11294818	It really depends how in tune you are with your body. Some people are really out of touch, and don't find out until the fourth month. I suspect this is common for people who are for the most part not feeling the healthiest so they don't notice that anything's off because things are 'off' already in the first place. Same goes for those who use drugs (a user I knew didn't know until her 8th month? stupid, I know).<br>  <br>  On the other hand, some women know right away! Some know subconsciously and change their habits before they've even taken the preg test and it's actually registered that they're probably pregnant. Of course, if you have no symptoms at all, it's possible it can go undetected for a while. <br>  If you still suspect, take a test at the doc's! It'll ease your mind :) And as for missed periods and 'sort of' periods, those happen. Cycles aren't 100% perfect for everyone all the time. When I was a virgin I missed quite a few periods here and there, and had very small and very long periods. Oh, the body of a woman!<br>  <br>  God bless!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	well not every woman's breasts get tender, some women don't feel tenderness until their 3rd trimester. also, u can't always tell if u're pregnant at 3 months bc some women don't start showing until they're 18-20 weeks pregnant. i'm pretty skinny myself and my stomach just looked bloated at 3 months like from a period. and it's also normal to get pregnancy symptoms at any time during the pregnancy, u don't always get the morning sickness during 1st trimester, it can come during 2nd or even 3rd. <br>  <br>  if u're worried, i'd suggest to go to a doctor and ask for a blood test done, some woman's hcg doesn't show up on the urine test, even at 3 months, and the last resort would be the blood test bc it's more accurate|`|nAOlBmzDaa	there's only 1 way to be POSITIVE - and that's with a TEST...|`|Bg6txvxqaa	see if you have your period this month and if you do, don't worry about it, if not or if it is still a bit 'off' ask your doc for a blood test to make sure!<br>  <br>  At 3 months, the hormones that would trigger a positive test result, drop so it may be that you would not be able to tell with a urine test, however blood tests are more sensitive.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	You're not pregnant. At 3 months a hpt would definitely pick it up.|`|48oRO9lPaa	yaa|`|3X0t8JrXaa	At 3 months I wouldn't rely only on symptoms.  I never had any real symptoms other than fatigue.  I did have "pregnancy" cramps which is round ligament stretching (uterus growing) but otherwise I would've assumed it as period cramps.  Now of course I had no period so that was the biggest clue and I did show up positive on HPT but not all women do at 1st.  My cousin NEVER showed positive and an ultrasound (in search of cysts) is what discovered her daughter.  As far as growing...well I'm 19 weeks and a day and you would never know I was pregnant looking at me...still no "baby belly".  Some women just don't show and its myth if you're small you show sooner...I was 85 pounds pre-pregnancy and only 90 now (baby is perfectly healthy).  I'd get a blood test done if I were you to know for sure.  Good luck to you!|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Absolutely you would be able to tell by those tests at three months.  You are not pregnant.  Something else is the problem.  Those tests are VERY accurate only days after conception.  They would have caught it by now.   Sounds to me like your body is just changing a bit, or you may have some type of infection.  I would ask your doctor about it.  I would say you are NOT pregnant.  Not a chance.<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|Tvcn83Adaa	Call your doctor and get a blood test.  It sounds like you have a major case of nerves and once you know for sure, you'll be fine.|`|weO1J2Eaaa	yes you would know. you should go to the doctors office and check on that.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	at 12 weeks, yes you definatly should get a positive by now. <br>  Maybe take a trip to the doctors for a blood test.|`|GHlYbDfJaa	I highly doubt you are pregnant.
PeEIuzP5aa	Make sure you take with you earplugs for when the plan takes off, you also might want to bring books, rattles to keep her bessy.|`|gqmtPx8gaa	You can bring the stroller but you'll have to check it at the gate/entry to the plane. <br>  <br>  I'd bring along some snacks and a few toys. Maybe a coloring book and some story books to read to her.
otFCWMuUaa	no its not statutory rape for the one woman who answered on here.. there would have to be a four year difference in age and under the age of 16..<br>  <br>  <br>  but its stupid. im 19 n pregnant now.. ask her where the shes gettin the initial $5000 to finnancially support the baby just in the first month? im pretty sure her 16 year old bf doesnt make that kinda money and if he does actually have a job thats probly his year salary!<br>  <br>  dont bring a child into this earth i you cant provide it the best life possible.. hes young. what makes her think that when he hits his senior year and college that he wont just wanna party n have fun?<br>  <br>  your friend is selfish im sorry you need to knock some sense into her. im 19 and this pregnancy is hell. <br>  <br>  ask her if she is ready for 3-4 months of non stop vomitting, and 40 weeks of stomach pain, vaginal discharge, swelling, and exhaustion.. then havin a baby where  your vagina will most likely tear and going through a birthing process where you need incredible muscle strength to push out the baby..<br>  <br>  thats the stuff they needed to show us in highschool health classes. <br>  <br>  i didnt plan this baby im not that selfish. i would of waited till i knew that i had the best life possible for the baby. at least my bf is also 19 with a full time job payin $17 an hour with health benifits.. and is in school for mechinical engineering.<br>  <br>  i dont judge a mother by her age but by her maturity and her readyness.|`|VHHis05Naa	Yes, because the 18 year-old is an adult and shouldn't be having sex with someone who is only 16.|`|TPnDIaQEaa	There is a low chance that they will get in trouble.<br>  However, having a baby at such a young age will most likely produce a very difficult future. Babies are up all night crying, constantly needing to be changed and feed and SO much more. Such a responsibility can be very difficult to deal with when a teenager has so much more to devote their time and attention to.|`|rxScdXM4aa	sure they can have on but they have to be prepared on many levels. they need to be able to support the child financially, emotionally, and securely|`|Z1FdawAOaa	if the boys parents don't like her the parents can press chargers against her since she is considered an adult. anyways what is a 16 year old doing wanting to have a baby? WAIT!|`|zfZiXQ3Oaa	Depends where you live.<br>  <br>  here in the UK the age of consent is 16, so it would be fine.|`|ySKK7lCyaa	he is at age of consent and i don't think that they will not get in trouble.|`|4ahUadqxaa	Tell your friend that is she and her boyfriend have a baby she will have to drop out of high school and never go to college.  Without a high school or college education she won't be able to get a job.  Both her and her boyfriend will need to jobs to have a place to live, to pay for a car and insurance, and raise a baby.<br>  <br>  They will never have free time again so you will never see your friend again.<br>  <br>  They will probably go broke, live on the streets, and the baby will starve to death.<br>  <br>  Tell your friend this.  Get her some help.|`|FERfSYtzaa	they can get in trouble but the type of trouble when they are going to raise the baby. 16 years old is to young to have a baby. i'm 17 right now and im taking care of my baby sister and my mother is never home and right now im going through hell.<br>   dont do it if you're not ready to become a mother.|`|IDTQwgBaaa	Where do they live? In any state where the Age of Consent is 17 (like here in TX) or 18 (like in UT) your 18 year old friend would go to jail for doing so.<br>  <br>  And even if they live in a state where thay can legally do so how are they gonna raise a kid if they are still at school? is the girl up to quit going to parties and having fun to stay home and change diapers?|`|C0hN449paa	First of all they kinda young and how on earth are they going to tell their parent how are they going to react, and the 16 year old has a whole life ahead of him at baby at 16 is just too young, tell them wait or just take a break for a while and if they feel the same way after GO FO IT!!!!|`|Fa130w6Gaa	Yes, they could get in trouble. If someone over 18 is sleeping with someone younger, that is considered statutory rape. I had my son at 16 and don't recommend doing that intentionally!|`|n4xRUt6Haa	your friend shouldn't have no baby she and her bf should wait until they are ready physically and mentally you don't want to bring a baby in the world if  you rnot ready. you will want the best for your baby.|`|eXTMwatMaa	they wont get in trouble<br>  <br>  but there young<br>  <br>  and 16yr old wont know what to do with the baby.|`|yY7EWzBZaa	Yes, she u could get in trouble if the boy is underage, it's satutory rape.<br>  18 is the adult age and if he's 16 she could get charged with it.|`|UZKfRM8naa	In trouble? <br>  <br>  Financially... yes. <br>  Educationally... yes. <br>  By their parents... hopefully.<br>  Legally... no.|`|SsLeR8zwaa	if his parents have nothing aganst it, then they cant get in trouble. but it is pretty much like her having sex with her little brother.|`|hKOc2i8maa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, THEY"LL END UP LIKE FXXXXXX
NeTNnvSZaa	There are some things you cannot control and who watches the kids when they're at dad's house is one of them.  Unless they are endangered in some way, your "preference" doesn't really matter.  His wife should be able to watch them regardless how you feel about her unless there is a legal reason for her not to.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	So you don’t want your son to visit his father because he works too much? I’m sorry, a judge isn’t going to buy that. <br>  <br>  If you start putting stipulations on who can watch the child, you do realize that this will apply to you too. And most people do “First Refusal” which gives the other parent first dibs on babysitting their own child before any other person does. But I do not think, unless they are a danger and you can PROVE this, that you can stop the new wife or the brother from watching the child during Dad’s visiting time. <br>  <br>  There were times when my stepdaughter was with us and my husband got called out for a side job. I would sit back and watch his daughter while he did his side job. Why should he have to miss visitation with his own child because he just has to step out for a few hours?? After all, I’m sure you’ll want that child support payment right? So he works to help provide but you don’t feel he is worthy enough to watch/spend time with his own child??<br>  <br>  I don’t think this will work in your favor. And the things you say and do now can affect the result of your custody case. So I’d tread carefully….|`|N48qV69daa	You have to realize, it is his son too! You cant keep him away from him because You think he might be sleeping! Thats not right, and it is really going to hurt your child in the long run. keeping him from not seeing his dad. Thats just wrong!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	you need to tell him how you feel straight up. why should you have to be polite about it? if he is going to be lazy and pawn his kid off on other people for whatever his lame reasons are then he doesn't deserve to see his son. visitations are meant for the parent to SPEND TIME WITH the child. if he's not doing that then the kid doesn't go see him, it's as simple as that really.not to mention what makes you think that even if you say something to him that he wont just have someone else watching him behind your back? <br>  if you are serious about talking to him about it just say:<br>  i want you to see your child HOWEVER i don't want person x,y,or z to watch him i want YOU to watch him. otherwise he wont be coming for visits.|`|DDYwnut6aa	While I do understand what you're saying, when you have a custody arrangement and he has his visitation, you will not have a say in who helps watch the child while he visits dad.  That's just the cold hard truth.  YOU get babysitters, right?  And the new wife, well, she is the stepmother whether you like it or not.  A judge will not like this style of thinking, and will not hesitate to tell you so.|`|lBw50ySpaa	This really sucks.  What can you do?  He has the right to see his son, and if he hasn't done anything wrong, there is little you can do about his choices.  I understand as my husband tends to nod off everytime he sits still for 5 minutes.  Plus he has a touch of ADD, and I have seen him "not notice" dangerous situations many times.  I actually trust my little one with his older brothers more.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I pray a lot!  I also just don't have much of a life outside of my kids.  Try to organize his visits more.  For instance, tell him that your son has been wanting to go to the Chucky Cheese (or whatever), and that you have been too busy.  Offer to pay for it if he will take him.  Or try to find an activity that your ex will enjoy too much to pass off.  My husband loves to do boy scouts, take them to football practice, etc.  You may have to make it sound like he is doing you a favor, but if it keeps your boy safe, it is worth it.<br>  Good luck.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Get over the 'my' son idea and let him see his kid! I hate it when women b*tch abou tthere kids dad not seeing them enough when the women won't let them. What are you gonnna do when he gets partial custody? No give him his kid and go to jail?|`|ISPIa0n5aa	say no and say why|`|BO28Mn8haa	just say what you told us. it sounds reasonable. maybe he will be keen on the idea.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Get a grip and quick. Your ex can leave his son with whomever he deems appropriate on his time and their is NOTHING you can do about it so long as the person is not unfit. (THIS IS WHAT A JUDGE WILL TELL YOU TOO). Grow up and stop trying to control every aspect of your child's life. If you don't then hopefully he takes you to court with proof of your actions and the judge gives him pure joint custody and you a friendly reminder to not interfere with the father's time with the child. Children are not weapons and that is exactly what you are doing by telling your ex who can keep his child and who can not, and when he can see his child and when he can not. Think about the kid for a change. IF he is not endangering your child then get over it. Find a hobby to keep you occupied or go to counseling.|`|1xlV9l0saa	you will not have much control over who he has around your child after its on a court order visitation...unless you specifically list it in the agreement. You have a right to be concerned about someone bipolar alone with your child but the new wife your probably going to have to just get used to it. Remember the more people that love your child the better...they can never get to much attention.<br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11109728	I have no problem telling my ex that he cannot and will not take my daughter!  He has been less than responsible in the past, and continues on the same way without changing - I do not trust his family either, and I already know he is the type to leave his kids with his mom anyway.  I can count a dozen different reasons not to let him, and lucky for me he doesn't argue with it.  We don't have a custody or visitation agreement, but I have always been the one responsible for my daughter, both physically and financially.  He won't dare raise a stink about anything since he doesn't pay anything for child support and doesn't ever want to.<br>  <br>  Just for the record, I do let him come over to our house, or meet us somewhere in town.  I don't refuse him the chance to come visit, I just put limitations on where and when.  I've told him family members are welcome as well, but since me and my ex don't get along, they don't feel comfortable around me, plus they've done a thing or two that I felt were totally unacceptable.  They have the opportunity to come, so that can't be held against me - they just choose not to most of the time.|`|KmC0K59taa	I understand not wanting your son to be watched by someone on drugs.  But you need to get over your issues with the new wife.  Just b/c you don't like her is not a valid reason for her not to watch her stepchild.  I'm a stepmother myself, and I love my stepson.  I don't have the same style of parenting as his mom, but I treat him very well.|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	Why don't you have him come to your home to visit the baby instead? Hello bipolar brother!!!!!!!!! and the new wife, if she doesn't have kids she shouldn't be around yours honey. Also the father doesn't have any legal rights so far, i'm not saying deny him his son but you don't have to take him to his house and when the judge asks why, bring out the bipolar-babysitting-brother, that should clear you for sole custody|`|Dv7340P0aa	So you don't want your son's father in his life.  There is no easy way to do that,  Just tell him up front and have good legal reasons to back it up in court if you have to.|`|TSmego9vaa	Just be honest with him.

Xu5BtID1aa	She should talk to her Guidence counceler at school! If you know about this person, maybe you need to talk to CPS for her, or if shes old enough she can call them!! Abuse is nothing to sit around and hope that it stops, because then it might be too late!!!|`|idKfxUTkaa	Well, I think she needs to find a friend that their family would be wiling to help her out and take her in so she can call the cop and get help.

So You have to be there for her and comfort her, and try to help her get away from the family.|`|q0ZEKr64aa	first figure out if she's telling you the whole truth.|`|tX27e0UFaa	She needs to first talk to an adult without her parents around. A teacher or guidnce counselor and then they can direct her where to go in the city you are in. There are a lot of places someone can get help from being abused. It is not fair for the police to be calling her a liar. If she has bruises and marks from these attacks then it should have been already noticed by someone and they will believe her.|`|QikvnTnqaa	She should tell everyone she sees! EVERYONE!

I work for social service as a social worker and  if she is under the age of 18 a worker does come out and do an inspection by law. But if that is what happen the she should talk to the school counselor if she attends school and isn't home schooled. Another thing would be to call outside help in California she can call 211 and she doesn't have to say her name or anything they will give her shelters to go to and places that people WILL listen. Does she have any friends that she can stay at? I mean any safe place relatives anything. It is also a good idea for to document time place and what happened to her any witnesses are also good to have....please have her e-mail me if you need any help at all (in california orange county). Take care and I hope you will be okay.---lia|`|GQZDcfUiaa	She could go to her guidance counselor at school; that may be the best place to start. <br>  or,<br>  She should go to the Department of Social Services or Child Services in her area and file a report.<br>  or,<br>  Go to her priest, preacher ,rabbi, or what ever kind of clergyman is available to her. <br>  or,<br>  She could go to a trusted family member that does not live in the same home.|`|berHpm4eaa	ermmm hw bout moving out..or if she cannot afford it..then when her parents abuse her next time she could maybe record theyre voices or make a video without them knowing..and show it to the plice...im sorry i dont kno what else to say...<br>  <br>  God bless the girl...how is she related to you?<br>  <br>  anyways good luk..bless<br>  Peace|`|BqcyxZhtaa	i think that she should tell some one and try to get help. she can tell a  counselor, teacher, and or a best friend and try to get advice. and when she call the cops they can do two things go in and observer.|`|a77nWPXPaa	Call 696 Kids or talk to the Guidance Counselor.

MvC6n3DWaa	No. Birth control pills prevent the release of the egg. You are looking for something to stop implantation which must occur when the egg is fertilized. It is know as the morning after pill, or Norlevo.
uFrqC4Y2aa	Yes. We planned on having a baby and it took missing the first pill to get pregnant.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	It is possible. take both of them and continue on schedule.

Congrats on the new baby!!|`|ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true- people dont want to share their experiences- they only want to tell you take a test- its sad- why ask the question if that is the answer you are going to get?<br>  people on here cant and wont help you out except give you the most obvious answer.|`|9sHJz788aa	yea you can get pregnant|`|o8xNTVWTaa	Absolutely now u just have to wait it out don't stress ur self|`|6a9AfhsLaa	if you have unprotected sex, yes, you can get pregnant. You can get pregnant when on the pill, while using a condom, nothing works 100% besides a hysterectomy. If you arent prepared for pregnancy, don't have sex. And if you do, be prepared for it. Nothing is 100% foolproof. Ask my sister, who will hold up my nephew. :) (god I love that kid so much!) but be careful next time, k?|`|sslXTGY9aa	Yes, there's always a possibility.<br>  Your best choice is to go to your closest health department and get checked of course...<br>  There's now a pill called the 3 day pill.<br>  It eliminates any chance of pregnancy.<br>  Don't know if it helps much but, hope it did.|`|AwwypYNBaa	yes with birth control when you start taking it you have to wait at least two weeks for it to work and if you forget to take a pill you have to start over and have to wait another 2 weeks for it to work again.|`|HMPdnhApaa	Do you really think someone is going to answer no to that question? Why couldn't you get pregnant if you didn't take your pill for 2 days? Yes, you could get pregnant!|`|Zew5sfbyaa	yes it is possible|`|hnCDmgyEaa	yes there is a chance
uSeApMt9aa	No not diapers. However every state has a program for formula. Its called WIC for women infant children. Don't feel like you can't take care of your child just because you sign up for wic. WIC helps all women of all ages of all income with breast feeding, formula, bath, and a lot i can't name. So call your local WIC location.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	I've gotten 3 free diapers from walmart.com in the free sample section, in fact the link sent me a diaper along with the lotion I ordered, it was a size 3, but still, I'm stocking up on them.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	If you can't find anything about it, then probably not.|`|EccBqsntaa	No..But WIC pays for formula, juice etc... if you qualify.|`|ni5tAjK8aa	yes there is a program call Courtney's Children's Foundation it is in Las Vegas so where do u live|`|0qP8gLpyaa	There isn't one.  Welcome to motherhood and learning to pay for your child's needs such as diapers, formula, wipes, clothing and other essentials.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	nope. you should've known what you are getting into when you made your mistake. don't depend on the governement to raise your baby. get a job to get diapers.
kRui5wGtaa	Aww, I know exactly how you feel. When we first brought our son home I was so overwhelmed and disappointed at the same time for not being able to "do it all". Your baby is only 12 weeks old...as she gets older you will learn how to multitask and have more things down on a schedule. It sort of just comes naturally. You are still trying to figure everything out and so is your baby! <br>  <br>  Sometimes, if you have to put your baby down to make a bottle and she is fussing, it is okay to have her wait for a minute or two. It is also okay to put her down and let her cry for a couple of minutes in order to compose yourself! That is very important. When you're aggravated and stressed,  your baby can sense it. <br>  <br>  Don't worry, you're a great mother! You're doing great and things will get much easier/better and a little more on track as you gather your experience with your new baby girl! <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats! :)|`|pXSKSS3daa	"Well i was wondering how long do you let your baby cry for?"<br>  <br>  I never did. If he didn't need/want anything else but to be held then I held him. Still do at almost 11 months old. Comfort and security are both needs in infants, IMO. Housework can definitely wait, so I wouldn't worry about that. Or, carry her around in a sling while you do your housework. If you need to cook dinner then put her in a bouncy seat and sit her in the kitchen with you. At least she'll be able to see you and won't feel "abandoned".<br>  <br>  I know it's hard at first because all you feel as if you're doing is toting your baby around the house but they NEED that time close to you. It's okay to hold her, especially if you feel like a "bad mom" when you don't. Those are your motherly instincts kicking in, listen to them.<br>  <br>  You don't need to be an "all star mom". Your baby and husband love you despite not looking your best or the full sink of dishes. They don't care about that stuff! Relax and enjoy your daughter being this small, it goes by way too quickly.|`|ROJans2Taa	every mom ive talked to feels this way, sometimes you need a break and you'll be better for it, and more useful to your baby, I struggled with my first to balance everything, now with my second if I feel overwhelmed, I dont feel guilty for setting him in a safe place for like 2-5 mins and taking some deep breaths outside, we all try our best and trust me your baby wont suffer any in the long run if you need a break, as for supper and looking good, some days I manage to do both other days I am still in my pj's throwing anything together, it does get easier as they get older, I keep that in mind. dont worry though, most of us are in the same boat with you. just keeping putting one foot in front of the other, congrats and good luck|`|AA10953561	I think 12 weeks is a little early to try the "crying-it-out" method. I didn't start doing that with my niece until she was nearly six months old. (I was her full time care-giver from the time she was born). For your daughter, you might try putting her in the bouncer or swing and putting an easily gripped rattle in her little fist. This seemed to help my niece a lot. Have her in the same room as you, talk and sing while you're doing your other activities. Babies are often soothed just by hearing their mother's voice.<br>  <br>  Don't feel like a bad mom, this happens a lot to new mothers. I'm sure it'll happen to me again when my daughter is born. Sure, I've been through it with my niece, but this time it is my baby, my body. <br>  <br>  I can't stand super moms! I have a six year old step-daughter, a wonderful man to love and take care of, a house to keep clean, and I'm 31 weeks pregnant. I've been trying so hard to keep everything perfect for so long now and it's finally kicking me in the butt. Then I realized, everything doesn't have to be perfect. As long as their is food for the family (even if it's just mac and cheese), clean clothes, and you can walk through the house without breaking a leg on toys and the day-to-day build up then you're doing good!<br>  <br>  I do a load of laundry a night, that way I can have some free time on the weekends to pamper myself. According to a lot of parenting books they say that you should try to find at least half an hour a day to just relax, but if you're anything like me that half an hour comes after midnight and the best thing to do at that point is just collapse into bed. So I try to take three hours at least once a week to take a bath, take a drive, or just sit in front of the TV and not do anything for anyone else.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hon! You can do it!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i personally wouldnt let a baby that young cry it out. and if it doesnt work for you no matter what age then dont do it. do whats best for you. all moms have those days where baby is somewhat inconsolable and impossible lol nothing you do is right and whatever you do is wrong and makes thm whail even louder! my trick is leave her in a safe place normally cot for a couple mins and catch my breathe i run put the kettle on go check on her then pour up my tea and keep going back and forth when im relaxed i go back in and try soothe her! o what works for you just rememeber to breathe and dont take it personally, poor little mite probably doesnt know whats wrong either lol.<br>  <br>  all star mom? i dont believe there is one unless you have a maid a chef and a nanny lol an all star mom is a mom that tries her damn hardest and is able to sit down at the end of the day and say ok my baby is happy my house is clean ....ish(lol if your anything like me) my family is fed (even if you did leave it in the oven too long) and im happy:)|`|deIzFnV8aa	I know, I feel overwhelmed trying to be a mom and wife!  I think everyone does.<br>  <br>  One thing I do is always take at least one nap time a day for total me time - reading or watching tv or napping or whatever. It is more impt for _everyone_ that you stay sane and happy than that the house gets vacuumed today, to use an example.  <br>  <br>  Also, your baby is getting to the age of more independence with playing, as she learns to bat at or grab at toys. If you are able to afford an activity gym, exersaucer, or the like, it is worth the investement. Play in these items can be lightly supervised, and are great for when you need to do some small chores or have something fun you can do nearby. You could check out places like Craigslist or consignment shops if finances are an issue.  <br>  <br>  The held part is tricky. 12 weeks is getting a bit heavy for wearing in a sling or baby carrier!  I like to put our DD in a bouncy chair and bring her into the kitchen while I make dinner; everything is so new and interesting to her that she is fairly good at being quiet for 10-20 minutes if I try to involve her in what I am doing.  I often do feel like I am ignoring her when I am working, but actually I think babies don't mind being self-entertained for a while, or enteratined with the same toys over and over. If you can somewhere portable you can put DD, I would try doing something similar. I'm sure she will still cry, but instead of feeling like you abandoned her in her crib, you will be right there to reassure her.  Try giving her things to suck on to help her soothe herself - does she take a pacifier?  I know that is not a super helpful suggestion, but by 3 months babies do begin to learn and have the capacity to get "spoiled", so this is a great time to try and wean her off it as gently as you can.  One thing I have heard is to give lots of verbal comfort, and to pick them up when they get upset, but not to hold them past their need for comfort. Like when she quiets down, she goes right back into her seat/playpen/whatever.<br>  <br>  The older baby gets, the more independent they get, and the more you will be able to involve them in daily chores and such. No one _expects_ you do have a pristine house or fancy meals at this point, so I hope you aren't putting that expectation on yourself!  Everyone feels like a bad mom sometimes, but obviously you aren't at all.|`|1tiCB311aa	Being a mom can be overwhelming. Do you have a baby swing? These are wonderful and will calm most babies allowing you to have some time to yourself. Another good device is a papoose snuggle it is like a sling that you where and can carry the baby without using your arms. They are great. My son had colic and it was a life saver. He'd ride around on my chest and I could continue to do daily activities and handle my other children. Don't be afraid to hire a babysitter. You need time away to even if it is for just an hour. Grandmas and grandpas and aunts and uncles would love to visit the new baby too, so don't be afraid to reach out for help. If relative are not close, try some good friends and your neighborhood may have new mother groups you can get involved in. A good place to check is the hospital you delivered at they will have resources for you.|`|T0gv52CDaa	I put my son in a chest carrier when I want to cook or clean.  Also, I refuse to judge my parenting skills on how clean my house looks.  I'd rather have a happy baby and messy house than have a clean house and a screaming unhappy child.  At 12 weeks old, sometimes your baby does just need to be held, and that is OK.  I have a 16 week old, and a 2 1/2 year old, and both of them have days where they are clingy and just need to be held, and when that is what they need, that is what they get.  Now if the 2 1/2 year old is asking for a cookie, or a toy or to see Thomas the Tank Engine for the 100th time that day, I have no trouble saying no, but how can I tell him he can't have cuddling time with Mama if that is what he is asking for?  I definitely can't see just letting the 16 week old scream unless I'm doing something that has to be done, and can't be done safely while holding an infant.  Despite being held quite a lot, I have two children who sleep through the night on their own, and the older one knows how to accept the word No.  My house isn't always spotless, but my kids are happy, and that is what is important.|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	Parenting is overwhelming that's for sure.<br>  1. Don't feel bad for your baby girl, if you're doing the house chores try putting her in the swing or the bouncer for a while, also remember babies need their mommies' love so try to find a balance. <br>  2. Reality: sometimes the house will be a mess, your hair will have to wait and the daddy will have to understand, you're not an octopus!<br>  3.Right now it may seem like you have no life of your own but it will get better, promise. Just that the 1st few months or even the 1st year are really challenging.And you are a good mom! (I used to feel kinda guilty too at that stage)|`|uGqYoZNEaa	{hugs}!  You are not alone, I"m sure everyone on here has felt this way from time to time!<br>  <br>  At least you have the right attitude, that you want to be the best mom and handle the day to days.  It takes time, babies change so much over the first year (and beyond) that it's hard sometimes to get into a routine with them.<br>  <br>  About crying:  My son cried it out once at 3 months and was good after that.  Slept through every single night since then.  My daughter is 14 months and wakes up 2 a night.  Every kid is different.<br>  Maybe with your daughter put her down when you know she is sleepy, stnd over her crib and rub her back sing a lullaby, let her know you're there so she feels comfortable falling asleep.  It takes a bit of time and patience but it is well worth it in the end.  And yes, I feel bad about letting them cry it out as well!<br>  <br>  Housework:  Can you get up an hour before she does?  At least once she is on a sleep schedule?  Get showered, dressed, and makeup on.  If hubby is home eat breakfast with him, clean a little from what yu didn't get done at night.  Makes a world of difference to be done up a bit than not at all when baby gets up.  Since she's still little she probably takes a lot of naps still, spot clean then, use your dishwasher.  My big thing is laundry.  Do one load everyday at least.  It sounds a lot but just do it, toss it in dryer and fold.  One everyday is better than tons of loads 1 day a week and it'll help you from being overhwlemed.<br>  <br>  Dinner/Husband home from work:  An hour before he gets home straighten up, start dinner.  ten minutes before, change your shirt, brush your hair put on blush, makes you look fresh and will help you feel better about your appearnce.  I"m pretty sure your husband would love you in ponytail and sweats, but if you look pretty you'll feel better and will be mor ereceptive to seeing him come home.<br>  <br>  And no one is all-star mom.  I used to think that when I would see moms in the grocery story with smiling babies, but TRUST there is no such thing.  Every mom has days from hell and most will lie about it to make you think otherwise.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
cAtWxJG1aa	what are your father's interests?<br>  <br>  for my dad, i'd suggest a chess game or a scrabble game or a chance for my dad to give my child a tutorial about bird identification at his bird feeder or debate politics or something.<br>  <br>  but also good would be letting your dad show your son old family photo albums, or watching a movie together, or teaching your son a card game (if it were my grandfather, he'd want to teach poker, lol), or building something small like a birdhouse, or fixing the toaster together, or just conversation about whatever it is your dad and your son might both like and/or family history/ your dad's childhood/ etc.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	play cards or bring a comedy video|`|DDFSITiYaa	People love to talk about themselves even if they don't admit it.  Does your dad have an interesting past or was he involved in any civic movements or historic events?  Maybe your son could strike up a conversation (or you could initiate it) and let the guy talk about his 'glory days'.  All he'd have to do is be an attentive audience...|`|s2Dv9NRGaa	well you could play board games. you can get like a balloon and bounce it around it is really good for exercise. My mom works at a rest home and they like to watch movies and have popcorn. but idk wut all he used to like and do. If its possible just have your son take him out joy riding.

Yo apoyo la adopción en muchos casos, si no pudieras tener hijos, en lugar de hacerte fertilizaciones y cosas por el estilo, deberías de pensar en adoptar, ya que de esta forma contribuyes a muchas cosas. Por ejemplo, si cada persona en el mundo adoptará, reduciría aunque sea muy poco el índice de natalidad que dentro de unos a?os va a estar hasta el gorro. Ademas haciendo a un lado dicho índice, puedes brindarle un hogar a un ni?o, que aunque no comparta tu misma sangre, será parte de tu vida.

XAQShKZZaa	En realidad el día de la menstruación no nos dice nada, lo que debes saber son los días de tu ovulación, eso varía en cada mujer.  LA menstruación es el último momento del período, es la manifestación del cuerpo de que no hubo concepción, y la ovulación, es decir los días desde que un ovocito sale de uno de tus ovarios hasta que se instala en las trompas esperando a los espermatozoides, es el comienzo del período, y es también el momento en que se produce el embarazo.<br>  Estos días van entre tres a cinco días, el resto de los días somos infertiles....
6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Solo te aconsejo que vayas a la maternidad concepción palacios que es gratis y te examinan y te dicen si estas o no embarazada. Si solo tienes un dia de haber hecho relaciones tomate la pastilla del otro día. Que evitara que fecundes y no es abortiva, pero si estas embarazada no te pasará nada.<br>  <br>  Si no tienes dinero para visitar a un ginecóloco ve a donde te dije. Ahi te lo hacen gratis o visita algun sitio de esos de cubanos puestos por el chavez y también te haran el examen de sangre u orina y es mejor y más certero para saber si estas embarazada. Por ejemplo el de sangre con dias de embarazo ya te dice si estas o no. <br>  <br>  Y te aconsejo si no estas, para la proxima usa preservativos o tomate tus pastillas anticonceptivas o te inyectas la anticonceptiva que dura un mes no es costosa y la colocan en cualquier farmacia. Pregunta y verás.<br>  <br>  Cuidate nena ok para que no estes pasando por sustos, no creo que hayas salido embarazada aún.
