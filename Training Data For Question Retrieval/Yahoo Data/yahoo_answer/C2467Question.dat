20090304124228AAHkdL1	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Need Help On Picking A Song to Sing!?	Well, I'm in seventh grade and the talent show is coming up soon and I only got about two days to decide on a song to sing and here are my choices:      Into the West by Annie Lennox (from the Lord of the Rings-the Return of the KIng) - I absolutely love this song but would this song bore the audience because although I know I can sing this really good would people not want to fall asleep for the 5 minutes I'll be up on stage?      Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend by Marilyn Monroe- Another one of my all-time favorites! But feeling like you're born in the wrong time can be sort of hard when you're surrounded by a group of twelve year olds who half of them don't even know who Marilyn Monroe is! Would anyone at my age group even either know this song or even understand what it's about?      My Immortal or Missing by Evanescence- I like this song a lot but would I sound too emo if I sing this? Also I want a song that is not on a low-key, I want some high notes in the song.      Broken by Seether or Bring me to Life by Evanescence- I like this song as well and I probably pull this off but isn't this more of a duet?      Angels or Memories by Within Temptation- I can't find any karaoke versions!      Okay, I can't think of really any other songs that could actually prove my singing abilities and hopefully would not bore the audience.      I need your help, please! I want a song that isn't too slow but also not a song that makes me sound like Miley Cyrus here (no offense to Miley fans!) I like rock, pop (not the girly or pathetic Britney Spears pop!), Taylor Swift kind of country, or Evanescence kind of gothic/punk rock.      I'm a Mezzo-Soprano and I got sort of Amy Lee (Evanescence)/ Emiliana Torrini/ Katy Perry/Avril Lavigne/LeAnn Rimes kind of voice!      Help me either decide on either of these songs or even advise me with some of the songs that you know that match with what I am looking for and my voice type.      Thanks! Good Luck!

20090304125120AATwO1l	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Twilight fan fiction #2?	i know i did one before this but i changed it a lot and i was wondering if it was any better?      Carlisle.      She had asked me to do it, to help him live. I was alone, in need of a companion. His mother had passed away and nobody would pay enough attention to realise he was missing. August 18th, it was in the height of the Spanish Influenza epidemic and people were dying every minute. He was dying also and if i did not help him when i did he would have soon followed his mothers and fathers footsteps.   I strode into the west hospital wing, sliding my arms through my white jacket just as another day was ending. Twilight is the safest time of day for my kind and so I had chosen to take the night shifts. Being heavily greeted as usual by the nurses and other patients, I took the old stairwell to the top level. Sighing heavily, I realised many new patients had been sent here during the day as a few hundred had passed away. It was part of mortal life to die and I could not escape the fact that many would not come out of this epidemic alive. I put on a welcoming smile as I walked past the crowded wards until I came to a large wooden door with a big black ‘5’ on the front, telling me it was my assigned ward. Opening the door a familiar smell of detergent still hung limply in the stuffed room. The ward was long, with around forty beds closely shoved next to each other, the influenza wasn’t getting any better and we only had limited spaces available. The walls which were once a newly painted white were now fading into an unpleasant dirty yellow and the floors were in need of cleaning. These conditions were not the best, but that was not my worry. Many of my patients were seriously ill, and in all my years of studying medicine it pleased me no more than to cure them.   Sweat glistened as it rolled down the pale cheeks of the boy. His name was Edward Mason and he was just 17. With his rich forest green eyes closed, his limp body lay motionless on the bed. Damp with sweat, his hair was a rusty bronze, messy and greasy. Edward had many of his mothers’ features; her perfect structure was strangely built in to her son. He was beautiful and it was clear that he was her son. Quiet groans frequently emerged from his fragile lips. I couldn’t just stand there and watch this innocent boy die. He had his whole life in front of him, but it was stolen, just as my whole human existence was taken away from me. The decision had to be made now. Every second, he was slipping closer into unconsciousness.   I acted on instinct that second. I quickly scanned the dirty white room, looking for anybody who would be paying attention. I drew an ugly patterned curtain around his cubicle for privacy .Of course nobody would come in. The would think he was dead already, so I took a step closer to the boy and held his warm face in my stone cold grasp. He did not fight or try to get away from my touch. Instead he welcomed the cool feeling of my palms; too exhausted to even try to talk he just opened his eyes and gave me a thankful look. I closed the inches from his neck to my lips. All these centuries of teaching myself how to control my vile hunger for human blood could all be wasted, I could lose myself, if I lost control for just one second…   I knew I could do it, I controlled my thirst for many years and the once sweet and tempting smell of human blood did now not affect me. This wasn’t about me anymore. I slowly opened my lips, took a breath and bit down into his flesh. His pulse was slow but the blood was still flowing warm and luscious. His pulse violently stuttered and increased as the venom was taking action, slowly changing him from mortal to immortal. As my venom flowed silently into his bloodstream he writhed and screamed in agony. Edward was burning from my venom and I had to get him out of here…and fast.   Ripping the curtain away, I grabbed the boy and quickly carried him protectively in my arms. Running at human speed through the corridor, many concerned eyes fell on the struggling body in my arms, I just kept on going. I needed to get to the back building where a window opened onto a forgotten alleyway. When I was out of human eyes, I broke into a full run. Dashing down the stairs and whipping through doors. His heart rate was slowing but I needed to keep him breathing. Reaching the back of the hospital, I thrust the stiff window open, cradled Edward in my iron cage grip and jumped. With a soft thud we landed on the stone ground. He was confused and in agony.    Still cradling Edward, we ran through the night. The tight streets were empty but I could hear the scuttle of rats in the alleyways, the quiet dripping of the nearby drains and the loud and drunken laughs muffled by walls. A harsh scent of alcohol and tobacco fumes burned my nostrils as we passed pubs. Eventually, we reached the edge of the dense forest. Edward’s expression was pained and he could not keep quiet for long. No matter, we were nearly at my house. The place I didn’t

20090304132028AAjQrIF	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my imaginary scenario?	Judy liked the watch. It was an expensive one and the woman was dead with no friends or family, so what harm would it do to take it? She slipped it into the pocket of her uniform and made her way to the hospital canteen.      "After all", she told herself, sipping her gin-enhanced tea, "it'll only go to waste. It's not really stealing, it's...recycling." She was pleased with this analogy, and a self-satisfied smile spread across her smug face. "All the work I do, I'm entitled to a few perks", she thought to herself.      Judy was a piece of work. The kind of person who only 'helped' others so that she could feel superior to them. "Look at them", she would say to herself, "lying there in they're own filth. I clean them, I fetch and carry for them - they'd be nothing without me". And thus would she wallow in the misery of others to validate her own existence. Like a parasite needs its host, Judy needed the sick and needy. Her life was nothing without them. The irony of her needing her patients more than they needed her was lost on her. If ever a more selfish, spiteful, sickening and soulless creature strode God's good Earth, their existence was lost to recorded history.      Every act of 'goodness' did not go unannounced. Every tenuous opportunity to introduce her latest act of 'charity' into a conversation did not go unexploited. She was her own best public relations officer when it came to relating all her many splendid and 'unselfish efforts' on behalf of the disadvantaged. It is the nature of vultures to feed off the dead, and Judy strode the corridors of the dying in much the same way. She fed off their groans and screams, and drank in their agony. When they expired, she feasted of the tears and misery of their loved-ones, revelling in the fact that she was in the midst of it all and that it gave purpose to her being.      Like I said...she was a piece of work.         This, of course, bears no relation to anyone, either living or dead. Any similarity is entirely coincidental.

I wrote this poem in 8th grade when my mother died. It was a very depressing time and i began to cut myself. I just found this poem on my old computer and it brought so many memories back.    Thanks so much for reading, please tell me what you think.         There back, there here. Willing, waiting.   They want her, they need her. Craving, hating.   She sees them, she hears them. She wants them away   They wish wash, they tourment. They linger and stay   There memories, that’s what they are. She sees them.   Its her, shes crying. Looking for a stem.    A root to the problem, the reason lifes like this.   A reason to the tears, something she wont miss.   Shes walking now, still crying. Bawling all alone   Shes running and running, then she hears the phone.   Its him. The man. He told her the news.   Your moms dead! he said, and theres nothing you can do.   Shes screaming, shes screaming! She cant fight it back   The memories still linger theve come to attack.   Then finally, she breaks.   She falls to the ground, not moving. Not crying.    Not screaming not hearing, not living not dying.   Shes frozen. Shes shocked the memories and pain.   Followed all the tears, as the blood washed down the drain.

Mother Earth's mood swings are evident day by day   our love once fragile as porcelain glass,   once shone in the Sun's Rays like crystaline mirrors   reflecting warm feelings as seasons pass   reflecting rainbows of infinite affection   waterfalls of never-ending passion    spilling kisses into sweet rivers that run along yellow meadows   neatly folded like napkins on a brown dinner table   has shattered now---only   the winds pick up the pieces of our love   folding them like origami to make a dove   so sincere and so true with diamond wings   letting the dove flutter amongst day break    only it is not the same,    her puffy white eyes weep tears of sorrow   her heart cannot beat anew   for if this is love then one and one cannot equal two   my one heart and your one heart did not merge to create one soul   but two seperate identities    she smiles colorful blurs amid the sunny sky   blowing her nose on these yellow napkins   only---only   to break down in tears again as raindrops splatter my dusky skin   mixing with my own tears warm to the delicate touch   strumming with the violin of my beating heart   conceiving music filled with so much sadness    engulfing our very souls until they merge into one   only one--one soul to share   our love is so sincere and so rare   having been through similiar ordeals   gliding amid pillows of heaven    as our wounds of the past slowly heal      What do you think?

Ok here is my question, let me know what you think:      (1) It is safe to assume that there are an infinite amount of fractions of a second between zero seconds and one second (i.e. You can always divide some fraction of time in half)      (2) Therefore, this means that there is an infinite amount of reference points or time values between zero and one second      (3) If the brain HAD the capacity to process and understand at an infinitesimally small fraction of time, that would mean that humans could experience an infinite amount of time periods simply between zero and one second      (4) The brain could also do this forever without fail because the amount of measured time within this amount of infinite time points (sounds contradictory but read it again, its not) would always be less than one second, because all of these time points occur in less than one second.  So, the brain would not even age one second within this infinite time span!      Sure, the brain cannot compute and understand every infinitesimally small second between zero and one seconds, but, I am sure that a computer could compute incredibly small fractions of a second.  So if such a computer were placed into our brains, could we virtually live forever between zero and one seconds?

But once she had such bright young eyes   eyes that masked her doubts and fears   of faraway dreams and tearful goodbyes   bringing her closer to the better years      the years do pass, she plans her getaway   she shoots for the stars and she misses   and so she searches for better days   in midnight wishes and drunken kisses      at night she would wait for sleep, if it came   dreams of a life and a love every night   and each day passed by the same   she lost her resolve to keep up the fight      but all was not lost for dreamers you’ll see,    because somewhere inside she yearns to be free.   and the girl that was lost is about to be found.      then one came her answer to her prayer   a new face at her door   the girl opened and couldn’t help but stare   he had the bright young eyes she had lifetimes before   and he said you don’t have to live like this anymore”      He told her “My dear but what’s the use”   When there is so much to done   In wasting life in self abuse   its true mistakes can never be undone   but there’s much to do and you’ve only just begun      And just before he turned to leave,    he said “ there’s no shame in second chances my dear   forgiveness you shall receive,    your scars and mistakes will disappear,    all you have to do is believe.      the woman opens her eyes and wipes away a tear,    and see’s the wide bright eyes of a small child.   she's whispers a prayer thats most sincere,    finally she closes her eyes and smiles,    and so you see her purpose was clear.

I'm supposed to write a paragraph on my personal goals and objectives.  I'm not clear on what I should write.  Stick to a no-fluff approach with an outline of my professional goals? Or my life goals? Objectives? Does that mean within the school or not? And isn't objective just another word for goal? I'm being neurotic but its important. And also, should I write about past experience, I was in the  military and it really influenced my decisions at the present.  Thank you sorry

20090304140138AAWS87j	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	In the book I'm writing, the supernatural characters can take years of life away from humans if they want...?	How should I have them do this? By touching the person? A kiss? I like the idea of them having to get the person to touch them. That way they'd actually have to work for it, and either seduce the person or have the person trust them enough to touch them.       I also like the idea that if they are low on energy and need more life, they can dress up hot and go to a dance club because there people would be seduced by their appearance and dance with them and touch them.      What are your thoughts?? :)

20090503112724AAJoDfn	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Will you read the first paragraph of my story please?	I know i'm not the best writer as i'm only seventeen plus it's only for fun, i would like to hear some people opinions though.   Thanks for taking the time out to read it :).      I sat at my vanity stand brushing my brown wavy hair back into a ponytail before securing it into place with a silk blue ribbon. That was when I first felt it, the same feeling I got when they first visited me a year ago. It had been getting more frequent over the past couple of weeks, it was as if they were telling the others I could see them. I wasn't as  frightened as the first time they visited, that blonde haired women dressed in a satin white gown who sat on my bed crying into her hands, I thought she had broken into my apartment until she stood up and disappeared into thin air. I thought I was going crazy, I had been exhausted that week but I started seeing her more often then others would visit me, that was when I realised I could see ghosts. The dead walking around like normal living people. I call it my gift. From then on I got a burning feeling inside my stomach when one was close to me, I felt them before I could see them. The burning sensation was stronger than I'd ever felt tonight, something was wrong. I slowly turned my head, scanning my bedroom as quickly as I could but the lighting in my room was poor, I could barely make out the artwork on my wall. I felt the burn in my stomach get worse, I knew whatever it was, it was coming for me and fast. You need light, switch the light on! called a small voice inside my head. I stumbled over to the lamp that was rested on my bed side cabinet but before I could flick the switch up, something dark-shadow-like-caught my eye in the far corner. I froze. I stared at the dark shadow for several seconds trying to make out the shape, it looked human but I couldn't be sure. It started moving closer, the burning was intense I could feel the beads of sweat forming across my forehead, the darkness was getting bigger, it seemed like it had filled the whole room. There was no sound, only the beat of my heart—which sounded more like it was humming—and my uneven breathing. In one quick but painful motion I reached for the lamp and clicked the switch, the shadow was gone in seconds along with the fire that burned my stomach. Whatever or whoever it was disliked the light. I laid there on the floor for a few minutes before heading to the bathroom to splash my face with cold water. I lent over the marble sink looking into the mirror in front of me, I stared at the girl looking back at me she looked pale and washed out, all the colour from her face completely drained instead it was replaced with fear. I turned away and grabbed a small hand towel from the side of me and gently patted my face until it was dry, it was then that my mind came back to reality and reminded me of where I was suppose to be tonight.

Okay, this book is about a modern day vampire who hates all the vampire novels out- he hates the kids obsessed with vampires, and the way the vampires are porrayed in a postitive light never fails to infuriate him. He changes one particularly obsessed girl into a vampire, and then leaves her. [[He'd heard her saying how badly she wanted to be a vampire, so he did what she asked.]]   These vampires are very different from Twilight, [[no sparkling, sine real vampires don't sparkle,]] there's a lot of intense description- [[it's told in a mix of the boy, Luken, and the girl, Cantrelle's viewpoints.]]   I'm thinking about calling it, "The Truth,"   What do you think?

Charade of Shadows      My face aches from my always-forced smile, pretending to be what they want.   My tongue throbs from lines woven with gold, always saying what they expect.   My eyes burn from unsweetened tears of hate, I cannot let the pain show.   My lips tremble from words unspoken; I should not say what I think.      I have secrets deep in me that I would never dare to utter, even to myself.   They would consume even the strongest.      I contain venom so vile that I reek of self-damnation,   As my helpless humanity withers.   There is nothing I can do.      Dark shadows stalk me sensing my fear, the fear of forever being lost in the dark.   My inner light dim from neglect, unable to guide me.      My heart beats like a drum as I attempt to escape,    But they race along beside me unfaltering.   The running is pointless.      I pretend to be content, pretend to have no shadows, pretend not to be me.   Life is just a charade.      My legs quiver, from always running.   But how to you run from yourself?   You can’t.      I am the shadows, and the shadows are me.
20090304160345AAaoCP7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does anyone know the title and author of this book?	Okay so it was a few years ago now that i read this book series and i can't remember what it was called or who it was by but it was set in the future (but not too far) and the main character was a young woman who was a thief and she did jobs for upgrades. humans could get upgrades to their body to make them faster or stronger or whatever. I'm pretty sure she drove a motorbike as i remember this scene where she had to get past a security checkpoint and her bike exploded over a bride. There was also gangs and she was friends with one of them.       I'm also 80% sure the writer was a female and her first name was Joanne or Joanna and the cover of the book was white with the woman on it in black and then just the name and author. I think there was three books to the series.       Much help would be appreciated as it's been driving me mad

20090304132231AAjSTMW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this small section of my story really boring?	I collided with the man who had suddenly appeared in front of me, my bag of candy flying everywhere. I fell backwards and landed hard on my ****, just what I wanted to happen today, fall over in front of not only my peers, but the towns people. Lucky, lucky me.       I looked up angrily, expecting to see a flustered short and fat old man with wind burnt cheeks and little round glasses perched on his nose, instead, I saw a tall, confident and tanned man I had met on many occasions before. He was gazing down at me with his dark brown eyes and smiling his broad white smile.       I blushed, something about him just made that happen.      He held out a calloused hand, chuckling at my typical reaction to his appearance.       I took the offered hand and he helped me to my feet. I brushed the dirt off my butt with my hands and tossed my dark hair over my shoulders before looking up and meeting his eyes once more. “Jack,” I said breathlessly.
20090304135902AAQApzP	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I feel like I'm trapped.  I don't know what to do!?	I'm a fanfiction writer and I'm presently writing this story based on Transformers and the friendship between a 23-year-old Scottish woman and Autobot Tracks.  The thing is, I'm basing the woman of a close friend I know who has H.S.P (highly-sensitive-person).  My friend is a loving, caring, brave and loyal person and she's so cool too.  But, because she is highly-sensitive, she can cry so easily, especially when she's feeling scared, happy or very sad.  She has a child-like nature, but is very responsible.      But, I digress.      I'm writing a fanfiction story and basing the main character of my friend.  However, I'm having serious doubts about continuing the story.  Despite it's popularity, I've had the occasional person complaining to me that the main character acts very child-like for her age, as they do not yet know WHY she is like this (I haven't revealed it yet).      I'm seriously thinking I should just stop writing the story, if this is how people feel.  But, I feel like I'm trapped because I have many friends who love the story and have been begging me not to stop.      Please, help me!  I don't know what to do.  A part of me wants to stop writing the story as I feel it's not working out and most people think the main character is too babyish for her true age of 23.  But, a part of me doesn't want to stop because I enjoy writing the story and I know that so many people like my story.      What do I do?  Do I do what I want to do and stop writing the story, despite what anyone else thinks or continue writing the story, knowing my friends like it?      What's more important in a situation like this?  Me or my friends?        I SERIOUSLY NEED HELP!  I feel like I'm emotionally trapped.
20090227074352AAL1zO9	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	For all harry potter fans,do you like this?	I'm 16 and this is the first chapter of my new fantasy series.Enjoy....      Chapter1        It was nearly midnight. A tall, broad shouldered man walked down the gravel lane. he climbed the first two stony steps ,and knocked at the door. The house was silent. A moment later, the yellowish light of the living room filtered through the drawn curtains, and the door swung open.           A man in his sleeping pajamas gazed at the unexpected guest. ”Byron??” His eyes widened in surprise. The guest pushed forward without even being invited. His black, leather coat was stained with mud.. The man closed the door, and followed his guest with a mixture of dismay over his long face.           “ Won’t you show me some hospitality Elliot?. It had been a long time since last I saw you, ten years, I guess” Byron said, resting on the sofa." I'm not here to waste my time. There’s an old unsettled business I need to finish with you”           “There is nothing for you to settle with me Byron. I’ve abandoned your filthy business a long time ago, and I won’t meddle in it once again”. Elliot turned to the entrance door, and opened it wide” I think that you need to leave”        Byron pushed himself off the couch, pointing to the wooden staircase standing at the end of the living room.” I guess that victor will be happy to know the nature of his father’s work, won’t he??” Byron smirked at Elliot” I know many ways through which I can find victor and tell him the truth, guess what he’ll be ashamed of his father. I can simply go up right now, wake victor, and tell him every single detail of our filthy business,” He walked towards Elliot, and whispered in his ears” and you won’t be able to stop me”           A moment of silence passed, with Elliot staring right into Byron’s blue eyes, Elliot considered the warning for a second. If victor knows anything about him, for sure, he’ll reconsider their relation as a father and son, besides, any secret of Elliot’s past being slipped into victor’s ears would throw victor into great jeopardy, and Elliot daren’t risk his only son’s life.           “Fine Byron, Follow me”. Byron raised his eyebrows triumphantly as Elliot approached a white curtain hanging down from the ceiling. He pulled the curtain open, and instead of a window there was a wooden door. Elliot turned the bronze knob, and Byron pushed into the room.           Before closing the door, Elliot twisted his head ,and ran his eyes up and down the silent living room making sure that Victor wasn’t strolling somewhere in the house.           “What do you want then?” Elliot said locking the door, and glaring at Byron who sat down crossed legged in an arm chair in front of the hearth” finish it Byron, or else….”        “or what Crow?? Speak.” Byron stole a contemptuous look around the room .it was quiet. Nothing stirred, save for the fire eating at the branches of wood at the fireplace.          After pulling out a chair from an oval table beside the wall, and placing it in front of Byron, Elliot grape a magnifying glass from the same table, and slid it into his pocket making sure that Byron didn’t see it.           “Still playing with your old set Elliot, I can’t help but remember the old memories” Byron said, looking at the oval table that was laden with all kinds of slithery tubes, colorful mixtures, and tomes of advanced math.           “Finish it Byron” Elliot interrupted placing his elbows on the arms of the chair           “Fine Elliot” Byron lit up his pipe and blew out heart shaped fumes. ”Our master Elliot, we must help him. It had been ten years since the last time he walked on this earth, we don’t know if he was dead or alive, but we’ve to find him in both cases. We……”.BOOOM           A short, hunchbacked man leaped off the mouth of a trumpet belonging to a broken c.d player. The man rolled for a few seconds on the floor, before he picked himself up, and bowed in front of Elliot’s chair.        “Sorry, sorry master”        “It’s ok Grimsnail, have you brought what I asked from you”        “of course master “.After flinging to the ground the orange cat  that has been purring  in rhythms in his arm, Grimsnail fidgeted inside his patched vest’s pocket , ” not now Grimsnail, as you can see we’ve guests” . Elliot widened his eyes in warning at Grimsnail who barred his yellowish teeth at Byron .   Neglecting Grimsnail in confusion, Byron’s eyes swerved back to Elliot, and before he continued his talk ,Grimsnail was already sucked back into the trumpet, along with his cat.      “Elliot we must find a way to retrieve Godnofer back” Continued Byron.      “How dare you mention his filthy name in my house”      Ignoring Elliot’s remark, Byron continued gazing at the trumpet, excepting Grimsnail back at any moment.” he has been trapped for  years now, you must help us Elliot, you’re the only one that can re-open the portal”      “I told you Byron I’m out of this game, I’ve a son now, he’s enough for me, I can’t risk my life with a mad man like Godno……”Elliot stopped suddenly in mid sentence as if

Ok well I need the truth so PLEASE answer this after you read the begginging of the book. I wanna get feedback!!! =)                                Chapter 1-         “Sitting on the porch, Ay?” Jeremy came walking up towards me on the sidewalk as I sat on the porch in front of my wrecked up old house.   “This your place?”, he said to me as he stood in front of me with his hands buried into his jean pockets.   “Yep, you can sit next to me if you want, theres space you know”, I patted the spot next to me, inviting the boy to come sit next to me.   “Nah, I gotta get moving. My dad’s carshop wants me to help design a new car. Its my specialty”, he winked at me then jumped on his skateboard and took off.   I watched him skate off until I couldn’t see him or his shadow any longer. The sight of him was gorgeous. Blondish-brownish hair blowing in the wind with those baby blue eyes was just breathtaking. I couldn’t look at his face without daydreaming about a candlelit dinner on the beach with just the two of us. He was amazing. He was the most popular guy at school and to top it off, he was voted the “jock” of the school last semester.   “Claire! Claire!” I heard my mother yelling. The screen door was open, which let in to the house, so I was easily able to hear her. But I didn’t respond as quick as I should have.   “Brooklyn Claire Reshwindz!” My mother screamed.   I hated my first name, but whenever I heard it I responded immediantly. It was probably because I didn’t want to hear it once more. Ever since the second grade I have been going by my middle name, Claire. Brooklyn just always gave me the shivers.   “Yes mother!” I jumped up onto my feet and ran into the house.   “Put your brothers dirty clothes into the washer. We don’t need his boxers laying freely around the house”. My mother picked up Jonah’s bushel basket of dirty clothes and handed it to me. I looked at it with a disgusted face.   “Uh, are you joking?” I asked her. She shook her head and pointed to the basement door which led into the laundry room. I plugged my nose with one hand and held the basket with the other. As I went downstairs, through the left nostril I could smell cheeto’s that smelled like gym socks.   “Ewww!” I squealed in a little mousy tone.   “Dear?” My mother worriedly screamed.   “It stinks down here!” I said as I kept walking down the stairs that felt like a mile long.   When I kept walking down, I felt like it was a never ending path, it did stop smelling once I got to the few last steps but each step felt like the room was getting narrower and darker. It was scary.   “Claire!” A voice screeched. The door shut behind me, I couldn’t see it close, but I heard it.   I didn’t think anyone else but myself was down here, this was starting to freak me out. I turned around repetedly on the stairs. I didn’t know if I should get off the stairs and actually get onto the level of the floor.   “Claire. Come over here, Claire”. The voice said, it was coming from the left of me. Without hesitation I looked around the corner, I slowly stepped off the stairs and turned to my left. It was still as pitch black as how it was before.   “Hello? Can you repeat what you said?” she asked the voice. Then she heard a whisper.   “Over here!”   I turned the corner fully. It was still pitch black, but when the voice repeated what it had said, it sounded much closer than before.   “Over where?” I was frightened but she didn’t know what was talking, it sounded like a regular teenage boy that had a fully developed low voice.   “Here!” as the voice said this, I heard movement. I felt the person or thing come closer to me. Without a second passing by, it was holding me.   “Don’t worry, its just Jeremy! I didn’t mean to frighten you!” He whispered in my ear. I still couldn’t see anything, but the fact of having me in Jeremy’s arms was enough for my heart to drop to the basement floor.    I had so many questions for him. Like ‘How did you get into my house?’ or even ‘Why are you here?!’   “Jeremy? Jeremy Albany?” I asked just to make sure that it was him.   “Yes”, he said in the cutest voice possible.   “Jeremy!” I answered back in an excited tone as he kept holding me. It was awkward for a moment, but I liked the scenery and what was happening, I just wish the lights were at least dimmed.   “We need to run away!” He told me. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. This guy had never really talked to me before, besides one day in Drama Club of last year, but that was it. And also out on the sidewalk earlier that day. I didn’t understand what was going on, it sounded like my life was getting a little bit of a romantic twist in it, I didn’t know if I was supposed to like it, but I did.   “Run away? Jeremy, what are you talking about? We barely talk!” I told him. I couldn’t see his eyes but I could just picture his gorgeous face staring back at mine, this moment couldn’tve been more romantic.    “We need to talk.

20090227075700AA821Uq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback of a excerpt of a short story im writing?	the clipping is of a romance part of the story. its taken somewhat out of context, so im looking more for feedback of the formation of thoughts as well as the storytelling. the "a, b, and c" in the story in italic font represents characters i have yet to name of develop. any constructive crit is appreciated. the word family here means a strong group of friends. it is only a draft so far, so don't expect any extremely beautiful grammar.      "Look at me" she said as I started to walk away from her and everything I left behind so long ago. "Look at me!!!" she said again, this time much louder. It wasn’t her voice, but the echo of her voice which screamed through the night air that sent a cold chill through my soul. I couldn’t help but to look back at her. Then I walked back. She completed her sentence. "…like you used to" her eyes were glassy. She was so strong. But she couldn’t fight the tears back any longer. I had little time to word exactly how I felt. I let my words flow. "For so long, you have looked at me with that pain in your eyes. and even now, there is nothing I can do".   "What do I have to do to make you look at me again, the way you used to, to look at a again the way you used to. At b. at c. to look at you family again.. Then her words became almost mumbles. The emotions and tears were vividly carried through the words. What do I have to do? What do I have to do, she said again. Silence entered. For what it seemed was so long, silence stayed. "Why did you come back", she mumbled, tears still streaking down her face. I had no answer..so she answered for me. "It’s because you couldn’t let go. You can’t let go. And now you’re holding on more than ever”. As she said that, her head fell on my chest. The weeping now turned to cries. She asked again, her face against my chest, this time as if she was whispering to my heart, “What do I have to do”.   "You have done enough. Now, lay your head and rest”. The three forbidden words weren’t needed to be said as I pushed myself away from her, and walked away into the silence of the cold dark night. It started to rain.      excerpt 2: this i actually plan to place far early in the story.   ...so i let my words flow.   "i missed you...a lot. for some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. heh. i often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   i found myself looking down. i was embarrassed by what i said. i sounded like such a loser and so desperate. i was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "i did think of you. i thought i was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...ive missed you, very much, almost too much."   i went blank. all i could do now was stare through her in amazement. i found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "thank you", she said.   "for what?"   "for missing me."   i let out a breath of a laugh."why wouldnt i miss you?"   "why would you?"   "i love you". as i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   i knew i had to say something. i couldn't help what i just said. i had to change this moment. i had to make something out of this. i had to recover from this mistake.   "i hope that didn't come out too cheesy. i spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "hey..stop talking." she cut me off. i was ready for a verbal lashing. i felt terrible and sick. after all she went through, i should be aware of her feelings. it was so obvious. what was i thinking. was i thinking? these thoughts raced through my head so fact that i COULDN'T think. i attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "i love you too."   i felt like i went dead.

For french, we have to write 10 poems, and they all have to be different genres, like Haiku's, sonnet's, Quatrains, or acrostics. They all also have to be on the same topic, like nature, boys, or animals, things like that. Give me some really good topics to write poems on please, not stuff like animals and nature, if you can avoid it. Something that's easy enough for a 13 year old to write about, and funny and interesting to read at the same time. Just list them down as they come to you. It would be nice if you listed 3 or 4 if you can think of that many. Remember, it can't be like Carrots, or an iPod, but say technology, like a general topic that all 10 poems can be about. Thanks, this is so much help!

20090304113920AAZDCtH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writing muses, inspiration and plots?	Good afternoon!      For the past four or five years, ever since entering junior high (high school now), I've been writing. I've written almost everyday in those four to five years and I used to write full chaptered stories, but recently, I've found that to be an impossible task. I'm sure it has a lot to do with graduation tests coming up and just my school work in general. Another cause might be because I felt most comfortable writing when I had microsoft word, which I don't have right now.      I don't want to force myself and I'm not trying to, but it's been so long since I've written a chaptered story of any sort... that it's killing me to not be able to write one.       I can have an idea, or a prompt... it's right there in bold, black letters. But, I can't ever seem to find a good way to start stories. I could always do it the easy way and start out with dialogue, but I want to capture my reader's attention and not just throw in words to start it.      I've been considering taking up writing exercises to see if that helps me, and I've been looking to the very heart of "writer's block" to see if I could find anything to better help my inspiration. None has come.      Although, sometimes, I'll be inspired to write something totally out of the blue and then I write with no problem. It's seems that it's just the things that I WANT to write, I can't.      Would there be any little tricks I could possibly use that might coax me out of my little block? Also, are there any good plot tricks that might make writing a chaptered story easier?      Many thanks!

Okay, so the main character is a girl who is shortish (not like REALLY short but a little short), thin, has reddish-brown hair, hazel eyes, and is sort of shy and a little meek in the beginning. Anyway, some events happen that dramatically change her life and her personality. She becomes kind of courageous and loses the meekness. I need a name for her. I'd like a name that can have nicknames. I was considering Rebecca and making her nickname Becca, but I'm not sure if I want to use that name. I like names like Elizabeth (Liz), Isabelle (Belle), and Victoria (Vicky). I need a name for her that's kind of like that.      Then the other main character is a guy who has blond hair (about ear length), darkish blue eyes, is normal height, and is basically a normal guy. I need a name for him. Not too common, but not a really bizarre name either. Something non-generic.       Thanks so much :) !

20090304153134AAweKLx	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback of a excerpt of a short story im writing?	the clipping is of a romance part of the story. its taken somewhat out of context, so im looking more for feedback of the formation of thoughts as well as the storytelling. the "a, b, and c" in the story in italic font represents characters i have yet to name of develop. any constructive crit is appreciated. the word family here means a strong group of friends. it is only a draft so far, so don't expect any extremely beautiful grammar.      "Look at me" she said as I started to walk away from her and everything I left behind so long ago. "Look at me!!!" she said again, this time much louder. It wasn’t her voice, but the echo of her voice which screamed through the night air that sent a cold chill through my soul. I couldn’t help but to look back at her. Then I walked back. She completed her sentence. "…like you used to" her eyes were glassy. She was so strong. But she couldn’t fight the tears back any longer. I had little time to word exactly how I felt. I let my words flow. "For so long, you have looked at me with that pain in your eyes. and even now, there is nothing I can do".   "What do I have to do to make you look at me again, the way you used to, to look at a again the way you used to. At b. at c. to look at you family again.. Then her words became almost mumbles. The emotions and tears were vividly carried through the words. What do I have to do? What do I have to do, she said again. Silence entered. For what it seemed was so long, silence stayed. "Why did you come back", she mumbled, tears still streaking down her face. I had no answer..so she answered for me. "It’s because you couldn’t let go. You can’t let go. And now you’re holding on more than ever”. As she said that, her head fell on my chest. The weeping now turned to cries. She asked again, her face against my chest, this time as if she was whispering to my heart, “What do I have to do”.   "You have done enough. Now, lay your head and rest”. The three forbidden words weren’t needed to be said as I pushed myself away from her, and walked away into the silence of the cold dark night. It started to rain.      excerpt 2: this i actually plan to place far early in the story.   ...so i let my words flow.   "i missed you...a lot. for some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. heh. i often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   i found myself looking down. i was embarrassed by what i said. i sounded like such a loser and so desperate. i was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "i did think of you. i thought i was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...ive missed you, very much, almost too much."   i went blank. all i could do now was stare through her in amazement. i found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "thank you", she said.   "for what?"   "for missing me."   i let out a breath of a laugh."why wouldnt i miss you?"   "why would you?"   "i love you". as i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   i knew i had to say something. i couldn't help what i just said. i had to change this moment. i had to make something out of this. i had to recover from this mistake.   "i hope that didn't come out too cheesy. i spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "hey..stop talking." she cut me off. i was ready for a verbal lashing. i felt terrible and sick. after all she went through, i should be aware of her feelings. it was so obvious. what was i thinking. was i thinking? these thoughts raced through my head so fast that i COULDN'T think. i attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "i love you too."   i felt like i went dead.

20090304152126AA3n6so	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	How can I strengthen my weak ankle?	My right ankle is weaker than my left ankle. I sprained it last year twice and the year before that twice during soccer season and I never let them heal properly.  I used to take ballet for 6 years than I had to stop due to unavoidable circumstances and I have not done ballet in 6-7 years and I want to start up again. I have talked to the dance instructor who I most likely would be starting back up with and she has said that soon after I start back up, depending on how I do, I should be able to start pointe.  I know for pointe a person needs very strong ankles.       When I stand on demi-pointe my right ankle over extends(like when a person is rolling their ankle and right before the heal touches the ground your leg makes an arc from your knee to the ball of your foot), and when I try to correct this my ankle pops and it strains it.      are their any exercises that you could recomend to help strengthen my ankle for pointe ballet.      I don't know if this matters but I am almost 16 and when I quit ballet even though my body wasn't ready I have taken all of the flat ballet classes that the instructor requires before a person can start dancing on pointe.

Ok, here's the scoop: I just recently purchased an Epiphone Slash Signature guitar from Guitar Center for $850 down from $1000 (hurray for discounts!). Now, I've been playing guitar for over 5 years. I currently am wielding an Ibanez Artcore semi-hollow body. I run this puppy through a piddly Marshall MG30DFX. It's great for practicing, but I'm in a band now. I need something killer to wow the crowd.       Given I'm now using a Slash guitar, I would like an amp that can get me *generally* within his sound range. Keep in mind that I also play Zeppelin, Metallica, KoRn, Santana, and Van Halen. However, I play mostly Metallica and Guns N' Roses. So, my fellow metalheads, what would be an ideal amp to play my new ax through that will get me the bite I need?      Thanks

20090304150715AAc7Dwh	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is my story too similar to Twilight?	I love Twilight, I am pretty much OBSESSED with it.  I would never intentionally try to copy or take ideas from Stephenie Meyer's books; this question is strictly to find out other people's opinions.  I love to write, and it is my dream to become a bestselling author.  I've never fully finished a book, so it is a HUGE accomplishment for me to get this far into my book.  By the way, it doesn't include vampires...or werewolves :]      Basically my story is about a seventeen year old girl, Lilly (Lillian) and her sixteen year old sister, Kate, living in Lexington, Nebraska.  Her parents are successful international business men, who have traveled the world in spite to fulfill the goal of advancing businesses who are just starting out. Lilly's parents have been assigned to move to London for one year, and Lilly and Kate are allowed to chose to go with them, or live with their uncle, Ron, their only stable living family in Astoria, Oregon.  Kate decides to live in London, Lilly chooses to live with Ron.  She doesn't have much interest in living in London.  When Lilly goes to school, particularly in her literature class, she meets a boy, Peter, who is somewhat peculiar looking.  His skin is pale, but it's almost like ice...it has this bluish tint to it.  His hair is dark auburn, but not long, and not too short...and it is also wavy like the ocean.  His eyes are dark gray, and he is very, very attractive.  She also sees his family, (6 siblings) and they too have the same dark gray eyes, odd looking skin, and dark hair. Lilly learns from her friend that the family has lived in a lot of places in the US and moved to Astoria about a year ago.  Their father is an opthamlogist (eye surgeon.)  Three of the children were adopted by the wife, who was married previously.  The others were from the father's previous marriage. They are all together, except for Peter, the youngest brother (A sophmore named Nolan whom you find out later is his actual biological brother) and a very beautiful female sibling named Calista.   Later Kate (who at first wasn't very nice to her, but then they become very close) moves back to stay with her. Kate (a sophomore) meets Nolan.  Anyway, you find out that the family is a group of immortal merpeople.  But, they don't have tails.  When submerged in water for atleast one minute, they transform into their real selves.  Their hands become webbed and enlarged, their feet become flipper-like, and they have a set of gills lining their neck and their eyes turn the color of the water.  Astoria is a rainly, cloudy place, and they can't live in sunny places because it dehydrates them.  Their eyes are always gray because it matches the overcast sky.  So anyway Lilly and Peter fall in love, and Kate and Nolan fall in love.  By the way, you find out later that none of them really were related (except for Peter and Nolan who really are biological brothers) they were all transformed.  In every drop of a merperson's blood is one cell. This cell is like the nucleus of a normal cell - it controls everything.  If a drop of their blood is injected in a human's system, they would eventually transform into a merperson.  Their blood is made up of two elements being water and salt, and is blue.  This is the reason their skin is somewhat bluish, because even though their skin is DIAMOND hard, a little blue still shows through. Because their blood is made of salt and water, they need saltwater to live (many times at lunch she would see the family drinking "murky water".  Later you find out that's saltwater).  However, there is one other thing that merpeople crave: human skin.  And that is because it is salty.  But Peter doesn't crave Lilly's skin (same for Nolan and Kate) because he is meant to be with her.  There is a group of merpeople called the Hawaiians, and they've created most of the merpeople.  They were sort of like the original group.  They set the rules for all merpeople, and the main rule is to never interfier with humans. If any clan of merpeople were too, the humans and clan would be killed.  One day the hawaiians see Lilly and Peter together and plan to kill Lilly, Peter, and his family for breaking the law.  However they don't see Kate, so she is not doomed.  Lilly decides to sacrifice herself, because she loves Peter so much, and couldn't imagine a world where he didn't exist. But of course, Peter saves her in the end and no one dies!     Oh, and the point of view is from Lilly!                                                                                                   please be honest, because I need constructive criticism!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...  And if anyone does think it is too much like Twilight, PLEASE tell my why!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Why might it have been Christian monks who first created a system for writing the Anglo-Saxon language, which previously had not been written?         A. The monks were employed by the king to write down all that they heard.       B. Monks could not speak, and so instead they would write.       C. They wanted to read Christian scripture to Anglo-Saxons in the Anglo-Saxon language.       D. Monks had systems of schools and printing factories that formed an infrastructure for transcribing oral traditions.    I really have no idea. I would assume B or C.
