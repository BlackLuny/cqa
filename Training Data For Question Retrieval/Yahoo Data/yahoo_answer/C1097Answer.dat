24H5tznkaa	The first thing that came to me was "Wild Child Deodorant" or "Nature Chick" or "Nature Girl"    I think you should probably keep 'girl' out. :)     I really like Nature Chick...sounds cool, goes along with your name. :)|`|7YWsEbWfaa	I would go with some kind of floral sounding scent.    -Teenscene  -Silkn'teen  -Florence      idk lol it's kinda hard|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	First of all determine if you need an antiperspirant or just deodorant if it is simple body odor body powder is perfectly fine if it is sweat then you should use Tom's since it is all natural and has no chemicals like aluminum. Good Luck!|`|f12MT3Rwaa	idk if its natural, but i use Teen Spirit (sweet strawberry),  it smells amazing, ppl walk by me and say, u smell good, n stuff. it lasts long 2 =D|`|hF9Vt6nbaa	hello...SOAP AN WATER ! the cool thing about being young  is that  your body perspires an you go take a shower after gym and go on with your day.today's teens  and adults body odor is doubled because we clog our pours with deodorant,we have lymph gland problems,breast cancer and so many more....we are supposed to smell that's the toxins leaving! so if you would like to try a deodorant, go to the health food store and they have an stone that looks like a crystal,an you get it wet and use it instead of all these pour blockers.try in moderation as always...an remember all the stuff that looks so convenient,has side effects an toxin,along with a lot of side effects is the fact that what you wear  under your arms,may make you smell worst! blessed be!|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	-teen silk  -teen n' clean  -teen silk n' smoothe        good luck!  i will buy some!  lol.  -abby
S61oU0yFaa	Don't let anyone influence your opinion.  If you want to wear it, then wear it.  You should wear what you want to wear with confidence.  As far as the t-shirt color I would suggest finding a color that's in the tights.  If you're going to be wearing denim shorts I wouldn't recommend the blue color, since there's already blue in the denim.  If you have darker hair, the yellow would look great.  If you have lighter hair then the pink would look good.  Think opposites attract.  Hope this helps!|`|0JcJedLcaa	i like that idea.  its cute.  thats how my dances were then.   and everyone was the same.  i think u should go for it.   and just wear a tshirt that is one of those colors from the leggings    and i do see where they think it looks like pjs. but no its a cute idea. but only if u want to be different. because everyone will be wearing jeans and a t.    but go for it.  jean shorts. those leggings and i would say like the blue color on there.  :)   good luck      and ps. listen to ur friends not the internet.     :)|`|ziALI6Xhaa	well theyre kinda cute...i mean..i wouldnt wear them...but im 22. u should wear a big shirt over them...go ask ur parents for one of theirs. possibly a long sleeve white shirt..or thermal..then add a necklace and sum bangles.. and call it a day!|`|aREeAzIuaa	no, i would wear them in sixth grade, maybe|`|82nIjqrMaa	I would wear them. I would wear a brightly colored tee with it and a skirt though. But if you aren't a skirt person then shorties would work just as well. =]|`|MgiK02Zbaa	they look like pajamas.|`|CpotQhwkaa	no. kinda hideous. just wear black or gray leggings|`|mxq7EEskaa	no i wouldn't|`|tv5YpG8saa	They're ok, they look like pj pants, but I don't know what they look like on someone, and it depends what shirt you wear with it|`|wCaFESnfaa	They would look different and I think they would be great. I say buy um! besides, dances are suppost to be fun, and why not look unique?!|`|fA3fhfPSaa	No.|`|laM5CZmUaa	i think the pants would look kind of tacky but if you find a tshirt with the same pattern, dress it up with cool shoes and cute accessories.|`|EV8vgMMxaa	sure  do what you want if you dont care about anyones opinions|`|isb2GENxaa	no try to get some red or pink skinny jeans  or a red shirt and a head band or something  get some spray on hair dye and put some red into your hair XD  or you could put togther a cute outfit with some legings or  some really neon colors, but i love the pants you were gonna wear XD|`|VNHC28Y7aa	I would go with the first or second one. Animal prints are better, the Peace ones look kind of childish, or like pajamas... but if you're really set on them wear a plain shirt (hot pink, or black).... but if you go with the zebra or leopard then you can wear a white tee shirt with some sort of writing on it or cool picture Preferably black writing!|`|63d9f46bda7649365dfa5197eb710a8caa	I think they would look cute under a jean skirt like the girls in the photo at the top. You could wear any solid t-shirt as long as the color is one of the colors in the tights... say white, pink, blue.. whatever you have. I think it's great you want to be different. What shoes would you wear though? If you are going to dress down for the dance (like everyone else), do something pretty with your hair... big, wavy, curls are always in style. Have fun!
XLRx5decaa	Slather them with vinegar. It may burn your eyes a little bit, but it works.|`|v5J50Ep2aa	use xxl mascara! or volume mascara!|`|M4cEjur8aa	Curl them three times -- once at the base, once at the middle, and once at end of the lashes.

But different mascaras work for different people.|`|4ab58a8654f438c9feb415c928245003aa	how long can one eyelash or hair grows, all depends on the gene that we inherit. And I don't understand why your mum doesn't allow false eyelash? Not all falsie are long and bitchy looking, it depends on the type of falsie and the wearer.     Why not try one falsie on one weekend, when you got no school, and show it to your mum. Show it to her that it isn't that fake and it's look natural after all.  http://sg-creations.blogspot.com/search/...|`|zOyMnhiNaa	neutrogena healthy volume or maybeline XXL extensions.  if you have a lash curler already, blow dry the curler part with hot heat for ten seconds, then apply to your lashes. it works just like a curling iron. also, put a conditioner on them at night when you sleep. then rinse in the morning. just dap a little in your fingertip and coat your eyelashes. they will be more nourished and mascara will attach to them easier.|`|T70dUdxUaa	Hey!  I'm 15 and cannot use false eyelashes they always fall out an totally mess up my eyes!  Ive used loads of mascaras but they don't really make eyelashes grow they just look like they have, to actually make them longer use some vaseline before you go to bed just smother your eyelashes in it and hopefully you should see change after just three days i swear by the stuff it honestly works! Lol hope it helps|`|NQI1YnNGaa	Curl them then use lash stelletto or volume blast lash extension and curl them again. They have heated curlers now too. And more then one coat helps. Good luck

HLmd17r9aa	Claire's does not train their piercers professionally (I had a friend that worked there). They give you a piercing gun, tell you to bring in some friends to "test" on and then you are piercing the next day.    Considering the fact that your cartilage can shatter or deform your ear if a nerve is hit, I would HIGHLY recommend going to a professional piercer at a tattoo/piercing shop. The piercers there are trained and they use a needle, not a gun. Guns cannot be properly sanitized and are inaccurate because they are so bulky. If something were to happen to your ear after getting pierced at Claires, there is absolutely nothing you could do for compensation.    Reconsider your options and hopefully you will decide to pay the $30 for a job well done.    Good luck!|`|BW3Ga4Mtaa	I got my cartilage and ear lobes pierced at Claire's and they did a great job. It never got infected or anything and it was quick and almost painless. When you go all you have to pay for is the earring  you choose and I think maybe the cleaning solution you use. Good luck.|`|SEd2yp0Paa	I got mine pierced at claires and it sucked.. they used the gun instead of a needle and a needle is much more safe to use than the gun. The chick that pierced mine did it like at the top of my ear up and down.. like u could see the back of my ear ring at the top of my ear. just go to a tattoo place and get the needle done.. much better that way!|`|BVyhflTnaa	Piercing guns are the worst thing that can happen to your ears.  They basically force a blunt stud through your ear.  Cartilage is not made to deal with that.  It can SHATTER.  This means that your ear could end up deformed.  Think about that.  Guns also can't be autoclaved.  So there are still bits of everyone who's ever been pierced with one stuck to it.    Save some money and go to a piercing shop where they've been trained to put holes in people; they do it for a living, not as an afterschool job.  They use a single use needle, and everything is properly sterilized.    Free doesn't make it the better choice.|`|yo30g3pPaa	I went to get mine done when I was about 11, and they missed my ear 4 times.  Don't go there, go to a local tattoo shop and get it done. They're more trained.|`|8NO8f2ffaa	nope|`|bu6BhCnpaa	i dont personally...but my friend does.    she siad that they jsut use the gun...and while it is effective it hurts more and you can get scar tissue buildup.    claires basically punctures the ear and the earing goes in the hole...at a tattoo and piercing shop...it may be slightly more expensive...BUT...they use a needle which removes the skin that will be replaced by the earring...this causes less scarring and faster healing.  it also hurts much less in the end.      so claires is free...but you pay for the earring...a shop may charge your 20 bucks or so...but in the end it is more worth it...    also...at claries the girls there are in no way trined or have much of a know-how on piercing...an actual shop will have professionals with an understanding of the healing process.    getting your lobes pierced at claires is no biggie...but the cartilage which can get infected much more easily...i would go with a pro|`|dM8EyL6caa	go to a tattoo shop. piercing with a hollow needle is safer than a gun.|`|AA11881072	using a gun will cause an infection more then a needle..plus the needle is just better.

n2hgJlPtaa	ok u really dont want to start dyeing your hair reason   1 is that once you start you will have to keep doing it .  2 is that hair dye really hurts ur hair it kills your hair .  3 it is really expensive to highlights and your so young do ruin your hair ok.|`|FMcu6BNpaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with that. Only SOME people at my school have highlights. But it can "kill" your hair. I don't think that you should get highlights if everybody has it. Its called peer pressure the only reason why you want highlights it because everyone else has it. And it will probably turn out that not 'everybody' actually has it. Don't do it unless it YOU that makes the decision that you want it not  just because you think its cool. Trust me I have gone through that and it didn't turn the way i wanted it to.|`|kknSPYxKaa	Just because all of your friends have highlights in their hair doesn't mean you have to get them.  I'm sure this isn't what you want to hear, but if all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you do the same?

Maybe just spruce things up a bit with some new makeup.|`|Zx8dDBY8aa	well, I find mothers always say their children is too young to those kinds of things.

Keep the temperature of the towel to your tolerance level (not too hot, but not cold either - else it won't do anything).  keep it for 10-15 minutes (change warm/hot towels as needed). then wipe away your back with a cold towel to clean them, and apply non-oily lotion.  not all pimples occur due to sweets... some can be from eating oily/greasy food, or even spicy food so if you can cut on those then great (if you do eat a lot). Some may also pass on through genes, so they go away over time i guess.  hope that helps! take care =)
ljqr3saeaa	I'm just as big as you. I'm engaged so I'm not all about showing my boobs off to everyone. To "tame" them, I wear camis with shelf bras in them, one size smaller than my shirt size under all my shirts. This kinda works like a sports bra. I also wear Victoria's Secret's Very Sexy Push Up Wireless bra, which gives me good support and just enough padding. Because there is no wire in it, the bra itself is very "moldable" so its easier to "tame" them.    I'm so glad your not one of those young girls that use their boobs to get attention. You seem to have a good head on your shoulders, your parents must be proud (:|`|yo30g3pPaa	dont worry about it,  you're gorgeous  do you know how many girls would kill to be that big?  you don't look abnormal, so why worry     :D|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	While numerous women dream of having larger breasts for vanity reasons, it is amazing to note that there is also a significant number who aim to trim their bust sizes. That is because they attest thatthere is great discomfort caused by having extremely big sized bumpers. Pain and stress at the back and in the neck are the usual complaints. Surprisingly, there are also some men who are suffering from breast enlargement, an occurrence that causes total embarrassment and insecurity. Thus, helpful tips to reduce breast size are widely sought across the market.    Leading the list of tips to reduce breast size would be reduction mammoplasty, or surgical breast augmentation. This is so far the best and the fastest way to eliminate the problem of excessive breast size. Healing takes only a few days and modern procedures and technology makes the surgical operation less painful and more convenient. However, the cost is still significant and there is an accompanying problem of marks and signs of incision. Many patients are still scared of undergoing knife procedures, though.     Part of the tips to reduce breast size would be the intake of breast reduction herbal pills that are currently rolled out in the market. such dietary supplements are not yet proven and endorsed by health regulators but initial users attest that they are effective. In-take of such pills, however, would be on the discretion of the patients themselves.        here are the tips:  you should wear tighter shirts. or go to victoria's secret, because they actually sell bras to make your boobs appear smaller, just ask them about it. everyone at that store is nice and will help you.|`|8NO8f2ffaa	which one are you?|`|bu6BhCnpaa	wow that sucks!    i was a 32DD when i started taing birth control and it looked liek i had gotten a boob job...peopel actually asked...    I got into the habit of wearing 2 sports bras sometimes...but...in the end...i jsut had in embrace it.  many girls will hate something about their bodies...and being 14...your is your breasts...but one day you may come to love them...and your friends will envy you.    that said...try your best not to wear too many low cut shirts...and the occasional sweatshirt is not too bad...make sure your clothes arent too tight fitting...i know tight is good...but too tight will only make your boobs look bigger.  try on a shirt...if your boobs are smushed in it...then buy the next size up...it may be more loose around your waist...but your boobs will actually not look so boulbus...the less you squeeze the more natural you will look.    lastly...make sure you have a proper fitting bra and be confident.    as a last resort you could try working out and changing eating habits to lose a little weight...which will reduce your breast size...but only slightly.  the other girls will catch up to you soon enough...|`|uirnyVeuaa	Wow.... seriously I wish more girls were built like you|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	You are 14 and guys at that age are jerks because most girls are still A/B cups so you are really unusual. First realize you aren't done growing and your body will balance in time so you will be beautiful. In the mean while avoid button up  and low necklines (since they gap). take advantage of slim square smocks and mini V t's they flatter without over emphasizing your chest and remember bigger tops just make you look fat or pregnant so don't over compensate. A boat neck will also "reduce" with out making you look bad as will shirt dresses. Get inspiration from drew Barrymore for now and Marilyn Monroe later. Your naturally beautiful shape is a blessing in disguise and you will be seen for more that your "knobs" sooner than you think. Learn now how to avoid jerks and be the smart girl who evey other girl looks to for advice later. You don't have to look fat, layer or compromise just be strong and confident the rest will fall into place. Just know you aren't the problem - your bust size isn't the problem anyone who is men to you or treats you badly is. You are BEAUTIFUL and you will continue to be so. Also please always wear well fitting bras (not small or loose) to keep you in proportion.|`|5wOyJ9DWaa	well you can just try wearing more layers .  when hot , you can wear those shirts with buttons that go up ?    sorry , i know my answer sucked|`|UblCF6K3aa	It's a good thing!!!!!!!!!! i would kill for that!|`|HLmd17r9aa	First of all, I would take your pic of here since most guys that are pervs are probably looking for pictures like that. To make your chest size smaller without having surgery, you could change your diet to eat healthier foods. I am older than you (22) but have a size 34DD chest and since most of the weight I gain goes there (I am not overweight at all), the same goes for weight loss. I have recently joined a gym and am eating better because my chest size is now giving me back problems. Weight loss and diet are pretty much the only way you can go about reducing your breast size without surgery.|`|1gt0K13gaa	You can't.

I believe I may be able to help you with your potentially very serious problem known as Adenosis. Because adenosis is a benign condition, treatment is necessary. Although I cannot immediately diagnose your condition, if you send appropriate nude pictures to my email at "service@bodybuilding.com" I can begin examination and refer you to a local health professional if necessary. If you have any other questions feel free to contact me via the email above.|`|A39OwyCXaa	Be proud of who you are. God made you.

Well tbh if you have back pains you might want to consider surgery. Also, cup size is what matters. Bust doesn't.

Bleach blonde is getting very tacky and is definitely not hot for this summer (unless you a porn star) lol
fb6e01bd10dce5212a34b8e493ff20a8aa	Most people's faces are asymmetric.  This is caused by sleeping more on one side than the other when you were a baby and your right/left brain development.      Use your hair to complement the features of both sides of your face.|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	get olay regenerist. it re-structures your face. you just apply it on the side you want to be higher or lower.  it works very well.  http://www.olay.com/boutique/regenerist/    its expensive but works very well.|`|hIdzQoquaa	Are you still hot?|`|KH5zRKWFaa	No face is perfecty symmetrical you know. I can't believe you're fussing about that! Holy Geez! What? Now you're gonna be all self -concious about it?Come on!lol.|`|Z4PxfObXaa	Honestly, most of us are not symmetrical.  You can try to even it out a little by applying your makeup in a way that makes it look symmetrical.  But really, I wouldn't worry about it.  No one is going to notice but you.  It's just like girls and boobs... almost all girls have one boob that is smaller than the other one.  But it's typically not noticable.  It's all in your head; you're the only one concentrating on it.|`|Fe5i7UCxaa	Alwasy sleeping on one side of ur face could do this sometimes it's just natural. However u can work out ur face muscles to become stronger, leaner and more symmetrical.

Stop looking in the mirror so often and if you really can't get over it, consider some plastic surgery. Although, I'm not even sure if they can fix that.|`|m1ymxDx5aa	noting its going to be like that for ever|`|Rxxv5g0eaa	you can move the lower side up a little bit|`|WDZ8fziQaa	well seeing as nobody's face is perfectly symmetrical i personally dont think you should do anything but if you absolutely have to then plastic surgery. and no you cannot alter the bones in your face by sleeping on one side of your face versus the other. the only thing you can do is plastic surgery. sorry.
d8b6703f3fe553c8173f1543b80dcc85aa	no, but you usually takea shower before you put it on,  then you have to have it on your skin for at least 18 hours; then you can shower.    then, if it does come off within the next 2 weeks or so, you re-apply it.  [do it all over again or else it'll be darker in some places than in others.]|`|SEd2yp0Paa	fake tan lotion prolly let it sit for like 45min to an hour.. then shower.. dont use a scrub though.

Gdz7T9Z7aa	There's an Armani Exchange in the Eaton Center.  Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein are most definitely sold in The Bay.  There's a pretty big TH section, but I guess it wasnt big enough?  There's a Lacoste in the Eaton Center, as well as a men's Banana Republic (probably not as designer as you'd like, but it's still a nice store).      You should take a drive on down to Yorkdale mall and check out Holt Renfrew.  It's a store like The Bay and Sears, selling a large variety of labels, but it's way more designer.  Like, Prada and Armani designer.  Also, I think there's a Lacoste in the mall too.  And a Tommy Hilfiger.  And I think there's a Burberry store opening soon, but I dont know if it has yet or not.  You also might find something nice at Club Monaco, which both the Eaton Center and Yorkdale have.    And there's a Harry Rosen in The Eaton Center, which sells Dolce & Gabbana, but I dont know how good their selection is.  I think they sell Versace and Armani too, but I'm not sure.    There's a Chanel on Bloor Street.  There's also a Prada store on Bloor.    I think that should do for now?  I covered a bunch of designer stores you'll probably love.  I live in Toronto, in case you're wondering if this is reliable info.  Anyways, hope you find what you need. - Caroline|`|gZn622dEaa	Mostly i would have to say online.|`|z9HZm6Ezaa	Maybe online somewhere. . .  I bet you could find somethingg there:)    Hope i helpedd:)

YoqtyDYTaa	I'm personally not a fan of the gathering material at the end of the sleeves and the jacket itself. But, that's beside the point. I liked the latter better, because it's more streamlined whereas the first had more unnecessary details. I don't like the pockets on the first one, they add too much bulk. And the last thing a lady needs is more bulk in the mid section.|`|nQdTKnzVaa	I like the first one. The second one looks kind of dated.

DpStw8RBaa	This style of tattoo is becoming increasingly popular; I've seen it both with flowers and with sort of shooting star type designs.

HcCYeLMAaa	i think longer hair works better for you , with short hair your look more mature & you look like you should be working in this office somewhere wearing glasses ! & with long hair you look really younger !    your look good with short hair , i you look way GOREGOUS with long !|`|yUP05L2Iaa	long|`|TBRMH4hbaa	You look fine both ways. You look older with your hair shorter, but prettier with your hair long.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	Without a doubt, definately long!|`|w9fyt27aaa	You look gorgeous either way, the longer hair is probably more sexier, but again the short hair is professional.

ZIq2IzOmaa	If you have layers that are nice and choppy, you can straighten your hair and  tease it at the crown to make it fluffy. A lot of hairspray will hold it up and poofy, a little wax on the ends will make them pointy and stand out.     You can buy bows wherever you find cute ones. Sticking to one store for a product just because of the name of the store is silly. The fastest way for people to call you a poser is to only shop at Hot Topic. Buy bows wherever you like them from. Places like Claire's, icing and other stores have cute little neon bows too. You can even find some in the little girls section at Walmart occasionally.

a6beQD7Qaa	try using a face mist like evian brumisateur or mac fix+ but spray it from a distance so it goes on nice & fine & doesn't make your makeup run. Alternatively you could spray a fluffly brush & then stipple it over your skin, but i find that this moves my makeup around unless I'm wearing a primer, so I just use the spray on its own.|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	Use a richer moisturizer and stop using so much of the make-up.|`|FklngtvCaa	for me, moisturizing my skin first  helps.    i don't use bare minerals, i use clinique,  but it's still a loose foundation.    clinique moisturizer is pretty good.  next, blend your foundation well with a  brush and don't use too much. especially  when you've just moisturized your skin, you  have to make sure you do it evenly or else  it could adhere to your skin in random patches.    after that, dab your skin with a cosmetic  sponge.    that works for me, i'm not sure why you're looking  powdery aside from maybe not moisturizing or using  too much foundation.|`|q3fK9CQaaa	That's because your putting too much.|`|YVNeeIIIaa	You need to blend it really well and don't use too much. Try "buffing" over it with the powder brush and maybe use a light bronzer so it doesn't look "chalky powdery"|`|c3Dhkvvoaa	First, use moisturizer, then try liquid foundation instead of powder foundation, then set it with translucent powder. That should help!|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	first, don't use too much.  second, if you leave it alone in about an hour it'll settle off on its own.  i have that powdery look sometimes with bare minerals but it eventually brushes off.|`|3ab6Hc0Faa	u need more moisturizer in your skin.  Maybe a little bit of sunscreen.|`|AA12056556	moisturize before you appy makeup and then set it with a spray on like model in a bottle has.|`|Eqh1enw6aa	First off your face should be freshly clean, then pat it dry, apply serum(this makes your face smooth and gives off the appearance of healthy skin), apply moisurizer(this helps in making your face hydrated), liquid makeup, and a bronzer(brightens your face).
hVZkMkqVaa	haha, you must just have really good hair genes.    or you might use a good shampoo?    anyways, i know what you're talking about.  :)|`|e8b42803cca27f15ab897dbc4a0227e7aa	I think it's because when you have it down, you're airing it out, so the scent is kind of dulled. But when you have it in a pony, it's closer to your scalp, and your scalp/hair growing on your scalp/hair closer to your scalp may be holding that scent of your shampoo or conditioner a lot better than the hair that grows past your scalp normally would.    That's my guess, haha.|`|xETCO0rUaa	Lol i noticed the same thing, my theory is that when your hair is in a pony tail you can't really smell it, you know how you get used to a smell after awhile of smelling it and being around it? thats why i think it is, since you can't smell the smell of your shampoo in your hair when it in a pony tail  and then when you take it out your nose is filled with it again:):)
dhEvs07waa	well if you can wait a week MAC will bring out its special Hello Kitty line and you can buy her and eyeshadow set    or just buy her any mac eyeshadow SET it would be a cute gift.    mac lipgloss is great too.       i dont recommend buying her foundation or powder UNLESS you know her MAC numbers. But still, foundation and powder is kinda boring for a gift.    go for eyeshadow sets (or eyeshadow color you know hse would absolutly love)  lipgloss  the hello kitty nailpolishes look cute too that are coming out  blush is a MAYBE gift.  i say if you end up not buying the eyeshadow set but her a blush with it whatever if u buy.    good luck :]              OH and if you still want to get her a liner, mac has some great liners! i use the gel liner but that might be hard for some people. either way mac has some great ones that are not 30.|`|Eqh1enw6aa	Hyper Girl,    For me I love cosmetics but I find some brands are well knows for certain things. I noticed for Mac there eyeshadows are WONDERFUL, they have their own look to them. If your sis is into sparkles and glitz you could probably get her an eyeshadow primer and a glitter. She can adjust the effect but whatever she does the end results are gorgous. There regular eyeshadows are also beautiful and they do have a special look to them. I know I have compliments everytime I wear the eyeshadow.   You could try it for yourself if you go to a mac counter-You might be tempeted to buy yourself some=)  Hope I helped you...|`|9qxQtLYTaa	it would be nice to get her a makeup palette for the eyes- or some of their collections that come out usually have really nice eyeshadow palettes- next week MACs new hello kitty collection is coming out, and it looks really cute- all the colors are really pretty, and they have glitter eyeliners, as well as some really nice looking shades of beauty powders- the lip stick shades also look rele good, and the hello kitty lipglass looks rele cute too, and it even comes with a little charm-i kno most ppl rele like hello kitty, and want the whole collection! ;p- but it doesnt look rele childish- they have a different looking design of hello kitty- if u dont think she would be into this collection, they have other nice eyeshadows and collecions im sure- or mabe get her some brushes(they are rele expensive tho)   good luck=) if you cant decide what to get her in the end, maybe you can get her a mac lipstick or lipglass, and a mac or sephoa gift card,so she can go crazy on w.e she wants!  ?|`|43tMQlG2aa	I would suggest a mac four pallete with four pan eyeshadows(11.00 each) You can only get the four pan pallete a freestanding stores, no counters carry them. Eyeshadows that are gorgeous and must haves for every mac addict are.  Woodwinked  Satin Toupe  All that Glitters  and wedge.  Other shadows that would look good on her would be  twinks  patina  dazzlelight  and hush :)|`|ITJtxINpaa	I think you should get her a mac eyeshadow in a color that she would like.|`|qOKFuXfLaa	get her a quad- the tempting quad is quite popular  if she likes hello kitty, you should get her some mac loves hellokitty makeup. it will be released feb 12. check on youtube for pictures/information|`|Xb7kaCkiaa	perhaps face and body foundation for a nice sheer coverage  a nice pretty pink blush to make her eyes pop  and plush lash which is really good!|`|7mmmGytpaa	get her some eyeshadows, mac's the best.. get a pink/burgundy or brown color, like an everyday color :)|`|XLRx5decaa	Get her a couple of eye shadows, or maybe an eye shadow palette.|`|Hm5SCDv4aa	Hmm, I would see what she likes the most.  Does she love mascara or eyeliner or eyeshadow better? Because for mascara, you could try plush lash.   Their best eyeliners are powerpoint and pearliglide.  If you get her an eyeshadow, get her something that would compliment her eyes.  Try tan, cream, or lavender.

usxeet5vaa	A light blue strappy babydoll top would look good. A red skinny shirt too. Definitely not something black. Light blue and brown look good together, so something light blue.

Pair the outfit with flats of boots or sandals.|`|6vZ2H7Uhaa	A white, blue (any shade of blue), green, or pink shirt. If you can get any of those colors for a baby-doll top, then that would look really good.  If you're feeling rather bold, you could wear a white and black striped shirt with the brown skinny jeans.  Brown and black IS OKAY to mix, despite what people say!!  Just ask Stacy and Clinton (lol I love What Not To Wear)|`|BzwQl2lfaa	my friend got some brown skinny jeans. wear(with just a white t maybe) or bring your skinny jeans to american apparel and match them with a cute colored tshirt or dress or tunic or anything they have. american apparel is made to match odd colored pants.|`|gFr0T74Jaa	Either a dark blue (not navy, but still kinda dark) or maybe white tunic....|`|yESGH991aa	You can wear this in many ways.

ITJtxINpaa	Instead of using eyeliner pencil or liquid liner, you can use a flat angle brush and some dark black/dark brown shadow(or color of your choice w/ high pigment). Then, just take some shadow and apply it like you would with an eyeliner. It will look better and it gives that smokey look depending on color use.|`|vUsByh1Naa	Ok stay calm,  I know its frustrating.  When you try to do a straight perfect line it won't be perfect.  Try doing a dotted line and then filling it in. Or For a really good look try to hold the end of your eye so its flat and fill in.  Don't use the point on a pencil liner use the side but close to the tip/  It will look great.  Good Luck!|`|KQqZF63oaa	use dry eyeliner.  and don't put it on after your mascara. what i do is leave my eye open and follow the line and if you make the line a little crooked down under then just fill it in color it in. good luck|`|AA10074793	hmm... heres an idea your like 2 so u dont need any!|`|Y4HKumx9aa	It takes a **** load of practice, my best friends done it everyday for the past three years and her eyeliner is flawless|`|zZrKhn9eaa	Apply the liner as best as you can, then take a q-tip and a little bit of eye make up remover and make a smooth line across the top of your liner. This way it doesn't matter how much you mess up, you can just erase what doesn't look neat.  And you can also try a wet liner marker. It's a bit easier than the brush.|`|usIJ4fNhaa	What I do is I kindof stretch my eye to the side so that it's kind of straight looking and I draw on the eyeliner. Short strokes. And if you extend it a little more, you get a nice cat eye look!  :DD|`|lsiyoSRaaa	I close one eye and apply the liner just apply over the top edge of your eye brose, then do the other one. apply your makeup First..|`|7QN9wetGaa	jst practice   it gets easier afterwards|`|z0NxnHknaa	This works for me everytime. I use eyeshadow. Use a slanted brush, wet it, dab the end into the shadow and then smudge it across your lash line. Flawless.

IHhDMHrGaa	Newborn hair loss is perfectly normal and nothing to worry about. Babies often lose their hair during the first six months. This kind of hair loss is called telogen effluvium.    If you notice that your baby has bald patches, observe the way she sits and sleeps. If she always sleeps in the same position or tends to sit with the back of her head against a baby seat, she may lose hair in that area. She may also develop a bald spot if she rubs her head against her mattress.|`|RTJta0Opaa	no...fix it with this    I have been using this stuff for a while now and it is amazing    HAIR ONE CLEANING CONDITIONER it is found at sally's beauty supply store.      here's what it is :  * Sulfate Free  * An all natural approach to hair care  * No damaging detergents or harsh chemicals  * Formulated with an elixir of natural herbs and oils  * Cleans with an astringent and antibacterial properties      Introducing Hair One ... a salon quality product that provides a new all natural approach to hair care and hair detox that leaves hair cleansed, conditioned and in optimum shape.

9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	You've done the right things so far. Downsizing is essential, and you'll want to stay where you are for a least a few months. Wait until the blow out is absorbed, then give it another month or two.    Your Mom got the right stuff. Just use a pin to puncture the capsule, and squeeze the oil out. It's like individual packaging for Vitamin E. It will be pretty goopy when you apply it, make sure you rub it in really well. The rubbing will help more blood flow to your lobe which will help your body heal the blowout.    It's going to take a while to heal, even with doing every thing you can to help it. Possibly a few months. On the positive side, it's usually easier to re-stretch after downsizing, and many people find that their lobes will get a little thicker after - always good for stretching to larger sizes.    In future, try taping up to 7/16. When you get about 4 gauge or so, it's usually easier to tape up gradually. Just get some plumbers tape or bondage tape (the kind that doesn't have adhesive, but sticks to itself) and wrap a layer or two around your current plugs every week or so. You'll find that it's a lot easier on your lobes.|`|79iCnhL7aa	Ouch!  Sorry.  Don't give your mom too hard a time though.  You can still use the capsules.  Just cut them open and juice them onto a piece of gauze.  Next time maybe you should do your own shopping however.  And if the blowout is too bad I wouldn't even use the Vit E.  Go straight for the miraculous Neosporian.
P8A7WOIZaa	3 suggestions:  (1) go to walmart (or any department store) and pick up some neutrogena acne mark fading peel  (2) consult a dermatologist.  Ask about getting a chemical peel  (3) consult a dermatologist.

wwSz1ht5aa	Try eating a little extra protein and doing some simple leg excercises to build some muslce and tone them up some !     Get some little ten pound weights, and hold them in your hands and do lunges. Do like 10 sets back and forth across your bedroom or living room. You could also try holding some little weights and doing some squats, Always stretch good too (:    And always be confident. A lot of girls would kill for skinny legs, i know i would ! Just work what you got ! Good luck |`|68d6a3309b70162315c58a97dda23287aa	Run and take up ballet.

They help with the weight gain, but I cant promise where you'll gain it... Or theres always the option of Yoga or Polities, it might take a while, but you'll gain muscle, which will make your legs look more full!|`|yESGH991aa	I had tht problem too. Get involved in a sport tht involves using your legs, or find workouts tht help ur legs. Start running or go to the gym. Your legs will be toned, and your legs will look thicker, like u want them.
wwSz1ht5aa	You have to work your obliques. Its honestly mostly guys who have that really defined "V", its more of a masculine thing.    See what i mean??   http://my247.com.au/247venue_images/2426...  http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2002/2639...  http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b82/ze...    But, if you still want them. you really have to work the obliques. Do like the side crunches, where when you do your crunch, you bring your left elbow to your right knee and your right elbow to your left knee.    Here's some more ideas:  http://www.sixpacknow.com/obliqueexercis...  Just google oblique excercises!    Good luck |`|MgiK02Zbaa	gross.|`|klu1sCpraa	Go Pink|`|c3Dhkvvoaa	it's her bones  they are protruding... but it's also from being very toned and working out a lot.|`|BeIX5pH1aa	so sit ups lol :P
75gzmV8saa	Okay, get a shower or wet your hair. Then braid your hair and blow dry it. Sleep on it and wake up. Un-braid it and comb it. More crimped, but it will get the job done!

I tried acne free regular and it made my skin even worse and more irritated because I have such sensitive skin. If you have sensitive skin, do not use it! If you don't, give it a try because a few of my friends have had success with acne free. It's like the same stuff as proactiv|`|v5J50Ep2aa	it worked on my skin for a little but after a couple weeks it stop working!|`|S8okmN6gaa	yes.. i used it...i tryed proactive and it didnot work...then i tryed acne free severe and it cleared up in like days..it was amazing to me...my face even had a glow to it..i didnt have terrible acne though just medium to moderate..but wow did it work...i then started using acne free,regular. and it also work..only bad thing if you skip a time to wash you'll break out..and once you stop using it you'll also break out...|`|7f8d05e3674077143007bbb7d8600031aa	All of the acne free products are of very high quality. I purchased the regulary 3-step system kit, after having battled with my acne for 6 years. I've taken medicine before, done the cleansers, topical ointment and microdermabrasion treatments (all very expensive).  Needless to say, after I discontinued all of the above for a couple years my face started getting terrible. I tried the Acne free and it works very well. Just don't use too much of the repair lotion, because too much can burn your skin. Trust me..it hurts.
dhEvs07waa	there are many things that could be the cause of it.    1. it is normal to loose some lashes, but when they fall in chunks thats when u got a problem!    2. try a different mascara, maybe one thats good for eyes like almay, physicials formula, nutrogena, or clinique. (kinds that are proven to be good for lashes) not strong ones.    3. DO NOT USE WATER PROOF MASCARA!    4. do not rub ur eyes when washing the makeup off use a gentle makeup remover (i recommend olay)    5. u can use almond oil nightly (unless ur allergic) and put them on ur lashes or eyebrows if u want fuller eyebrows in in time it will help the loss grow back        GOOD LUCK |`|Io3jW3EEaa	dunt use  cheap mascara|`|Y4HKumx9aa	Any kind of mascara will do that, because the brushing weakens the eyelashes connection, just like over brushing your hair does, so yeah, its normal, your eyelashes should get used to it|`|Ge3BNeB1aa	I don't know, but I'll tell you one thing: If you help me find my eyebrows I'll help you look for some eyelashes...    LOL|`|Cqg18qdAaa	try define a lash, then at the end of the day, clean it off with olive oil, it will make it come off, and give u naturally longer and fuller lashes =)|`|Flgtz6taaa	Try a different mascara. Like covergirl...there collections are good!|`|h19o5cMiaa	Don't use alot of mascara, and don't pick at it either. Also using an eyelash curler will make your eyelashes fall out faster, so avoid that.|`|7QN9wetGaa	what kind of cheap mascara are you wearing?|`|qD6h8GVyaa	That's a sign of cancer, better get that checked out|`|Oh53ZpGJaa	uh ohh. [:  use an eyelash curler && an eyelash primer. thats just like a clear mascara and thenn put on the regular mascara.     that should help   :)|`|lsiyoSRaaa	Stop wearing mascara and see a doctor.|`|N0hlErEyaa	that happened to me i stopped wearin mascara and that helped a little but they still sometimes fall out. its kinda weird
xETCO0rUaa	I get the fluffy ends too but i have a totally different hair  so idon't know if this will work for you too. i never blow dry my hair when it's wet cuz it gets frizzy if you blow dry it using a cool setting after it's already fully air dried then it makes it really soft and silky and even stairtens it a little bit. then i focus on my ends with the flat iron so i don't have fluffy ends. Hope this helps:):)|`|Y4HKumx9aa	dry/dead ends, gets them trimmed off, then condition the ends lots to prevent it from happening again|`|e8b42803cca27f15ab897dbc4a0227e7aa	Maybe you're not straightening the ends and holding it there for a few seconds?    Try it. That should work :]|`|75gzmV8saa	Well, with relaxed mixed African-American hair, it is different. You need to use treatment and go to shops with African-American hair products and you should probably try the hair dresser and ask for advice. Oh and maybe you should spray the ends of your hair and add hair oil. I have relaxed African-American hair and I can't wash it and do everything with it everyday. Or else it will fall out. Good luck! There are easier ways to look good! =D It's probably  the African-American part of your hair giving you problems and you should treat it like African-American hair.|`|u5c8eS9gaa	It is most likely because your ends are really dead and/or damaged. So therefor they are only being irritated by the heat instead of absorbing it and straightening like it is supposed to.
2RkDecZwaa	you wont get blowouts at that low of gauges. and yes, they hurt, they will be sore all day and probably the next morning after you stretch them, this is common sense. for some people the healing process is different, for me in the beggining when i stretched they always got pus on them and some sore and bleeding and scabs, but then when i got to about a 2, thats when the scabs and bleeding and pussing stopped and they only got sore. just deal with it. keep em clean though. if the scabs and nastyness doesnt go away within a few days or a week, thats when you take them out.

5qIOzchwaa	easy. when your hair is wet, about an hour before you go to bed, braid it in about ten braids. You have to have layers to make it look like hers, and keep the last 1 1/2 or 2 inches straight and unbraided. when you take it out just barely shake it with your hands so it doesn't get frizzy. then bobby pin it back on one side. I would use leave in conditioner before you braid it as well. this girl DID NOT use a krimper I used to have my hair like that all the time and i did it with braids.|`|avlVHXDCaa	cut it in layer  the top part wave it  the bottom part staright it  then put it in clips|`|YuPNVX9maa	cut it in layers, and then use a crimping iron, and push it back with a bobby pin.|`|ArfWE1Ykaa	you can take a shower at night, and braid the top part then take it out in the morning. but you can also use a hair crimper.|`|w5sIDn43aa	the easy way is to braid a bunch of medium sized braids it then flat iron over them then bobby pin it back :)|`|xETCO0rUaa	my hair is naturally wavy, the trick is to crimp or curl it in layers, make sure the very top hair, right were you split your hair is very thin so you volume on the top, and don't forget lots and lots of volumizing hair spray, try aussi and pantene:):)|`|apVcr7x2aa	You use a 3 barrel curling iron U crimp only hair on top a few sections. for the front pull some strait hair in a bobby pin after you part it.Goodluck|`|e8b42803cca27f15ab897dbc4a0227e7aa	Crimp the middle of your hairstrands, and leave the ends straight.    :] Oh, and leave your bangs straight, too, and bobby-pin them back :D|`|d5ppt4jFaa	i used to do that when i was little x] if you braid the parts of your hair that you want to be crimped like that tho its not very crimped the look more wavy. But yah braid the parts of your hair sepretley and sleep with the braids in over night wen u wake up just take out the braids carefully dont comb over them it will break them. u might not need to hair spray them so yah :] saves u from burning urself on a crimp machine.

(and probably more likely to actually like you, than to just wanna do you. -.-)     Again, (in my area, ), when  they refer to you as "hot"...  Okay, well, only the sluts in my area refer to anyone as that.  Boy or Girl. It's rude. Same thing with sexy.    And adorable (in my area) means they could look at you   with like, big eyes, and go "OMG!! You're such a cutie!" like girls  do to a puppy, or a bunny or something.  It's definitely not a bad thing, but most of the time they only like you as a friend, and such.    Again, just in my area and stuff.  But it's not a bad thing, in anyway, to be called cute.  (again also refferd to as "boyish charm". xD)    Kay, I'll go now. xD|`|MwkR695Gaa	ur cute  meaning ur not incredibly hot ur just so so and being cute inst childish

They have a lot of different kinds, so explore around!|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	i have seen them at target.|`|MmmcKU52aa	urban outfitters has a bunch  just go to urbanoutfitters.com  good luck :]|`|LSKeLOIGaa	forever 21, urban outfitters, american apparel.|`|WCYEHwEIaa	Charlotte Russe had one the other day in the store.  It is the one that is on the front page of their webpage. However, I couldn't find it listed in the accessories section online. Forever 21 would be your next bet. If you can't come across one, you can get a small, thin scarf and makeshift it.|`|89AN5yZwaa	wal-mart
xETCO0rUaa	hmm.. hard to say, but i think she might dig you a little, if she puts her hand up to her eye when she's resting her head on her hand that means she doesn't like you, if she likes to make contact and laughs at your jokes alot she likes you:):) hope this helps|`|MGjMjWwaaa	well maybe you shouldn't have been looking there|`|FvjbdPNPaa	i think she was flirting...but yeah she likes you|`|3CTcs5u6aa	I think your too boob obsessed. Its all in your head.|`|uU3CK0Yiaa	i think she was, personally ive done that and so have my friends. but dont be focusing on her boobs. by her doing this she might be feeling insecure with her personality so she thinks this is the only way she can impress you. so i say get her number text her and just talk make her feel  good and always laugh at the stupid jokes ;).     oh and instead using the word "hot" try beautiful or pretty and gorgeous those make a bigger impact on girls.|`|3M9TAZAeaa	i think she's totally digging you.  she likes to flirt with you, and maybe just doing the boob thing out of habit.. i do that sometimes and dont even notice it!  but it definitely seems like she likes you.  keep it goin for a while, dont try too hard to make her laugh everytime she's with you.. it's noticable.    and to be able to know if she likes you.. she will like play fight with you, like if you take her phone or pencil or something.. if she play fights with you she totally wants to be really flirty with you.. and will like how fun you are or w/e    just be yourself, show her that you're more than just funny    good luck!!!|`|yhGNTRE8aa	Wellllll.  Okay well she isnt a slut.  She could have just folded her arms and made her boobs look bigger.  or she prob was trying to impress you. You havnt know her for long so wait a little. dose she flirt??Shes prob into you.  Wait a lil then ask if she wants to hang out or somthing. then take it from there.   Stare at her eyes and lips.  Make her notice you too|`|H34ro4I4aa	Sometimes girls do that to attract attention, but that doesnt necessarily mean she has feelings for the people shes getting attention from. you definitely shouldn't judge by that but rather pay attention to whether she tries to be around you a lot, makes excuses to talk to you etc|`|5yXLJx08aa	yes. she's attracted to you probably physically more than anything else at this point. girls usually don't subconsciously fold their arms right under their bust line, so she was being a little flirty.   future signs: if she touches you casually, like your shoulder or arm. if she leans in close to you or if she starts wearing an alluring perfume. if she puts a little more effort in her appearance    good luck!|`|WztCveoqaa	it does seem as though she likes you. its really hard to tell when a girl likes a guy because all girls are different. but the giggling and showing of the boobs is deff a sign. ive done that before.|`|w5sek8YNaa	No. She was just being social,  And the clevage was just cuz of her shirt, and she was just crossing her arms to cross her arm. But hiding from the teacher cuz either the teacher is a perv (like mine) or they have a b-f when girls show boobs.    But im not trying to  be negative.  She might start liking you!  You will know when she starts hanging around you a lot.  Watching you, even from a distance.  Smile a lot.  And blush.    So keep an eye out.

I1oAAKwMaa	actually.... you should be taller than 5'8 if you want to find jobs easily.     this is my suggestion. go to Asia..... I know it sounds crazy but a lot of developing models go to asia to develop they're portfolio and become more experienced and makes more connections in the modeling field.... If you sign with an agency here, they will provide for your trip if they think you have potential. Developing models go to Asia because the asian people love the westernized look and 5'8 is considered extremely tall over there.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Yeah most likely you won't be able to sorry.  Not to make you go anorexic on us, but if you got lucky enough to get into high fashion runway modeling at your height, you'd have to  drop a few pounds and a few inches off your hips.  (If I remember correctly I think the standard hip size is 33 or 34 at 5'9")  Sorry.  That doesn't mean you can't be a model though.  Just not runway.  Kate Moss is 5'7" but she's teeny.|`|FvjbdPNPaa	you are too short to be a runway model..but you can still do commercial modeling. i believe that 5'9 is the minimum to be a runway model

meacW8jQaa	sort of.  neon is going to be REALLY in.  the trend.   like neon green, neon pink & etc.|`|Tf19RETiaa	i saw that pastels and neon colors are in for spring  (according to seventeen magazine)|`|zdPu4z88aa	I think it will be shades of pink, bright blue, and bright green. maybe even yellow. Pastels are in too.|`|FpEI84Gzaa	Pink and Silver together  and Purple and Gold.|`|sOkePjK3aa	Neon colors or neon colors against black.|`|CTzFX0pSaa	definately agreeing wif vicky above me  No matter wat year Pastel (light,soft) colors are ALWAYS in for spring  and even to uhh..spruce it up a little if ur stuck with a pastel solid colored shirt or dress you can sometimes layer it with bold (animal prints too) or floral patterend shirts, tanks,sweaters, or even just accessories. =]   but im not so sure bouh dat neon orange thingie..srry|`|E05AbalLaa	pastels are really in, like lavender, mint green, light yellow, peach, etc.|`|7mjB9maOaa	Yes, professional stylists are saying that bright, tropical colors, specifically neon orange, peach, and sunset-pink will be very abundant this spring.|`|vZmyjmyKaa	gray/blue/green  bright neon orange goes with any prom, its usually one of the classic colors.  go here for ideas;   http://www.jovani.com/prom_2009/|`|HnT1ZK0Baa	My prom (2007) was green.

iJrCZxy8aa	hmm actually... i dont mean to be mean but the filipinos that i have seen are really non good looking. They dont fit my standards of a beautiful women. But im sure that there are pretty filipinos out there aswell, i just havent come across one. There are ugly and beautiful people in every race.|`|AA10451072	Nahh. Filipino ladies are sexy, but nothing compared to Brazilian girls.|`|0HXclnCXaa	yeh i've never heard that before    although now that you mention it....one of my drill sergeants in basic training was half filipino && 100% sexy|`|WpaQKpckaa	Yea I think that to. Not to be discriminative of other asians they're just as pretty, but Filipinas do have an exotic look to them. My Filipina friend is so pretty.
S61oU0yFaa	I think the term is eclectic.  It means you don't really like just one particular kind of style, but many.  They use that term for music lovers too who like different genres.|`|A8awRQWtaa	1. Someone who can't make-up their mind  2.

His jeans were loose, his belt was tight  His balls were swinging from left to right  Left, left, left right, left    His prick was hard his mind was weak  He couldn't hear, he couldn't speak  Left, left, left right, left.    I think it was Nana but it could even have been Olivia Newton-John.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	It was an old Andy Rooney  classic.  The last jumping gigolo in Juniper Springs.

jldfQmFfaa	It will only go on sale if it doesn't sell well and Delia's needs to get rid of the extras. If it does go on sale, it'll probably be the season after its release.|`|9rQzQxexaa	id say a few months, unless no one buys it :p  but in the mean time, why not go for something like this?  http://www.forever21.com/heritage1981/pr...    forever 21 has tons of other nice plaid tops too that are cheaper|`|0LkHjGAaaa	You can find shirts exactly like that in other online stores. Trust me, I wanted that shirt (or something very similar to it) a lot! I love it to death, but I'm glad I didn't buy it because I found one just like it for half the price. And the one I bought wasn't even on sale. Don't get me wrong, I still love Delia's, but they're really pricey sometimes. Try stores like Forever 21!    Here's a link to a similar pink one!    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...
1JglzZTjaa	If you are wearing silver sometimes that can infect it it does to me. So if you have any 14 caret gold ones then dip the ends in antibiotic ointment then stick them in your ears. Every once in a while twist the earrings and eventually it will get better.|`|WJWW7NXaaa	If it is infected you'll need to take it out. There are certain pains associated with new piercing but enough time has passed since August that the initial problems should have subsided.     Keep it clean with surgical spirits and put a plaster over it to stop airborne bacteria from getting in. You can always get it redone when it heals|`|3BvRAGcQaa	try using some peroxide... if over three days that doesnt help, you are probably allergic to the metal just try getting some nice earrings, some that are white gold, platinum, sterling silver...etc. some peoples ears are just a little too sensitive. mine are. i can only wear nickel and gold earrings|`|3c582e2ff2165b90d72480b3064fa8bcaa	that happened to me when i first got mine done. Try squeezing them as hard as you can to get it all out. especially if you feel a bump in there. also, clean them with peroxide at least twice a day.    if that doesnt work, go to the doctor. my doctor cut a small slit on the back of my ear and drained it out for me. (my ear was severely infected at that point). Good luck!|`|UfELDZoMaa	It sounds like it could lead to an infection. Skin has natural oils, but can an infection can start out oily. Are you using alcohol? usually a puss will follow soon after. Or discoloration. Just keep using alcohol everyday at least 2-3 times a day and clean it well. If it gets worse, then take out the earrings immediately and see a doctor if it's looking really bad|`|wPG6TbtXaa	u need to go c a doctor...trust me, thats happning to me rite now and its happend b4 also. i went to c the dermatologist and she gave me this medication, forgot its name, but worked like a charm, i cud c improvements within the first 2-3 days. and mine was severe. i think ur earrs mite be infected. go consult a dermatologist b4 its to late.|`|FEVQisMGaa	That is either puss, or plasma. It's best if you take it out and put in a retainer. You should regularly keep that area clean (but you know that already).    It's not necessarily infected, but it runs the risk of developing into an infection. If the problem persists even with the retainers, remove them.    Use those pimple pads, those are really powerful disinfectants, and act as an astringent.    Clean before putting in a retainer.    Wait like 2-3 days, and put the piercings in. If it continues, that's a rejection. It's not uncommon to have some piercing's work--and some get rejected.    If it stops, you were just having a normal cycle of the piercings healing process.    Your lobes have blood vessels, and your cartilage doesn't.|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	This happened to me with my 3rd hole, cept it was totally different!  1)Take ur earrings out  2) Go to the doctor, or to wherever u get ur ears pierced and let them look at ur ears  3) If they dont know, just clean ur ears w/ that stuff they give u and keep ur earrings out!  4) Ur hole might close up, but u can probably get it pierced again!    Hope this helps =D|`|GemKt7XWaa	Might want to get that checked out. Also, you are fine.|`|CdBdP2ymaa	Can't help...but that always looks cheap.   sorry|`|uOtZUzNOaa	put hydrogen peroxide on it.|`|tbKoPNbDaa	buy one of the cleaners for piercings from claires. i had this too a couple summers ago and it went away after i used that stuff. just whatever you do dont take out your earrings for too long while they are pussing cuz they will close up and then you have to stab them through til it bleeds. its rly nasty. my band director made me take my earring out for a competition and they closed up i was so pissed. lol sry im really bored|`|JoAfcy4Caa	Seems you got you ear pierced at a cheap peircing parlour hygiene is very very importnat when getting anything pierced.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	You are infected|`|ljhVxJDBaa	The same thing happened with my belly ring.  Its not puss, its normal.    but if its red you might want to put eye contact solution on it a couple times a day. (also have my cartilage pierced) and that's what they gave me =]|`|NLx9UiDGaa	u can use alchol to disfect ur ear. als ou can go see a doc about that before anything esle occurs|`|laM5CZmUaa	talk to your doctor, they can diagnose the problem and give you treatment

2oN7WrVKaa	I think that pale is much more beautiful then a fake tan.  Fake tans are usually for people who want to conform, and who are fake.  Natural is truly beautiful.  As long as your skin isnt really sick looking, then pale beats fake tan 10 to 1.|`|jpGNV4Qhaa	naturally pale    u could do alot of things that you cannot do with a tan lol im actually jelous of u people cometimes. :) im naturally taned from head to toe =}|`|7d1bcd83d6c3611b6f659779f4f9e017aa	I find normal skin color to be better than fake tans.
cgmBEvHIaa	dont listen to everyone who says 10. honestly. i was so scared cuz everyone was telling me thatt. its only like a 5 maybe 6. seriously its not all that bad. as for cleaning it, they might have this stuff called H2ocean. if they do GET IT! if not, i kno they have it at hot topic. its amazing really. also dont twist the bar. thats a common mistake people make. good luck!|`|WBXi14WYaa	I know alot of the basics. Umm....   I read all this:  soak it in salt water like twice a day starting off, then you can go to once a day. it shouldn't get infected if you clean it every day. The amount of pain depends on your pain tolerance. My guess is that it would be similar to your cartilage piercing. And they aren't exactly "gaping" holes lol. But I saw a 16 gauge needle. It was really scary looking. But it was a little hairy and gross because It was used to inject a cow with medicine. (Future stepdad is a farmer.)  Well thanks for answering mine. Hope I helped =)|`|K5IOSGXAaa	10 - and God help you if it gets infected. uggh|`|SEd2yp0Paa	When you get it done the place gives you cleaning stuff and instructions on how to use it. I don't have my industrial pierced but i do have cartilage done and it really only stung with she pierced it and then it didn't hurt but for like a week after. HOPEFULLY that will be the same for you!   GOOD LUCK
yMzDqdzbaa	what made me stop is thinking about all the germs that are under your nails.  people get sick just from that.  its absolutely repulsive.  but if that doesnt disgust you..    there are nail polishes that taste really terrible. its clear, and it should help.  i dont know where to get it though..|`|VfBVyNz9aa	Put on nail polish. ;0 A few layers of clear should do the trick. I used to have a nail biting habit as well. I forgot I had nail polish and it tasted soo gross. Blech. It's so bitter tasting. Or you could chew some gum. I was chewing gum once and I bit my nail, but I got some gum on it. It wasn't so hard to get off, but i had to wait till I got home, and I was shopping at that time, so I couldn't really, well, buy anything. 0_0 Also, I knew this guy that way like, mega gross. He has this short stub of nail, like less than half of his nail of there. And it was all bloody and rotten. It was gray and brown as well. He used to dig under it with a lead pencil and his lead pencil would get all bloody. And what's even grosser? I had to sit across from him in LA class each day. I practically puked everyday!|`|14C43fhTaa	Hi Back :)   Well i bite mine too and it is a bit emabarrising   It is hard to stop   My nails sometimes go down to my skin :|    One way you could try is either Chewing Gum(Wrigleys Soft Spearmint to be precise :P) or biting a pen helps     If those dont work for you then try the old fashion method of putting mustard on them and then you will be less tempted to bite them :P|`|4TqadRJYaa	Chew gum or eat candy or something.|`|FJtfeOx0aa	I'd highly suggest you do NOT use the nasty tasting nail polish. I tried it.. Worst idea EVER. It ruins the whole... eating experience... xD  I had chicken wings. Yummy Yummy. And I had sauce on my fingers.. went to lick it off.. :'[ worst taste ever. Ruined dinner. lmao [i sound like a fatty =P]    Full sets might work. go to a nail salon and get a full set. they help you to get used to not biting your nails. problem is, when you take them off your nails are very weak. I suggest you buy one of those nail polishes that are supposed to strengthen your nails. when one breaks, don't bite it. put a little dab of super glue on your nail where it broke. it helps to grow them out, keep them strong, and also helps you to get out of the habit.    also, if you bite them when you get nervous, trying doing something else. i tend to rub my jeans.. like when you take a pinch of salt in between your thumb and pointer finger.. i do that to my jeans if i'm nervous.       lastly, try painting your nails. it doesnt taste good, but doesn't ruin your food :) if you really are bored and want to bite them, try picking or peeling away the nail polish|`|vCpsuchtaa	Get fake nails. That way you won't want to keep biting them because you have spent money on them to look good :-) My best friend did this and it worked.|`|jGqZdS2xaa	They make nail polish that tastes really bad which makes your fingers unnapealing tasting. But if that doesnt work you can go to a hypnotist and they can actully hypnotize you to not bite your nails anymore. I know someone who did this and they said it works great!    Hope this Helps! |`|TAT0bkXyaa	Put some gross tasting nail polish or something like that on.|`|rv4Z32VFaa	Wear gloves or put like vaseline on it or sometime to gross you out when you put it in your mouth so after a while you unconsciously will stop biting your nail.|`|lBSFD5xHaa	Well i would buy some really cute  nail polish & doh your nails & you will  like them so much you wont want to ruin   them by biting them...or...you could buy those   nail polish that taste like chile, or onions, or garlic, then you definitely wont bite them.  :D|`|1KfbgBupaa	There is a brush-on nail product that is supposed to taste bad.  I don't know if it works or not.  I used to bite my nails but made a conscious effort to stop doing it; it took a while but I was able to stop, to the point that even if I have a hang nail and no file or clippers, I can't stand to bite it off!      You might try getting acrylic nails put on as that would cover your own nails and you couldn't bite them; it would give you a breathing period and a boost in your effort to stop the biting.  Also, they'd trim your cuticles and you could get some cuticle oil to keep them looking better.    If you do a round of acrylics, keep in mind there's a proper way to remove them!  You absolutely cannot peel them off - they'll ruin your natural nails.|`|NfKxRUo7aa	start biting your toes|`|DfQCtjXraa	Go to Nail Salon and have a full set on...!|`|gPJf3UTaaa	painting your nails will keep you from biting them. it also will let your nails harden and get healthier.    and moisturize your cuticles every once in awhile for improvement.

To get the hair poofy, I think they layered it and then teased it. :3|`|egj9sL93aa	girl thats not ur style!!!!!  but if u do decide to do that scene style, go for the 1st or 3th hairstyle,  most likely the 3th.  & dont forget the heavy eyeliner LOL    and for the poof, its called teesing, (or however its spelled),  & u might need hairspray or sumthing to keep it up.|`|QGrteAumaa	yeah scene hair fits you well, ugly hair for an ugly girl.|`|8c6e2a73151cc65046309f9d3e2dc2d7aa	3RD|`|IStGqIWBaa	I think the third one would look best on you. Oh and to make your hair big its called teasing the hair. You take a comb and run it back and forth through a section under the hair you want to be big but do it close to the scalp. Yes layers will help make you have this effect. Then spray hairspray all over it. When you do the teasing it will make it look tangled so no worries.|`|u7o75zipaa	If you HAVE to have one of those styles..  Go for the second.

You can't make your hair any stronger than it is -- than it has been programmed when you were born.    You need to be in excellent health, watch what you do and eat, and what you put on your hair.  But it all comes from within.... once the hair has appeared on the surface of the skin, there is nothing much more you can do.  It all depends on what you put into your body to make it all work well.|`|3WItFAwlaa	Janet and Dee gave good advice.    This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have found for my hair type.

I've also been drinking a lot of water lately, and I've noticed an improvement.  Use almond oil instead of moisturizer on your face in the morning.  Give yourself a deep-conditioning treatment for your hair once a week.  Baby lotion seems to work for my skin.  Don't use flat irons or curling irons (they fry your hair).  When you are conditioning your hair in the shower, comb through it.  Use shine serum in your hair.|`|cgmBEvHIaa	for ur skin..

You might also want to try a detangler.|`|DKfScL8taa	for NOTICEABLY softer hair and skin you need body wash and shampoo that does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate. It is a comercial cleaner used to clean concrete floors (like in home depot), and it completely strips your skin and hair of natural oils. If you google it, you'll get all the lowdown on how if affects your skin and hair, and products you can use that does not contain it. I use shampoo with no sodium lauryl sulfate, and my hair is softer, stronger, thicker, and all around healthier!|`|c0n2Rgkpaa	For your hair try dove products. I use Dove conditioners and spray in conditioner and it makes my hair super soft. When I straighten or blow dry it I use biosilk serum. That works really well too. To get soft skin use an exfoliatior in the shower and use baby lotion or aveeno right after you dry off. Do the same thing for your face but use a facial moisturizer. You can also make an at home mask that works really well. Mix oatmeal and honey and spread it on your face. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes and rinse off.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	drink lots of water every day...    make sure you have a good shampoo...i am really liking john frida but purology makes a good expensive shampoo...its what my salon uses.    soft hair can also be fixed witha  good hair mask...try neutrogena...its 6 bucks and worsk wonders...its liek a 3 minute mask.  use a moisturising shampoo not a volumizing one...as those tend to be more drying.  and look at the shampoo label to see if it contains ro sues alcohol...which is the main drying ingredient.  its always better to use a moisturizing shampoo and pair it with a volumizing conditioner...which can weigh down thin hair if thats what you have.  also...reduce your use of hairspray blowdrying on high and any other products...comb your hair out after conditioning in the shower witha wide toothed comb and then again during drying...no brushes on wet hair!!! leave in conditioner is also great...i liek bed head its great and kinda expensive but worth it.    for skin...lotion lotion lotion...find a kind you like...i LOVE johnson and johnson calming lavander...its not greasy and smells so good...and it works well...    before lotion get a good body scrub...i have thos organic stuff...its really grainy...but if you exfoliate your legs and arms and torso...youll be surprised at how soft they feel afterward...esp with the lotion too|`|YJi8CZnNaa	For your skin; take a bath with some baby oil in it.|`|Cy9mMf4gaa	Vitamin E and A|`|DfQCtjXraa	Eat a lot vegetable and fruit...|`|gPJf3UTaaa	taking vitamins will do that.. most vitamins say right on the front of the bottle what they do. so some will say, "healthier hair." or "healthier skin"    also, using any face wash that exfoliates will give you REALLY soft skin.. salon shampoo and conditioner will make your hair softer. but if you don't wanna spend money.. use leave in conditioner.|`|su2aRQSoaa	Just moisturize a lot, drink lots of water, have a lot of vitamin E. Eat a lot of carrots. Don't use shampoos and conditioners like suave. Use something like Sleek Matrizx or Chi. Potion number 9 is expnsive but really good for your hair!

tbKoPNbDaa	doing all of these things will clear up acne and prevent it (and give you glowing beautiful skin) :) hope this helps:  -take omega-3 vitamins. i just get the gummy kinds :P.  -wash your face with warm water and rinse with cold water (closes pores)  -for dry skin i recomend a cream based acne wash. for oily skin i would get a foam or gel cleanser.  -only wash your face twice a day and never skip no matter how tired you are  -drink warm water with lemon in it for a bright clear complexion  -get flaxseed chips from trader joes or some health food store (or anything with flaxseed in it) its amazing for skin and hair  -take vitamins  -drink chamomile tea  -dont cake your face with makeup (if you do wear makeup i recommend neutrogena skin clearing makeup. it covers really well and has .5% salicylic acid in it  -drink half your body weight of ounces of water a day (i.e. if you weigh 120 pounds drink at least 60 ounces of water a day)  -clean your pillow case a couple times a week to get rid of the bacteria from hair products and dead skin  -when you sleep, tie your hair out of your face  -moisturize EVERY day with aveeno clear complexion it has .5% salicylic acid in it to really prevent acne  -dont touch your face at all dont even rest your head on your hands while your sitting your hands have too much bacteria on them  -eat yogurt daily  -keep your hair clean (make sure its not a grease ball) it will get all over your face  - avoid anything with caffeine in it (irritates acne)  -exfoliate gently once a week  -wash your face in the shower, the sink has hard water which promotes acne irritation. the shower uses softer water  -use a mask whenever you want for your specific skin type (dry skin-honey, milk, yogurt, egg whites. oily skin- tomato sauce or lime juice. acne prone skin- papaya juice or cucumber juice)  -wash your cell phone periodically ive heard they get really dirty (bacteria)|`|YwHl37Hgaa	You can try this crush 1to 2 Aspirin tablets mix with a little water and apply on pimples for 15 minutes and wash.

Urine clears acne.  If you go to google it has a couple articles..... if your TOTALLY not down for that... which most are NOT.. seek a dermatologist|`|bu6BhCnpaa	well if its as mild as you say...    a good facial cleanser is always the first step.  a neutrogena bar cleanser of cetaphill is the best...its mild and not as drying.    my dermatologist told me that the number one mistake is not washing your face with a facial cleanser.  most peoepl jsut use dove but thats actaully very pore clogging.  if your acne is not severe...then somehting that is jsut made for your face might make a difference...if its a little worse, then try a cleanser with a sylactic acid.  it will just dry up the pimples.  neutrogena is the best for a first try.    i would ever want to try proactive...its too much and too much is involved...i jsut wash my face with a good cleanser in the shower.  then...i bought a small spot trreatment.  i keep it in my medicine cabinet.  when i do get a pimple i jsut put a dot on before bed and before i put on my makeup and it drys up the pimple right away.    in all the two things iwll cost about 14bucks...depending on brand...and they makea  big difference,    a few other tips...toothpaste works as a good spot treatment is you are unsure of buying one...it jsut dries otu the pimple...but you cant use is under your makeup.  salt is a good facial scrub...but burns a little...corn starch also works and doesnt burn.  using a scrub (i use st ives apricrot scrub) once or twice a week will also reduce breakouts...because it gets the dead sin off your face...which is basically what clogs your pores along with grease and such.    last but not least...a good moisturizer is always essential...i use cetaphill...its mild and not oily.  i dont use it all over...jsut if i get an occasional dry spot.    i knwo you werent too keen on using too many products...but ive honetsly found that investing in a good facial cleanser and making sure to scrub once a week makes a big defference.  and for those pesky pimples that mgiht still show up...a spot treatment really does the trick...give it a try...if you are unimpressed after a few tries...most drug stores will actually refund your money.

Also, a lot of them now have elastic on the back instead of a tie, try to look for those.  I know Urban Outfitters has a few.    Other than that, I don't know.

AA11675226	Every girl is different, maybe ask your mum about what age she started developing and use that as a guide...    I grew substantially when I was quite young (about 13, D cup). I thought I had finished and would always be that size...    When I turned 19 I had another growth spurt and filled out even more, also my hips shot out another 2 or 3 inches and while my pants all fit in the leg and length they just wouldn't button up over my hips! Annoying for sure!    My sisters (I had two) were both different, my older sister was slim and tanned and had a 'lean/slim' body type, she filled out more as she got older. My younger sister was atheletic and had curves in all the right places, while I was somewhere inbetween and more on the curvy side of life...    I would love to be a smaller cup size, I was really self concious about my seemingly massive boobs in school. And then I found out the girls with smaller chests were just as obsessed about size as me... there's really nothing you can do about it either way. You body will take the course is is genetically predisposed to, all you can do is ride out the puberty wave and enjoy your healthy body.|`|f9No4eRBaa	A rule of thumb for guys when they want to date a girl for a long term relationship is to look at the mother as there are high probabilities that's how she will look.  ie: if the 18 year old girl is thin and mother is very heavy, chances are when this skinny teenage hits past 30, the beef will start piling on.    Back to you . . .what's the size of your mom's boobs??  If they are small, you better start thinking about getting a boob job when you are old enough.|`|DeUvhuuQaa	well, how old are you now?|`|XzjOVaZraa	How old are you now though?????? if your 16-20 chances are you chest is finished growing....|`|jTsQkuhHaa	YES - mine grew as I got older, with weight changes, better eating habits and of course, after having babies...

3funFya2aa	Neutrogena.       It's the only thing me and my sister will use. It's kind of expensive, about $10 a bottle.. but it goes on thin, doesn't cause break outs, and covers up nicely. It's actually made to treat and prevent break outs. And I've noticed it lasts a lot longer since you don't need nearly as much as you would typically use with other products. So the price is well worth it.  Sometimes I have dry skin. Nothing will cover that up, duh. But that's why they make moisturizers.|`|lyp6JEcEaa	I use faerie organic minerals all the time on people with acne prone, oil and dry skin and it really a great product. I also understand your predicament on having dry areas as well as oral antibiotics and topical creams can do this. First I can tell you do not waste your time or money on drustrore brands especially liquid formulas as they are loaded with chemicals that can and will break you out, even when they say non comedogenic(meaning they shouldn't break you out). Neutrogena uses a laundry list of harmful chemicals you can look up neutrogena (or any other brand) on how harmful their chemicals are here.......http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com  Honestly when it comes to any makeup in general you need to have a good skincare regimen. Most drugstore brands will dry your skin out and not moisturize properly as many of them use synthetic emollients (moisturizers). Are you exfoliating as well? This will help to turn over skin cells and make your face less dry and cakey looking when you put your makeup on. I always recommend mixing table sugar with your face wash as this is a natural form of glycolic acid and helps turn over dry skin cells. Faerie Organic really is the best thing that I always recommend for acne as their makeup has no chemicals, no preservatives, it is natural, it not only covers redness but actually helps redness due to the zinc oxide which is anti-inflammatory and it can help future breakouts due to the Boron Nitride which is antibacterial. My clientele loves it. You have nothing to lose I would totally recommend getting the sample kit. And make sure you ask them for some samples of their skincare as they give me samples all the time with my orders. I have used their acne products and they really work on acne. Hope this helps you with your decision.
LVO8ixtaaa	I think a messy bun would look great! Some examples; http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1429/6547...

So, I usually pull off a high ponytail, but pigtails look amazing! And really cute.   Also you could try doing two really "messy" braids. Since your hair is layered, some of the hair will come out of the braids, but it still looks really cute!|`|jnRdXKVbaa	i think curls looks hot, short hair like alice cullen is awesome too! my friend has her hair! just be creative    BE YOU!|`|J3W93q55aa	it's alright|`|oJdyBSDHaa	maybe scrunching it, or something called the triangle, its like a half pony tail but a little less hair tied.|`|v9uESkIDaa	maybe a ponytail with your bangs loose. you are very pretty!|`|ZleVRevVaa	yes i liked ur hair and even u look sooooo cute. can we be friends?|`|NIYYN6tpaa	Mines  better and I'm a guy but your good. Don't worry about|`|vJzCrX88aa	its nice yeah.. ponytail wud luk gud|`|YGfdyCofaa	You have beautiful straight, shiny hair!! I think it would look really cute in a short bob haircut. It would accentuate your long, slender face and high cheekbones. It would be kind of drastic, but it's the hairstyle I would have if I had your hair type and facial features. I'm envious! :)
MV4OYifKaa	Okay well first of all, you need confidence. Go out and buy some heels, wedges or boots or something. They will boost your confidence level. And it looked like you hardly wear makeup. Theres one of your problems.. when you have no make up on, it makes you look you have a baby face or that your innocent. Wear some more dramatic make up, maybe a darker shadow with some liner and mascara, and definately more blush. I'm not saying to cake it on but just use a little more. And why nto show some cleavage??? Your a girl, flaunt what you've got..not to much tho=] hope i helped!|`|SOTftMa1aa	I wus gonnu suy show some clevuge but guess not. sorry bout the u's but the first vowel key is broken. umm use wuy more muke up und grow the huir out cuz it is ugly|`|nRYVWkpEaa	huh, you're not 12, but are you sure you're not 13?

Instead of tshirts with words on them, buy blouses. Forver 21 has some nice ones.  Also I'd suggest a different haircut. Maybe one a little more sophisticated?  I was thinking instead of the swept bangs, to do ones straight across, but that could actually end up working against you.

rzsxk6Rzaa	lip peircings are about 50 or 60 usually with jewelry, you need to wash them with saline solutions and epsom salt, and rinse with listerine after EVERY MEAL.  Tounges cost about the same but you have to eat mashed potatos and pudding for about a week cuz your tounge swells, and you need to rinse with the unflavored listerine every hour or so and after every time you eat.     Intially its hard to hide a tounge peircing, lips idk how you would hide it but once the swelling of your tounge goes down... after about 2 or 3 weeks... depending on how fast you heal and how clean you keep it, you can swich to a clear of pink bar bell.    Just be careful not to yawn!|`|ZaadvJAXaa	Good luck getting a tongue piercing and hiding it from your parents.  You'd be talking funny for a while, til it heals.

wiJmJ7gNaa	It totally depends on the type and brand of hair straightener you use. If you bought one that is regular brand kind, then you shouldn't use it as much as you do now, because it could cause a lot of split ends and would be damaging to your hair like your mom said.   As for me, I sometimes straighten my hair at least once or twice a week, but I'm using a hair straightener that costs somewhere around $200 and instead of being made from the regular materials the ordinary straighteners does, it's said to be ionic or something, and is doesn't kill your hair at all.  Another advice, sometimes natural is pretty. Don't always straighten your hair, cause wavy can be a cute style too!|`|b33b2b841b148ef2f8f73241b4f3bd75aa	it will not make your hair fall out when your old all it does is slowly damage your hair, but its just your ends usually, so your fine and you barely use it compared to others.|`|dASDaT4Zaa	Straightening your hair every week or so will probably not do anything to your hair. If you're still worried, you could possibly try a replenishing shampoo that mends fried hair.|`|t043WEDIaa	ok obviously it's not good for your hair, and can cause a lot of breakage.  i would invest in a really good straightener because it will last a long time and won't cause as much damage.  also, there are things that you can spray in your hair before you straighten/blow dry that can help protect your hair.  also, make sure you use a good conditioner|`|4Wrubudwaa	always brush hair first and let your hair be soft a dry then straten it|`|1BiHJqdiaa	Ok, so I have long hair (down to my waist straight). As long as you have you're straightners on a not too high temperature, and have your hair trimmed regulary, 1-2 times a week is fine for straightning.     You won't turn out bald, don't worry.|`|HHnQyjFBaa	Well if your hair is healthy, it makes it look very shiny and smooth. If you have been straightening your hair for a really long time and have never used heat protector, your hair will look fried and very damaged and dry. Straightening causes split ends, which happens when your hair gets very weak. I would suggest going out to buy a heat protector, and don't straighten every day. Be happy with your natural hair, you can do a lot with it without using heat!    Cheers,   - Claire|`|QU0V1G32aa	Straightening your hair is actually really awful for your hair.  I have super thin hair and I straighten my hair at least once a week and no more than three times a week.  I would continue straightening your hair if you want it straight but there is no positive side to straightening your hair except for it being straight. You could always use something like, I'm not sure but thickening shampoo? Incase your hair starts falling out, haha. But also, there is shampoo out there like repair for your hair. Just look for one of those.    Hope this helped :]|`|OagqxZnyaa	uhh not really is so-so you should sraighten your hair   2 times a month is you do it more your hair will get frizzy like this picture ok :)      http://www.hairrepairteam.com/images/reb...    i dont want your hair to be ruined ok im just trying to help you ok ;)|`|Ku7Qi76Paa	i believe that if you don't have it on too high of a temperature and don't expose your hair to it for long periods of time it should be fine. Just use good shampoo and conditioner to help reverse to damage. And you also might want to try some heat protection spray..try Beyond the Zone Turn Up The Heat Flat Iron Protection and you can get this at a Sally Beauty supply store...|`|QWlZsv62aa	Well straightning your hair is bad for your hair cause no heat is really great for your hair. But hair grows back even when you're older, hair continuously grows. There is a straightner called the Kioseki, it's exspensive about $100. But it won't damage your hair as bad. If straighning your hair makes it look better, if you're not worried about damage, keep straightning. Or let it go in it's ntural habitat. Put it in a loose pony tale...|`|kknSPYxKaa	I straighten my hair every single day, but straightening your hair isn't as bad as putting a blow dryer to it everyday, like some people do, it is best to just let it air dry.  OR you can try using a heat protector, you can buy it at any drugstore.  I use VO5 heat defence.  Love it!

HE1cJJQYaa	If you take really good care of your piercing and go to a reputable shop with a professional piercer, then you run a low-risk of infection. It will be sore for a week or two which reminds you to take care of it. Then it will start to feel absolutely fine. You will be able to tug on it a little and sit comfortably and it will feel a lot less tight around the piercing (you will barely notice it is there). This is the point where you have to remember to keep it clean and the less touching the better. Continue to wash it when you are in the shower and do a sea salt soak occasionally (1-3 times a week) to keep everything up to par. After about 4-6 months minimum, you can change your jewelry but I would wait a little longer just to make sure that the fistula (healed skin around the piercing on the inside) is completely healed and won't tear.    Good luck!|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	yeah,  it kinda hurts,  but only for a few seconds.  and it just is a bit red afterwards.  but its really not that bad,  and it ends up looking great once it heels in a few days.  just moisturize and wash the area a few times a day, so it wont get infected,  and if it does just keep moisturizing.|`|SEd2yp0Paa	I just took mine out a few weeks ago. I got mine done when i was 16 and i'm 20 now. The hole I have now is so gross.. i can see through it! SICK! I'm going to have a nasty scar and a cute little stretch mark to go along with it when I decide to get pregnant. Mine was infected for almost a year.. gross puss and crusties. It hurts if you hit it while its healing of course, but when its done healing you just have to worry getting clothing stuck on it and pulling on it. It maybe cute while your young but when you decide to take it out.. its not cute at all.   Just something to think about :)
IcTnDRC4aa	Yes, I do it all the time!  You just take your straightener and and pull down, only wrap the hair around as opposed to just going straight down.   For the best results, pin your curls up and use hairspray! When you're all done, take down all the curls and run your fingers through it, to separate some of the curls. Good luck!
Y22T738Taa	Definitely a cute boho dress. Put tights on and layer a shirt underneath... makes it perfect for the boots, as opposed to sandals!|`|l1VA4W6kaa	im sorry but..........

I would definitely pair it with a tunic and leggings maybe or skinny jeans.  Skinny jeans are a must with these otherwise your pant legs will cover them up.

rNaH7Ogaaa	uhmm just wait i guesssss.    im twelve and i wear a b and have maah period    depends on the person reeealy|`|DJLz6o8Iaa	theres a lot of water bras,silicone bras,ect u can use!! and ur just a girl,wait a lil longer until your boobs grow a little more, if your not satisfied when ur an adult u can get a surgery! but be happy right now!!  :)|`|GTEreJJ7aa	eat a lot.  boobs are fat.|`|QU0V1G32aa	There isnt really anything you can do.  I used to have that problem and all you can do is wait.  Eating a lot wont help your boobs grow.  Have you ever seen really fat guys with like boobs?  Yeah, you dont want that.|`|v5J50Ep2aa	you just have to wait you dont want to be know as the girl who stuffs her bra!|`|fxgMwo7iaa	Don't look forward to your period fro boobs, i got my period at 11, and im still only a 32b, sometimes i even get a 34a to push my boobs up for cleavage. and its not a kid's size. 30a is a kid's size. get implants when you're 18.|`|lBj1AEhIaa	okay there is no food you can eat. and yeah youll get them soon.  my friends like 16 and still flat chested. so it just depends on the person. and dont get water bras or dont stuff. people can tel when they are fake.|`|YFhEbEwUaa	i know it may be hard for you but there's really no way you can make your boobs bigger, and eating a lot won't help. trust me.  You probably are just going to hit puberty late, there's nothing wrong with that. Your period is probably on its wayy(:  Don't worry hunnn it's not very fun anyways|`|V2F8YCa2aa	Just wait and they will come! It's a natural thing, don't rush it.|`|HycJkyxxaa	I understand your problem. I'm your size but I'm 15. When i was 13 i was smaller but i was also skinnier. Once you mature a little more you're chest should grow, but if not don't worry.  Chest size isn't what makes a person. Also, after you get you're period you're breasts should grow more.
b33b2b841b148ef2f8f73241b4f3bd75aa	Hmm try using an intense shampoo or go to a salon and talk to them about it, you might just wanna dye over it.|`|zY8uu241aa	Wash your hair with acid. Trust me, it works.|`|MP6yCEXYaa	cut it, it will def do the trick|`|vPSxynmEaa	it depends how long its been in. it will probably only last 6 to 8 weeks in the first place, so you could just wait. or you can go to a salon and have them try to lift it out.|`|f6zazHOFaa	Well it all depends on what your original color is.  If you were blonde it will not come out.  The package may say washes out but if you were blonde it stains the hair. They fail to mention this.  If this is the case, the color will have to be stripped and a new color deposited.  Best advice is to go see a local stylist and get a professional consultation.  If you can not afford a salon try a local beauty school. Typically they only charge for the product being used and not the time because the students need the time to complete the state board required hours. Hope this helps.|`|AA11675226	Some more info about the condition and appearance of you hair prior to putting the semi on would help me answer this better.    Assuming you were blonde before, and put a blue dye in your hair that you tried to wash out which has now turned your hair green, I would recommend buying something like Selsun Blue Anti-Dandruff shampoo.    I had natural blonde hair, put blue in the ends for a concert then had a job interview the next week. I swear I spent most of that weekend in the shower!     But yea, unless you pop down to the salon and get them to do a colour correcting session or bleahc it out there's not a lot else I could recommend.     Whatever you do, dont try putting another colour on at home while your hair is in this condition. A store brought colour will only turn out the colour on the packet if you have relatively natural, untreated hair beforehand. if you try any other at home colouring, your hair will probably turn a dark khaki green, not a good look!
v9uESkIDaa	hi, well i had the same problem, cause my mom always asked me to go with her to the salon. i HATED that, i had my hair red, orange, brown, yellow, pink, purple.... so i totally understand... my hair fell a lot. and with time it stopped falling, here's what i did (or what my new hairstylist told me i had to do):    1. NEVER dye your hair..for a while, until the problem is solved completely. don't have a perm or anything. the only thing you can get in a salon is a haircut and vitamins (which help, but it's not the  1 thing)    2. don't straighten your hair or use ponytails for a while. sometimes it's hard to fix your hair with these conditions, but trust me, you can work it out. and if you MUST straighten, use a ceramic straightener    3. wash your hair only TWICE a week. this is VERY important    4. use your shampoo ONLY IN THE ROOTS. and don't EVER use leave-in conditioners. use regular conditioners ONLY IN THE ENDS OF HAIR! (trust me.....)    5. nobody can tell you which brand of stuff to get. what can be happening is that the pH of your hair changes with conditioner specially, so it falls. what you have to do is get a new brand and try different ones till you see one that you can use and no hairs fall. specially with the conditioner. and remember, only in the roots goes the conditioner.    6. this is the last but the hardest, i know... but trust me. i had this problem and i lost about 50% of my hairs 3 years ago :( and following these steps now i have waist length hair and my hair doesn't fall anymore and the new hairs grew back and well... i'm very happy now :)  well... step 6 is cut your hair. my hair was like 4 inches above my shoulders and i had to cut my hair by the middle of the neck. my hairstylist just told me: "i have to cut your hair so it doesn't fall completely" so i agreed, cause the hair that is too long weights more and falls easier. so, until the problem solves, at least cut your hair by your neck. you'll see it's worth it...    good luck, you'll see you can do it! :D tell me how it turned out!|`|u2fdcM6xaa	dont overwash your hair. also dont overcomb it and when you comb it use a really widely spaced comb. use shampoo that protects and makes ur hair stronger.|`|2gg3dKJUaa	look for products with henna in them... find a place with organic products and find a restoring shampoo with henna.... the harsh chemicals in regular hair products are overbearing on your hair...|`|rNaH7Ogaaa	hair falling out is natural. happens to everyone|`|HS44HUrgaa	damn i would kill my mom if she ever put anything in my hairr :P  try a new conditionerr maybe ??  Sally Hanson's a good store for good stuff =]|`|fxgMwo7iaa	Don't dye your hair until it grows out completely, use a hair serum, dont straighten or blowdry your hair. shouldnt your mom know this stuff?|`|pMSySO5vaa	Well you always will lose some hairs. its normal. The product that your using is really good. um like when my friend gets really stressed she loses more hair then normal and she breaks out. So the fact that your stressing about it falling out is probably not the best of ideas. so just try to not stress so much.|`|c89J6VFEaa	I don't know much about hair but I'd say don't dye it ever again!  And get some natural treatment done by a proffesional  Oh and make sure to thank ur mom!

c6oApsD7aa	Well, if you cry at the wrong times its usually hard to stop your face from being red, seeing how your probably not near any cold objects. If you are, Ice works best or sometimes a wet washer and dab your face a little until the redness goes away. Good luck! :]|`|8bc5ef4c5efab964e0a598b04c4f2f86aa	Ok hun, you can't do it right away, I say you take a paper towel put Ice cold water on it and dabb it on your face. Then take a regualr paper towel and dab the water up. It will take a minute or two but it gets rid of it alot faster!|`|9xBtHTdCaa	splash you face with water or rub it with a wet washcloth for like five minutes and if you can not get to that put it under a air conditioning  vent and make sure the air is pointed at your face for a few minutes|`|yg1QlVm1aa	deep breaths until you relax and it'll fade|`|zL5qROrLaa	Cold water usually helps me!:)|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	I'm sorry you cry so much.

Anything cold helps.    Hope it helps|`|E0PQQaNjaa	cold water, or if you can, crushed uncoated asprin made into a paste with water really, really works - apply thinly to skin. The aspirin causes blood vessels to contstrict getting rid of redness.|`|eJbA3g4vaa	Splash your face with cold water and then pat it dry. Unless you have mascara on, then use a wash cloth and wipe around your eyes. It is best if you wash your eyes though.
5YMkieeXaa	i think black would be alright with you.    putting on eyeliner is easy .    you can chose to but in on the inner lid outer or both     if you chose inner it will make your eye smaller    if you shose outer it will make your eye larger.    --------------------------------------...  for a natural look don't go around your entire eye, just do corners and maybe a little of the middle.       i hope this video helps too  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CscN3pYzP...      good luck!|`|e0urnErUaa	black on top and bottom will look great!|`|NjAD1xcZaa	Use a black, they really compliment brown eyes and make them stand out, try to get very close to the lid on the top, do it in many strokes with a thin pencil, don't try it all in one go. Same with the bottom. except try to line in mostly, then go over it so it's more even and straight. hope this helped.
WE5LFhmJaa	the eyeliner-maybe you should get a long lasting eyeliner. like covergirl. make sure your skin is clean and not oily before you put on your eyeliner.    lips-you could get a concealer that matches your skin to put around that area|`|x6PNkSxbaa	spf 25 from clinique   http://www.clinique.com/templates/produc...  this works well i use it but i dont have dark areas around my mouth but my friend does i recommend it it worked good  and this eye liner i use this one and i love it http://www.clinique.com/templates/produc...|`|IIpEaDCcaa	Always prime your eye before putting on any makeup.

Don't bother taking anything.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	Take some tylenol for sure.  I had mine pierced and it hurt like hell.

However, it looks really cute, so don't let the thought of pain discourage you!  lol  Good luck girl!|`|LvI4jRd8aa	take pain medicine before and make sure you keep your piercing super clean until it's completely healed because belly button rings can get infected easily|`|JBLcMQ9haa	I would just take some Ibuprofin before you go.

Its sore after wards, every time you sit down or bend over. Take some ibuprofen, it will help.  Make sure you keep it clean.  Its really no big deal, you'll be in and out within 20 minutes.  Good luck, and remember, beauty is pain.  If you have any more questions about it, feel free to email me, i have mine done (:|`|jUuYMVqiaa	no reason to take anything for pain, getting your belly button pierced is just like getting your ears pierced. its just skin..so if you have your ears pierced then you already know how it will feel. the clamp hurts worse than the needle, and i've had a little experience with different areas being pierced and my belly button was the least painful..both times.

QypYDyUqaa	Try:   Chin-length or longer styles. Side-parted hair styles. Swept-forward layers around the upper face, gently wispy bangs. A chin length bob is great on your face shape! This creates a balanced look by giving fullness where you need it. You can wear shorter styles, however, if you are a dramatic heart shape you need to leave weight in the back nape area. This will achieve more balance between your dramatic cheekbones and more narrowing chin.|`|MLAQJ0ewaa	If you're really not sure, go to a fancy salon. Not a fantastic sams or someplace in a mall.

It seems you know what you want, so go with the bangs...I have a heart shape face too and I just got fringe bangs about two weeks ago and they look great! I kept my hair really long though. If you want it shorter because you're tired of it being so long, then go with that as well...maybe a bit above the shoulders? That would be cute with the bangs.

AA11675226	As you are a guy, you will probably have coarser leg hairs then most females.    Exfoliate with a loofah brush the day before and keep legs moisturised well at all times.    Shower, let legs get nice and wet, lather up.    (I usually hop out of the shower for this part and do it over the bathroom sink).    Smooth shaving cream for sensitive skin over your legs (something with aloe is good).    Shave with the grain/direction of the hair folicle.     The wet the leg down and reapply shaving cream/gel, shave against the direction of the hair folicle.    Slow and steady is the way to go, dont push too hard or go to fast as you will cut your skin.    After you are satisfied with the level of smoothness, jump back in the shower and rinse off.    After drying, make sure you moisturise legs well.    You mentioned skin irritation, you may be cutting the hair too close to the skin. Sometimes a one or two bladed razor can be better for males or those with senstive skin as it doesnt cut quite so close to the skin.    I am one of thsoe unfortunate girls who cant shave my legs every day as I get bad razor burn if I do. I brought one of those nifty wet/dry electric razors... it removes all evidence of hair even though if I rub my leg I can still feel a slight stubble sometimes...it's still better than ugly red dots all over my legs! And it also means I can have smooth looking legs every day of the week and then super smooth legs for date nights etc.|`|PwDWfgiNaa	Nair is an awful thing, it burns be too. Shaving feels good right after wards but the stubble it creates isn't fun. Exfoliating your legs helps. But if you want silky smooth legs for long periods of time, i would strongly suggest waxing. Professionally of course, if you do it at home you won't go through with it. The results last anywhere from four to eight weeks. Hope this helps.|`|WsPjaIXsaa	I find it really simple... you should use shaving gel when you use a razor. Are you just dry shaving it or are you using water. Also you can try soap instead of shaving gel... This is what I do.  1) I get my legs wet  2) I put the shaving gel on  3) I shave my legs|`|DeUvhuuQaa	guys are supposed to have hair on there legs...weird|`|qdqr9j3raa	your a guy.. you shouldnt shave your legs    but since you alreadyyyy did.. put on lotion after you get out of the shower.. it soaks into your skin better and will make your legs softer|`|35d2zC5Faa	My first thought was, why did a guy shave his legs? But hey, not for me to judge, you weren't asking for my opinion on that. That said, I never shave my legs two days in a row because my skin is too sensitive. If you really want to remove leg hair, and you don't want stubble, wax them. Your legs will be smooth for 2 weeks. Plus, every time you wax you damage the hair follicle, and in about a year, you will notice less growth.

HLmd17r9aa	It all depends on the size and detail, or which artist you go to. Some charge by size while others charge by the hour. You may have to get it done in more than one session if it is a very big piece. I think the area would be fine and the artist will shave your leg to tattoo it.    My guess would be anywhere between $400-$800 simply based on my idea of what it would look like. I am not an artist, and I would highly recommend looking around and getting quotes for pricing before just paying up at the first shop you go to.    Good luck!|`|GXM74MGPaa	600-800. dont get tribal. its lame. and it would cover it. but you would still be able to see it.|`|8THz1sp9aa	If you have extremely hairy legs you're going to want to shave constantly. This is a larger piece so your artist is going to most likely charge you by the hour. I know my artist charges new clients $100 an hour. All artists are different though, I know another artist in the same shop that charges $140 an hour. Since it's going to be completely black, it's probably going to take a lot longer to finish (not going to be cheap) I don't see why it would stretch unless you put on a lot of pounds all of a sudden or started to work out constantly.|`|N19mmDELaa	the lower leg is a great area for a tattoo.  the tattoo shop should shave your leg for you when u go.   when the hair grows back it shouldnt look bad.   price depends on the artist. some charge by hour other charge by size, color and detail.   calf's dont get really fat like bellies would. u shouldnt have to worry about stretching.     good luck!|`|fUz47r7haa	it depends who does it|`|zggJKu5Gaa	I have both of my calves tattooed with straight blackwork.  My tattoos are classic hot rod flames going from my ankle 2/3rds of the way to my knee.  I also have hairy legs, but you can see the tattoo just fine.  It really helps that it is solid black, and just a shape (no details or shading or anything).  Unless your legs are super-hairy, you should be fine.  I have never heard of calf tattoos stretching perceptibly.      I can't really help you with the cost, but blackwork is very slow and expensive because the artist has to get complete coverage of every single piece of skin for it to look right, and then you will still most likely have to go in at least once more for touch-ups once it is healed.  I don't know how long your tattoo will take, but my calves were about 5 hours each.  A good shop will charge between $100 and $200 an hour, plus tip.  So a 5 hour piece would run around $750 plus tip.    Finally, get the tribal if you want, but just be aware that you are going to get a lot of flak for it.  Most people (myself included) view tribals as the male equivalent of a tramp-stamp.  If you really like it, don't worry about what others think, just do what you want.  But if you have any second thoughts, or an idea for another tattoo which is more original and has some meaning to you, I would seriously consider it.|`|AA11519838	Price REALLY varies from artist to artist. They can honestly charge whatever they want. Area-wise, it's fine. Hair shouldn't really matter unless your legs are like a couple of bushes. Straight black, you will most definitely have to go get it touched up right after it's healed. Hope this helped a little bit.|`|QzlFON84aa	Well i think it will cost you at least $500 from your description of it. But again it all depends on the detail you are putting into it. And then again how thick it will be.. So im guessing at least $500. Also i think were you are planning on getting this tattoo shouldn't really affect you in anyway so i think it's ok. And finally your tattoo will show even if you have hairy legs. unless its like Chibcha hairy.|`|2cc1f1dada4ed72fa85fbd7edc9e1ff9aa	i think that that  sounds really cool , but you should reaally think about it, i mean, the leg is somewhere visible and whith that , i know this is wrong ..but people judgee. you... , why do you want it? why on the leg?  i want a tatoo too but im still deciding.. i
ABOvm38Caa	I like the Ped Egg.  Not sure if it would work on corns, but did a great job on my heel removing calluses.|`|TRmUCvJWaa	Just bite them off
C5eKUi2Xaa	Okay so if you want longer looking lashes, curl them BEFORE you apply one coat of mascara. (If you're going for the natural look). NEVER curl your lashes when the mascara is still wet or you might rip out your lashes! If you want to use eyeshadow, get light, neutral shades. And you should use 2 colors. One darker one, and a skin color one. Apply the darker shadow to the bottom half of your eyelid and the lighter shadow to the top half. And where the two colors meet, blend! Just blend a little so there isn't a weird line. If you want to use eyeliner, I recommend a brown pencil one. And apply on the top lid right above your lash line. Just a fine line though. You don't want to over do it. If you want to use concealer for blemishes, green concealer eliminates red. But if you want a regular one, get one that matches your skin tone pretty well if you don't plan on wearing extra foundation or powder because if the color is off, you will have weird colored spots on your face! White eyeliner on the bottom makes your eyes appear larger. And also, if you want to bring out your pretty eye colors, get Almay eyeshadows made for your eyecolor. The link is below.    Hope this helps! :)|`|sPvhK9eLaa	one coat of curving mascara. maybe a little eyeliner if you want, not liquid tho. =]
82JFlb9Faa	There are alot of things to promote hair growth.    1.eat alot of fruits and vegetables    2.take multivitamins daily    3.your happiness and stress level has ALOT to do with hair growth    4.rub your scalp in small circle for about 10 minutes each day with olive oil.    5.dry hair breaks off easily,so make such you oil it unless you have alot of natural oils    6.every 6-8 moths trim your hair.Trim about 1/2 an inch each time.    7.drink ALOT of water.This is very important.    8.Try not to stress over little things.Stress is one of the most hair killers on the world!     9.that's it.Try your best and good luck!:)|`|f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Curly hair will always *look* shorter than what it actually is, so even when it looks like it's not growing it actually is. You have to find ways to measure your hair, like with a measuring stick, and keep track month-to-month of how much your hair has grown. Many people keep track by taking digital pictures of their hair and comparing them month-to-month to see how long their hair has grown. There are things you can do to hamper your hair growth, such as putting stuff on your scalp, like oils, so make sure you keep a nice, clean scalp. Also, if you have breakage then that could be why your hair isn't getting longer, in addition to cutting it.     Never comb/brush your hair when it's dry out drying because that pulls out the hair. Instead, always comb/brush it when it's wet and has a lot of conditioner or shampoo in it. This will make it easier to comb and detangle and you won't be pulling out your hair in the process. It's recommended that curly hair is detangled with a brush and straight hair should be detangled with a comb. If you use a comb then use a wide-tooth comb because anything smaller will pull out your hair.|`|lPU38Lk6aa	My hair is the same exact way.   I'm gonna give you the same advice my stylist gave me.  Do not dye your hair, this will only cause more split ends and will actually result in making your hair curlier and thicker. Don't comb the **** out of it when it's wet, as wet hair breaks easier than dry hair causing split ends. Try to let your hair dry naturally, and shampoo your hair every other day, but apply conditionor every day. It will make your hair a lot healthier because curly hair is usually more dry and coarse than straight hair.|`|YGfdyCofaa	I'm by no means an expert on this matter, but I do have extremely thick, long, curly hair. A few of the most important things to remember are to keep your ends trimmed, NEVER use a brush, and make sure to keep your hair moisturized. I just asked a similar question the other day and got an extremely detailed answer from a fellow curly-headed girl. This process was recommended to me and seems to be very good. It's pretty drastic, but is something to consider.    CurlyGirl Process: http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...    Also, the JessiCurl line has come highly recommended to me as well. You may look into one of their sample packages and see how that works for you.    JessiCurl Line: http://www.jessicurl.com/    Just a few things to consider. Hope this helps!!
MV4OYifKaa	well first of all, your 13, i probably wouldnt let you dye your hair either. Trust me, you will probably regret it cuz you hair with get damaged and you'll hate it. But work on the grades thing and maybe do some chores around the house, keep your room clean and stuff. You have to bargain with them. Say "hey mom, if i keep my room clean, do chores when you ask, and keep my grades up, will you let me dye my hair?" that way your both getting something out of it.|`|gDHFh2Coaa	-Work up those gradessss!  -Show classy picture examples of people with this hair color.  -Make your parents a promise.|`|kogfFMgmaa	do u have cash? just buy some dye and walk ovr to the salon if u have like 100 bux they'll do it for u.|`|z1gUsqzHaa	I'm in the same situation as you, only I want white hair (It would look cute and artsy!)    I want to do it behind her back, but that seems... You know.|`|5VXsgfLGaa	Tell them that it's your hair and you have to live with it. My friend did that when we were 13 and she got to dye her hair purple :]|`|fA96jQcvaa	If you have long hair, and you dye it, there's like an 80% chance you'll lose control of your hair & it'll get really damaged.  I had long hair and i dye'd it once, and i started having lots of split ends and hair falling out [My hair is still constantly falling out for no reason because of that]    So i suggest not to dye your hair. But since you WANT to, and that's the question, i'd say tell your parents you're growing up, and it's time you made a decision, and that decision to dye your hair isn't harmful to your HEALTH, and it will make you feel more confident.    Good luck & i hope i helped!|`|iTTS06IKaa	You could try starting with something a little less extreme, like a NON-permanent purple streak instead of dyeing your whole head. That way, if you end up not liking it, it looks bad, or your mom really abhors it, then it will come out in a week or two. Or on the flip-side, if you end up really liking it and your mom can handle it, then you could dye it permanently.     Also, you might want to try to do better in school or offer to do chores...you know, win your parents over ;-). And you could offer to pay for it yourself.|`|gvwMiLNYaa	just tell your parents the truth about what you want. explain to them why you want to dye your hair so badly. they should understand.|`|XfWoNzXWaa	umm...purple? r u sure u really want purple hair? like, my babysitter had purple hair like, 5 years ago, and after a few washes it turned pink. so unless you want pink hair.....|`|lPU38Lk6aa	well...you could just get like10 dollars and go to a drug store and buy the do it yourself hair dye kits.  theyre actually really easy to use.
zhxeJuqyaa	yes there is. my cousin had it once after she came back from a trip to africa. put mayonaise on your for four hours. DON'T keep it on overnight, it can become poisonous after six hours. also you might have to watch her hair 2-3 times to get all the may off. another thing you could do is add olive oil to the mayo. leave the mayo out on the counter so that when it is put on the hair the mayo is about room temperature. the most important parts to apply the mayo is the top neck and behind the ears. hope it helped. :)|`|kogfFMgmaa	nope|`|uOtZUzNOaa	i heard hair dye gets rid of it..|`|c89J6VFEaa	It would be preety much IMPOSSIBLE!!!|`|oyvRHQmaaa	only two things work.... the commercial products, or shaving your head.......|`|bUHn1Pu0aa	Shave her head|`|XfWoNzXWaa	i don't really think so. if you could, they wouldn't make lice removal products. sorry.|`|hx6sh0q2aa	nope|`|v5vH8PcQaa	Nope there's no way to do that|`|pzeWOm4Raa	this is going to sound realllly gross but mayonnaise. lol put it on her head at night with a cap over it for her to sleep in and wash it out in the morning and just keep doing this until there is no more lice. if i were you i would do it when she isnt doing anything like at home watching tv or something just as much as possible. and when you finally get rid of it clean her hairbrush out and check it every day for eggs or bugs!!|`|2pcPmGPtaa	Try vinegar.

iTTS06IKaa	When hair dye fades, it just either isn't as bright as when you first got it colored (which is normal) or your roots are starting to show. If the dye was fading, perhaps more of your natural (darker?) hair would show more. You can either re-dye it and/or buy special shampoo & conditioner specifically for colored hair (so it fades less).|`|bUHn1Pu0aa	Be careful as what u do next could change the color totally.  My hair went strawberry blonde so i dyed it brown & it went carrot orange!!  Try a toner maybe or get professional advise.|`|hx6sh0q2aa	Buy lightning gel and go out in the sun.  Or if your hair can handle it, just get lightened professionally.|`|MV4OYifKaa	Maybe the hair dye didnt mix well with your natural color. You might have to go get it toned again. And if your talking about your roots growing in, its just an illusion, when your hair is dark and you dye it lighter and your roots grow out, the hair dye makes it look darker than it really is.|`|XfWoNzXWaa	mostly, as you get older, your hair gets darker. so when you lightened your hair, it probably just took some of the natural color with it if that makes sense 2 u. the same thing happened to me. now i gotta pay 2 go every 2 months to get a touch up.|`|BCKEzqRlaa	Well, the cause of this is the sun. Strawberry Blondes turn brown a little bit faster than other blondes. The sunnier it is, the faster your hair will brown. I suggest to get it re-done and wear headcoverings like bandanas, headbands, hats, etc. if you want to keep it from getting brown. Stay out of the sun as much as possible if you want to keep the blonde.|`|7YIQT9g8aa	Umm, how many days in a week do you take a shower? It's probably why its turning into a different color. That's what i've heard.
Nwm1JZNXaa	Yes and it is really good for sensitive skin!  It won't irritate your face.|`|EW1yumzNaa	Yes it works really well!|`|FcYtLNNIaa	Yeah, for when you're little.

AA10199093	a. pale Irish girls are hot  b. you are going to burn yourself  c. tanning is not worth the risk of skin cancer regardless of your ability or inability to tan d. see "a"|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Use a ton of sunscreen and limit your exposure to only 15 minutes the first day -seriously, or you can end up in misery for the rest of your break. Stay in the shade the rest of the day. Then you can up the time each day in 1/2 hour increments and see how you do with that. Use the sunscreen every hour or after swimming, it wears off. Bring coverups and a hat. You may be okay and tan but you don't want to ruin your vacation in agony either.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	you are going to burn burn burn!!!    just because you are somewhere with a lot of tan peopel will not change your skin type...    my suggestion...SPF 110...if they make it that high...    if you want to try to get tan...your best bet is to (i know its bad for you but liek i said...best bet) try a tanning bed.  you go in for a few minuutes and get a slow slow slow tan...it mays a base...but at least you wont burn as badly in the dominican.  if you are against that maybe a self tanner or a spray tan will prevent you from getting ultral red and burnt when you go down there...    have fun!|`|d0f8fa109b7a7196f354bef38eee38d5aa	just cuz ur very pale dosnt mean u cant be good looking.seen many light skin girls that are sexy. been to the dominican republic.the closer u get to the equator.the easier it is to get a nice dark tan.however if ur lilly white like u said.just get a tanning lotion,get drunk,pass out under the sun on a comfortable beach chair or have a baby with a black or hispanic and atleast your children wont have such fair skin.

[i prefer charlotte russe]    abercrombie pants are pretty small & short too.|`|cSJ2xLJDaa	I know how you feel! Places like Gap, Old Navy, Delias, etc. have XS sizes but still run a little big. Clothes at cheaper places without name brands fit just right. (stores like rave, agaci, forever 21). Not the best quality. Bebe has some cute clothes. My favorite store of all time is Lip Service clothing which you have to purchase online. I mean the style is a little out there (like me ) but if you dress normal they have a huge selection of jeans that anyone can wear. Their sizes run really small! Fits just right. I wore them when i was your age but I was a size 0 and 95 pounds and 5". Now that i think about it, I was extremely small for my age and your smaller! Put some weight on girl! If you cant gain weight you might have a thyroid problem and need to see a doctor. Best of luck!|`|177899897ae0634b315f1b26968a1388aa	I would try limited too or gap kids if you like the preppy style.
0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	Yes i have tried it :]  it works very good and makes you look flawless and naturally beautiful, and not make you look fake like some makeups do. i totally recomend it and give it a 5 out of 5 star.    you should try it!    -abby|`|GXM74MGPaa	Yes, its really cakey|`|fxgMwo7iaa	I use MAC studio fix. its a powder foundation and its amazing. I know this doesnt exactly answer your question, bit i think you should try it.|`|3FxlUxlxaa	Haven't tried Scupt, but Studio Fix is amazing!|`|kWIqDkB9aa	No i havent, but if you want GOOD foundation, get organic, non comodogenic stuff like Jane Iredale is what I use.

It's wonderful and doesn't dry out your skin like a lot of powder ones do.  That would be my recommendation :)
OKNSN6W2aa	Use Head and Shoulders shampoo and conditioner.  Rub honey into your scalp and leave for five minutes, before it crystalizes, then wash it out.  Take gold listerine mouthwash and pour it onto your scalp. (I know it sounds weird, but the flakes disappear instantly)  Or put a few drops of lemon juice on your scalp and rub in, then wash out.  Good luck!|`|pS9yoeLuaa	Babies get "cradle cap" which, to me, is dandruff with a cuter name.  Baby oil makes it go away...

My cousin is on pill medication and he applies special cream to his face so he does not get acne.  Popping and touching your face will make things worse and more irritated.  Right now, sucks, but just let it be until you can see the dermatologist.  Most insurances also cover these medicines it seems, too.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Try Mederma for scars, it works very well. Get yourself some acne meds too - try one with salicylic acid to keep your pores clean, like Stridex pads, and one with benzoyl peroxide to clear your skin and heal it fast - just check the labels.|`|78xcSNrKaa	Don't pop your zits, pizza face.    Seriously, just wash your face it isn't that complicated.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	they iwll fade with time as long as they are not craters...otherwise the only way to help those is to get collagen injections...    learn fron your mistakes and dont pick anymore...    you could try mederma but the effects of that are minimal    and for new scabs that are healing use neosporin now...it will reduce scarring...    lastly...for those pimples you have now...get a spot treatment that will dry them out...or put a dab of toothpaste on it before bed|`|k5exOZV9aa	make up|`|ABOvm38Caa	You need to use something with salicylic acid.

DpStw8RBaa	It sounds like you have a really good personal reason for getting the tattoo and that's awesome. I like the placement on the back of the neck; it's sexy and it can be covered up with long hair or a collared shirt if needed. I say go for it.|`|8THz1sp9aa	I like this on the back of the neck. Really the only location I can think of that will look good on a female. I hope you do your research and look at portfolios carefully, until you find the perfect artist for this piece. good luck!|`|nLF3cmqOaa	ooh thatll look awesome!! and its original too (even if u are copying it from someone else, atleast its not chinese characters or stars like everyone else has)    just make sure u get a good artist who can draw a lion haha    GOOD LUCK!!|`|dvAolNmNaa	I really like the placement of the picture you showed or try it a little lower.  http://z.about.com/d/tattoo/1/0/p/p/0815...

They mean nothing at all, now.|`|WGzJUSefaa	If you love fashion, you should check out this site!

YGfdyCofaa	First of all, it's really important to have a good flat iron. I really like the CHI brand. The smaller it is, the easier it is to get close to your scalp without burning yourself. You can't straighten as much at one time, but it's a tradeoff. They are kind of expensive, but well worth it in my opinion. One of the most important things to do when you know you are going to be straightening your hair is to blow dry it as straight as possible as soon as you wash it. Don't let it dry at all on it's own - this is when the curls form. Concentrate on the roots when you are blow drying it. If you blow dry them straight right away, the curls won't have the opportunity to form.    Also, make sure your hair is 100% dry before you use the flat iron on it. The moisture in it will stop it from straightening properly. Get yourself a few clips and just clip all of your hair on top of your head except for a small section. Start straightening there and just take a section at a time out of the clip until it's all done. Use a spray gel or light, flexible hairspray on it once you're done. Good luck!|`|154dzJ1Faa	If you have straightened your hair, it will stay that way.  The only reason it curls for you is that it is not dry.  There is moisture getting into the hair, or more likely, was never removed.  You straightened your hair while it was still a bit damp inside, and it will always make the curl come back.    Have you seen the Dominican wrap?  You need to try that sometime.  It does take a long time to do, but I think it does look very nice.  You might be quite happy with it.  The process has been described here before.|`|fxgMwo7iaa	CHI straightener.|`|67PSW5Rlaa	put relaxer in and straighten and then spray|`|2g4597fnaa	my hair is exactly the same! what i do is deep condition my hair and braid it in small braids to let it dry. then i run zero frizz through it. after that i use my flat iron (CHI) to straighten it. i brush body lotion in it to make sure that it's moisturized and silky and completely straight. hope this helps :)
qfSKgxDsaa	I like mary kay's spot cream or this cream that's orange and is like the terminator or something...good luck    p.s. using clinique BAR soap is the ONLY thing that cleared me up; even tried proactive!|`|z5dpWOidaa	Cut off your head|`|1uk2cThkaa	BAsically you need to get an angle grinder and buzz down your skin. It's called exfoliation. Throw some methylated spirits on there so that you don't get chaffing.|`|zPb24HrQaa	Start a good regimen of hygiene. Wash your face,neck or back with a salicylic acid wash, use a toner after that and finish with something that you can leave on your face. I have tried every product available, prescriptions (even had injections and oral antibiotics for 6 months), tried pro active, Mary K, Neutrogena, Acne Free, Biore, Clean & Clear, purpose, you name it I've used it. I found something new at Rite Aid, it's Vita C2 Clear, it was $15 for three items. They seem to be working, healing and repairing. Good luck to you.
VhmBMJKxaa	well, you could go with the direct approach and try some blue and blue/gray eye makeup. Brown and reddish tones also bring out the color in blue eyes.    Also, don't limit yourself to just one color per application. The rule of thumb is use a medium shade for the entire lid, and under the eye, if desired. Use a darker shade for around the corners of the eyes, and the lightest shade for the browbone. It is also a good idea to add some sort of wet eye makeup or shimmer to help the powder stay on longer. Finish by blending with your fingers or a blending brush.    And if you're feeling on the wild side, why not try two different colors that go good together? Such as an apple green base with a bright blue at the corners.    Have fun and hope I helped. :)|`|iYlaooaPaa	i would go with either a purple/lilac or brown. brown is always good.  i have pale skin and blue eyes too. it really makes your eyes pop. try it out. also any golds/bronze would work too.|`|IaGNXfUOaa	Coming from another pale redhead with blue eyes, I'd stick to using Bronzes/Gold's, PurpleMauve's's and other warm colors. They work well as long as they are not applied heavily. Try to stay away from pale, bleached colors other than for a highlight right below the eyebrow.|`|L5cReesbaa	Brown contrasts with the blue and makes the eyes stand out. Try different shades or brow - tan, chocolate, beige, etc.|`|gPJf3UTaaa	to enhance eye color, use the opposite color on the color wheel. so pinks, oranges, and browns are the opposite of blue or gray. those would look really good!|`|GXM74MGPaa	brown eye make up|`|oUV9ZUsEaa	a smoky, dark hazel would look great. only put on a little bit of mascara, and a little under-eye black eyeliner.|`|tB14zSSnaa	do smokey eyes.  they look nice with grey or blue eyes|`|PkauhFMwaa	A smokey eye, using a dark grey, light grey, and a sea blue for colour!|`|C5eKUi2Xaa	These make your eye colors look so pretty and stand out!

oDzOYMjDaa	I think if you're gonna put girly hearts on it, you might want to consider putting it in a place where you can hide it. Depending on the social situation, what job you get, who you're meeting, etc. you may not want it to be so visible...|`|0NQL7yRPaa	no|`|YJi8CZnNaa	Sounds quite cute to me, too bad you don't have pictures of your drawing.|`|rYQrwD5Raa	No, bad idea!  I have had a tattoo for 45 years and regretted every day that I got it....it was cool back then but it did not fit me when I grew more mature.|`|Ox4bXbKuaa	I think that is a good idea. If you get a tattoo you should get one that means something to you and I think that one does and it will look cool. BUT do not do the hearts.. You can go to dafont.com and type in XVII in the Custom preview box and they will show you that in different fonts. Thats the best way to find a good one you would like. like the guy said before about regreting his tattoos..well, i had one that said animal liberation because i was a vegetarian for awhile and love animals. then I started eating meat Lame i know,but people kept bugging me asking what it said and if i was a veg. It got annoying!! but i just got it covered up with another tattoo. I have 5 tattoos and had my first one for 5 years. I dont regret any of them,yet but i dont think i ever will...I dont think you will regret this one since it is about your family.
tfqpb5XQaa	Yeah, from yeah 4 till half way through yeah 7...i was pretty fat, and you know, i just wasn't what you'd call pretty, pretty much the opposite lol. I got constantly teased for how i looked/weighed and only had a few friends, didn't really go out with friends cause i felt bad about myself most of the time..Then half way through year 7 i lost a heap of weight and started wearing make up and doing my hair and pretty much taking care of how i look,and things seemed to get better :)|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Yea, I used to be skinny, but now I'm hot as 'ell!   ((((burp))))|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	Yes. I love myself now.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	I was a chubby child.  Now I'm underweight.  Eh. Depends on your definition of ugly in my case.|`|8iQFdkIhaa	well i used to have buck teeth and my nose totally did not fit my face at all, and my hair was really ugly.    but i got braces (and got them off now), grew into my nose, and got a wayy better hairstyle!|`|Klb66zADaa	No, I'm still ugly.|`|mw56qYwYaa	Yes!! I used to be not-so-cute. I never was teased though, i'm sorry to hear that :(    I have ugly duckling syndrome now.

(thank god! haha :) )|`|29d245c6068a80708e3b9f681a4cb2d0aa	I have never been good looking.|`|7fallgzXaa	I'm the opposite. All the girls used to like me in middle school. I was real athletic and good looking. then i got real sick for about three years and now im not the least bit attractive to girls- skinny, pale, scars and stretch marks... it sucks. just enjoy what you got|`|91TxX375aa	Yeah, everyone thinks they're ugly at one point or another.  I thought my life was horrible at one point until my friends told me what they would think of me if I died.  It made me feel really special that they loved me for everything I do and who I decide to be.  I never give in to peer pressure and am hoping for my figure to fill out in the next year or so.  Never think badly about yourself.|`|f9No4eRBaa	Girls in particular become more beautiful as they get out of their teens. They are like the ugly duckling.

You know what??   . . .you are going to get more beautiful !
xTpvnWRuaa	Well you can always research how to do it, I'm sure someone knows how, but I still really wouldn't do it by yourself just because you NEVER know.|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	not a good idea.|`|Xef2mbGcaa	Dont do it !  This stupid girl in my class did that and she fked it up.  Now she has a PERMANENT ugly hole on her face.  And its big, I know its permanent because she went to a tattoo place for advice and they told her.    At least get a professional.|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Don't do it yourself, go to a professional.  DIY piercings are bad ideas in general but especially one on your face, so close to your mouth.|`|BCKEzqRlaa	You should NEVER do a piercing by yourself, as it could leave a permanent mark if you do it wrong. You should always get piercings done professionaly, no matter where it is. My friend pierced her own lip, and it looks very swollen in that spot now because she messed up. She wasn't able to fit an actual lip ring in there, now she has a small hole in her lip that is slowly closing up. Its healed now, but theres a bruise there and its swollen.
RDL3Bvksaa	Soft Curls (For Short Hair)    A soft, curly style is a great way to wear your hair down if you have naturally straight tresses. First, set your hair in hot rollers to form the curls. While youre waiting for the rollers to heat, do your make-up to maximize your getting-ready time. Once the rollers have cooled, unroll your hair and brush it out. Flatten the front and hold it in place with some long bobby pins or hairclips. Tease the ends and the back up with a teasing comb and some hairspray. Dont worry about every strand of hair being perfect; the slightly disheveled look is sexy and stylish. Once youve finished teasing the ends, remove the clips at the front and finish the style with a flower or some rhinestone clips placed randomly throughout your hair.    HOPE I  HELPED !    & you're really pretty :D|`|d5t5XgfVaa	fist curl it than make it in ike a lose bun.. with curls on the front.  cutie|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	Why don't you try curling it?|`|KfkmB4X2aa	afro afro afro afro afro afro afro afro afro afro afro afro afro afro afro afro afro|`|L5cReesbaa	Ignore the color, and consider the style of this photo.  http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_NO2UOMMYKZ0/SK...

jlMBxhVxaa	I scrunch my hair ALL the time. My hair has a little bit of natural curl to it, but i have a ton of friends that still do it who don't. It really doesn't matter what gel you use, as long at it will hold you hair in place. Right when you get out of the shower, make sure your hair is still completely wet. Comb and Part it the way you want, and then run the gel through your hair. After that divide your hair into two parts, and use your fingers to spiral it just by twist i around. After you have got it into two spirally curls, scrunch the top part. Touch it up with a little hairspray and you should be done. The finished product to be scrunched hair with a little curl at a bottom.     Hope it works =)|`|p3GZERIsaa	It should work give it a go?     http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=S0znTQt_5r...|`|NTEuxMVmaa	I spray super hold styling gel on my hair when it's wet.Than i squeeze sections of it that i want scrunched.Than let it air dry.

adyNCp6eaa	What about wearing like tight, but not too tight jeans, with a layered top, like a elbow-sleeve striped shirt with a opened button up front, and a white tank top underneath.

nz8q1tDfaa	Do not stress.  You are right it the shampoo that is giving you those oh so wonderful flakes but it's not dandruff.  Dandruff is a disorder that requires a medicated shampoo.  More often then not Pantene will leave a heavy residue on your hair and scalp causing your hair to feel limp look dull and even greasy, (Happening right around two-three weeks after using). What is worst is if it does this to your hair then think of how it's effecting your scalp.  When your scalp has a build up on it,  it becomes very irritated and itchy,  scratching it loosen up some of the build up and then you start seeing the snow fall.    There are a number of reasons why I never recommend this product or any other "store bought" products, this is just one reason though.    I suggest going to your stylist and have them do a CLARIFYING treatment on your head and then a deep conditioning.  Besure to ask her opinion on what type of shampoos and conditioners you should be using for your hair type specifically.  Ex: moisture, if you are curly, strenghtening if you are fine textured, etc..   You'll notice that the itching and flakes will disappear like magic!!|`|PTwgXnauaa	Normally the 2 in 1 Shampoos i.e., shampoo+conditioner can cause dandruff, always use a separate contioner and never apply it on your scalp, just hair length. There is a home remedy for dandruff: mix 3-4- table spoons of sugar free yoghurt (preferably homemade) with about 1-2 table spoons mustard oil and 1 teaspoon lemon juice..Apply this mixture to your scalp, leave for half an hour and then wash normally with a conditioner free shampoo. Do this twice a week..You will see a difference after even the first application.|`|3F8PgjIlaa	Buy dandruff shampoo or ask your hair stylist about it maybe they'll give you the right stuff for it|`|JA7RQBBDaa	idnt know about baking soda that sounds funny never heard of it  but selson blue for dandruff works just go to walmart and get the blue bottle..|`|jIyvb2OOaa	pantene is bad for your hair it coats it in wax (like a candle) thats what makes it look shiny. maybe thats what caused the dandruff. i really have no idea though|`|AA12165129	omygosh pantene did that to my hair too!  i started buying this shampoo from sally's and it went away.  just switch shampoo  :)|`|AA10290522	Try the cheapest shampoo you can find like a hotel shampoo or suave. Those chemicals will wash off the wax that is in pantene.

DuSFKygEaa	Don't confuse confidence with arrogance.  They are totally different.    Arrogant people are typically obnoxious.  Confident people are not.  Some times confident people are accused of being stuck-up.  That too, is wrong.    A few years ago my ex-wife was yelling and screaming at me while her husband stood next to her trying to look tough.  She threw out all kinds of threats of legal action and having him kick my butt.  I stood my ground because I was confident in myself.  I knew what the law was and I knew she was wrong.  I also knew I could kill her husband because I'm a Brown-belt and she has already mentioned all of his health issues.  Bad knees, really messed up neck, ruptured disk in the lower back among other things.  He had a reputation of being the baddest guy in the county.  Everyone was afraid of this guy.  I knew that I could cream him in just a few seconds.  She blew a head gasket at my confidence and blasted me for being arrogant.  I'll leave out the cuss words but I was apparently a cocky arrogant Bast*rd.  I told both of them that it's not arrogance, I'm confident in my abilities and I know the law.  Guess what.  Nothing happened.  I won I guess.    About a year later she apologized for the incident.  I told her that I would have crippled the guy.  Maybe killed him.    Confidence is sexy and it's attractive.  Arrogance is not.|`|MCN7gdI8aa	no, i think youre mixing two different concepts together, being SEXY requires confidence, being beautiful doesnt, beauty is in the eye of the beholder or better yet in your genes, someone people are beautiful even if theyre shy or have no self esteem, they might not be attractive or sexy, but they are beautiful, good looking.|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	When answering as to self confidence, and its' t relation to beauty...such beauty must firstly be a seed which is rooted and grows from the internal in you. Such beauty is NOT shallow not is it corroded by the passage of time. Such beauty is eternal, inviolate, if you maintain it, and are TRUE to it, will glow from you even outwardly. That Beauty will offer you self  confidence, because self confidence is neither arrogant nor self depreciating.  It is a difficult balance to maintain, but if your integrity is placed whole heartedly upon it, it will prove, no matter what you may go through, WHO you are for the whole of your life! G.|`|E70A7aqcaa	Now, in your first three "follow-up" sentences after your initial question, you appear to be stating assuredly, or confidently, if you please, the way you are, and why, without excuses or apologies. And you continue that in the first sentence of your fourth "paragraph", but then, in the second sentence of that 4th "paragraph", you suddenly tell us how you are too insecure to be confident, but you tell us in a "matter-of-fact" way.  No excuses.  And the last statement of that 4th "paragraph", you again state your conclusion of how you are based on what you've already said in the first three statements.  And your entire 5th paragraph is statements, with question marks at the end, not convincing me that you're asking a question, but that you are just fulfilling a "requirement" maybe, of Yahoo Answers, to at least look like you're asking a question.  It's not until your third statement in your replies to your answers that you actually appear to be asking a question, and then again only in your 5th, or last reply to an answerer.  So, are you asking a question, or stating an opinion?  Sounds like you're pretty confident to me.  God Bless you.|`|bPZlpe0taa	I think confidence is just being happy with who you and what you look like,that's what makes confidence beautiful,it's someone that doesn't constantly criticize the way they look and is happy in their own skin.|`|XwlEqiNNaa	beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. but for my opionion beauty true comes from comfidence does not make being a slut approprate.confidence is not wearing trashy clothes its taking pride in yourself.

You can find it at sephora i think|`|KbmP0xWhaa	lore'al or nopolien perdis works concealer works for me and the bet part is you only need it on the spots where you get breakouts and it covers it completly. plus it is a non oil based foundation so it cant give you more break-outs.      hope i helped - goodluck:]|`|YJPRiQQzaa	I like Bare Minerals.

gW8VFRmjaa	why are you people judging her decisions? maybe it has special significance to her. and most likely she's done exstensive research to ensure they were correct.    anyways, maybe you could add just like little designs around it (just curvy lines etc.) or maybe you could have vines with small flowers or roses or something, or you could have a bunch of stars or hearts or some other symbol ranging in size around them, maybe you could add a smoke effect around them? idk those are just some things off the top of my head. maybe you could just go to your shop and ask the artist for some ideas, they could probably even draw up some stuff for you.|`|MgiK02Zbaa	ha you probably dont even know what they say.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	Honestly chinese characters are played out..|`|bM3nTH5Faa	what do the characters mean..?

Zx8dDBY8aa	well, that's the thing with nice hairstyles, it does cost a lot to maintain it. I have long thick hair and I haven't gotten a haircut in a year. I'm going to get one tomorrow with cut and highlight and it's going to cost 150 dollars canadian. On top of that, I have to buy a nice straightening iron to maintain it cause the revlon I have burns my hair. I think  good way to save money is if you don't change the color of your hair and don't have any bangs. You could also try going to a cheaper place, the quality may not be really bad.

I stopped shopping at Limited Too in 6th grade and was one of the last my age to still wear clothes from there.  Also, the shape of the dress and the size are designed for a child's body, not a teenager.  If it fits her now, it wont in a year.  I'd try Delia's, because it's juniors sizing but a broader age group more appropriate for a 14 year old.|`|0NdBx2keaa	it's cute, now let's see a picture of you in it. grrrrrr

MFYiwCVYaa	Well if your hair is brown get a honey color.  if your a red get a honey  if your a blonde get a lighter blonde     Hope that helped! :) Have fun|`|aDwfTXyDaa	i would agree with highlights. like  a golden copper tone color. that would  be pretty. :)|`|Px00R2wnaa	highlights. you'll need way more money than $50 more like $200|`|ADWIWx5Baa	Get highlights  But please do not get blonde ones..since your hair is soo dark it would just look really bad and fake. Get auburn or red highlights. Normally a haircut is about $15-$20 but if you get it down at a salon it would probably be more than $40, I suggest getting it down at a salon because they do a much better job.    Also..you are very pretty =)|`|Zx8dDBY8aa	I think a trim is fine. A haircut can range from 25 to 40 dollars depending where you go.|`|l5wziiicaa	Why would you do that to your hair!  Your hair is so pretty the way that it is!|`|ygm5zqS6aa	well maybe blonde strikes and you should get layers! and straighten it!!  if you hair is longer than your shoulders then it costs up to $65 and if your hair is shorter then your shoulders then its under $65....|`|OxDr0zazaa	get highlights.  and it shouldnt be more than 45.  it depends on the length half of the time|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	Get some highlights but not blond. The picture makes it kind of hard to see but I think blond will look really fake with your skin tone. Try some light caramel or dark honey colours.|`|JbMmsqzIaa	definatly highlights  they look more natural and  in my opinion better lookin  : )

Also Hello Kitty she likes anything hellokitty..|`|pgdXk9mjaa	My bf is a Captain America fan as well.  He says he would definitely not wear it.|`|VLRkJOOuaa	Not really.

I think that's mostly because of how lighting moves. Movement can appear more flattering, especially if you're comparing to a picture that may have caught you at an awkward moment. Also the same with pictures taken with flash, because it alters the coloring and the natural lighting that may be more flattering.    I couldn't tell you which is the true you. I'd say that technically a camera may be more accurate in capturing your general image, because some mirrors don't give you a perfect reflection. However, going beyond the visual, the mirror can give you more of who you really are instead of just what you look like.|`|eX8i4vwRaa	i feel the same way! trust the mirror.. not technology lmao|`|h9y9xN4Naa	exactly the same here.  :)|`|7ZuSLoO9aa	to me i think is the mirror because it tells u your real look.

GSZGmH14aa	haha.. yes. I worked at VS and the guys always were fun. The difference is the texture and the amount of sparkle and shine the give off.    Umm. sparkling is more glittery than luminous.. Luminous would be a softer type of color that would catch the light at just the right angles and a cream shadow is not powder. so its thicker and you cant apply it with a normal eye shadow brush..  A few of there perfumes arent to bad.. the lip glosses you have to be careful because some of the colors come out really deep or really bright. umm. test them on the back of your hand and decide which on she would look best in.      Hooe this helps.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Try sneaking a peak into her make-up drawer, so that you don't have to guess what she likes.  Or ask her mother or sister.|`|nMgsLNAAaa	a woman who loves you when you DON'T give her gifts is a keeper|`|xl8kjeAkaa	sparkling shadow sparkles, luminous shadow is bright, and cream shadow is creamy:)|`|C5eKUi2Xaa	If you're talking about the eyeshadows that come in a little container and there is a long silver handle coming out of it, those are pretty good. There isa sponge tip applicator on the bottom of the silver handle. It's very easy to apply and the colors are really pretty. Andd I think if you buy two, you get a discount.     The cream shadows are eyeshadows that you squeeze out of a tube. They are... creamy. Haha. I don't know how else to explain them. Personally, I prefer the other ones. The powder ones. Creams tend to crease more. (When your eyeshadow moves around and gets a dark line where it all collects and around that, it gets rubbed off) Incase you don't know what I mean haha.    I have never used their lipglosses but I bet they're good. Make sure you get her a light one if she wears light lipgloss, and a dark one if she wears dark.     As far as the difference between sparkling and luminous, I'm not quite sure. But I'm almost positive that the "sparkling" one will have more shimmer and sparkle to it than the "luminous" one.    If she tends to wear sparkly eyeshadow, you should get the "sparkly" one. If she wears ones without that much sparkle, get the "luminous" one.    If you have any other questions, you should just ask a worker when you get there! They will help you select just what you need.    Hope this helps :) Goodluck with this and hope your girlfriend likes it! :)|`|ba450548ec13ce7a3711c94421c92d4aaa	First off, great idea with the gift, what girl would want that? Sparkling would sparkle, or have a pearly look to it, Luminous is probably matte, meaning it doesn't shine or look pearly, it's just the color. Cream is a different make up type, it's not a powder shadow, but like a mouse. For lip gloss you can't go wrong with clear, which is just shiny, no color, and the kind girls wear the most. Avoid bright red and hot pinks, as those are the ones most girls don't like, or any weird purplish and brown hues. Just a light red or pink, like a hint of color is good. Watch what she wears and ask her mom or roommate or whoever for some tips.

JvZY0ZS4aa	I'm ticklish everywhere. When I was young, someone just had to pretend to tickle me and I'd be jumping around. This reaction of course proved hilarious for my family who often mercilessly tickled me till I was rolling on the ground (sides of tummy or knees where the biggest target zones). I learned that kicking and biting were effective means to stop the torture, which my aunt discovered in a painful way ;o)     Then there was the really embarrassing time as a teen when I was playing pool at a bar with my sister and brother-in-law. He snuck behind me and targeted that very ticklish zone just inside your hip bone. My body involuntarily dropped to the floor - was like a power down button! Not cool when you're flirting with the guy at the next table!    Pregnancy has been my best escape from the torture. What is it about being ticklish that just compels EVERYONE to see you writhing on the floor laughing uncontrollably?|`|GfCsOZOLaa	I cant tell you its personal

My hair never seems to get greasy, even after like after 4 days.    So don't wash your hair everyday, as it ruins it and strips out the oils, making it hard to style and comb.  If you wash your hair everyday, your hair is more likely to get greasier and will become greasy really quick..    You need to have a routine for your hair, just like other things, like going to bed, eating breakfast and stuff.   Like for me, I wash my hair on Sunday's, Wednesday's and Friday's and around 9pm-10pm ish.   Your hair will get used to the routine very quickly.|`|n3akm5u6aa	once a week once you not using products if ur every four days .|`|wkuCydzRaa	once maybe twice a week. Otherwise it will get greasy quicker.|`|BqMoGMZbaa	i wash it every 2 days|`|TmUqdoqKaa	i wash my hair every other day too, but i wash my fringe every morning because when i sleep my fringe sticks up and wont go back in the morning. =D|`|cf4b2c89769e2fa8220e3e5f4b43c112aa	Well I think you are really only every other day, but I have wavy hair that gets oily very quickly and I wash my hair every night since it's very oily.|`|eV50c9vnaa	once a week is fine, according to the short girl sat on my bed. she says it really depends on what your hair is like, if it gets greasy or dirty then you may have to wash more often. Try keeping your pillow case clean and changing it regularly to avoid getting it overly dirty during the night.  Personally, i wash mine daily, but im a guy and i use wax in my hair, so its necessary.|`|nasm1bJWaa	I Wash Mine Everyday.   Its A Pain But It Depends On Your Hair Type.  You Know, If It Get Greasy Quickly Or Not.  If Your Hair Get Greasy After A Full Day And You Washed It In The Morning You Are Either Using Too Many Products In Your Hair Or You Have Abnormally Greasy Hair.  For Most People I Would Say Every Other Day To Keep It Clean And Not Greasy x|`|IVlsDTEqaa	i have the same hair as yours, like curly/wavy and i wash it once a week. you should too because our hair type needs moisture and washing it every other day/everyday/2-3 times a week strips it of its natural oils so then it becomes horribly frizzy and dry.  before i wash mine i put like all these oils into it to condition it; mainly olive oil and leave it on for about 30 minutes, then go in and wash it, it should feel really really soft. then just put in conditioner for a few minutes and ta-da! only use shampoo every other wash because as i said before, shampoo is very drying.  hope i helped :)|`|eharP3rkaa	are u mad wash it every day!!!!!!! .|`|m3rt9x8Caa	I have wavey naturally brown hair too, and i wash mine ever other day.|`|QASqKvSNaa	I wash my hair every other day and that works perfectly for me!    Wash it too often and you lose the natural oils in your hair that make it shiny and manageable, but if you don't wash it enough, then you get greasy lank locks.    It all depends on the condition and type of your hair.     I would recommend washing your hair every other day with a mild shampoo, followed by a conditioner for your hair type.|`|SK5FGKCCaa	Wash it every other day, but only with a small amount of shampoo.   For your type of hair, you need to basically wash it with conditioner.  This is because shampoo takes the moisture out of your hair, and as wavy hair lacks moisture, you need to add extra.   Use a conditioner made for dry, damaged hair. Wash with shampoo, every now and then though so it's not dirty.|`|m4wFJPAOaa	Twice a month the 1st day and last day. Gee what a question|`|HjiqMDI6aa	I'd say every 2 days or every other day. It depends on your hair conditions and where you live and what sort of work you do. Because if you're outside sweating it out then everyday would be the best option but I'd suggest after every 2 days.|`|vJRMmgd6aa	every other day|`|ijeninncaa	I wash mine every other day so it doesn't get dry but it has no time to get greasy either :)   x
KPsWriOOaa	o_O I would never buy 90$ makeup. It's probably expensive because it's limited edition and because they have to pay Sanrio part of the profit.|`|Xef2mbGcaa	Read this!  Its a makeup review site, you can find basically any product in the world and see what multiple people think of it.  I searched this and you should take a look.  If it askes you to sign up, just do it.It only takes a sec.  I always go here before going out and buying any type of makeup [:  http://makeupalley.com/product/showrevie...|`|S8yHCzesaa	Hi, its because the $90 dollar one is their Kitty Kouture collection where the compacts have swarovski crystals on them. Its the "high-end" part of the collection.    MACs hello kitty line is in 2 parts, Hello kitty Color collection and the kitty kouture.    the Hello Kitty Color collection comes out feb 12 and those prices are pretty much the same with the permanent line. not as expensivee    hope this helps :D
o6qWRBlTaa	Capitalism at its finest.    MAC is owned by Este Lauder, the same company that has a large shelf of cosmetic products in stores like Wal-Mart. Rest assured the large chunk of cash you spend at MAC stores goes to pay their pricey mall monthly rent.    http://www.stylelist.com/blog/2008/10/05...    You gotta love it, Estee Lauder makes a big announcement that their MAC line is coming out with some Hello Kitty endorsed makeup product, and at the same time they're launching low ball items at Wal-Mart, Kohl's, and Target. It's like when Donald Trump had his "apprentice" tv show and was filing for bankruptcy at the same time.    And the MAC Hello Kitty makeup comes with packaging that has Swarovski crystals, while the low end Estee Lauder products at Wal-Mart come in clear bottles.|`|Br3k7Hagaa	Apparently it has 'rare' crystals|`|AXFrh871aa	That will be the 2nd part of the hello kitty collection, Kitty Kouture. It will launch March 5th. The packaging has Swarovski crystals...    Here's a better description:    Sheer Mystery Powder (LE) - $90.00USD  These will be available in three shades and are packaged in a silver powder compact with Hello Kitty outlined in white Swarovski crystals with a pink crystal bow on a black background. These come with a refill powder.      Light Medium Pale ivory   Medium Plus Tan beige   Dark Secret Deep caramel

vL7gkN7uaa	For your first time i recommend you do it professionally by a salon that was recommended to you. You don't want to take a chance by doing it your self.|`|rQE5I9lJaa	okay i know it may cost more but definatly go to a pro hair salon to do it and after its done ask them to do the deep conditioner so ur hair doesnt look dry and bad! : )|`|CtYc6l7Oaa	i just recently got my hair dyed for the first time, i went to a salon to get my done  it can cost quite abit but its worth it     i advise you not to do it yourself if it is the first time your getting it done|`|IIztioS3aa	Best thing you can do is go to a salon. It can be a little pricey, but the color always keeps better, and it won't irritate your scalp as much. Plus they can help you pick a color that will look great on you.    if you don't want to go that route, you can pick up a box of hair dye at most stores, drug stores, grocery stores, a target or walmart kind of place. Those colors are decent, but they tend to fade pretty quickly.     If your a first timer, i'd recommend a semi-permanent. Something that will wash out in a dozen or so washings. That way if you don't like it, its not there forever.  The other way to go would be do high-lights instead. This way its a touch of color, something to change it up but again, its not really drastic in case you don't like it.    I like feria the best for drug store brands. It has a lot of longevity. I have quit using boxed dyes and go to Sally's to get my coloring products. http://www.sallybeauty.com/ you can mix a color yourself, but as a first timer i recommend getting something that is premixed.    VERY IMPORTANT! NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF RED! Red is a very powerful and vibrant color. a little of it goes a VERY long way!    So you want to stay within 2 shades of your natural color for the easiest time dying your hair. If your doing it yourself, i really think you should have a friend help you apply the color so that it goes on evenly and isn't blotchy.     You will start at the roots. I like to get my hair line and my part first. Also, if you wear your hair back a lot make sure you get the nape of your neck really well. Most directions tell you to section the hair off into 4 sectors and do it that way, but i never do. They also tell you to start at the base of you skull because that color will be on for slightly longer than the rest of it, and may be a little darker. It will look more natural like that because your hair is usually darker on the underside anyway because it doesn't get as much sun so there are less high lights.    most color is supposed to sit for 25 to 30 minutes. If you are covering up a lot of grey then it can go for as long as 45 minutes.    BE SURE TO USE A DEEP CONDITIONER AFTER WARDS! hair dye will dry out your hair and scalp. I really like Aussie deep conditioner. It comes in a few different types.     best of luck with your coloring adventure!
ealVW30gaa	Yes, it sounds nice.|`|oPn8itQiaa	I don't know the exact colors of your skirt and shoes, but I put an outfit together with a cream skirt, brown shoes, purple tights and a purple cami under a cream long sleeve top.  I think it looks super cute and got several compliments.    But your combination sounds nice too!    IM or email if you'd like to see a picture!|`|FY7dyuGbaa	yes, if you are going to church.|`|tVVLtMHGaa	Yeah as long as you balance them with a dark brown sweater.|`|lmOGqkMsaa	It's more than ok...its fashion!

xpQnXaxdaa	Well your probley allergic to that type of lotion. I know that im allergic to a lot of lotion makeup and stuff my skin is really sensetive and im guess yours is too. I would actally ask your doctor or someone who knows about allergic reactions and sensetive sakin and ask them what type of lotion you should use or keep trying diffrent ones untill you dont get itchy and red bumps. But I would try and ask someone who knows about this stuff first. But There is a lotion thats called Aveeno active naturals and this is all the stuff it says on the front:Daily moisturizing lotion, clinically proven to relieve dry skin,moisturizes for 24 hours, fragrance fre, with natural colloidal oatmeal. Anyways I use this lotion and I dont get bumps,rashes or read when I wear it. So if you dont want to go and ask your doctor maybe by this stuff and try it first and then if that doesnt work then you might want to go ask your doctor|`|mbh6XBhSaa	use a gentle lotion and wash it often with cold water|`|Oextrh4iaa	Maybe your allergic to the lotion. Also make sure you wash off the lotion at the end of each day, in order to prevent irritation.|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	You are allergic to a common ingredient look at the bottles you have had a reaction to and see what is common. Personally I don't use lotions I use straight vaseline or a silicone hair treatment like "Sunglitz" it softens hair and smooths skin. Hope this helps!|`|zoJmDBpUaa	Try another brand. Try Nivea.|`|940fbd1f3460247a3967883e86cdaa2eaa	The thing with lotion is you need to wash it off at the end of the day.  Scrub your hands gently at the end of the night and dont sleep with the lotion.    I use to put lotion on my legs to try to make them smoother and I started breaking out. My mom said its cause I left the lotion on my skin for way to long all week and the natural oils your skin makes gets stuck under and in the lotion.    Hope this helps|`|xAdOhtaoaa	maybe u have a heat rash ?|`|xPx6OUmFaa	oh no! ummmm well you must be allergic to some product in both vaseline and the other lotions you have tried. i would recommend going to a dermatologist and getting some lotion that wont irritate your skin prescribed
iXEgmhMuaa	Schedule a blood test with your physician. Establish whether or not this condition runs in your family. Dark circles are believed to frequently be hereditary.     Identify allergens. Allergies may be the most common cause of skin discoloration under the eyes. If allergies are the root of your problem, you simply need to treat them or remove the allergen (i.e., the thing to which you are allergic). Seasonal allergy problems such as the hay fever can frequently be effectively treated with over-the-counter and prescription medications.      Treat your skin while you sleep. There are overnight facial masques available that may help reduce the appearance of puffiness or discoloration, but you can also make your own. Just before you go to bed, take a washcloth and wet it just a bit with cold water. Then squeeze out any excess water and place it over your eyes as you sleep.      Cucumber TherapyApply cool tea bags, an ice cube wrapped in soft cloth, or cucumber slices to your eyes daily. The tannin in tea bags has been shown to reduce swelling and discoloration, and cucumber slices have long been used to reduce puffiness and refresh the appearance of skin around the eyes. Lie down, preferably in the morning, and leave fresh cucumber slices or cool, damp caffeinated tea bags (you can refrigerate them overnight so theyll be ready) over your eyes for about 10-15 minutes. Keep your eyes closed.   Try to relax the space. You can do this by wetting a cotton swab and then freezing it for a little while. Then you should gently wipe under your eyes in the areas where the circles are occurring. When wiping, close your eyes and try not to flinch.      Avoid rubbing your eyes. Cover the problem up with cosmetics. If all else fails, use a yellow or peach-toned concealer which will camouflage the problem under your eyes. The yellow/peach undertones in the makeup will help cancel out the purple, blue, and brownish colors of your undereye circles. Pink-toned concealers can actually make your circles more noticeable. After applying, set the concealer with a light dusting of translucent powder.|`|y6vOJMORaa	Sounds like your living the fast life...and your body is showing the reactions.    There is a reason they call it "beauty" sleep. If you drink coffee, power-drinks such as Red-Bull, etc...STOP ingesting that garbage immediately...poor nutrition, such as fast-food(not fit for human consumption) is a fast-killer. Drink green tea(not the bottled-sweetned stuff!) for a small boost...shut off that cell-phone, find ways to reduce stress in your life...drugs and cig's also are very detrimental to the body.

Firstly relax girl..you need to tone things down, a hectic life leads to stress which can result in other serious consequences..but back to the bags! First soothe them with some aloe vera or cucumbers if you have the time,.. but if your in a hurry (which you prob are by the sound of things!) some non-oily concealer should do the trick as it will last longer and you should put a layer of transuculent powder over it to really lock in the colour and to help obtain maximum coverage!and remember pet, its prob not as bad as it seems..Im sure your beautiful with or without make up!|`|VdaQ2Vo0aa	I have heard warm tea bags or cucumbers help with the swelling under the eyes.|`|8ab6993234808864c73a8260c98e510aaa	well, first try getting more sleep... see if that clears it up..|`|r1fb8t25aa	undercoat|`|kiJUCYMcaa	i am in the same situation but with me i have dark circles all around my eyes|`|h7mRUC0Uaa	Firstly, getting more sleep would help reduce them, but also lying for just 15 minutes with cucumber on your eyes (when you get the chance) really helps.   You can get some realy great concealers as well so if you can that is a good match to your skin colour that will help a lot.    Hope this is useful.|`|FQLbY6mVaa	I'm 21 and i had the same problem.

adyNCp6eaa	Just wear mascara, eyeliner, and a bit of gloss. Ask a friend how to apply well. Blush and eyeshadow is like dirt to your pores, not good. I dont wear blush or eyeshadow much, and it looks fine. I wear blue mascara and it gives me my own style so i dont look like im copying girls at school, && i dont put on too much either, cuz that just looks wayy too preppy.|`|AtJgXB59aa	mayb you shud jus wear eyeliner and eyeshadow clear your skin and then wear foundation|`|qfUnwHyFaa	you dont have to wear foundation   but if you want to how about wearing a light powder of something instead of a thick foundation.|`|33rlQAK3aa	You can go to the doctors and get a cream or anti biotic to clear it up, thats what i did last week, and it seems to be working, i wear make up and now that i have the cream it doesnt effect how much make up i wear. so just give it a try hope i helped :)|`|fEaWOiE9aa	Don't Feel Like U Have 2 Wear It Just B/c Every Other Girl Is.

If you really want to wear it then I would recommend not wearing foundation for a while, until most of your spots are gone.  When their not so visible, go to a department store to one of the make-up desks (clinique, clarins etc.) and they should match a good quality foundation with your skin, that way you shouldn't have a bad reaction to it!|`|tVVLtMHGaa	Maybe your allergic. What kind of spots r u talking about? You can always try the mineral makeup. Make sure you wash it off really good at night. and use a good moisturizer. And don't apply it too thick. Also, try MAC or Clinique of something like that. Good luck!
ugXymVAhaa	Few things you could do,    See you GP and talk to him about the problem he will prescribe some tablets that you can take. Only after taking them can you see if there is any result.    Or go to a Chinese herbal clinic/shops and ask for advice they are rele good at the hair loss stuff, they may also suggest acupuncture or some herbal medicine.    try to use shampoos that have vitamins in them and strengthen you hair.    These are some of the steps you can take, but it all depends what caused the hair loss if its genetics then...    And i know it's probably a cliche but eat healthy as this provides you body with the required vitamins    But i would strongly recomenfd you see a GP to start with    All the best|`|BKOgIfwHaa	Try the link below it is supposed to help prevent hair loss and some of your hair loss could be postpartum after the baby and try to deal with your stress and get it out of your life.|`|Nm5VWnRLaa	Are there any deficiencies in your diet? Perhaps anything you gave up so you could breastfeed? If there's anything you can think of, perhaps consider vitamin pills or supplements. I saw an article that listed iron, vitamin b and protein deficiencies as possible causes of hair loss.  If you think it is purely stress related, perhaps organise childcare to give yourself some time off to relax, or try herbal teas, or foods that produce endorphins. Regular scalp massages might help to stimulate hair growth, as well as relax you.  If it continues, talk to a doctor or pharmacist. They are more likely to be able to recommend treatments.  I hope you find a solution soon. =)

Su0LaNhoaa	Im a hairdresser.  DONT  permanently straighten your hair it will never be the same.  Get the Brazilian Keratin Treatment.  It is amazing and will change your hair and take all the frizz out and relax the curl and make your hair like silk.  and no damage.  go to BrazilianKeratin.com for all the info and salon finder...not all salons do it|`|ldwl20W9aa	No.    If you only bleached it once, and it was only streaks it won't be extremely damaged. Just buy some deep conditioner and leave it in for a few extra minutes. Your hair will regain it's health in a matter of weeks once it has time to produce more natural oils.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Yes! Having your hair permanently straightened fries and kills your hair. I don't recommend it.
C5eKUi2Xaa	I love this stuff! I use it to take off my makeup too. It's very gentle and when I use it around my eyes, I don't experience any stinging or irritation. My skin is noticeably less oily after I use it.     However, it says it lasts like that all day. It doesn't. But, I think it works pretty well. I love the clean fresh feeling it gives me too.    I've stuck with it for a while :) A little goes a long way. It's good to use it before you put on your makeup if you have oily skin. It gives it a fresh start.

It looks way more beautiful!|`|3ivRqDQ9aa	i say both! whatever makes the person look more flattering i say both because some don't match with straight but with soft waves.|`|g4nlUfmeaa	Usually curly, but different looks work for different girls.|`|sxo9dznQaa	either because they're both pretty.|`|AA11408898	anyway she has it looks good|`|DrXWucWpaa	I'm not a guy, obviously. But i think it depends what the person looks like.  Its not the same for everyone..|`|d5t5XgfVaa	it dont matter really,, i love my baby..  eww and guys with big hair is grosss|`|CDymqY65aa	straight|`|4x9PBxAoaa	Straight|`|k0yybjuWaa	straight for sure
19a42269af82d3f5735bb50900745b21aa	You should wear pinks and purples.  Think opposite on a color wheel.  Those will help the green stand out.|`|LeNeinDUaa	your eyes are a nice color. Green eyes are way cooler than blue :)    Anyways, use a purple (light, nothing heavy) eyeshadow on your eyelids, and a highlight color (like a shimmery silver) higher up.  Wear mascara but dont do eyeliner.     I think it's almay that has eyeshadows that are made for different color eyes. If you get that for green eyes it will make them pop too.|`|FVWvN07xaa	Blue eyes are awesome! :D  I have them.  But  i really like green tooo :)  you're eyes pop already, but use like eyeliner.|`|jp5DMXRJaa	shimmery gold!|`|IIztioS3aa	bright greens tend to make my eyes pop. My eyes are blue, but they vary in shade depending on what i'm wearing and make make up. If i wear a lot of green then they are more green. If i wear a lot of black they are more of a steel color and if i wear a lot of blue they are too. Opposite colors usually make them pop the most, but if you wear a lot of the color that you'd like them to be that might work too.    good luck
VDFl79FHaa	well maybe not everyday since it seems like you have very healthy hair maybe 2-3 times a week should be fine.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	If you have dry hair you can use it. I am assuming you are a guy. i don't think most guys use it unless they have dry hair and is long. if you don't use it and don't need it, don't bother|`|273f4d8a2a7dc06d2adecfcbd9d31ba8aa	I use conditioner daily, it's actually better for you hair then shampoo, which you're only supposed to use every other day.  When you use conditioner you're going to need to let it sit in your hair about five minutes, otherwise it doesn't really serve it's full purpose.|`|abeHfpdZaa	Depends.. if your hair is short, I don't recommend using conditioner. and they say every other day to condition because too much is actually contradictory.|`|xPx6OUmFaa	conditioner is da besssssssst!!! are you crazy i use a ton every day after i shampoo it makes the hair so soft and nice! you have been missing out my friend|`|JyGwfxzxaa	well...  i would say not that much..  because of all the chemicals that your hair is taking in ...your hair cant take that much torture from chemicals...  you should use shampoo and conditioner atleast 3 to 5 times a week...  i know it sounds crazy but if you want to have healthy hair than i suggest doin this...  its what i do...|`|SGreWjXaaa	After you use Shampoo. Use Conditioner.    It's like a combo... Like let's say you go to KFC/McDonalds    You get a meal without chips. Thats what you get when only using shampoo.|`|bSNm7VWVaa	Yes so u don't have dry hair or oily hair or damaged hair|`|sOpwKWVhaa	it's okay to use conditioner but make sure you use it once a week. u did mentioned your hair is fine but conditioners contain substances that makes it more healthier provided you use it safely. also, when u apply conditioner, massage it on your scalp and let it stay for at least 5 minutes to15minutes. then wash it..u'll see, there'll be a big change with it' s texture and thickness plus the smell is really good.
SK5FGKCCaa	Ofcourse she will!  She's only 13, and you stop growing when you're about 21!!|`|RicENLBsaa	yes will most definitly grow more|`|agyeZK1Caa	I'm pretty sure she will she's only just hit puberty when your growth spurt begins. Compare her height to others in your family many girls end up slightly taller than their mums.|`|p3GZERIsaa	God 13, course she will! I' 14 and 5ft 1! Still got bit of growing left though as does every teenager till around 18!|`|BqMoGMZbaa	of course she will... she'll stop growing when she will be 18|`|dabXEhINaa	She probably will, especially if everybody else in your family is quite tall. Even if she doesn't 5'2" is a really nice height (:|`|BKOgIfwHaa	Oh she definitely will grow some more. She will have a growth spurt between her ages of 14-16 and she is just starting her teenage years the changes in the next 2 years will amaze her if shes worried.|`|3qLIRorjaa	Yes, maybe. When i was 13 i suddenly shot up to 5ft 7"
8c56e64a8f1b90a7291b8613f7c9b797aa	Hi Sweetie,    Sorry to hear about your trouble, Im 14 and mine ALWAYS, without fail comes when I want to go swimming. If it'is possible try to talk to a female teacher about the problem and ask her if you can wear thick black leggings under your skirt so that you can kick freely. There is no chance that it will make a noise, just try and use a smaller sized pad, there are ones that are designed for younger bodies and they are a different shape, alot smaller and thinner, but they have a super absorbent core. If thats not an option, ask your mum, tampons are VERY tricky to use, it took me forever and i still have trouble with them, but if your allowed its worth a try, but remember to use the smallest ones you can buy.      I hope this helped and good luck.|`|c5anDswjaa	Seriously chick, try tampons out.. When I was your age I was worried about using them too! Wearing one wont make you lose your virginity, and it wont get stuck unless you pretty much make it be stuck.. They are a lot cleaner, and you dont have to worry about leaks or noises.. All you can ever see is a little string that is very easy to hide..    But yeah, your pad probably will make a little bit of noise.. And youll probably be able to see it in your leotard.. Just give tampons a try, they may sound uncomfortable and awkward,  but they really arent and are a LOT less worrysome than pads.. What seems worse, an absorbant plug, or a mini diaper? I use tampax pearls, get your mom to buy a box and you can give them a try :)|`|QovnMnbNaa	Man just wear tampons, I wear them and I'm 13 and have isnce I was 12. "uncomfortable with the events to use them" - get used to it its life hun|`|eX8i4vwRaa	wait.. your worried about him SEEING them or HEARING it?  if its hearing it.. dont worry; just do it.. he prob wont even notice!|`|vSAQqGa8aa	Well what you could do is when you wear your leotard, put in a panty liner before you practice, there very thin and shouldn't be seen. After your rehearsal go to the bathroom take it out and change into a pad so there wont be a chance of you leaking through your clothes.|`|hZkLVF2Baa	Why are tampons out of the question? They're much easier to hide... in fact you can't tell whether or not you're wearing one since it's inside of your body. And I don't get the rest of your post... what does that have to do with getting kicked out of school or kicking your legs... or noises? I don't get it.|`|IP2suWFTaa	Buy Always pads.they are very thin and very absorbent.I use them and you can't even tell when I have one on.
1Bj5nJOfaa	it'd look really pretty on you!|`|8iQFdkIhaa	yeah, it would look good.|`|AFkmdu92aa	yes!|`|KbUIttmqaa	YAY TWILIGHT    yes i think your hair would look very good voluminous.|`|F2D0R8Alaa	yes i believe it will|`|KPsWriOOaa	Yeah!|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	I guess it might but I would be concerned about bangs and a hairstyle with that much volume often makes cheeks and face look fatter on most people so beware of that. Kristen Stewart has a tapered chin so it looks great on her.
tB14zSSnaa	Use planet spa, its a face mask  it helps get rid of acne scars.  my friend had like alot of them  her skins perfect now, and shes only used it 4/5 times, shes more palre then the moon.  its really good stuff   can get it from avon. works really well :]  and for stretch marks use bio oil  its pretty pricey but works  have to use it for about 2 months tho, and the marks could be almost gone, and it doesnt tan your skin,          and to add, the face mask stuff  is 1 ;D  http://avonshop.co.uk/product/wellbeing/...|`|XHX5Z94Saa	Go to a dermatologist and they will probably want to use lasers. Its not surgery. It may cost a thousand depending on the severity, but it's totally worth it. Also you should use alpha hydroxy acids and dermabrasion. Also vitamin e. If you still break out really easily then you want to be careful putting these on your skin, hense seeing a dermatologist is key. Hope this helps.|`|KblMZiHpaa	yea definitely don't deliberately tan  i think i read somewhere that tanning will just darken the marks     i've heard retin A micro is excellent for removing scars but if i'm not mistaken you  need a prescription to get it.    a dermatologist would know the best!    good luck!|`|940fbd1f3460247a3967883e86cdaa2eaa	I'll tell you what I told another girl.  And this works!    Go and buy a body buffer pad or a facial buffer pad.  Get a scrub, like apricot facial scrub (i use it on my body )  Rub the scrub over your body (I did this cause i would get little pimples or whatever on the back off my leg) then use the buffer pads.    Buffer helps remove dead skin that is stuck on your body, and it doesnt hurt, just dont rub to hard. One the dead skin is gone, after a week you'll notice how smooth and firm your skin is getting.    Just shower everyday. Stretch marks apply to this buffer stuff to, they're basically damaged dead skin, help you body shed that skin faster.  I had a son and my tummy had horrible purple scars. It's been 5-6 months now and the scars are very very faint pink lines.    Hope this helps, good luck!|`|pqqJ5krjaa	Take a picture of yourself, photoshop it, done! It is, afterall what every my space ***** does.
Zx8dDBY8aa	as long as you take care of your hair before you straighten it, it should be ok.|`|TvuILSmYaa	probably...if u do it everyday...  dnt do it everyday, just to be safe.|`|YsLzrcL8aa	split enddddddds i straighten my har lotsand its starting to give me maor split ends|`|KPsWriOOaa	Doesn't cause baldness but it does cause split ends. Use a heat protecting hair spray/serum before you straighten.|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	Bald? No.  Split ends? Most definately. Heat is acutally terrible for your hair I wouldn't straighten it everyday and I would always use a heat protectant product.|`|oarhKHiLaa	i depends it usually gives u split ends but if you do it like everyday you might start to loose hair.But once you take ccare of it before you strighten it; it should be ok|`|yGl8v7Xwaa	It doesnt called balnes, but it can cause split ends or thick wiry damaged hair. Instead of straightening it everyday, get it straight permed or apply moisturizer after use.|`|vnVUdcUGaa	it depends on your hair. if you use lots of product while you straiten it you loose hair. and when you straighten your hair you get tend to get split ends because if you have to flat iron on too high it can burn your hair. it is usually ok if you have thick hair though.|`|1fWUOC5Yaa	it makes you have split ends if you straighten it everyday. but if you use conditioner and products to help then it probably wont turn out so bad
4RSJq6azaa	Try urban decay eyeshadow singles in oil slick( i luv this 1, but it has lots of sparkles)      U could also try Nars eyeshadow duos in Pandora or Smashbox eyeshadow singles in blackout ;-)|`|BYb3teJ0aa	nyx eyeshadow single in black.|`|jMffH1kzaa	id say go to the mall and ask a professional...good luck!  xoxoxo  lulu|`|7tRTZhnLaa	mac carbon eye shadow is really black|`|xFq3b4FKaa	shashbox black shade works AWESOME
dabXEhINaa	I think you probably will, you're face isn't too round so you won't look fat, if that's what you're worrying about! Even if it doesn't suit you it will grown out soon.  You could also try getting some layers put in!|`|UW8Aoid0aa	yes, theyd look very cute!|`|KiEPDEHkaa	I love your hair the way it is. & that's a pretty picture!   :)|`|Ip1Rdi9zaa	Natural looking side fringes will look good. Having elongated face, long fringes extending to the bridge of the nose would look good. Also, do not chop off too much of your hair...just a little to look natural.|`|yfZ5YSp4aa	Yeah!    And you should put some light brown hightlights in and curl.    It would look d3lish. :)    GO FOR IT!|`|5c48a3d3646aac3d075adfdfcbebb73daa	Definitely! A side fringe would look very flattering on you! ;)|`|6mBrJ2EGaa	yes~|`|LydL7EN6aa	yeah! thats be cute on you!!! good luck!!|`|0EmjQjf7aa	NO. you should have cleopatra hair Style|`|vJRMmgd6aa	yea i think u would look cute!|`|AA11193401	you would look good any way you do it your very pretty|`|tg89r7ZJaa	yes that would look cute....|`|0fE4qkPyaa	YES!It would look great!|`|h9y9xN4Naa	get frnt bangs..u'll look gr8  :)

xqgE4CrBaa	Yes, you're pretty enough. Now run along and practice! Shoo shoo!|`|yfZ5YSp4aa	Yeah. Ur really pretty :)    And love the way you done your makeup in the first pic. Keep it up!|`|UW8Aoid0aa	being pretty has nothing to do with cheering  i've seen gorgeous girls  and girls who think they're gorgeous  you just need to have the skills   and your make up looks fine as it is    but if you're talking about competitive cheerleading, they'll give you your own make up|`|OQqAlHL8aa	there's no attractiveness factor to cheerleading. I personally have seen cheerleaders that looked like scum of the whore house. your pretty and you know it, you're just looking for affirmation. I've never been a fan of the stereotypical personality of cheerleaders but I'm sure you'll be fine.|`|2G8lOPN8aa	Your link doesn't work...but from my experience...cheerleaders are not necessarily pretty--they are just usually confident (and quite often stuck-up)  I can tell you right now that the cheerleaders in my highschool were certainly not the girls *I* would vote as most attractive!    To be a cheerleader you need to have some gymnastic/dance ability.  Your looks should be secondary to your abilities.|`|3LWI3qfhaa	most of the cheerleaders i know arnt very pretty. They just think they are. Do u think ur pretty enough. if u do then thats all that matters :)  u should go for it...goodluck|`|5xgcKSbjaa	No.|`|Ppz64oxQaa	Sure|`|wNfGstspaa	You are flawless.|`|EJAIYK8saa	i think ur cheerleader material i was a material for a very very long time and u look like ud belong on our team..           hope it helps..|`|PAwQLtYcaa	you shouls lose alittle weight and then try. Go for a gothic look.|`|tdbNz7bTaa	I agree With the last post.. I've seen cheerleaders who aren't cute at all and not skinny too butt they are confident and loud and peppy...if you are good at it go for it..|`|049b3a8507fd29a17c1797467db7d4aeaa	im not going to look at the pic because I really don't think that your beauty or lack of have anything to do with it. Get your skills up and go for it
1e9c55b274cecb6e7839a919734e6d05aa	use lots and lots of baby oil on the tracks and it should slide out just fine.|`|7euKjvG9aa	I hate to tell you this but you are going to lose some of your real hair, but not much if you use the glue remover. The glue used for bonding hair is like glue cement and really should never be used on the hair and especially not the scalp, the only reason why its sold is because people buy it. The best extension is a sew in (I don't believe in those either, but they are better for the hair) because you can keep them in longer and be able to wash your hair with them in.|`|twYAtTOpaa	bond remover or baby oil. let it set on the track then it should slide out ina a few minutes.|`|n3akm5u6aa	wash ur hair as normal and genlty slide it off .
BI1Ma4vVaa	Well for BACKCOMBING just use a normal rat tail comb that you can get in like walmart or target or any drugstore.    A HAIR PICK which is also known as a FRO PICK is something different entirely, though you can get it from any of the above listed places.|`|TBRMH4hbaa	They sell them at every beauty supply store. Some dollor stores even have them, and some Walmarts. Just ask for a teasing comb ! You can also use a fine-tooth or a tail comb (:      Vote me best answer pls !|`|0JoLBnBKaa	do you mean a hair pick???
BI1Ma4vVaa	Umm. I think the bangs are a little too full and blunt for your bone structure. I would be worried about losing your eyes and making you look constantly angry. If I were you I would keep that colour and get the same sort of layering just with thiner bangs.|`|NZjnMKXAaa	yeah it def would that haircut is way cute!  x)|`|Zx8dDBY8aa	I think that cut will match you.|`|l5wziiicaa	The haircut is super cute!|`|zR0Dcdevaa	I like your current one better.|`|TvuILSmYaa	its almost kinda the same hairstyle as u already have...|`|IexejV9iaa	Yeah it would look okay|`|NuRM8SRdaa	well your current hairstyle is very pretty! the black is very nice too...it oculd soo work! do whatever you please and believe me you will look great! i have to say i think u rock the light brown the best!    |`|IrahyL2Qaa	yes|`|WFZWlGA0aa	The emo chick's hair seems pretty thick...it might not work on you...your hair looks cool already though.|`|oWjJR5F0aa	yeah you coullld.|`|fYktw8Xqaa	I think the haircut would look great on you.  The bangs especially :)|`|6xJt8iAMaa	It would look good on you!

154dzJ1Faa	Layers mean that the top sections of your hair are cut shorter than the lower sections, so that it doesn't hang to the same length.  You get "layers".  No, it does not make your hair straight, and no it does not make it less poufy.  In fact, you get layers to MAKE your hair fuller, and curlier.    I think what you are wanting is to have the hair thinned.  That means that some of the hairs are cut quite short, while the one hair next to it is left long.  So it looks like you have less hair.  The scalp will still have as many, but they don't all reach the full length of your hair.    But my question is: why do you have it so long?  Obviously, it is a burden.  It is a pain.  it is a lot of bother.  And there is no good reason why you  have it so long... is there?  Think about it, and tell yourself why you need it that long, when it is not doing anything for you.  It is supposed to make you look attractive.  Does it?|`|256cVXsmaa	Yea tell them to thin it out with a razor and to give you long layers... It will make it look less puffy and give it more texture and style!|`|240196f7d6a1fc2f0753fb8357ab2c18aa	I will just simply answer your question straight forward, without thinking of your extra comments: YOU WILL FINALLY LOOK PRETTY!!!!|`|AA11915664	it will help but you need to use an antipoof shampoo and conditioner such as sunsilk in the blue bottles. it takes a whole LOT of the bulk out.|`|sOpwKWVhaa	it will just make your hair puffier than before. it will look horrible,believe me. I cut hair here in the philippines and i know very well what will happened to your hair so i strongly suggest not to cut it. instead, have it rebonded. here, we call it "hair rebonding. it makes ur hair not only straight but smooth, thin and easy flowing. after u geta hairrebond, then decide what hairstyle u want.|`|54261bcf6c81c42832912d11681eaf89aa	It works perfectly!!  I too have thick hair and i have been fancying it for 5-6 yrs..  try it gud luck!!|`|AA12138071	It will thin it out.  The thing I don't like about having my hair layered when it's longer is that you need a half-container of gel if you want to braid it. If you don't like to wear braids, you wouldn't have that problem, of course.|`|tjt8DCvUaa	your hair will become thinner and easier to handle, but might take more time to straighten, but would look better :]
Xef2mbGcaa	Ugh.  I hate it.|`|C5eKUi2Xaa	Get the Revlon Colorstay. Best I've ever used. I prefer it to MAC studio fix liquid foundation.
BTpNkxoeaa	Come on buddy.  It's February.  If you really want to crossdress, just be honest enough to say you do because you want to.    The best tip I can give you is to get a lady friend to help you out with this.|`|3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	Tips for Halloween?  In February?  Crossdressing?    I think you're a bad boy.  Somebody needs to teach you a lesson.      I wish someone would make you wear a dress like this:  http://www.simplydresses.com/shop/viewit...    We would make you wear a wig like that too, and heels, and everything.  Then we would make you wear Wings, and tell everyone that you are the Toothfairy. Then we would take you shopping at the mall.  However, we would lose your there and you would have to walk all the way home.  Ha!    That would really teach you a lesson.|`|gSOGsHIOaa	its february...?    anyways...could you be more specific?  crossdressing isnt really a costume - its *part* of your costume...|`|nBayWj8Faa	Don't make it a lifestyle choice?

N3qnOlehaa	your links are broken, just letting you know. idk im having my 8th grade promotion this year too, im probably gonna wear a dress from nordstroms or macys or something. it's really not that big of a deal and im not gonna stress, and you shouldn't either. but, i guess for hairstyles curl or straighten your hair.|`|ZgfygNpoaa	links don't work!
tfqpb5XQaa	It depends on the person, i guess the older the person is the more it seems to bother them being asked.|`|90ZaNZE4aa	no     Im 20, young and going strong|`|5qFmukWwaa	For some reason there are people who are bothered about revealing their age.  When you are talking person to person its probably better not to ask.  For myself, I don't mind being 58 - I just wish I didn't look 68.|`|TBRMH4hbaa	No, but I'm only 16.  When people ask my mom she refuses to answer, so I guess the older you are the more sensitive of a subject it becomes.|`|v1tHjJ3haa	I'm 17 in exactly about 9 days!

Don't be touching your hair too much, it will get oily.|`|NUw5PKrhaa	yeah sure! It's actually better for your hair if you don't shower every day. If you feel grimy w/o the shower, give your self a sponge bath.|`|rCh8Wk2raa	taking one every day is bad. i take one every other day.|`|qyEXOHsxaa	Yeah you'll be okay! you'll just be sleeping so it's okay to be dirty.

If you can't.. then i guess you can't :[  Just try to check to see when you can as soon as possible.|`|rbwgOoMHaa	Well, if you're feeling gross, you should just put your feet in the bathtub and rinse off your arms and legs and stuff. It's bad for your hair if you wash it excessively so it'll help that as well.|`|d9f63360c00901d3fe28d35b4e974c71aa	work on getting heat and take one in the morning. You can generally buy an electric heater at WalMart all night for $30 to $50 that will safely heat your bathroom at least, when used as directed|`|eJbA3g4vaa	Unless you have really greasy hair, its okay to shower every other day if you don't have a lot of time in your schedule. But yes, of course its okay to skip tonight's shower! =)|`|VDFl79FHaa	of coarse if you take a shower everyday you skin because dryer because you wash away your natural oils skip a day and you'll also get healthier skin!|`|fxgMwo7iaa	Yes, just use baby wipes or something on you lady part and unisex part and in your armpits.|`|9uEZSIvhaa	Yea its okay. i take a shower every other day in the winter. As long as you arent smelly, which you probably arent :) Hope you water heater starts working again.... lol     hope I hellpppped!
ndlSeLNeaa	ya they do this in stores....it can range from 50 to 80 depending on what you want|`|92fbce946753f473dafcf78d171f5a2baa	yeah , i got it for my mom, its 70 bucks. and they have different sets of sample perfumes like classic, bestseller, trendy ,   yeahh stuff like that.    heres the link:    http://www.sephora.com/search/search_res...|`|D1tPCO0uaa	Yeah Sephora.com has it. They range from 50 to 70 and there are three for women and one for men.
154dzJ1Faa	A curling iron is okay to curl your hair, when you know how to use it.  With long thick hair, it is just too hard to do properly, I know.    Hot rollers are an option.  You will put them in while quite hot, leave them in the hair while you get dressed, and then take them out.  It is almost like the curling iron, but they don't get that hot.  You will get a good bounce to your hair, and curl.  They should last the day, I would think, but not as long as rollers in wet hair.  Hot rollers are great for touching up a style, to rejuvenate some bounce for the day.    Because your hair is very long (not sure how long) you have to remember that a lot of weight will pull the hair down, and you will only get some lift at the roots, and curl on the ends.  With layered hair, the ends are spread over a larger area, and it looks curlier.  Try pulling up your hair on the sides, and that can help a lot too.    Hot rollers are a heat implement, so take all the necessary precautions with the condition of your hair.  I think you will like the effect.  The iron can be used to add more definition to the ends of some curls.|`|07YBD5mJaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoZ2QGq0n...    save your money=]  works just as great!
qfSKgxDsaa	Relax hun it's not that bad I will tell you everything :)  1. You'll walk in and go up to the desk and tell them you would like to get your ears pierced (your parent or legal guardian has to be there if under 18)  2. You'll sit in the little designated chair and tell her what kind of earings you want (sterling silver is the best)  3. She will get them out and put on gloves and open the package.  4. She will get a little purple marker and put a dot on your ears and make sure they're even and ask you if that's where you want them.  If you don't, speak up!  This is permanant! :)  (3 and 4 may be reversed)  5. She will then clean your ears with an alcohol pad and load the earings in the piercer (If you want them done at the same time they can get two people to do it, but it's really not that bad)  6. She will go on three.  The piercer is a little noisy and makes a clicking noise  7. Then she will put the cleaning solution on that you must do for the next 4-6 weeks about 3 times a day (like morning, after school, and when you go to bed.    That's basically it!  The actual piercing, doesn't hurt at all.  Your ears will be a little sore.  You might want to take like some advil to help with that.  You'll notice it that night when you're trying to sleep if you sleep on your side.  Try and sleep on your back to make it easier.  It's sore when you go to clean them, but you HAVE to!  If they start looking red or don't look right, go to cleaning them 4 times a day and make sure you clean them after any showering or swimming.  But you'll be fine, it's a very grown up thing to do and it's pretty cool.  After about 6 weeks you can change your earrings but must leave some kind of stud in for at least 6 months so your holes don't grow up.  She'll explain all this to you too, but now you know before you go :)  Email me and tell me how it goes!|`|eJbA3g4vaa	I got my ears pierced at Claires and no, they do not use numbing cream. It doesn't need it that much. It is only like a little pinch. I would say about as much as a normal flu shot would hurt. Im not sure about if it gets higher. I only have one piercing, not any further up.|`|VDFl79FHaa	i got my ears pierced at claires. it was ok once it goes in it doesnt hurt anymore. its really fast so dont worry. just make sure not to take it off till 3 weeks or the hole will go back in|`|qyEXOHsxaa	They just use these guns that have earrings in them with really sharp ends and they just use a marker to find the spot on your ear, then they use the gun and do it really quick. It doesnt hurt at all. It's like a little prick, you'll get over it trust me. It's the eastiest peircing to get.|`|7M20gPYGaa	okay.. i only got my ears peirced in grade 8  i was sitting on the chair and i was like clenching waiting for it and it doesnt hurt the first one its unexpected the 2nd hole u can feel a little pinch but it does not hurt :D|`|TTWyHRtqaa	Noo it doesnt hurt!  -This is wat they do, get a marker put a dot where there gonna pierce u. --Disinfect the earring there going to pierce u with  and ur ear.   -Get the gun thing, and pierce ur ear!    And then ur done! :]|`|GgBdQqrdaa	doesnt hurt at all.. i just got mine done.. guaging hurt worse.|`|ZJGqEtFMaa	my ears aren't pierced, but I'll say tat it probably feels like a short needle on both sides of ur ear, it'll probably hurt for the first couple seconds|`|BCKEzqRlaa	Getting your ears pierced doesn't hurt at all. The cartilage on your lobe is very thick, its like getting a shot. You'll still feel something, but it doesn't hurt. I didn't get my ears pierced at Claire's, but when I did get my ears pierced, I think they swabbed my lobe first. After that, I think they marked where they were going to pierce, and they just stuck the needle through with their device. It feels like a little sting, and you won't feel it for long. If the holes close up, they do the same thing, but it will hurt less.|`|9ni90gyVaa	some what|`|84db822e80c8ab6223d50689fd25b00aaa	It doesn't hurt really. It's more of a shock because of the sound it makes (right near your ear) and then blood rushes to your ears and they get very hot. You might be a litle uncomfortable sleeping the first night or two, but it's really not bad at all.    I would be careful going to places like Claire's because I've heard that using a piercing gun is not the safest way to get a piercing. (Try a tattoo/ piercing parlor instead)    Basically what happens is you tell the employee you want your lobes pierced, they mark a spot on your ear with a marker and you can look in the mirror to see if you like that location. (Sometimes people prefer it lower or higher). Then they take either a piercing gun or needle and line it up with the mark and then quickly pierce the lobe.    It's all over in a matter of seconds, so don't worry about it. Enjoy!|`|pS9yoeLuaa	PLEASE don't go to Claire's. Please. Please don't. For your own health.    Piercing guns are so dangerous.   They use the same gun on so many different people and this thing cannot be cleaned properly. This means that if a person with HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, or any other disgusting and contagious disease was pierced with that gun, you can catch that disease. That's comforting, isn't it?    The guns hurt to a ridiculous extent and with my first ear piercing the gun got stuck to my ear. It dangled there while the girl who put it there ran into the back and cried to the manager that she didn't know what to do.    The people who do the piercings are 16 year old high school girls who do this for minimum wage after school. That should be enough to make it that much less appealing.    But there's more!    The jewelry is completely inappropriate for the piercing. You need hoops, not studs. And not the hoops you can buy at Claire's for $8. CBR's, or captive bead rings, are made of surgical steel (hypoallergenic) and they come off less easily, and they don't press the piercing which irritates it - the hole will be able to breathe.    Please to to a professional piercer who uses a sterilized hollow needle that he or she opens in front of you, wears gloves, properly cleans the area, has appropriate and autoclaved jewelry, is CPR certified (yes, people faint), is in a clean shop, and will give you proper aftercare instructions.  It's safer, it's cleaner, and from someone who knows - far more painless than having your ear pierced with a gun. (Plus the sound makes you jump)   A pro will do it properly and painlessly. Please, if you know what's good for you, take my advice.|`|7Xcl9XLoaa	i got mine dones at claires and they didnt put anything to numb it on my ear..  all they did was mark where to put the hole through, use a sanitizing wipe, and said 1 2 3 then used the thing that puts the hole and earing through..    it didnt hurt too bad, kinda like a shot but it doesnt hurt after words|`|C8zrNMRjaa	it doesnt hurt at all you can only feel it for like a second and its so worth it trust me (=|`|NoT3WGaEaa	My sister said it doesn't and she's the biggest cry baby I know.|`|p0qLn2kFaa	no,its like getting a shot at the doctor's you'll be just fine.|`|iTTS06IKaa	It feels like a really sharp pinch, that's all. I got mine pierced when I was in 1st grade, and if I can handle it, I'm sure you can! =)  It's more suprising than it is painful. The funny thing is your ears feel really hot afterward. Getting them peirced and wearing earrings is fun!|`|rv4Z32VFaa	It's like a sharp pain that lasts for a few minutes but then it's fine. Look, beauty is pain and there are more painful things in this world. You'll be fine!|`|SEd2yp0Paa	Not at all..   They will clean your ears on the lobe and put a dot on both sides and let you look at them to see if that's where you'd like your piercing to be. You pick out which studs you would like ( i suggest getting gold or white gold instead of the cheap stuff but its up to you ) then they have a little gun type piercing device which they put the stud in on one side and the back of the ear ring is on the other. then they pierce your ears and then clean them off again. It really doesn't hurt at all.. like at all.. It will burn a little bit like get hot feeling but as long as you clean them regularly and move them around you'll be just fine :)   Absolutely nothing to be afraid of!|`|DKfScL8taa	no, and no. they use a gun, super fast. does not hurt.|`|cgmBEvHIaa	it doesnt hurt at all! just a little pinch that it. keep them clean tho, cuz if they get infected.... thats a whole nother story|`|xAdOhtaoaa	yeah only for a pinch second
VLdc4mrpaa	You may want to considered having the hair cut with a razor. This will give it some texture and make it more angular. Right now, the overall look of your hair is pretty soft/blunt.     I would avoid going too short as you need some length to balance the size of your head. The length now is actually pretty flattering, but you can go a little shorter or longer depending on how you get the hair cut.     Try having some fun with your hair. Go a bit longer in the back, and change the bangs to a more angular side-swept style. You can even spike it up a little like in this photograph of Joe Jonas:    http://i94.photobucket.com/albums/l90/me...    Feel free to not focus on being neat with your hair. A bit of a "messy" look is definitely in style, and it gives you more freedom.    http://www.hairfinder.com/haircollection...    http://hairdohairstyles.com/HairStylePic...    http://i152.photobucket.com/albums/s189/...    You may want to invest in some styling gel to help hold your hairstyle in place on those days when you decide to go for a more messed-up look. Just blow dry your hair and apply the styling gel and use your fingers to style. On most days, especially if you change the bangs to a more angled side-bang, you should at least consider straightening the bangs or blow drying them straight. For the most part, a razored shag cut is pretty low maintenance.     It will take a little time to "train" the hair to be in the direction you want it to be, especially if it's been in the same style for a while. Blow dryers and straighteners help a lot in the beginning.     You may also want to consider the hair color. The black is a little dark and does not work with your skin tone. Try going a tad lighter, such as a medium to dark brown. You may also want to consider some subtle lighter brown (or even auburn) highlights. I wouldn't go too overboard with the highlights, but some added to the hair will add some dimension and interest.     Also, once a week or every other week, wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo. It will help get rid of build up and keep your hair from looking too "greasy".  Don't use the clarifying shampoo too much if you are going to color your hair, and I don't recommend you use anything except color treated shampoo for a month or so after you first color. A little clarifying shampoo will help make your hair look cleaner and healthier.    I'm not sure if you will like any of the pictures, but hopefully, at the very least, they will give you some ideas for your hair and you can use them to find the best hairstyle for you.     Good luck and post pictures of the new hairstyle!|`|gPJf3UTaaa	fohawk?

cDpu1Dxyaa	GHD is the only way to go  It straightens and curls (it's the iron you've probably seen on youtube) it heats up super fast and the curls are amazing! sooo easy to use and they're good for your hair.    No decent salon product will ever be around $30 (sad but true) any thing that cheap and you are at serious risk of burning your hair leaving it damaged and frizzy.    GHD's cost around $300 but they are amazing and a good investment|`|07YBD5mJaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoZ2QGq0n...    save your money=]  this works just as great, saves time, money and your hair by not using heat.  best wishes!|`|3AAtPzSaaa	try a ghd....  theyre the best i own one and it straightens your hair as well as curls it.... its a skinny rectangle shape but dont let that detur you its way better then spiral ones.  heats up within seconds.  theres no way $30 will be enough for ANY decent iron....  for a good one your looking at $100 upward!!

lZzCGq08aa	Well, I definately don't know much about fashion but I do watch America's Next Top Model. You can watch a few episodes to see what they usually look for in a girl. It's always good to be outgoing and friendly but don't over do it. As for your look, be clean cut. Don't pile on too many layers of clothes because layers can sometime make a girl look bulkier than she actually is. Wear a hairstyle that suits you well. You can practice by having a friend or family member make up some random questions for you. Answer them as if you were at a real interview and have them grade you on your responses.

CXAauAk2aa	All you have to do is let your hair grow and when its like 1.5-2 inches high then go to the barber and tell them to cut the sides kind of like a tapered side. Then in the back of your hair just let it grow and don't cut it. Most importantly is to cut the sides a little bit more than you would on a normal tapered cut.

1L98dC81aa	No, it is two neutral colors and it would be like putting navy and black together. It is too similar to look good together. The same goes with brown and black. There are so many other colors that go with black like red, blue, green, yellow, and even white.|`|QMYNU9uNaa	They don't exactly "match" but they are both neutral colors so technically someone could wear them together if they really wanted to, but it's not something I would do personally. I think brown pants with a black shirt or the other way around would look weird, but maybe if there was a dress or nice shirt with a cute pattern that had both brown and black on it then it would be acceptable.|`|43MRQ9eLaa	i think it does but im a guy so what do i know... lol i wear this brown hollister shirt with a pair of black jeans and they seem to go fine.|`|k5unIdZmaa	wow what a question.

TBRMH4hbaa	Well, if you think it would look good on you then do it !     I think only certain people can pull it off without looking like a bull, thouhg. Some pictures of you would probably be useful, but do what you want !     It's a neat piercing, because you can flip it up or down and theres a bunch of different types of jewellry !      chose me for best answer pls|`|IMOKF6alaa	Do it. I think its soo hot on people!|`|xzNr2RmIaa	You should!  It's a cool piercing.  I had mine done, it didn't hurt anywhere near as bad as I thought it would.|`|eXJOdwzcaa	if you know the peircer then yes.   but if you dont then no.  thats a pretty important part of your nose.|`|3ivRqDQ9aa	u should totally get it!! i think it's cool!!|`|sWz9cDnyaa	nope i love piercings but i think septums are getting alittle overrated but i heard they dont hurt much to get done|`|nwVGX7SKaa	nooooooooooo! no offense i'm not a fan i think lip rings are cute though|`|QJ0sy8eaaa	no, a septum piercing looks tacky and like you're trying too hard.  get another piercing, like your nose or lip.   a septum piercing is just a giveaway for someone who is trying too hard to achieve a certain image, and thats exactly the opposite of what you want. i got my nose done on my 18th!|`|Zzumj5HDaa	Well, I have a few piercings, and I'm all for expressing yourself BUT... A septum piercing does not impress too well in the job market. If you have a creative job, go for it! If not, i would say no because most employers frown upon any visible body piercing. Also, if it's not enhancing your appearance don't waste your time (or money).|`|fXj2kVpPaa	NO, no and nooooo|`|3ab68e1da8b4effd949a5a9484a588c8aa	if you feel it would suit your face then yes.    it is one of the best facial piercings you can hide. as long as you wear a horseshoe ring you can flip it up inside your nose and it will stay in place. so it will not be a hindrance if you want to find a job because you will be able to hide it.    your nose will be sore for quite some time compared to a lip piercing. if you really want it it is worth it. tip - qtips help when you need to clean the inside of your nose until it is not sore.

Over time, it will lighten.  Sometimes not enough to make it very blonde... but just a little.|`|HL2Sw9Pdaa	sunlight.  its the heat of the sun + the lemon juice.|`|HAxUYzb4aa	you better use sunlight, my GF did it|`|ldwl20W9aa	Yes, the sun is what activates the lemon to lighten hair.

S61oU0yFaa	You are not fat... at all... don't let the size 0's bring you down, because most of them don't have curves like I'm sure you do.  If you're concerned about camouflaging anything you're uncomfortable showing a great option is a wider strap A-line dress.  Wider strap allows you to wear a supportive bra which will lift "the girls" up higher which will give you more of a waist.  Also something with a wide band that sits right at your waist will make you narrow there.  The A-line will float away making your bottom half in proportion with your upper half.  If you're concerned about a large chest don't go with a scoop neck, because that will just make it look larger.  A v-neck compliments just about anyone.  Here's some examples!    http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...    http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...    http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...    http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...|`|256cVXsmaa	Well for one you are NOT fat girl! Stop that nonsense!  I think you should def. try forever 21, wet seal, or charlotte russes websites.  Also try Windsors formal dresses...  http://www.windsorstore.com/shop_departm...  If you have a bit more money than you could try cache, they have gorgeous formal dresses.  http://www.cache.com/cache/control/main    Personally I think a  dress that has some sort of bow or tie at the waste and flows out more beyond the waste would look best on your body type.  It accentuates your waste line =]  Def to the knee or above the knee sense it's a graduation dress.  Maybe something along these lines   http://www.windsorstore.com/shop_detail....    EDIT: woops I didn't mean to say at the waste, meant to say below the boobs.  Gives you shape and hides the bad areas!!!|`|qfSKgxDsaa	I'm sure you are fine!

Xef2mbGcaa	Actually, NW is WARM.  NC is COOL.  Try going down again and play around with warm and cool colors on your neck,(not your face or you'll look streaky if the colors don't match, and your neck you can hide with your hair).|`|C5eKUi2Xaa	Try a different salesperson. Tell them that you want a NW. But ask what shade of an NW blends in best.    Also, if you want to find the shade yourself. DO NOT try and apply it on your hand or wrist. Apply it to your jawbone right above the neck. Because the color of you hand is different than your face! Whichever one blends in perfectly without leaving a darker or lighter spot where you applied, that's the one for you! :)|`|e98509f4bac5877efa0694962f059f0baa	go to the makeup section in anystore. if you prefer to use mac cosmetics then ok. when your in the foundation part of the store, take eachone and macth it to your skin. if it blends in, then you have found the right shade. it has to match your skin tone. dont worry about the warm/cool undertones. since your confused on that, dont worry about it. just focus on rubbing in a bit on the bottom of your wrist, and see which on matches the best. the one that blends in well, and can hardly tell that you have any on, then buy it. cause you have found the right one for your skin tone. goodluck and dont ask those people, some people know what they are doing but others dont. =)

d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	Forehead wrinkle.( horizontal ones): Apply olive oil and massage on lines with front of fingers held together and, starting from one side of forehead, do a series of short forward and back strokes - about 5 or 6 - blending one into the next all the way to the other side. For best, quickest results do quite vigorously for a minute or more. Crows Feet: Can be very quickly greatly minimized by rubbing up and down on them quite vigorously with first three fingers held close together.  Even deep lines will be greatly diminished. For faster results do 2 or 3 times or a day. See clear fading of lines in one to three weeks - depending on how often and how vigorous you have have made it.    Wrinkle prevention:  Avoid using products. Many and particularly anti aging and wrinkle creams, cleansers and moisturizers are seriously skin harming and skin aging -.even causing acne and worse. Many have been pulled from market, notably in France, because of cancer causing scares. Verify with a Google  I have had truly remarkable success in  preventing wrinkles with safe, natural treatments using only modest cost essential oils and massage that not only permanently healed my many skin conditions but gave me a virtually flawless, healthy, young looking and vibrant skin. Daily thorough massaging with oils feed skin essential beneficial and health promoting nutrients and even the first day you will see skin looking healthier and starting to glow.    Massaging quite vigorously is even better for skin tightening and giving you a younger looking skin. Don't be afraid of doing it vigorously. If done right it is only beneficial. There is no pulling or stretching of skin as you have to tighten face muscles in order to tighten the skin in the part being massaged and in doing so it exercises and conditions many of face (and some neck) muscles - thus combating weakening of muscles that eventually leads to sagging and in turn wrinkling and lines.  Massage using a forward and back motion using finger tips and front and sides of fingers depending where on face you apply it. Circular motion is not effective. In a few days skin will visibly tighten, look and feel smoother and healthier. It can totally revitalize and rejuvenate skin and face.

RChBFKdWaa	it wont be very hard to get out if you only dyed it once.  the first bleach it will probably go somewhere between a light browney orange and yellow.  the second bleach after a few weeks will go light yellow and then you should use a toner on it after that.|`|4Xmr0Yjlaa	no but it would have a red tint in it|`|YJGEEJhWaa	its really hard to get to blonde if you have almost black hair, you'll have to bleach it, and it'll prob go red 1st. xx|`|twYAtTOpaa	it will go copper if you used a permanent hair dye to make it brown. you have to strip the hair dye off first then bleach it at least twice.|`|fhIndzl4aa	Permanent is just what it means. This makes a 'permanent' change in the pigment of the hair shaft.  It does not wash out!    It will fade in time, but cannot be simply removed to "bring back" your natural color.  All hair that has been colored in this way has the natural color pigments irreversibly chemically altered.      It can be removed, leaving the "altered" hair shaft pigments, which can be "corrective colored" back close to the original color.     If you are very dark haired (Level 1) and want to be a level 10 platinum blonde, forget home hair coloring!     Note:  To read about hair color levels and pigments check out: Haircolor Basics: Hair Pigment Categories.  This article explains hair color levels as well as hiar pigment categories.    I know that there are many lightening kits on the market that will lighten hair at home and there are beauty supply stores that will sell professional products to the public, but if you try this at home you are taking a big gamble.      While it can be and is done every day by people, some get the results that they wanted and some get horrible results.     If you don't believe me, just go to any beauty supply that is open to the public and stand around the hair color section for a while and listen to the customer's comments.      Or go to any mall or public place and just sit for a few minutes and take a silent count of how many botched color jobs you see!     My heart goes out to these people because most people who color their hair are trying to improve their appearance not detract from it!  There is nothing that will lower your self esteem of yourself worse than having a bad hair day whether it is a bad cut, color or perm that lasts for months.|`|hr9H9DLfaa	It will not be the platinum blond you are expecting, in fact it may turn a copper or an orange. Let me tell you what you can do.    Now, if you want to bleach it again go ahead and do that as long as you are okay with walking around with orange hair (or whatever color may turn out) until you get it bleached again. You will need to get it bleached 2 or 3 times before it will be the blond you are going for. However, bleaching is very traumatic to your hair which is why you need to wait a while between bleaches. Also, ask your stylist to put a deep moisturizing conditioner on your hair after the bleach and leave it on for a few minutes. This will help your hair stay healthy and soft. If you don't your hair could split, feel like straw and just be downright unhealthy. Good luck!
mpOGnr6vaa	Boys usually do, but that depends on the person, his or her fitness level and amount of bodyfat. Women usually have more bodyfat, and that slows reflexes.

Also, you are probably the only one who thinks that, because the more self-conscious you are, the more you will think they stick out.
zFwjZy53aa	The beach or your backyard. I love to tan but would never step foot in a tanning bed. Just use a light spf on your body and a stronger one on your face. Don't get a spray tan or fake tan they look so fake. Oh and to keep your tan, well they have this lotion at cvs or walgreens made by no ad and it kinda "seals in" your tan.

And since you havn't done that before your eyes will water a bit and your mascara will get on the contact and it hurts.     Also, kinda a bone-head thing, but make sure you always put your contacts in before you put on your make up.

Puss is your white blood cells acccumulating at a sight to fight infection. It should not be ooozing and have puss. With tatoos you do have open wounds and entry past the skin. It is many holes poked through the skin and anything can enter those holes and cause infection. The wrist is close to the hands and your hands carry so many germs every day. They have doctors wash all the way to the elbows because germs can climb that high from the hands.  If you try rubbing alcohol on it for a day or two and it continues I would see a doctor. Infections are not something you want to mess with at all.

CJGrCsfIaa	I am a rep, but I'll give you honest answers.    You can't beat how affordable and convenient the products are. Most of their products come in convenient packaging and are customizable.     Their foundations are oil-free and they do not test their products on animals.     They also have a 100% satisfaction guarantee. Those are some of the reasons that I like the products so much!|`|C5eKUi2Xaa	Okay so personally, I don't use Mark. But I would like to.

They're cream shadows crease. She has the liquid foundation and loves it. It covers really well. Personally, the sponge tip applicator I think doesn't work that well. I've heard of it breaking off, it doesn't get much product on the sponge, and it's kinda difficult to use. Read the reveiws on the site! They are very helpful.|`|e98509f4bac5877efa0694962f059f0baa	i LOVE mark products. i usually just use the mascara, cause i'm not one for using eyeshadow everyday, and i have gotten lip gloss from it and i'm not a lip gloss kinda person, but it all is very good. i like it alot.     and i'm not a sales representative. i just like buying their products. =)

You can also team a jacket or cardigan.    Alternatively, wear a well-fitted slim jeans, a nice camisole and a smart black jacket. Accesorize it with a smart shoes, a pearl necklace or a brooch.    Wear lots of mascara, lip gloss and a natural blush.    You'd look just perfect.

Well not a dress, but one of those long-top thingys that you can wear with dark leggings or tights. With ankle boots or ballet flats? Then a cool (maybe leather) jacket over. Thats an outfit i've always wanted to wear :)    Then wear a few long small-beaded necklaces to make it less dressy and more casual. Have your hair in tousled waves, thats sexy and casual at the same time!
u25R7XIGaa	You really shouldn't. You won't have immediate problems but it will make the hole weaker, and as you get older the holes will stretch until they more resemble slits... and then any earrings you wear will look funny. If you want to wear them, like, once, for a dance or something, you'll be fine, but it'd be better to stick with some simple, pretty post earrings.    EDIT: People, it's 8 weeks (2 months) to change the POSTS. You're not supposed to wear dangly earrings for 6 MONTHS.     Even if they seem light, when you move your head, the earrings will swing and tug a bit, so it's not just the weight that's the issue. After all, you can wear posts.|`|DlMsJPwUaa	yes, its not an infection thing, its so the hole doesnt stretch|`|mGHwSICwaa	the person who did my pierce told me to wait only 2 weeks...|`|AA12157801	Do you want your ears to get cut open?|`|VDFl79FHaa	well i didnt wait six months to wear dangly earrings maybe 1month or 2 cause my ear is perfectly fine now.|`|KbUIttmqaa	i think your actually supposed to wait a year... But i suggest that instead u get some nice studs and use those. No point in taking a risk like that.|`|G3lcNV85aa	..I was told to wait 8 weeks, not 6 months..I'm fine. Just clean your ears a lot.|`|fco4Hl2gaa	Your ears won't rip open, don't pay attention to that comment haha that's ridiculous. It should be completely fine for you to change your earrings now, six months sounds like an unusually long time to be recommended to keep them in anyways. Read the source I put on here, it says you really only need about 6 weeks if they're healing well :) Hope it turns out well!|`|Gem96NQyaa	As long as they're not too heavy, you can get away with it in about half that time.  They say six months because heavy earrings are kind of the in thing in a lot of places right now, and putting that much weight on a freshly healed piercing can very easily open it back up (and cause it to stretch).    If they start to get sore at all, though, take them out immediately, and put a stud back in as soon as you can.|`|ZDv516AOaa	no, well i didnt... i mean if u wear like really heavy once its a bad idea.. but light ones.. after 2-3 months u should be good!|`|177899897ae0634b315f1b26968a1388aa	I'm not sure... I thought it was more like 6 weeks. If you decide to wear them, I would start of with a lighter earring.|`|9Rf2Tny3aa	I would definitely wait. You can wear them maybe a little before, but you could really screw up your ear if you do ;]|`|ycs7XAnXaa	no|`|cPaegdwzaa	you'll be fine. if you're good now then i would go ahead and put some cute earrings in. pay no mind to your first answer. he doesn't know anything. besides, it's more like six weeks, not months.|`|M6r8uMRlaa	deffantally not, i say if you want to be asfe 1 month or not even your ears don't need that much time to heal. If your putting in dangly earings make sure there clean. If your going to wear these earings once and change them a few days later then don't worry about it cos that will infect them.|`|218b808e7b15d3ab6f134c62bbbafc16aa	I wore my gold studs for six months. When the hole within the piercing heals, you may wear dangling earrings.     Most dangling earrings do not have gold or stainless steel reinforcements. The nickel can cause minor irritation.    Please wait 6 months for the healing process to be complete. You may wear clip ons that interchange into studded earrings after the six months are complete.|`|8iQFdkIhaa	I wore big dangly earrings like 2 months after I got my ears pierced and had no problems what so ever!|`|L5sfYvU7aa	Well... no. Maybe after a week after your ears feel all comfortable to studs then you can wear dangly ones. I only waited 3 days haha. =]|`|RMh0a3DSaa	No way i only waited like 3/4 months. Just wait until your ears feel like nothing happened and then you can.
5NitHFxKaa	How did you acquire this "Blackberry Curve"?|`|91TxX375aa	Depending on how long you've had it, you should see if there is a warranty in your contract or something.  If there is, you could return it to the store where you got it and ask for a replacement.  They'll give you the same SIM card too.

BUt now I work out loads and loads, i walk and run a lot, bicycle 10 kms everyday, in addition to squates and lunges. So i think ive developed some muscles there. Now it doesnt ache so much.|`|Jn0S7yXyaa	Yeah, I used to have a flat butt, but I have noticed that all the fat is going there these days!|`|KPsWriOOaa	Never really had an issue with lacking fat in that area! haha

But if your thin hair, just stick with layers!  And if your like fringes.  Then you can get a full straight one, or a side one.  I have a side one at the moment and it looks pretty good.  Because i cut it on the sides so you can't see my forehead at all  ^__^  And maybe a colouring?
BNBMdUDTaa	It totally depends. I've seen prom dresses for several hundred dollars, but I also got a prom-like dress from Macy's for ten dollars (it was massively on sale). Since you probably aren't going to wear it that often, you probably shouldn't spend too much money on it (unless you're super rich or something like that :))    And yes, a lot of prom dresses are short. It really depends on what your school is like-- at some schools prom is more formal with a lot of long evening gowns, but at others most of the people wear shorter dresses. Personally I had a really long prom dress and I felt a little out of place b/c a bunch of people had short ones.    Hope that helps!
AA10849332	its just going to take some time.    it would be a really good idea for you to go to a piercer and have them look at your lobes to see just how much damage you DID do since that can affect your ability to stretch larger in the future.    2 weeks is way too short of a tie period to wait between stretches. You need to wait at least a month.     if you don't want to have to start completely over on the stretching process, you need to make sure that you at least have your 10s back in if not a pair of 12s depending on how much blowout there is.      sea salt soaks will help but other than that you're just going to have to wait it out|`|xzNr2RmIaa	Sounds like a blowout to me.  Despite how much you want to keep them in, take them out completely or your ear will be messed up forever unless you wanna get it surgically fixed.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	Yes it does sound like a blow out.  You stretched way too soon, by they way. (You need to wait at least a month before going up a size).  Put the 10g jewelry back in, and leave them alone for a few months. Keep doing sea salt soaks and hot compresses, and if you're ear doesn't get better, go talk to a piercer.|`|eXJOdwzcaa	i agree with the person below me.    i had a friend that blew his out REALLY bad and he wrapped dental floss around the blow out part so it would cut off the circulation, then cut it off.  i know it sounds disgusting, but it actually looked alot better after his healed from cutting it off. he said it didnt hurt too bad that gauging it hurt worse.  i dont know if i recommend that or not.|`|BVyhflTnaa	If you just put the 10g ones back in, I'd say take them down to a 12g.  Insert the jewelery from back to front, and SSS every day.  I've also heard of ppl massaging their lobes with emu oil or jojoba oil to help re-absorb a blowout.

9EdJHqKHaa	Cold sores are a type of herpes. They are contagious and once you get them there is no cure. It is a viral infection that last a few days to a month and then it will go into remission, reoccurring occasionally. Check out WebMD to learn more.|`|agR89OPtaa	Yes you can get herpes from kissing someone with a cold sore.  You will keep getting them for the rest of your life.  It is a virus that will erupt into blisters and sores.  You can thank your boyfriend for giving you something you will never get rid of.  There is medication that will help the sore go away sooner, ask your doctor.|`|fscgp7iFaa	Yes you can a cold sore is a form of herpies that is contagious.|`|nMgsLNAAaa	yes.  Its called Hepatitis C. You have a disease.(albeit a very common non life threatening one)    Next time leave out the personal info. NOBODY GIVES A SH7T|`|zR0Dcdevaa	Yeah, you definitely can.  It's a form of the herpes virus, and it's very contageous.  You're a carrier now, and they'll likely come and go for the rest of your life.  You can also give it to other people that you kiss on down the road.  I know.  It sucks.  I get them too.    Now if you want to know how to get rid of them.    Buy some "Abreva" it's expensive but it works FAST to get rid of them.  Also, if you wanna go a cheaper route, taking "L-Lysine" will clear them up.  You can get it at GNC.|`|BTyE1Ou4aa	yes, if one of you have got, or had one when you were making out you can catch them off him, or he can catch them of you... its a pain, i know, i recommend as soon as you feel one coming on put some tea tree oil on it... it works real well|`|tvWm1e4naa	i don't want to ruin your relationship but probably you are not his first or only girl in his case. where did he get his cold sores?  Usually cold sores can be acquired from skin to skin contact including kissing. I might be wrong coz u can also get it from sharing drinks and utensils.  You should avoid having any physical contact with him while he has cold sores because it is most contagious when present. cold sores is caused by a virus called herpes. are you sure it is cold sore/ blister?|`|GMcjx5dFaa	Yes, especially if you're frenchin'!|`|bWMBuNiMaa	yes bcuz the cold sore can be transmitted orally.....|`|Pl7d4EhYaa	well someone has to have one or one of you has to have yhe right type of herpes|`|VR2biZutaa	Yes... cold sores are actually a strain of the herpes virus.|`|CAfpMvmgaa	ABSOLUTELY! only if there is an out break at the time you kissed that person.     also a cold sore is a form of Herpes! so once you have it, you have it.     Cold sores are a very common illness caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).    The disorder is characterised by groups of fluid-filled blisters which appear on red swollen areas of the skin or on the mucous membranes. The areas can be tender and painful. The blisters heal without scarring but have a tendency to recur.        * There are two types of herpes simplex virus.        * HSV-1, which is the most common type, usually causes cold sores (oral herpes). HSV-2 usually causes genital herpes. But both types can infect any area of the skin or mucous membranes.        * Approximately 80 per cent of the adult population have antibodies against HSV-1 in their blood.        * Around 25 per cent of the adult population have antibodies against HSV-2.    What causes the virus to be contracted?    The virus can only be transmitted by close personal contact such as kissing. Most people will have come into contact with the virus between the ages of three and five but will not show any symptoms until after puberty.    HSV invades the cells of the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin, causing fluid-filled blisters to appear. The virus travels from the epidermis along the nerve paths to the roots of the nerves where it becomes inactive.    A weakening of the body's defences, due to a severe cold for example, can lead to a reactivation of the virus and a return of the blisters.|`|5sNOUCRKaa	YES YES why would you want to Kiss someone with a sore on there mouth. keep putting ice cubes on sore for about 2 min at a time that will freeze them and know more kissing.|`|czsXcx3Zaa	you can pick it up when you were a kid. Most people who are infected with the herpes simplex virus (cold sores) got it during their preschool years, most likely from close contact with someone who has it or getting kissed by an adult with the virus.    Although a person who has the herpes simplex virus doesn't always have sores, the virus stays in the body and there's no permanent cure.|`|wKg4vZbuaa	yes, cold sores are contageous.|`|lJO1xbg6aa	Yes you can..just from the skin to skin contact.|`|BNLVl0Jpaa	yes you can|`|xdTNcHvMaa	yes you can even get them from using the same cup or cig or anything from mouth to mouth contact|`|22ixkZXSaa	no, but you can get the HERPES so watch out|`|L5tWiYOFaa	Yes they are transmitted via the exchange of bodily fluids.|`|cqtrmpvxaa	have you ever considered the idea that he may have herpes? it's called the kissing disease after all|`|yptfd3sIaa	Yes, if this is a real 'cold sore,' you've just contracted the highly contagious and incurable Human Herpes Virus 1. (Not HHV 2, the sexual sort.)|`|bmlIg6vRaa	yes you can, cold sores are a form of the herpes virus. they are completely benign, even they are a pain. as long as you dont start moving to oral sex while you have cold sores you should be fine. there are medicines out there to help cold sores heal faster such as abreva.|`|7X8nQQSFaa	Yeah you can. Because when you or your boyfriend has a cold sore. The germs go onto their lips and create a new one. Its more gross then getting a normal cold sore. hope this helped? =D|`|tB14zSSnaa	you can pass it on like a cold or  anything but just buy kissing a baby on the head you can give them cold sores it might not appear for years it can never go away, ocne you have it , you have it for good.|`|h6Vi2TvHaa	yeah you can...  : (|`|BscNuCTHaa	yes, because cold sores are actually contagious.  so he is giving them to you.|`|HReBWI6qaa	Yes.  You both are coming into direct contact with the viruses that are causing the cold sores.  If either of you have one wait it out.  I know it's hard, but it's better to wait it out than to give the other one pain (I used to get them a lot and it always sucked).|`|LKB8oSfaaa	You can get cold sores from kissing. He must be kissing somebody with cold sores and rubbing that bacteria on you. Cause now your getting them. You should stop kissing him.|`|IO8jA9q2aa	Absolutely. Kissing is one of the best way to get cold sores. Cold sores are a form of herpes and and kissing someone while they are having an outbreak will pretty much guarantee that you will get them too. Cold sores can be caused by any strain of the herpes virus and what's worse is it is possible to get genital herpes from giving oral sex while having a cold sore. Please don't let anyone tell you that is not true because it is a fact. Once you get a cold sore you are stuck with the virus forever. Most of the time they aren't to much of a problem and outbreaks are minimal but if you they get out of hand you can get treatment for them though most people don't have to.|`|yy8qhRhraa	DUH yeah u can get cold sores.

jUuYMVqiaa	idk what that first girl was saying about surgically yes. cause thats all wrong. if you leave them out for a week or even a few weeks they will go  back to normal. i had my ears stretched to a zero gauge an in about 4 weeks they went back to the normal size of an earing....which is kindaaa like what happened to your ears just not so extreme.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	dont wear earrings for a while, you pretty much stretched your ear, like when people stretch their ears to wear plugs. so stop wearing earrings for a while and they should go back to the normal size within a few weeks at the most|`|qh0YrhN5aa	Surgically yes. If your wearing a pair of earrings constantly...twisting the backs every few days to make sure that they don't adhere to your skin is the way to go. Good luck
M5ZkTY9baa	If you're going for something quick I would go with pressed or loose powder, and maybe a little bit of cover up (cover up stick) for any dark marks or acne that you want to cover up. Sounds like you have good skin so you won't need it much!|`|HEjVqjDgaa	Pressed powder will give you a nice light coverage - liquid takes longer and can be heavy, concealer - dont wanna use that on your cheeks, its too heavy, loose powder- is good for setting foundation, but not much use on its own. You can even consider mineral foundation...but I would stick with a pressed powder compact - get one with a mirror so you can carry it with you and touch up during the day!|`|V2F8YCa2aa	Loose concealer, loose powder, loose natural colors of eye shadow, other neutral colors...|`|AMKN8Qxraa	mineral makeup i think is the easiest to apply its heaps quick   i use everyday minerals its heaps cheap if you get a custom kit as well   its a loose powder and it covers my uneven skin tone heaps well :)|`|vyrA1F6naa	My skin is the same way. I have a loose powder (Bare Minerals) that takes no longer than 1-2 minutes to apply, and I get compliments on my skin a lot (I don't think people can even tell I use makeup). But if you get a loose powder, make sure you have a really good brush otherwise it could look cakey.|`|C5eKUi2Xaa	If you know how to do your makeup right, it shouldn't take you long at all! It takes me about 10-15 minutes to do my whole routine. I wear a lot! Mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow, concealer, liquid foundation, loose powder, blush, and lipgloss. You just need to find a routine that works for you.    But if you want quick face powder to apply, they have ones where the brush comes attatched. So you just rub the brush over your face and the powder comes out of the brush. I've never used one but I think that's the quickest way.

46465463e9a9114f6aea1c68a978589daa	Try this: wet a washcloth with the hottest tap water you can stand.  Wring it out and put it on your nose.  The hot water will open the pores to clean them up.  Gently wash your nose then with whatever soap you prefer.  When you are finished, use cold water to close the pores.  Dabbing your nose with rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball will help too.  Don't overdue it though.  If you clean your nose like that every day you'll see a difference.|`|fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	Blackheads can happen to anyone, no matter what your skin type. Blackheads are caused by oil in your skin that gets caught and expands in the pores. Oxidizing from exposure to the air, the oil actually turns black.    what works for some people might not work for everyone but here are some things that you can consider.~    First, stop the problem before it starts. Use noncomedogenic, oil-free, water-based skin-care products. (Noncomedogenic means the products were laboratory tested and approved by the FDA not to clog pores and cause blackheads.)    If you change your skin-care routine and still get blackheads, speak to a dermatologist about getting a prescription for Retin-A, which is a strong exfoliant that opens pores, sloughs off dead skin and cleans out blackheads.    If all else fails, a dermatologic facial performed at a dermatologist's office involves a prescription-strength acid that gets rid of dead layers of skin and the use of surgical instruments to extract the blackheads.    Blackheads are a problem that should be treated by a dermatologist. But, if you want to try an over-the-counter product, a lot of people rave about Biore Pore Perfect Strips, which are supposed to lift out blackheads on your nose, forehead and chin.    Hope this helps~|`|AA12036538	I need the answer too|`|ac28660b20a63e218793a30208dc9c9faa	I have posted home remedies on black heads you can follow those home remedies to get rid of them the are at http://www.beautycare4all.blogspot.com . don't worry they are free.|`|ef5db42bf93cbc496dc9de8edf640fe3aa	youre going to have to spend money. p.s. most of neutrogena and stuff like that doesnt work. try JOEY blackhead peel. its awesome and under $20. online or at ULTA|`|85fc3d624e1ccfc11f5649244c732c85aa	Go to Origins and get a new face care line its like 20 bucks for the tester kit and you will love it!!Its made by a dermatologist and it works really well!Good luck....|`|AA10904776	ME TOO...GOSH DAMN THESE LITTLE UGLY SPOTS!|`|a911d3469f391ed14766d9fcb3964f24aa	I dont think there's a "Miracle Cure" for this little enemies, but a very good cleaning routine must help you control considerably this  the problem.

Her favourite scented bath salts, bath oil, or foam bath - take her shopping!!!!  then get a few nice soft and smooth river stones to put between her toes so u can paint them a nice colour afterwards (if she's into that), otherwise it's really relaxing for the feet and toes to have little pebbles (flat ones-not sharp) between your toes.  It stretches out the little muscles in the toes and feet and relieves tension there.  Nice touch in or out of the bath with the pebbles between toes (paint afterwards!!!!)    Candles, big, small or floating if mom is experimental or doesn't make an ocean wave in the bath!!!!  don't push her for an answer.  Then have a nice body butter or mosituriser from the body shop, again let her choose her fragrance.  You can go and buy this for her, but my feeling is that she'll appriciate the gesture anyway.      Give her a bath menu and set up the candles, run the bath for her (if she'll let you) and put the petals in the bath (it looks and feels oh and scents are great!!!!), and let her do the rest.    Suggest some music, or let her just be quiet in her own space.    Enjoy!!!!  There are lots of ideas if you google.com it.  Choose your favourite spa bath recepies from websites!!

Es una idea que nos mete la sociedad; pensalo as: los pechos son para amamantar, es decir, producir leche cuando tengas un hijo...Si es por esttica, yo no recomendara una operacin...lo que pods hacer, si ests demasiado desesperada por aumentar tus bustos, entonces us push up...Te lo sacs y pons cuando quieras.

Lo importante es que ests sana y te aceptes como eres. Recuerda que hay varios tipos de mujeres y cada una es especial, nica y maravillosa tan solo por ser mujer.  Todos los tipos de senos son bonitos y tienen sus ventajas y desventajas. Por ejemplo los peque?os se caen menos y se mantienen mas tiempo firmes porque la piel se estira menos y es menos el peso que tienen que soportar, cuando corres no se te mueve para todos lados y lucen bien.

70542c97804a873aad3ec849898c5711aa	This is what you need to do. First, TRY TRY TRY to cut out all kinds of sweets. Also, eliminate soda (yes...even diet soda). In addition to this, it's also important to start off the day properly. Many people think that they need to eat ONLY "breakfast foods" in the morning. Things like toast, pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, cereal, etc. This is wrong, you can eat a nice grilled salmon or chicken fillet in the morning with a side of green vegetables or 100% whole wheat toast. Also, there are egg whites (try 3 egg whites and 1 whole egg for pleasant taste, scrambled). There is also oatmeal (always original). DO NOT purchase the flavored oatmeal which is usually packaged in boxed envelopes. These are high in sugar !!!     Don't forget, you need a decent protein intake.....lay low on the carbs. Stay away from the whites: white bread and white rice. Go brown: brown rice and whole wheat bread. Drink water!!!! At least 8-10 glasses a day. Tea (gren tea is great) can be used as a substitute for water if you like.     Finally, EXERCISE!!!!! Ok, you have a busy schedule.....so does everyone else. You need to either wake-up earlier or FIT IT into your schedule. Jog in place for 15 minutes in 30 second intervals, do push-ups, run around your block. Just get your heart-rate up for at least 30 minutes a day. It's not impossible to do, even with a busy schedule.    Let me warn you, there are NO PRODUCTS that will help you lose weight. Anything that claims to do so is simply a marketing gimmick.     However, if you're too lazy or unmotivated to practice any of the above suggestions, then try not eating. Don't forget about puking.....it's pretty effective, but you may lose your hair and burn the enamel right off of your teeth.     You're welcome.|`|98cae6e33c2cb74735dac9feda52a732aa	It takes weeks, months and years to become overweight. Don't try to lose your weight overnight !!!  I've heard that eating "mini-meals" six times a day is a good way to lose weight. It's all about eating good healthy foods and PORTION  CONTROL ....keep it small. When you eat often, your body won't go into the hibernation mode and hold onto stored fat. You WILL, however, have to increase your amount of exercise. Start out slowly and increase the time each week.  You don't want to over-do it.  If you get uncomfortably sore, there will be a good chance you will want to quit exercising.  You have to be realistic and make all this a "life-change" in the way you eat and exercise. I wish you the inner strength to do this safely and successfully so you can become the healthy person you want to be!  Good luck!|`|db8530abc15d1f7914b4d49211b22e87aa	Its free--close your mouth after eating half your normal amount of food. NO SNACKS--except raw veggies. NO SOFT DRINKS.

GL :)|`|45972580dd86784131b1ce2b9961690caa	The best thing to loose weight is to walk walk walk and drink more water or use honey if you want to use honey contect me.|`|9f98c349e6c1e6e22ad56917628f4da8aa	A fast paced 20 minute walk every day in the morning swinging your arms.  This will both burn calories and speed up your metabolism at the beginning of the day, causing you to burn more calories throughout the day.  If you're going to eat fast food or other junk-type foods, do so long before evening, so you have the opportunity to burn it off.  If you need a more radical approach that will work even faster, do another 20 minute walk in the evening swinging your arms and carrying some light weights.  Don't do diet plans.  The ones that are designed for fast results tend to have a bounce back that you regain more weight than when you began.  The plans that are meant for longer term weight loss are designed that you stay on them forever -  or else gain back more weight than when you started.  The human body is designed to be able to eat a lot of fats and even sugars, but not processed sugars and the body must be kept active.  Pro football players are famous for eating HUGE amounts of total garbage:  multiple pizzas, 20 hamburgers at a sitting, but because they are so active, they are able to maintain an athletic body type.  The key is to exercise and that exercise need not be anything crazy, just 20 minutes a day every day and most people will lose weight over time.    Hope this helps!

I'm American, but i dont think there is too much difference between our hair. but if you want to leave it dark stay inside more or in the shade or just dye it black, but i think that if it looks good or you like it, keep it. also in  Missouri we also call it sun-kissed,or bronzed. there is some others but i cant remember all of them.|`|AA10625237	It's from the sunlight.

Look at african americans who go into sunlight everyday without protecting their hair. If you're really worried about it, go out and buy a product with a uva and uvb inhibitor, a sunblock for hair persay. After you start using the product, your hair will redarken slowly. If you want to get brash about it, you can dye it black before you start using the protectant, they sell wonderful hair dye made especcially for asian hair at sally's|`|fab39c596551c750bdf3ee1c56b1345aaa	no its not impossible you could be stressed or it could just change colers by the seasons like most white ppls hair or like mine my hair changes to black in the winter and light brown in the summer or early fall really creappy huh  dont freak over your not gonna go bald if you are then you can officially freak out

G5yQtHs9aa	If you want it to be less gooey, pour a few drops of nail polish remover or acetone into the bottle.|`|KPsWriOOaa	I've never tried that...sounds odd. I usually just put a little bit of nail polish remover in the nail polish bottle. Works for me! :)|`|D7QdvWYDaa	No, don't ever heat nail polish in the bottle in a microwave. Nail polish is a flammable liquid and if the liquid reaches it's flash point due toi the temperature of the liquid, the bottle may explode and worse, damage the microwave and cause serious damage to whoever is near by.     The principle of microwave radiates works on the amount of moisture in the food, product, etc. Just like any metal placed inside with spark.If there is any moisture it will heat up. That's why sometimes they recommend adding a small amount of water to food and it can heat up coffee in a coffee cup.     Which brand of polish is it. If it's OPI it will have a danger flammable liquid marking on the bottle or the box because of European Standards.    If you want to make the polish easier to use, just roll the bottle in the palms of your hands.|`|PMK86fHoaa	NOT a good idea.|`|htBHCNDtaa	Heat makes nailpolish dry up. If you want nailpolish to last longer and work better keep it in a cool place away from the sun or the fridge.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	i wouldnt do that it could get messsy    try putting a cup of water in the micro wave for like 5 minutes and then stick the nail polish in the hot water. that might help make it easier to use and less clumpy:]|`|KbmP0xWhaa	well, it depends how long you put it in for. if you put it in for about a minute it bubbles up and overflows from underneath the lid, also it can crack the glass/plastic and it goes everywhere - my advise is dont do it. i made that mistake before :P    hope i helped :]
Ao9xL1pvaa	If it is too far back it will not be able to heal.  After 6 weeks and mine still hadn't healed, I took it out and let it close.  About a year later, I had a different place pierce it.

If you don't like it, most salons will give you a full refund when you return the product    Most salon brands contain  Sodium laureth sulfate, the gentlest surfactant and best for your hair.    Some salons will guarantee your color if you use their products.    Salon products are more concentrated. You can purchase an 8oz. bottle of salon shampoo and with daily washing, it should last you minimum of  6 weeks. OTC brands aren't as concentrated causing you to use more shampoo. In the long run, you aren't saving money.    Salon shampoos contain higher quality protein based conditioners. These conditioners penetrate deeper into the hair shaft and lock in moisture.

La bellezza  un fatto soggettivo e cambia a seconda delle epoche, mentre alcune cose rimangono fisse. Ad esempio per molti secoli la donna grassa  stata considerata bella, ora vige il criterio della magrezza, anche se a volte riappare il concetto di donna formosa, che riporta il "grasso  bello" in avanti. Cosa sono le cose della bellezza femminile immutabili in tutto il mondo? secondo una parte degli etologi, gli uomini valutano le donne a partire dalle caviglie, a salire fino agli occhi ed al nasino. (Le donne sono convinte che gli uomini guardano...gli occhi). Come mai? Bene si deve far riferimento alla necessit nella preistoria di sopravvivere e di potersi riprodurre. Allora si comincia dalle caviglie, devono essere snelle non gonfie, significa che si pu correre, le gambe poi, se sono diritte e non magre vuol dire che la donna  capace di correre e camminare, se poi si innestano in fianchi larghi, vuol dire che la donna partorir senza sforzo, se ha un bel sedere, vuol dire che ha riserve di grasso per sopravvivere nella carestia, se poi ha una pelle lucente e trasparente (anche le negre hanno la pelle cosi) vuol dire che sintetizza la vitamina d, il calcio, e quindi far figli non rachitici, il seno, ovvio, sar capace di allattare i figli, e poi si guardano gli occhi ed il nasino....Ovvio che le bionde, chiare di pelle e con un bel seno, fianchi larghi, siano le preferite dagli uomini. Ma le "bionde" intese come donne dalla pelle trasparente, bel seno, fianchi e sedere a posto ci sono in tutte le razze. Quini se ne deduce che ogni uomo di ogni razza trover fra le donne pi vicine a lui le donne pi belle. E che se ammireranno le donne di quei paesi che pi diffuso hanno il capello biondo i fianchi ecc... nessun problema. Ecco perch le donne hanno imparato a mettersi i tacchi, a tingersi i capelli di chiaro, ad usare il trucco, e poi con la palestra con l'alimentazione ecc. si mimetizzano con le pi ammirate dagli uomini. In un paio di generazioni scompaiono le donne meno amate. Guardate l'Italia. Vi ricordate le brune baffute di pelle scura che esistevano negli anni 50? sono scomparse, non le trovate nemmeno nei paesini della Sicilia. E in Giappone sono scomparse le ragazze senza seno e senza sopracciglia, e ci sono le bionde.....  Insomma cerca attorno a te e troverai le donne pi belle del mondo, e comunque in tutto il mondo ci sono le donne belle.

6fefa1374c6e4aeb4e3debcad2321a6baa	Worth is a relative measure, so it is difficult to assign a dollar value to the largest and "most perfect" blue diamond in the world. Some sources value the 45.52 carat rock at a quarter of a billion dollars ($250,000,000), while others quote a more conservative figure as low as $200,000.   Much of the stone's value comes from its long and storied history beginning in India where it was said to have adorned a religious idol. A French merchant named Jean Baptiste Tavernier purchased the stone, and in turn, sold it to France's King Louis XIV.     The king had the stone recut and reset, and it remained in his possession until it was stolen during the French Revolution. The gem disappeared for many years before resurfacing in 1839 in the possession of one Henry Philip Hope. Hope, who lent his name to the jewel, purchased the diamond for $90,000. After his death, the diamond passed through a variety of hands before it was purchased by Pierre Cartier.     In 1912, Cartier sold the stone to eccentric American heiress Evalyn McLean for $185,000. McLean owned the famous gem until her death (although she did hock the jewel frequently when she ran out of funds).     Jeweler to the stars Harry Winston bought the Hope diamond from the McLean estate in 1949, and it toured the world for a number of years. Then in 1958, Winston donated the Hope diamond to the Smithsonian Institute, its present home.     The jewel is often reported to bring bad luck to those who possess it. Cartier started the tale of the stone's curse in order to intrigue Evalyn McLean into purchasing the diamond. The various tragedies Evalyn encountered during her lifetime only fueled the superstition. Evalyn, however, held a more pragmatic view of the stone's power saying, "What tragedies have befallen me might have occurred had I never seen or touched the Hope Diamond. My observations have persuaded me that tragedies, for anyone who lives, are not escapable."|`|34078381173055a64a03d485efca688aaa	Don't know but I saw it at the Smithsonian and it was freakin huge and blue.

21ad2e63bc55efde9c7b9c20e6efff75aa	You really should get that done professionally......I have black hair too...I radically changed it's color in the 90's....It really damaged my hair.....Now I am satisfied with high & low lights....It looks almost light brown & it's healthier.  If you lighten your hair, remember that when you style it with heat, etc. your hair will dry out.....Also, when your roots start to show you will be in  an endless cycle of dying your hair.|`|14638179760d9ec0f0284caecad9df4daa	Please! Please! Let a professional do this if you want to lighten your hair. I myself have black hair. I went to beauty school, and while I was there, decided to bleach my hair. It was an awful long process and I wouldn't do it unless you have very healthy hair. At first my hair turned orange (no kidding), but we kept working with it and bleaching it. That was why it was such a long process, it didn't damage my hair as much as I thought it would though. After we got it to the shade I wanted (which was not orange) it looked really good. Good Luck!|`|AA10507997	I VE DONE THAT AND IF YOUR HAIR COLOUR I MEAN THE BLACK IS NOT NATURAL, YOU'LL GET FOR THE FIRST 3 OR 4 VISITS AN ORANGE/REDDISH SHADE.TODAY YOU CAN USE ANOTHER MIXTURE BUT ONLY PROFSSIONALS HAVE IT.ITS NOT BLEACH.IT GIVES YOU THE SAME RESULT BUT IT DOESNT HURT YOUR HAIR.NOW DONT GO FOR LIGHT SHADES OR ELSE YOU'LL BE SPENDING AS MUCH MONEY PER MONTH AS FOR PAYING THE LOAN OF A CAR.IT WILL LOOK DIRTY IF YOU LEAVE IT GROWING UP WHEN YOU'RE BROKE.SO TRY A CHOCOLATE BROWN WITH SOME CARAMEL LIGHTS IN IT.

YkovI0aEaa	yes, because the dye has chemicals and if your hair is weak, your hair will fall out.  Also, it's really unhealthy for your hair.|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	Its definatly not going to be healthy for your hair thats for sure, but your hair may just get weaker and if you refrain from straightening it everyday then you should be fine.

1Bj5nJOfaa	use patrolium gelly.  very cheap and comes with SO much  and gets rid of makeup really easy.  plus, it takes the absolute LONGEST time to run out.|`|kogfFMgmaa	just buy makeup remover.  and then u put it on a cotton ball and u just rub|`|KbmP0xWhaa	well, i know this may sound really weird but you can use baby moisturizer from johnson johnson, its for nappy rashes but it works great on removing eye make-up and because its a moisturizer it doesnt hurt at all, all you have to do is apply some to a face washer OR a tissue wipe it on the areas you want the makeup removed and then get a clean tissue or face washer and wipe it away do it three or four times and then get face cleanser and wash your face.    hope it works for you - it worked excellent on me! goodluck :]|`|C5eKUi2Xaa	Ouch that sucks. You have to be VERY gentle when taking off your eye makeup. My mascara comes off with just water, so I get my fingers wet and then I basically use my fingers and sweep my eyelashes. It's like I'm applying mascara. But with my fingers. I use the side of my finger, not the tip. And then I just use My Clean & Clear face wash to gently rub on my eyelids to take the eyeshadow and eyeliner off. This alwaqys works for me. Hope this helps!|`|uH1frnsTaa	WHAT I USE WHEN I DON'T HAVE MAKE UP REMOVER IS VASELINE IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC. PUT A LITTLE OVER EYE LID AND WITH A TISSUE PAPER OR TOILET PAPER WIPE IT OFF FROM OUT TO IN. HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|PNIihEDXaa	yikes sorry it hurts so much! sometimes when im doing my makeup my eyeliner or mascara gets in (just a little bit) so nothing like your case here i think... but i clean my hands and gently touch the black stuff and it comes out. its probably not the safest but it does the trick! as for makeup remover try loreal gel mousse make up remover or something else from the range. its like a cleanser but it takes off your make up :) is it also possible the cloths that remove makeup were expired or possibly you rubbed too hard? maybe you were allergic to something
c9469a0c25b4c415d92edc506376c2afaa	My favourite is Bank, dunno whether there are any in London (I'm living in Wales).

kogfFMgmaa	i swam with newly pierced ears with my friend who had newly pierced ears and we were fine|`|WVuI07Hjaa	wrong. your ears will be fine.|`|KF2LHfN2aa	I got my ears pierced last year and me and my friend were wondering the same thing! Yes you can go swimming. Make sure to disinfect your ears with rubbing alcohol before and after you go in the pool by pouring some on a cotton ball and rubbing over the hole. That's exactly what i did and I discovered it to be perfectly fine!|`|CWW0V7kOaa	There's a small amount of chlorine in most pools to keep the bugs out. If anything it will do them good.    If you couldn't swim before they were pierced, you can add balloons to them to help you float.|`|RAp45UmUaa	well, they may be right, but i doubt the infection would be bad enough to keep you away from swimming, so... dont listen to your friend, have fun, deal with the infection later. haha|`|ZaadvJAXaa	You should be alright.  If it worries you too much, just dab a cotton ball soaked it alcohol after swimming.|`|lJHPiAa5aa	i think your friends are right|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	I would not recommend swimming with newly pierced ears.  The chlorine can aggravate the new skin and can cause infections.|`|IStGqIWBaa	Wrong. I swim all the time with my new pierced ears nothing ever happened.
amxxZr69aa	In my experience, I learned to tweeze that area or thread it (I learned how to thread on youtube). I tried waxing but it didn't work for me. My skin is light and every time I waxed my upper lip, it would leave my skin lighter than my skin color. It was very noticeable. My mom told me to put make up so it would all be the same color but it didn't work. By the time my upper lip went back to my regular skin color, it was time to wax again. Does that make sense?    Hope that helps in any way!|`|pQwslQWuaa	i use nair upper lip hair remover it does work and u can do it in the privacy of ur own home , u can get it from most shops|`|vtpzayeTaa	OMG! THREADING!! if u dont no what it is, look it up on youtube. but i can tell u what it does: best of all! YOU CAN DO IT AT HOME!  also, all you need is thread, like what you use for sewing. all you do is take thread and tie a know to make a circle that is big enought for ur hands to fit in it and then u twist id so that it has some twists in the middle so it looks like a bow. and then , well just look on youtube.  and it does not hurt much and it lasts longer than waxing and it pullls the hair out from tihe root and when this is done regularly, the hair eventually gets thinner. again, look on youtube for a tutorial.
MRwR6eHYaa	ha uhh that's a terrible idea. there is a huge difference between lotion and soap.. lotion doesn't clean you.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	Why not just use body wash?|`|hG9e4nNLaa	It's not soap, it won't clean you.|`|x3AJj3GXaa	find a lotion that makes you smell good without washing it.   And for the shower, find a shower gel that will leave  a nice smell.  you could even find a lotion and the shower gel that are the same brand and smell, that would be awesome! :)|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	You could but I wouldn't.  The lotion will not cleanse your skin like body wash or soap will.  The lotion will also probably leave a residue or oil on your skin that could cause your skin to break out.|`|zMD0VeOmaa	no use soap or body wash to bathe with. you need something with antibacterial ingredients to get clean. otherwise you will stink eventually. trust me.|`|igLsH24Qaa	This is a bad idea.

It sounds like a good idea only after washing though.|`|jx3CYExzaa	seriously? it wont wash the oils off of your body that give that funky smell. its way more expensive. and a little weird|`|JQ2pOeb8aa	Isn't lotion more expensive than body wash?

jUuYMVqiaa	i can only answer one of your questions sorry!!  but ne ways you can change the color because i had a friend with one right by her eye and it was just like this tiny post sticking out of her skin and a little ball the she could screw on and off and change...i believe its like a labret but implanted into your skin.

They are called sculpted nails.  It is the same thing as artificial acrylic nails, but without the tip glued on.  This is hard to do on yourself, so I recommend calling a local salon and asking if they do sculpted nails.|`|71b837d42975c5635133e1728f41838baa	It doesn't make them longer, however it protects them from breaking so they will grow.|`|1dedabd5d4f514278a75751bcecc36e4aa	As Brownie said, they wont make them longer necessarily but they will protect them as they grow.     To make my nails grow, I took prenatal vitamins (hair grew also!) I also did a a soak twice a weak , of mineral water and milk. The calcium and minerals assist nail growth!

be7de9d4ba67319fec1a612620ef7166aa	There is no magic "pill" or shampoo that will make your hair grow faster.  Any product you see that says it'll make your hair grow faster is just a scam, and you would be wasting your money.      To make your hair shinier and healthier looking, I have heard that some people love horse shampoo, believe it or not.  But that isn't going to make your hair grow faster.      The best thing you can do to help your hair grow is to get it trimmed regularly to get rid of dead ends and to take vitamins daily.  Try a multivitamin with E.  Also, you can massage your head in the shower every day.    Hair grows at a rate of about half a milimeter (give or take a little) per day, so that means about half an inch per month.|`|AA11267536	my hair grows quickly.

As for the damage that has already been done, I would apply something external for it. Organic preferably, you may get rid of acne with chemicals but then you end up with dry, wrinkled skin when you're old.  For prevention, take a good multi-vitamin for a while, and Krill/Fish Oil, eat protien/veggies/and fruit. Exercise and drink 8 glasses of water daily.  Think positive.  Oh, also do steam facials once a week.  First wash your face with a gentle cleanser, organic please.  Boil water, add rosemary/basil to the water. Place a big blanket over your body and put the water between you and let the steam open your pores and remove dirt/etc. Do this for about 10 minutes. Then put avocado on your face for dry skin, egg white for dry. remove. Then apply lemon juice, let it dry. Lightly rinse your face.  This makes anyone look supple and glowing.|`|AA11707323	Accutane.

Follow these instructions and do let me know if they worked on your skin. i'm sure they will!      1. Put toothpaste on your pimple before you go to bed, should help reduce swelling overnight. Make sure it is the paste not the gel. One of the most popular acne home remedies.     2. Wash your face twice a day in warm salty water. This should leave your face oil free without aggravating the acne.     3. Apply a paste of fresh methi (fenugreek) leaves over the face every night for 10-15 minutes and washed with warm water. This will prevent acne, pimples, blackheads, and wrinkles.    4. Place strawberry leaves on the acne, the alkalinity helps to reduce the swelling.     5. Extract juice of one lemon and mix with equal quantity of rose water. Apply this mixture on the face and let it stay for about half an hour. Wash the face with fresh water. About 15 days application helps cure acne, pimples and reduces blemishes and scars.     6. Another method is to massage the face with the skin of lemon before washing with lukewarm water.     7. Apply fresh mint juice over the face every night for the treatment of acne, pimples, insect stings, eczema, scabies, & other skin infections.    8. Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. At least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables should be included in your diet. All acne home remedies should include a healthy diet.     9. A couple of garlic cloves, crushed and dabbed on the face 1-2 times a day. One of the smellier acne home remedies!     10. Home face wash for acne: Mix together 1 or 2mls each of the following: witch hazel, tea-tree and sweet fennel essential oils, adding essential oil of geranium for women and essential oil of rosewood for men. Mix with 300mls of water. Shake before use, as the oils will float on top of the water during storage. Dab affected areas with cotton wool two or three times a day. The oils will clean and unclog giving antibiotic-like protection to the skin.     11. Apply fresh lemon juice on the affected area overnight. Wash off with warm water next morning.     12. Use 2-3 tsp. dried basil leaves to 1 cup boiling water. Steep 10-20 minutes. Cool, and apply with cotton ball.    13. Grind orange peel with some water to a paste and apply on affected parts. One of the best acne home remedies.     14. Clean face with cotton wool dipped in rose water 2-3 times a day.     15. Mix 1 teaspoon lemon juice in 1 teaspoon finely ground cinnamon powder and apply on affected areas frequently.     16. Nettle Tea is another solution, this tea has a herb that has some curing power and really helps work wonders on skin problems. Drink four cups a day to get the full benefit of one of the most powerful acne home remedies. Get nettle products here.     17. Aloe Vera juice applied twice a day can greatly speed up the healing of acne lesions. You can buy Aloe Vera at vitacost.com    18. Another lotion that uses bee propolis extract may also be effective. Mix eight ounces of water and 11 drops of bee propolis extract. One of the acne home remedies which has been proven effective with many people.     19. Some herbal acne home remedies...   Burdock leaf tea.   Lavender essential oil (mix 1:10 with water)   Tincture of calendula flowers.   Tea tree essential oil (mix 1:10 with water)   Liquefy cabbage leaves with witch hazel, strain and add two drops of lemon oil. Use as a lotion.     20. Ice down the acne before bed, by morning it should be noticeably less swollen. Works best on larger pimples that have not yet formed a head.     21. Take vitamin B5 and zinc supplements daily to strengthen the skin's resistance to acne.     22. Mix mint juice with turmeric powder and apply on affected area. Leave for 15-30 minutes and wash off with lukewarm water.     23. Mix some vinegar and salt in a bowl. Pour a little bit in your hand and rub it on the pimples. Soak a face towel in it and dab it on the bumps. Leave it on for 15-20 minutes and rinse it off.     24. Blend cucumber and make a paste. Apply this as a mask on your face and leave it for 1/2 hour and then rinse. This refreshes your skin and prevents acne.     25. Mix corn flour with egg white and apply on your face. Let is dry completely for 1/2 hour. Dip your hands in warm water and massage your face and wash off. This when repeated regularly gives you a smooth skin.     26. Mix sandalwood paste with rosewater and apply on the face. Rinse off after 30 minutes.     27. Essential oil face mask for acne: Use a mask base powder, such as fuller's earth or kaolin powder. Use distilled or filtered water to make a paste. Mix 1 heaped teaspoon of base powder to 3 drops of essential oil. Add approximately 2 tablespoons of the water in, to make a fluid yet balanced paste. Essential oils to add in the mask either separately or try smaller amounts together; cypress oil 1 drop, lemon oil 2 drops, sage oil 1 drop.     28.

But if Proactiv isn't you you should try to find a cleanser that has salycic acid that dries out the acne and it will shrink and eventually go away. And also don't use greasy moistrizer because that blocks the pores. You still can eat greasy food because that doesn't have anything to do with acne. Also before I go you should drink alot of water because that flushs out the toxins. Don't worry if you still have acne after summer is over because the picture people who take your picture can  edit it out of the pictures. I think it is like 5.00 more.

Ich hatte es immer regelmaessig bekommen. Jetzt ist alles vorueber. Ich achte mehr auf meine Ernaehrung.    Aber wie oben schon erwaehnt, kann es auch andere Ursachen haben. Frage doch einfach Deinen Arzt beim naechsten Besuch.|`|a96d9c29657d2897034a91b9fb8a3cb6aa	Hatte ich selbst schon mal. Kein Kalcium- sondern Eisenmangel! Im Apotheken gibt es Tabletten oder man ist vermehrt grnes Gemse. Besonders Eisenhaltig ist Spinat|`|5ca3d9cf3426037c78a99a789af5a4a5aa	wei?e Streifen auf den Fingern?glen sind kein Anlass zur Sorge, geschweige denn solltest du deshalb in die Apotheke laufen und Nahrungsmittelerg?nzungen zu dir fhren- alles unn?tiger Quatsch! Beobachte den/die Streifen...normalerweise wachsen die mit dem Nagel wieder aus. Dann war es lediglich eine Kalzifikation, also quasi das Gegenteil von nem Mangel. Das passiert immer wieder und das kannste auch bei einigen Menschen auf den Z?hnen sehen, die haben auf den Z?hnen hellwei?e Stellen. Das sind auch Kalkanreicherungen, die aber an den Z?hnen nicht rauswachsen k?nnen und somit bleibend sind, bzw. vom Zahnarzt oberfl?chlich abgeschliffen werden k?nnen, falls dies gewnscht wird.     Wenn du allerdings tiefere Streifungen, bzw. Rillen in den N?geln findest und du dich zudem noch "krank" fhlst, sofort zum Arzt, da diese Nagelumformung wirklich einen Mangelzustand, bzw. eine Organfehlfunktion aufzeigen k?nnen, die oft die Leber betreffen.    Aber ich denke, du hast lediglich so wei?e kleine Streifen in den N?geln, die wieder von alleine verschwinden.    Wie sich ein Kalziummangel zeigt, kannste ganz schnell ausprobieren- einfach mal Handsplen. Das Splmittel w?scht Kalzium aus und deine wei?en Fingernagelenden verlieren ihre wei?e Farbe und werden ganz weich und fahl.|`|96236f206666b48b43fa08ca07b15419aa	Mangel an Vitaminen.T?glich Obst essen oder in der Apotheke KApseln anfordern,dei den Bereich des t?glichen Bedarfs abdecken.Die Sonne kann aber auch helfen|`|9acab93dd1ffbc0fc8ddc4eed5c9a9c9aa	du holst dir am besten kieselstein-erde.tabletten...schmecken nach nix und hilft echt...wei? es aus erfahrung|`|c72b4c44e6da092865aa966ff5b27d27aa	Bio H Thin aus der Apotheke ist gut fr Haare und N?gel auf pflanzenbasis, schadet also nicht dem K?rper

God is watching us|`|AA11791117	For starters be yourself!  Guys are a dime a dozen as I have learned the hard way and a good personality is worth more than a dozen dimes.  Good looks are not always that great!  Trust me, I am a 32 year old woman raised in Virginia Beach who is told constantly how pretty I am yet at the same time most guys just want to get down a girl's pants regardless so please be careful!!   I have a wonderful boyfriend to whom I am marrying, yet often he comes across as jealous because of my appearance and it gets rather difficult at times. Trust me if this guy really is interested, then he will like you for who you are and the things that you have in common and not simply based on appearance.  That would be remotely shallow and that is not a pond that you would want to be caught in.   I use to think that because I didn't have big boobs that I was not liked but that is not the case.  It is more about personality than anything else that make a person special.   Trust in God and what I am telling you and things will work out for the best.  Is he really worth the dramatic change?  Remember you are still in school and a lot can change over a year.  You don't want to be some knocked up school girl looked down upon because of the effects of some boy.  There is more to life than just guys!  Sit down and take the time to watch the movies "Clueless" and "The Princess Diaries" and watch closely at each totally different actresses behavior throughout the scenes.  Alicia Silverstone may be popular and fashionable but when it comes to good looking guys, a jerk is the last thing she wants.  Though I can't remember her name, the young woman in The Princess Diaries that also plays a role in The Devil Wears Prada, starts off as the role of a clumbsy, nerdy looking individual that evolves to a beautiful classy woman and discovers that family and friends are more important than money, popularity, and men.  Get a good education and enjoy life safely and happily.

By massaging the scalp the hair follicles are stimulated and the texture of the hair is also enhanced. Massaging activates the nerves and a sense of calmness in the mind ensues. This therapy is useful for people who have routine stress.    Everyday spend about 5-10 minutes massaging your hair with your fingers. Move your fingers circularly all over the head starting from the temporal parts to the occipital area. Apply the necessary pressure to the areas. Even Yoga exercises such as the headstand are recommended for proper circulation to all the parts, especially the hair follicles to stimulate growth.

fb6431580fa6844ad8367bd0398586ddaa	Blackheads can happen to anyone, no matter what your skin type. Blackheads are caused by oil in your skin that gets caught and expands in the pores. Oxidizing from exposure to the air, the oil actually turns black.    what works for some people might not work for everyone but here are some things that you can consider.~    First, stop the problem before it starts. Use noncomedogenic, oil-free, water-based skin-care products. (Noncomedogenic means the products were laboratory tested and approved by the FDA not to clog pores and cause blackheads.)    If you change your skin-care routine and still get blackheads, speak to a dermatologist about getting a prescription for Retin-A, which is a strong exfoliant that opens pores, sloughs off dead skin and cleans out blackheads.    If all else fails, a dermatologic facial performed at a dermatologist's office involves a prescription-strength acid that gets rid of dead layers of skin and the use of surgical instruments to extract the blackheads.    Blackheads are a problem that should be treated by a dermatologist. But, if you want to try an over-the-counter product, a lot of people rave about Biore Pore Perfect Strips, which are supposed to lift out blackheads on your nose, forehead and chin.    Hope this helps~|`|1687fcba84dcdce354c1cffe9824fdb1aa	Squeeze them|`|f0d55ea2da03d48e351e1106d7b4c6a8aa	use a oil free acne wash such as neutrogena it works great|`|0607332a982b789c912a420dda7b5f85aa	ok..first get a cloth..and wet it with really hot water..then rub ur face with it..but it has to be hot when u do it. just rub it all over ur face..do this every night. and it should work ...thats how i got rid of mine.|`|5a05750cea9a60f78da2b1b21f23afe7aa	I'm HUGE on this.....start with plain clean skin, you don't need fancy cleaners.....water and dove is great!

I hadn't slept for days. Johnny began to cry, like he usually does before an attack. It wasn't right for him to be here. He was too young, too afraid to take the life of another.    The rain beat down on the bunker. It was so fast and in such great quantity that you had to squint just to see your own goddamn nose. It was a wonder, I thought, as to how we could spot the torches from 50 yards away. I'll never forget the torches...

Get a clarifying shampoo and a good conditioner to follow up with.  That will work to strip out the color faster.  If you go to a salon they can get it out for you.  It depends how much you hate it.|`|1249a1112df182516bb6aa683b7be8a2aa	lots of conditioner|`|AA11461017	At home, the only way to really get it out faster is to wash it more often.  I read that you can mix a tablespoon of baking soda with half water and half shampoo.  You put it in the hair and leave for 5 minutes, working it around the head the whole time.  Supposedly that is suppose to fade color fast, but I have never personally tried it.  If you go to a professional, there is a product called Color Phantom that will remove it all completely.  If you have any friends that are stylists they can get the product at a beauty supply store really cheap and it is easy to use.  Good luck!|`|AA11126650	Don't use baking soda... that will eat your hair's natural oils and cause it to be really dry and brittle.  Buy some lightening shampoo, one made for blondes or people with highlights.  This will naturally and safely lighten your hair more rapidly than normal washing.  If that is not fast enough for you though, you can also mix a little peroxide with your shampoo before you lather.  That is a little harsher on your hair, but will not cause any major damage.

Or just dye it all one color and take this as a lesson never to diy highlights - always salon!!!|`|266415cb2fafe600391fa02baa8616d6aa	i wouldnt- go geet a colour expert kit- the loreal kind wit hthe base color and the highlighter color, flesh out the roots with the darker tone- dont go ash! but try one of the beigey  darker blondes- i repeat, NOT ASH- and just kinda muck it up on your roots there, dont comb it through, and dont leave it on too long. then once youve got a c=feel for how the overall color is matched up with what your friend did to your hair earlier, use the highlighting portion of the color expert to flesh out your highlights and bring them up to the root. also, to help in the blending, theres this stuff you buy at the beauty supply called Neutral protein filler, get that it really helps in making sure all your color sort of comes out even and blended.|`|AA10952317	yes, it works just as well.|`|ec9ea67e5fe5e0d84dced20df25501d6aa	Yes, I use them quite often.

AA11525748	Yes it works on all types of hair. Put all through your hair and then go sit in the sun for a few hours. It is more safe than putting chemicals in your hair.. My friend did it before and it worked good.|`|db8d8f4ba2929954492ae8d77e0b3143aa	I TOTALLY agree with Allyyyyyy  DO NOT USE SUN IN!!!!!!!! it is not lemon juice! it is nasty stuff that has a metallic compound in it``` meaning you can NEVER put another color or perm on it! and as in NEVER i mean until it is cut off!    Lemon juice is safe however, it is acidic, and actually will help seal in any color you have put on your hair. it does lighten your hair GRADUALLY and only a little bit, but the sun does do damage to your hair as well. so really if you want a sun kissed look just go to a salon, it really is not to expensive, and you will look awsome!|`|5a4a1dc305598fe549f44b2a0867f63caa	yeah it makes your hair lighter, havent you seen that stuff in the stores called sun-in   its basically lemon juice used to lighten your hair, you spray it in your hair, and then you go outside and the sun lightens it. my friend has black hair and it kinda made her hair redish color. and no worries, it wont ruin your hair at all.  when you put the lemon juice in your hair its not going to do anything if your not in the sun to naturally lighten it.|`|52227a156dfca2a50f8d167d6a02e224aa	Lemon juice does make your hair lighter, and it wont damage it in the least bit way.  In fact, it's actually very good for your hair on occasion because it's a natural way of cleaning it.  It does not work well on black hair.  I have black hair, and I left it on for about an hour, and not much happened.  The longer you leave it on the lighter it will be.|`|e6b6aa94e4c84a1c6176e6dbd771a589aa	Hey, don't do it! You gonna damage your hair coz.Lemon juice has "Citric Acid" so your hair is gonna lose all its natural oil and moisture. Also, Citric Acid will dry your scalp so bad that it will start flaking like dandruffs. Why don't you try Papaya paste for that? I mean, completely riped papaya and just smash it to glue like paste and apply on your hair and leave it for 2 hours minimum. No problem for any hair colour. Works really good like natural conditioner and also helps making hair much lighter.You will love it. good Luck!|`|49d573747f53581e3f4e84e6751d8defaa	OMG I am a hairdresser and you should NEVER EVER EVER use lemon juice or Sun-In on your hair!!  Get it professionally lightened at a salon.  If you use Sun-In, you are basically screwed.  That can not be colored over and basically turns your hair into mush.  It literally kills your hair follicles.  You have to wait for it to grow out before doing any chemical services on it.  Go to a salon.  It's not worth it to damage your hair|`|f66fe048b6bd77bde41acd8d9e0e67fdaa	it doesnt work on black hair its mostly for browns and blondes it sorta gives you highlights my friend did it a couple times and it didnt hurt her hair

732a551488cde1d74b83095c62a56be5aa	ho fatto la parrucchiera per un po di anni quindi ti posso dare un consiglietto! inizio dallo shampoo, per non farteli arruffare puoi usare liss extreme di l'oreal professional, c' anche la maschera, ma se hai i capelli fini ti puo andare a ingrassare la zona vicino a la cute, poi per l'asciugatura puoi usare una crema lissage come iron efect sempre l'oreal professional, questa usala se hai i capelli non troppo sotili, se no puoi usare un olio ai semi di lino,  molto buono quello di Elgon e quello di Retro' , oppure il olio liss extreme l'oreal prof. se invece ce l'hai sotili e anche un pochino rovinati usa Treatment infusion sempre di Retro'. Per fissarli un po' e dare anche un po' di lucentezza io metto 2-3 spruzzatine in mano dell'olio ai semi di lino con 6-8 spruzzate di lacca no gas (Alpiane di l'oreal prof. secondo me  delle lacche no gas delle migliori), spalma un po nel palmo della mano e distribuisci sui capelli, sempre senza toccare troppo la zona delle radici. Oppure se non ti interessa tanto il fissaggio (anche se io te lo consiglio piu che altro nei giorni umidi) usa Serum Vital quello di Elgon oppure di Retro', dona lucentezza, appena messo sembra molto olioso, ma dopo asciuto  perfetto, ricordati ke se hai i capelli sotili di non metterne troppo. Se per caso porti anche l'estensioni cerca la linea 4U di Socap,  fatta apposta per ki porta l'allungamento, se non lo porti non ci pensare ad usarla perche ti andrebbe ad apensatire... Ho visto ke ti hanno consigliato tanto anche le schiume, ma usale solo in caso di avere i capelli abbastanza mossi o ricci e asciugati al naturale, non ci pensare ad alisciarti i capelli usando la schiuma xke  99999 volte peggio ke se non usassi niente. Se vuoi dare volume per mantenere lisci i capelli usare Volume extreme di l'oreal professional,  uno spray ke va spruzzato solo sulle radici, ma non su lunghezza n punte.  Spero esserti stata di aiuto....  ciao ciao...|`|65c7e8cd373e5d15008026758db98355aa	Penso che esistano in commercio spume e creme che "domano" i capelli che tendono a gonfiarsi con l'umidit|`|fb0c003ecfb1a97217127efdb21ea00faa	metti la spuma ed evita di farli lisci,tanto in estate il riccio un po' spettinato  di moda|`|684dd80fe4b6d41f383bbcc7edbaa078aa	fai come lo zio qui... taglia tutto e via!!|`|a0534634b9a4e387e6c28a7b102e37d2aa	mettici della schiuma quando li lavi|`|7dc62898b9ba87ae05e60664f71ff0d3aa	Una bella rasata e via.|`|4734e8d9d027223b9547b150282333fdaa	usa un cappello! a mali estremi estremi rimedi!|`|2666ed4cc403327e05078cc6b560ebd1aa	falli ricci, almeno sn gi gonfi e l'effetto successivo dell'umidit dell'aria li render perfetti. ciao|`|2d5b7b202a7ebcc1e2f3e8573ffb4244aa	IO AVEVO LO STESSO TUO PROBLEMA...SE C ERA UMIDITA  I CAPELLI DIVENTAVANO CRESPI E GONFI...POI IL PROBLRMA SI  RISOLTO DA SOLO...NON  PIU SUCCESSO..BOO...VAB SE CE NE TANTA DI UMIDITA SI CHE SI GONFIANO ANCHE A ME CMQ USA LA SPUMA
e68d678c0aa412b21073ee7ade031ac6aa	I have been in many pageants. I have won and I have placed as far as 5 runner up. I personally think that there is really nothing to it. THEY do the make up and hair for you. It is up to you to look cute in it and smile your *** off. My advice is dont be too fake. I know many people who all they do is smile the whole time. Try giving littlw winks at the judges here and there. Put your hand on your hips and be yourself. That is what they are looking for. I think you should so do it. Win or loose it is a wonderful experience. Just think possitive and be yourself and not the person walking infront of you. Good luck!|`|c6159e737985f5aef410ee7e323e7b39aa	They are not harder than they look but, it is hard on finding the right dress.  My mom found me a dress when I was like, 8 years old and when I did the pagent they Didn't like the pattern on my dress.  So be careful on what kind of dress you choose.|`|6a27887d6352a22fadb44f45dfb2d1f2aa	I think you should go for it!  I did one pageant and I didn't win because I had to have my little sister with me and she was a brat, so don't let anyone else ruin it for you.  Do it the way YOU think is right, be yourself and be as beautiful as you can be.

294b0f1b94866a830f0fd85948bbb438aa	Taken from About.com:    Your best bet are styles that fall right below your chin or add a little volume on top. Soft, graduated layers are also a great bet because they make your face appear slimmer and tend to remove bulk and weight from the sides. Bangs are flattering, but keep them long or sideswept. Go for wispy and tapered ends. These de-emphasize the roundness of your face.    Celebs who share your face shape: Fergie, Kate Bosworth, Oprah Winfrey, Cameron Diaz, Kirsten Dunst, Michelle Williams, Catherine Zeta-Jones     Avoid: One-length, blunt cuts if you have short hair.

77cc538c082065c84038030871869fbeaa	Beauty marks (and moles ect....) are sexy. I think that it is a show of individuality, and a reminder that no two people are exactly the same. Do not let other people get you down on this, because everyone has flaws. But really, I do not think of a beauty mark as a flaw.|`|72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	I have tons of beauty marks. I love them on me. I have like three on my face that are very visible, but I have a lot that are on different parts of my neck, and on my chest area. I think they are so beautiful. I think that it's great you think this way and your not stuck on beauty like a lot of other people. You sound very grounded.|`|35fdfcc942da772e22a482dd20b5e9b9aa	Everyone has physical flaws, some are able to cover them up better than others, that's all.  In the long run, it's not how you look that matters (most people are at least not unpleasant to look at), it's how you appear when you open your mouth and begin to speak that matters.      "Beauty marks" must be a myth started by someone who had one and was insecure about it...a euphemism, in other words.  I had a mole on my face when I was a kid (not bulging or hairy, or anything like that) that made me very self-conscious.  No one ever ragged me about it (though they ragged me about everything else), but I had it removed.  After 20 years, it came back a little, but I am at a point in my life where I don't care much anymore about it.  :)    Kids will pick on other kids about anything...kids are cruel, and anyone who talks about the "sweet innocence of children" hasn't spent much time around them or has forgotten their own childhood.  We bear the scars into adulthood, and it can affect the way we relate (or don't relate) with others.  In the end, though, beauty fades, and our personalities are all that's left to recommend us.|`|8bf7c4f12dc5e8bf893bf7e94881a717aa	This they are adorable.

If not, you can just wait for your natural hair coulor to come back, this way it will save you a lot of trouble and money.  Hair lighteners normally have bleach in them and these are harmful to your hair and scalp.|`|4c3171f5254510ba261d4c1d187675adaa	IM A HAIR DRESSER PLEASE LISTEN  Color will not lift out color.  They only way to get your lighter (besides waiting for it to grow out) is to bleach the color out.  You also need to know how to do it and leave it on long enough to get to the level you want.  That is why you see a lot of orange headed people out there.  It might cost you more money to go to a salon, but you'll probably end up there anyway after trying it yourself...It'll cost more for you then because then they have to charge you for a "corrective color".  Either way, it's your hair and you're going to do what you want anyway.  Good luck  ( After you use the "Lite hair lightener" and it's not light enough, they other color will not lighten it more..Like I said, only bleach lifts out color, you can use a color to get it to the tone you want after)  Ask your stylist, PLEASE|`|ce01e08331613f0080c5b4389b0a1ab4aa	Honestly, i would not experiment ever with colors. Not unless you've done it before. WIth blond, it's a bleach that changes the colors hair, and damages the folicle. Girl! Take that to a pro, its SO worth it!

3de44647a7a98ab25d70c1d7392ebbd0aa	A week probably won't be enough to get visible, incredible results. Working out just your abs will build muscle there, but will not necessarily flatten the area. It might even increase with muscle build-up. Instead, try focusing on an overall workout routine that will help you to burn calories/become slimmer along with ab-building.

Trust me it's great, and if you are looking for quick results this is it.  Good luck with that.|`|AA12044803	Do at least one hour of cardio each day for the next week (running is probably the best and most natural to do).  Try this move that really works your ab muscles:  Get on the floor as though you're about to do a basic crunch (back flat and knees toward the ceiling).  Crunch up (like a basic crunch) and raise your left knee toward your face slowly.  Keep your upper body raised and slowly "push out" your left knee to make it straight---KEEP IT OFF THE FLOOR THOUGH.  Slowly bring the left knee back toward your face and turn your upper body toward the knee (as you would a bicycle crunch).  Slowly lower back to the floor (upper and lower body).  Repeat with your right knee.  Do each side at least 10 times--more if you can.  The key is to do it slowly.  The reason it works so well is that you're keeping your upper body raised the whole time!  That really works your core muscles.  The other stuff you do during this excercise gives you that definition you want!  If you do this correctly, you'll see results FAST!  Good luck!
8b8660f7a35d658359b0b2464eefa916aa	It could be caused from overprocessing-especially if use a relaxer or heat processing too much, or if you get chemically treated styles a lot or use a lot of heat styling.      Try to take a break from these types of styles for a while-apply a repairing and strengthening serum with some sunscreen before you get your hair done. I know this is horrible too but try to let it air dry rather than under the dryer or in rollers before you get it braided.     As for product lines: here's a few that my friends suggest. If you can-talk to your stylist too.  They can recommend an assortment of products that can help.

TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM STRAIGHTENING AND CURLING YOUR HAIR AS MUCH IF U DO.|`|1ab64e59b314db5cba44c6b5716d1244aa	First - get you hair trimmed. Regardless of what the hair commercials tell you - there is nothing that cures split ends.  Next when you do your hair DON'T use elastics. They will break your hair. Use scrunchies or soemthing like that. There are all kinds of hair goodies out there now. Mine is medium length too and all I do is pull it up (Like I would for a pony tail) and put a hair clip in it.  DON'T sleep with pins or metal barretts or anyhing of that nature in your hair. It will casue it to split.  If you color your hair - that adds to the problem. I suggest you stop it and let it go natural. And if natural is turning gray - you can tell people it's a fashion statement.|`|85b878c370e81d0a22a8ad02a61cd067aa	Shampoo is meant to do ONE thing and ONE thing only, and that is to clean your hair.  Shampoos whose manufacturer's claim will take care of split ends, or make your hair thicker or shinier, are lying.  All shampoo does basically the same thing (liek soap), and that is it gets your hair clean.  Anyway, keep your hair shorter and in an uncomplicated style.  Don't use curling irons (they split ends of hair), perm your hair, or use the hair dryer excessively.  use a good conditioner once a week.  Have split ends cut off (they won't repair themselves no matter what you use).  use a soft hairbrush but don't over brush.|`|345163780c91d4d41b0c5263fc295f04aa	increase your protein intake and take biotin- healthy hair comes from the inside out|`|AA10545281	Our hair doesn't break off because it's not "clean," so your choice of shampoo may not be the culprit. Many times we're not taking care of our scalps and making sure our hair is conditioned and mosturized well enough. Start using a moisturizing conditioner or deep conditioner at least once a month. Don't use heavy pomades and grease, but something with a lighter texture (the Motions line is good for these). Also, stay away from hairstyles using excess heat (blow drying styles, hot curler, etc.). and opt for wet sets, and things that allow your hair to air dry. Also, at night, cover hair with a satin bonnet or sleep on satin pillowcase, because cotton takes away the moisture in our hair. Hope I've helped!
