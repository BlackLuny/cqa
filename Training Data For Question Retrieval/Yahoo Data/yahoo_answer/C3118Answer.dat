Here a link about it...    http://www.ehow.com/how_2209302_help-tee...    A fantastic job where you have room to move up and make great money is as a busgirl or hostess at a restaurant like Outback or Fridays.  If you are charming and outgoing be a hostess, if you are shy and quiet be a busgirl.  At some restaurants you can receive "tip share" where you get a cut of the nights money in cash.  Its nice but make sure you take half or more immediately to the bank for deposit or it will fly right out of your pocket.  Cash tends to do that :)     Good luck|`|wZ0ToeQWaa	pizza hut|`|DYm8rPpyaa	In east Asia.|`|PNkhcbMcaa	They hire 5 year olds in china, as far as the U.S. goes, most adults cant find jobs|`|WCJtZKaqaa	maybe mcdonalds, taco bell, dairy queen, burger king, fast food restaurants|`|71f2930ee535098af1f6581cea1d859faa	Try fast food, or local restaurant's, don't forget summer jobs at water parks, just try small business.|`|aein2bCbaa	Pretty much anywhere.

tbFI2XJeaa	Be sure on the top of your resume you have your name, address and all your phone numbers. You want to make sure they can get in touch with you to set up an interview.<br>  <br>  The first part of any resume should be your schooling. Never lie on a resume. If you did not attend college do not put it on your resume. If you attended college, but did not graduate - put down the college you attended, without a degree or year of graduation. Those of you over 50, even 45 - never ever put the year you graduated. This is one easy way to try and figure out how old the applicant is. This holds true for the year you graduated from High School. If you are young - do not put your graduation year either, this will tell them how young you are. The secret is - keep it a secret. Get your foot in the door first, don't let someone discredit you before they even meet you. Yes, yes I know there are laws about not discriminating against you, because of your age. But lets face it, who would get the interview - someone who graduated in 1950, 1999 or 2007. I would pick 1999, they would be about 27. They were 18 when they graduated, they have been out of school for 9 years, so that makes them around 27. <br>  <br>  Don't be shy, put down all your education, and yes even technical school. <br>  <br>  Put down all your job experience in the last 10 years. If you have been with the same employer for longer up to 20 years put that down also. But, watch out for aging yourself with too many years. It is fine to put down the years you worked for an employer, especially if you have more than three years with the same employer. This shows loyalty and longevity. Every employer wants to hire someone that does not job jump. It cost employers a lot of money to hire a new employee - they do not want to keep having to hire every year or two for the same positions.<br>  <br>  If you were at a job less than one year, leave it off. It will be a flag for job jumping.<br>  <br>  Always start with your most recent employer. If you are currently employed and do not want your current employer to know you are interviewing - I would only write the title of your current employer as "Current Employer" do not give their name.<br>  <br>  Give a brief explanation of your job duties. Be creative, if you are the secretary responsible for greeting clients, answering phones etc... give one of your job duties as communications. You are the first person a client speaks to when they call. If you are nasty on the phone, your employer may lose that client. If you were not good with communications you would not be in that position! Once again, do not lie and give yourself titles, just to give yourself titles. Think about what you really do and write about it. <br>  <br>  Be sure to include all the computer software you know how to operate. <br>  <br>  You do not have to include every single detail, summarize your job, (employee hiring, evaluations, payroll, taxes etc..) <br>  <br>  The next part of your resume should include special areas in your life. <br>  No offense, but employers do not really care if you like to garden, read, etc... This area is for special qualities, awards or titles. <br>  If you are the President of an organization, put it down here. <br>  <br>  On the bottom or your resume is the place for references. <br>  <br>  References available on request - is the safest way to give references if you are currently employed. Be sure to check with your references first, before you put their name down. Employers usually call your past employers, not the names you put down anyhow. They want to know your past work record from your employers, not your friends. Lets face it, are you going to put down the name of someone that will give you a bad reference?<br>  <br>  The final area on a resume is your salary. If the employer does not ask for salary requirements than don't put it down. Why shoot yourself in the foot. They will always start with the employee who is asking for the least amount. When an employer has 10 resumes which all sound promising, and then there is one that sounds great, but wants $10,000.00 a year more than the rest, they will probably start with the others first.|`|RmlJs18haa	you can search online for examples.<br>  <br>  what you need to write is;<br>  <br>  your name, country of birth, citizenship, date of birth, marital status,sex, race,address,e-mail, tel.<br>  <br>  and objective of your position, expected salary, earliest date to start work,education qualifications,skills, languages,your previous job & working experiences.<br>  <br>  :)|`|QKeQDXVoaa	Name: ?<br>  NIRC?<br>  ADDRESS?<br>  DATE OF BIRTH?<br>  Job Experience ?<br>  Apply For What Postion?<br>  Recommad By?<br>  Why Do you wanna to join this Company?<br>  Best if got Ex Job Testi?<br>  <br>  Try to write as much as u can. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  K>A>Z|`|15hvyAAkaa	I would do an internet search for resume templates.

MfoQc8wdaa	I know of other HR recruitment firms facing a rough patch due to a lot companies cutting down of fresh recruitments because of the economic slowdown. Some of my friends have worked for the company, but they quit really soon, so it seems like they have a problem retaining employees (as any outsourced business does)    Since I don't know your current job profile i can't really say whether you should stick to your current job or join Emmay HR. But if you're into Corporate HR, I strongly recommend you stick to that.
sg93GVSJaa	You ask for a transfer form from the invoice office.  Fill it out and return it.  They basically ask the store you want to be transferred to whether they would be happy to have you, and they will only approve it if there is a need for more staff in the store you are applying for.  Also I think your current manager can block it if they want, so make sure you talk to him or her before handing in the form.    It is probably a good idea to ring up the manager of the new store you want to transfer to.  One of my colleges did a transfer with Woolies and when she turned up at the new store for her first shift the manager had different ideas about the times she would be working.     edit:  She applied about 3 months before moving, but I'm not sure about the minimum time it can be done in
ada347c9f8c191ef5503d5f59e329442aa	There was probably a sorting error at the Shanghai Sorting Center. Both country names sound similar (and with poor penmanship might also look similar), so instead of routing your package to Canada, someone must have piled it with the mail going to Grenada. When the package was sent out for delivery in Grenada, they obviously couldn`t find such an address.     Depending on the delivery service this is (EMS?), your package might be on its way back to the sorting center in Shanghai or to the original sender. In the worst case, it might still be in some postal outlet somewhere in Grenada.    This is obviously an error on the part of the delivery service or the sender, so it's best to get in touch with either of them to have it sorted out.    Hope this helps.

gaXUIduMaa	Most of them are honest contests.  Catering to business men (women) is profitable and steady income, even in this economy.  Business lunches are often more expensive than the casual lunch so they get even bigger sales there.  A few of them build mailing lists but most businessmen do not like being sent advertising to their business email address so it isn't very effective.  Conceivably they could sell the cards to some company for bulk mail but I don't think the volume is sufficient for that to be profitable to the restaurant.
