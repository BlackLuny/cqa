Hello, I own many real vintage clothes that require dry cleaning but this is very expensive when more than half my wardrobe are clothes that are made of contents such as Virgin Wool, Lambswool, cashmere and merino wool that cannot be cleaned in the washing machine and dryer. I can't afford the ridiculous dry cleaner bills, and have gone to many different places to try and find the best deal, but even then it's very pricey. I don't have much money and was hoping that there is a alternative i can do at home to clean these garments?
20090128184913AAWuZng	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Hardwood floors question..Attic room?	I have removed old carpet from unfinished hardwood floors what has been left some of the carpet padding and the woven fibers(from the padding) which have stuck to the floor in some areas. my question is any suggestions on lifting the fiber threads left on the floor.       While the pad has long ago turned into a powder these threads remain and in some cases are stuck with I am guessing is dirt, fluids, and some of the padding.       I have tried scraping and successfully removed most of the padding this way there are some problem areas where as i describe fiber threads from the padding mixed with who knows what. I am sure it is not a glue as this is happening only in some areas where i can not seem to get to the wood.       We have tried paint thinner to see if that would help lift which is a big no.    I tried a orbital sander with several grits and no such luck although in some cases the sander seemed to shave pieces of the fibers off it did not allow these areas to be exposed (wood exposed).      Hints and tips are appreciated.       The carpet was there around 50yrs.

I am a renter and my landlords house sprung a leaky pipe in the attic that came down in buckets into my livingroom and destroyed my furniture.  The thing is the landlord tore open the ceiling, fixed the pipe and in 3 days sealed the ceiling back up wet, tore back the carpet, pulled out the underlay, dried it with 3 small fans, placed it back in its spot on a wet floor, dried the carpet with 3 small fans, pulled it back over top of that underlay, and pretended like nothing happened. The inside of my whole house smells like a mold bucket, but he covered it all up so when the building inspector comes, he knows i called he will think nothing is wrong.  Isn't that wrong? do you not tear it out and replace it?

Our Christmas tree stand leaked quite a bit and we didn't find out until after we took the tree down. Is it possible to replace just a few planks? We have the planks here, but since they are the lock and groove kind, I have no idea how we could take the old ones out and replace them since it isn't close to the edge of the room.

20090128194819AA3zUNn	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Tree house questions?	I love tree houses, so does my husband, and we plan to some day build a really nice one, not like one that you completely live in, but maybe a living or dinning area, We don't have the tree yet. The tree house plans will probably effect what house we eventually buy. I need to know what we are looking for so I need some answers to these questions.   1, Living in an area with moderate winds and yearly ice storms i'm worried about the weight on the tree. Is it acceptable to use posts and ground support to help hold up the structure? Should I forgo any bolting to the tree and use only ground support to allow for wind movement? (the structure would still be partially in the tree, but not rested on it)   2, in my area any building wired for electricity must be inspected by a county official, would this still be necessary if my tree house ran only on self generated solar power?   3, could i use mostly recycled materials to save on cost and be more environmentally conscious.   4, what trees are best for a tree house that I plan to be about 10-15 feet up.      I know that it's hair brained and away off considering  current economic conditions, but any thoughts, knowledge and opinions would be appreciated, and if entertaining, enjoyed.   thanks!

20090128200254AAySeZz	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	What kind of evergreen would you suggest to block the view of a backyard playset?	This is so STUPID!  We requested to put up a playscape in our backyard for our kids to play on (we already have it, we just relocated and need to put it back up).  We requested from our HOA.  They came back and said we could but that we had to plant an 8 foot evergreen between the playground and the 10 foot easement to the fence line at the midpoint of the playset.      So basically they want us to plant a Christmas tree immediately behind a playscape that our kids will be playing on, leaving no fall zone, etc.  They say it will block the view of the playset, but the tree has to be 8 ft and the playset is 12.  Plus the playset is about 30 feet wide and the top of the evergreen will only be very small at top.      So, that being said, is there an evergreen tree that would work for this situation?  Oh yeah, my son also has VERY BAD outdoor allergies, so playing anywhere near a tree daily in Texas where allergies are bad anyway will not be good.  So one that has low allergens would be good too.      Or, is there a way I can talk them out of this ridiculous request?

20090128200623AABdlWe	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Would it be ok to have a piano in a townhouse?	There is only one shared wall with another townhouse, and the piano would be on the opposite side of that wall (as far away from the neighbors as it gets). There would be nobody above or below.      I plan on checking in with my neighbors anyway to see when they work so I can play when they're not home.       So here's the question, yay or nay? I'm moving out of my parent's home and haven't bought a piano yet, still up in the air, I'm trying to get some thoughts and recommendations to see if that would be appropriate (obviously it wouldn't be in an apartment but this seems like a different situation). Thanks!

20090128205553AAvPWFv	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	I have a question regarding Oasis cleaners?	I work in a dining services hall at a college. We use Oasis as our company who provides us with our cleaners like orange soap, sanitizer, floor cleaner, etc. It scares the crap out of me that these products could make you go blind or damage your lungs if you get them in your eye, inhale them, or digest them. All of them are already hooked up to a machine that dilutes them with water, so these are considered "normal use conditions" and safe under these terms but I just feel paranoid knowing I have used these without problems so far, but one day I could have one. Is anyone else familiar with or use Oasis cleaning products?
