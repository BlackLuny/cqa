Oug6YTrGaa	Well, you eat fruits and veggies of course.<br>  && LOTS of water.|`|D34huOlCaa	Cut out your sweets...soft drinks, sweet tea etc.  Cut out all fried foods. That should help.
9pLdhuBnaa	Gas build up can sometimes cause this (an example only).  However, because it has been a few days since this started I would recommend seeing your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.
6iU0d0L3aa	Think about it. <br>  Do you think you’ll make it through the day?<br>  Check tomorrow morning if you can make it, go to school. If you can’t wait another day; Getting sick at school does not make for a great day.<br>   <br>  For a few weeks, the rash may come back when you are out in the sun, get too warm, or are under stress. This does not mean the disease has gotten worse. <br>  By the time the rash appears, you can no longer spread the disease to anyone else. As soon as you get a rash, you may return to school.|`|ML3PGUPYaa	gotta start going sometime.|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	No, it's not good to go to school after you've had a fever the day before. Also, you might not be able to get through the day. And lso, a friend can come over and help you with work. That's what I did when i had to go in for emergency surgery :/ lol they gave me laughing gas!|`|YvFTZ6akaa	What in the world if "fifth disease"?
sKTmxnx1aa	As long as it feels comfortable, it is in right!  Good job, and yes, you can go to the bathroom normally with a tampon inserted properly.|`|kDvKc3npaa	If you can't feel it, you've put it in right.<br>  <br>  You can go to the bathroom with it in, your period and pee come out of different holes.<br>  <br>  congrats|`|16bWGB14aa	If you can't feel it it's in right. You can use the restroom with it in.|`|c9ZqOAk4aa	If you put it in right, you shouldn't be able to feel it when you walk. As for going to the bathroom, it is good to change it every time, but you don't have to, just hold the string out of the way. Also, don't leave it in for more than 8 hours, or you risk getting Toxic Shock Syndrome, which is deadly!|`|3AXHItOqaa	No, you don't have to. Might sound gross, but you pee out of a different hole...lol..If you try to take it out before it has absorbed enough, it will be difficult and hurt. If you prefer to, you can. But you definitely don't have to.|`|Lec4JlfXaa	when i use the bathroom with one in i have to take it out|`|FWXd7nQUaa	well if you can feel it at all, or are just uncomfortable<br>  cahnces are you didn't put it in right.<br>  or you got to big of a size, since your new to it<br>  i would suggest a slender applicator (alot easier)<br>  and YES you can go pee.<br>  the problem is while your peeing, you might pee on the string,<br>  so either hold the string forward with your hands,<br>  or take it out, either way works.
ZFL4ScBGaa	This has happened to me before. My doctor did a bunch of random tests, and yes the first thing he asks is Have you engaged in sexual acts lol but besides that he didnt check down there at all. Most doctors know related illnesses, or minor problems when this occurs in a girl.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	He/She  the doc may ask you to do a wee in a small bottle in the loo. The doc may feel around  your tummy a bit. If you are avirgin the doc is unlikely to do an internal. although he/she might ask you some questions. If you are certain you have not had sex, then don't worry. If you have you need to tell your Mum and dad.|`|J4wTIhsoaa	since you are a virgin, they won't do a papsmear. They will probably do a blood work up, but being 15 it's normal to be irregular.|`|KDXisAOlaa	ask him...i dont know i have never missed a period. so i would not know|`|4Ld1GqnZaa	There's no need to go to a gynecologist if you miss one period.  If you miss more than three months in a row, I would suggest it, but it's very, very common for girls your age to miss a period here and there.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, they have a couple little tools they use to look up inside you and check you out.  They might want to get a feel of your ovaries, which would be a little more 'personal.'<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid though.  It wouldn't be too bad if you went!|`|0dSZ4yOTaa	most likely a pregnancy test, i know your a virgin but he most likely will just to be sure and perhaps a pap smear or pelvic exam.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	A standard office visit would include: a breast exam (the doctor feels your breasts for lumps); a pelvic exam and PAP (you put your feet in the stirrups and the doctor places a speculum in your vagina and cranks it open, then peers into your vagina with a light, then inserts a tool to take a scraping from your cervix, then removes the speculum); and an ovary exam (the doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger in your bottom and feels around for your ovaries by pressing that finger up and laying a hand on your abdomen pressing down). This all happens with you naked except for a paper gown and your socks. <br>  <br>  You asked.|`|JRKJ1w3Zaa	no,<br>  <br>  I had that problem too. I went to a GYN and they don't check your vagina if you are a virgin.<br>  <br>  my GYN used this radiology thing that checked my cervix from a screen for any back up. <br>  <br>  and that was it.<br>  <br>  and I got some pills for it which worked.
YmEU7K70aa	if you are looking for a sign kind of thing one could be your wieght, when u reach 100 lbs then u should be beginning to start your period so just be aware. i started my period at 14 so dont be freaked or anything. and u will develop boobs when ur supposed to. im 16 and still dont have much of them :(|`|ba4500039e8f92604ce593a1896685dbaa	It depends on your body.  Everyone is different.  I didn't get my first period until I was turning 13.  I had a chest but not a big one when I was 13, and when I turned 14 I was caught up with everyone, I was a late bloomer, but I'm happy it worked out the way it did.  Trust me you don't need boobs at age 11!<br>  <br>  As for the period thing, trust me you don't want one!!!  I was always excited about it .. now that I have it, I wish I could go back to before I ever had one!  Just enjoy life right now.|`|qosigLPMaa	:) Don't worry, everything will come to you naturally, you're only 11.<br>     For me, I didn't get my period 'till I was 13 and my grandma, 'till she was <br>     15! Some girls get their periods earlier than others, that's all there is to it. <br>     Same with breasts. If you want more information about puberty, I suggest <br>     you speak to your mum or to an adult you trust. I know it may be awkward, <br>     but it's the best way to learn about this kind of stuff.<br>    <br>    I hope this helps! :)|`|9DCjdnZ1aa	you should enjoy who you are as a 11 year old :)|`|183e99810d00196cd16aa11a9f77c72daa	Wow a lot of people get it at 13 or 14 maybe even later. Don't rush it's not a wonderful thing lol.|`|QJHE3z1raa	your ONLY 11 and are worried.<br>  some girls dont get boobbs til 18|`|KfBk9UMraa	It differs from person to person. Everyone is different and will devolp at different times. My friend is 15 and still doesn't have any boobs. I am only a 34 A and don't feel bad, you'll eventually get some.
5KndPRJfaa	A blood streaked discharge could be a sign of a functional ovarian cyst, especially if you have a history of functional cysts - although I'd recommend that you get it checked out to be sure.<br>  Although functional cysts can go away unaided, they will often come back. Conventional medicine will do little for the condition. I really believe in a natural holistic approach - it really can work wonders, with zero side effects. There's a good site with more information at <a href="http://OvarianCystsHealed.info" rel="nofollow">http://OvarianCystsHealed.info</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.
j0RQIbnqaa	Tall seems to be the look girls are pressured into these days. Not that you can change your genes, so that's a bit ridiculous. 4'10 is short in comparison with the average of American girls' heights, but take that somewhere else and you'd be considered average. By 17, most girls have stopped growing completely. Also, to find out if you are still growing, have an X-ray done of the growth platelets (usually of the wrists). If they are still open then you've got some growth left. Your physician could also give you an approximation of your adult height by looking at your medical chart. Anyways, don't worry too much about your height. Power to the short people!|`|w1kgu0hOaa	dang I was 5'4 when I was 15 and I thought I was super short! but no worries, If you're healthy then I dont see any problem, some people are just short, and some tall, some skinny, some fat, but we are all people (yap yap yap....) lol anyways, it's fine don't worry.|`|aYaCXKOEaa	i know many girls your height pretty cute some of them and yea|`|JOYF6yCnaa	its not a bad thing! <br>  when i was turning 15 i was about 4'11"<br>  but now im turning 16 in may tooooo, and im about 5 foot something.<br>  so maybe you'll still grow! <br>  id rather be short, than tall though!|`|quPY9x7qaa	you're fine as long as you're healthy, my 1st wife was 4'11" when i met her @ 15 and she never grew an inch... most guys love shorter women anyway|`|eGSIXIsFaa	That is pretty darn short, yeah. Don't worry about it though.|`|QUcxqoABaa	well, I've always thought that being short(4 a gal) is better than being tall

Things with healthy fats, like almonds or peanuts, for example have vitamin E, as well as broccoli and sunflower seeds. Also, water is great for the skin. Get your vitamin E from healthy foods, though, rather than taking supplements, which are said to be risky for your health.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	lots of fruits, veggies, high protein, low-fat, and fiber-rich foods|`|zaCagGRPaa	i take fish oil pills
JdkPNBuYaa	Right now i'm about to totally go off on you because you're BEING STUPID.  Dude really i'm 16 as well and i know a **** load of people as well as myself that have gone through way more crap than you.  you should never kill yourself for a girl or for someone else because that's completely stupid.  most of the people i know get abused at home either rape or their stupid father beats the **** out of them.  if you want someone to talk to there are suicide hot lines just go on google and type in suicide hot line.  You know if you o kill yourself a lot of people are actually gonna care.  your ex best friend and ex girlfriend are gonna care when you die.  most people don't know but statistics show that on average a suicide affects six other people.  In addition (i actually had to have my friend tell me this) when you kill yourself you're being selfish if you really think about it.  when you think people don't care, they really do you just don't know.  i walk around school like a loner, but on days when people notice i'm there, people will just ask me if i'm all right (this actually happened today with a chick i knew in middle school)  people do care.  in my school right now there's a lot of rumors going on about a teacher Ms Coggin.  she left school to help kids likeus that have issues and try to kill themselves.  right now shes trying to create a website thats a home for people.  maybe if you look her up on google you can find her.  talk to her and i swear to god she WILL inspire you.|`|ooNwvfIVaa	i understand how you feel i have been through that kind of thing everyone thinks of suicide i did too but just think it through it isn't worth it just find someone you can talk to and they will help you my friend helped me get through things like that and just every now and then at night go ahead and cry because it does help just think of the things that have gone on cry be happy whatever you feel like...it does help just try it suicide isn't the only option|`|b3M3Goxlaa	No don't do anything. Go to your parents and explain the situation. no matter how much they may be mad they still love you. go to them and talk and go to a therapist or anything but that is never the answer. 16% of high schoolers have those thoughts but dont let them get to you. go to you parents now please for everyone|`|aTKprEybaa	NO!!! you'll get through it all in time but i would teal your parents how you feel to let them know.

dBaCusz6aa	i think its when you take laxatives and drink a lot of water cayenne pepper.|`|CX9JBYTCaa	There are a lot of different cleanses out there. The most popular right now is the one which has to consume nothing but warm lemonade with cayenne pepper and maple syrup, plus a daily cup of laxative tea for ten consecutive days. Sound awful? That's cause it is. People can say all they want about the benefits of cleansing, but your body needs more than that to run efficiently. Protein, vitamins, carbs, to name a few. You'll lose a bunch of pounds, for sure, but that will only be because you haven't eaten for ten days!|`|135639db342592f16cebca190c3085b3aa	I don't know.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|aw5BGkmLaa	Forget it, you are not fat and 120 is WAY to skinny for your height. At 120 yu will be unhealthy. For your height the recommended wieghts are:<br>  <br>  small frame 144-154 lbs<br>  Medium frame 151-163<br>  large frame  158- 180|`|nqXJ9SGXaa	you do not gain muscle from cardio (i.e. running). Whoever told you that has been misinformed or is just trying to confuse you. A easy visual example of this, are the world class runners. they are not muscular, they are toned and small and skinny. If you want to lose weight, you have to burn fat and make better decisions eating wise so that fat doesnt just come back and all that hard effort is gone. Muscle is gained by weight resistance and repititions of that resistance. 120 is way way way too skinny for a 5 foot 10 guy. To be honest, getting down to 120 is a pretty unrealistic goal you have set and you'd probably look pretty gross at that weight with your height.

KAwYumFfaa	Yeah, he did. Its been 24hrs since the incident, you should do the warmth therapy. Luke warm water. Also, let him take some pain reliever, that really hurts. For the swelling on the wrist, you should put on some ointment in em. Declofenac (voltaren) should do. That is anti-arthritic, serves well the purpose for your boyfriend's  swollen palm. Also, try not to move the that hand on him.<br>  Lastly, let your boyfriend work on his anger management. He might really damage his carpals with that thing he does.|`|gi5yLsdjaa	if he can wiggle his fingers, then no. If not, then yes.

When you break a bone, Swelling is immediate and massive, there is no room for question.  Bruising follows quickly (about 8 to 12 hours) behind the swelling.  Next time tell him to punch between the studs.  <br>  The stupid idea you can't move your fingers is what kept me from going to the doctor for 8 hours on that one I kept fishing for the rest of the day.  When my hand had finally swollen to the point I couldn't work the reel (about 2 hours) I changed hands, but my fingers still worked.  I might also add my hand was only cracked, not fully broken.|`|YmC7525Faa	nahh he would be crying like liitle bby|`|SWZ2Hef1aa	First, what the heck was he doing punching a wall? Doesn't that spell out STUPID? Honestly, no offense to you or your boyfriend!!<br>  <br>  It doesn't definitely mean that it is broken. First, I would start by applying light pressure to his knuckles, fingers, and palm. If he twitches, definately take him to the docter to get it checked out. Even if he doesn't, I would definately go to the docter. Nobody could determine whether it is broken or not than them. Good Luck and sorry for any offense!|`|C5JcLlMOaa	maybe, theres really no way to tell from the exterior unless bones are sticking out. try running your fingers over it then compare it to his other hand.<br>  <br>  and you probably shouldnt be dating him if he is punching walls. you could be next.|`|QUcxqoABaa	well maybe, take him to the doctor, if he can move his fingers it means they're not broken, but maybe only very hurt<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  by the way: why did he throw a punch at a wall???, doesn't he know they are almost unbreakable|`|dz3JusDMaa	idk go to a doctor<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtakzRg2vedN7GRFcBvWwGvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304172610AAAuLEA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|vxW7bEnDaa	if bruising comes through then there may br a break.<br>  <br>  i would be more worried about what's going on in his head than his hand, to be honest......|`|qWYikidEaa	Could be.

Right now it may be a wall, but very soon it could be you. <br>  Be careful!|`|5p0rzz38aa	doubt it just put some ice on it and in a couple of hours or minutes it'll be ok just make sure he doesn't do much with that hand like mastur...ehhh playing video games -.o|`|EcVVcgZNaa	Anger issues much???<br>  If he can move them, then they aren't broken...|`|x0vVdphbaa	Can he move his fingers? if so does it hurt? if it does it probably is i would check it out|`|l9t7HHCkaa	I heard that if it swells, It's not broken. have him ice it for 48 hrs, heat for 24|`|aDWQfWJ3aa	I hope so.|`|H9Qt633Uaa	if he can't move it then yes, but if he can a little bit they are probably just jammed put ice on it|`|5lXSw9Ycaa	ur boyfriend is retarded.......<br>  <br>  good job!<br>  <br>  =D|`|2OoyYsA2aa	you should get a knew boyfriend before he punches you!|`|MC6cIwrhaa	no its not broken...its just in his hand his muscles got screwd up...but dnt worry its not broken|`|pD6K1rLkaa	possibly, he should get an xray
gbUKzTyVaa	All non-organic foods contain some form of chemical in them.  These chemicals are allowed for some reason by the FDA, and can do many things- ranging from preserving the food, to making it taste better, to making it make you hungrier, to making you physically addicted to the food!<br>  <br>  This is ESPECIALLY TRUE of foods that are processed, frozen, microwavable, packaged, junk food, candy, soda, caffeinated beverages, fast food, school food, etc.!<br>  <br>  So remember- you're eating countless chemicals each time you take a bite of those delicious mashed motatoes and cheese! <br>  <br>  And the great taste doesn't come from the actual food, since it has been frozen and sapped of any natural taste.... so, the great taste comes from a chemical, or many chemicals!<br>  <br>  And those chemicals are made in the same chemical factories which produce bleach, shoe shine, nail polish remover, and candle scents!  These chemicals are 100% UNnatural, and are harmful to you!|`|lxJoXNZwaa	Yes, it is possible.  If it's greasy cheese fries - then it's probaby not a good craving/addiction.  Try baked potatoes and cheese - yummy!!|`|eO6GqpOqaa	I go through phases like that. I had a chicken sandwich phase, a sub sandwich phase, a teriyaki chicken phase and right now I have a chicken nugget phase..they last like a couple months or a year. I think its normal, your taste buds change every few years and eventually you eat so much of it you get burned out after a few years and move on to the next thing.|`|FFu7wS7Jaa	I personally am addicted to my moms Peperonni Rolls.....can't get enough of them...
KihN53yYaa	i know wut you mean by it feeling good,<br>  sometimes to need pain to get rid of pain. if u know what i mean.<br>  Im not emo either but i do cut myself. i have some hard times dealing with stuff that happened to me, and cutting is temporary relief.<br>  <br>  Talking to someone about it isnt always the easiest thing to do, but it could help you, depending on your situation.<br>  <br>  sorry if i made no sense.<br>  :)|`|OdpmgrNjaa	first, try to find out why you are cutting and get to the root of it. also try to talk to your friends and family and ask for moral support. after all they know you best and want you to be happy and healthy! and just know that you are not alone and that a lot of people face this same obstacle! good luck!|`|1AsZJzbJaa	find something safer. like drugs or alcohol.|`|2VrCJNbTaa	you have to think to yourself that i'm better than this...and i dont need to do this to make me happy. if you feel the need to do it...just go do something that releases stress....like hitting a punching bag or something. anything else would be better. go scream if you have to l0l hope this helps you out. Good luck|`|6jrv0MWTaa	Well cutting becomes a habit, so i suggest stopping it now before you scar too badly.<br>  <br>  Go for a jog instead, a proper one, 10-20 minutes.<br>  <br>  Get your buzz from that instead. =)<br>  <br>  if that doesn't work go to a doctor.
AA10299265	Okay, here is your straight answer... There is no better testosterone booster than good old fashioned sweat, healthy diet, and clean living. In other words, lots of exercise, primarily natural foods, and no drugs. Period.

e57e71cec6c8a1accec8acab20e4afdfaa	If your 12 and 175 it's probably not a healthy thing to go on a diet just yet. I know it may be hard but diets (Even the bad ones) can seriously injure someone under the age of 18. People under the age of 18 usually have fat they can't get rid of by running and dieting. And any bad choices you make diet wise can result in a bigger unhealthier you shortly afterwards|`|FaVYRoXqaa	It`ll take you a year to lose 70 lbs, not 2 months.  Get active and eat natural, filling, healthy foods from all the food groups.|`|1Qi4dHjjaa	I feel your pain :( I'm turning 12 also and I want to lose weight. I guess being active and eating right can help.

BfuWYpQMaa	I would suggest adding green tea extract pills as well as a vitamin B complex pill to you diet. Both the green tea and B complex will aid in increasing metabolism. These are far more safe to take than over the counter weight loss pills. I would also suggest drinking lots of water.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|DeSCJn0paa	If you can find clenbuterol... take it.

4f2GaLhpaa	Your muscles get sore because of tiny tears in the muscle tissue (Not because of lactic acid like most people will tell you). What your body is doing is rebuilding those muscles up so that they get stronger, so they generally should feel a little bit sore if you're trying to get a six pack. <br>  <br>  I think in your case you're fine, you should see the results because you said you are feeling the burn while you're working out-which is a good thing! Mostly it depends on your physical activity level. If you are a really active person your body will recover faster then if you live a generally sedentary lifestyle. <br>  <br>  Maybe if you want to feel more sore try doing lots of different ab exercises, instead of just one.|`|MyKyEJUvaa	try using different excercise, machines if you have acces to it or you need to use some weighted excercise for your abs. it sounds like your old excercises your abs got used to it already, so need to challenge your abs so that it will get sore again.|`|XjwOWUdtaa	maybe you need to try other exercises. First of all 80 is not alot try more reps and more ab contractions. Use more weights do like weighted crunches on the ball. I try to do 500 contractions every other day trust me they would be sore after that. Well goodluck with your six pack

I gave me horrible headaches and I constantly felt hungover sick.|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	frequently it can, depends on what kind and your body so talk to the doctor about your concerns|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	it's one of the side effects but it doesnt affect all women...it just depends on your specific reaction to it|`|oWJU0ky4aa	Not everybody reacts the same way to meds. It doesn't matter what the doctors say the side effects are.It doesn't even matter what it says on the box about the side effects either. The only way your going to know for sure is to try them yourself.|`|bpZp8UjKaa	It made me gain about 50 lbs. But know I have the mirea and it works GREAT!!!!!

All women are different and how one person reacts to something doesn't gurantee that you will react the same.  Some women gain weight while others don't.
KAX9FURMaa	I don't think there is any need to worry about it for now. Some girls don't get there periods until they are 18 (even if they are physically developed).<br>  <br>  Even if her mother got her period at 12, that doesnt necessarily mean your friend should get her period at the age of 12. I got my period when i was 17. My mother got hers when she was 11. Its all normal :)<br>  <br>  She will randomly get her period one day, when her body is ready. So there is no need to worry for now considering she is only 14.|`|lHfS4ueyaa	She might just get her period later then others I wouldn't worry untill she's almost 16|`|977ciAaGaa	Getting your period depends from person to person.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	The only reason to have a period is so you can reproduce. That's it, her body just isn't ready to carry children yet. Not saying that you are emotionally ready to carry children, but that is the only and sole reason that women have periods. It's expelling what didn't get made into a baby that month! My sister got her period at 9 and I didn't get mine til I was 14. Age has nothing to do with it, it's how the inner body is developed. Take it as not having your period as a god send!|`|0icbC7kHaa	your friend is YOU! ... any how going to the doctor will help, they will do blood test and tell you what vitamins u need to get ur period, my sister needed ore iron, she was really low on iron, but that was her case.|`|tVHFekZlaa	cup size matters not. My friend is a d cup and has not got it and i am 32a and got it 5 months ago. nothing is the problem just chill it will come. You can however start to worry when you are 18.|`|5OyM2PXpaa	Hi<br>  Nothing is wrong! I am a B-cup and my mom got her period when she was 16. I got it on the 9th of last month. I am 13. It is perfectly normal for her and her mom to differ:)|`|bm3R5Cq4aa	i got my period when i was 11.. so did my mom ... <br>  but my sister is now 14 and she still doesnt have hers... and shes more developed than i was when i was 14... <br>  <br>  but my sister ithink still doesnt have it, because when she was like 10 she lost a lot of weight really quicky, she doesnt eat, and she exersises a lot, and she is really thin... and that makes people stop getting their period, so she just never did,|`|YJgf8SzGaa	nothing my mom had a dcup in the sixth grade and didnt get hers till she was 16<br>  <br>  she was just lucky nothing wrong with that<br>  just make sure she gets checked out sometime after her 16-17 bday it might be an issue|`|K2vNnBnQaa	Everybody devolps at their own rate.|`|N4Tokvakaa	im an A something lol and im 11... im in sixth grade and i HAVENT had my period yet.<br>  <br>  idk everyones different ha ha

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>

qcnUZBAzaa	Hair color has nothing to do with it, maybe because Irish people have red hair, people may generalize, because the Irish are known for being able to hold their liquor. Weight has a lot to do with it, but hair color is totally irrelevant.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Makes no difference.  I was born with red hair and my cousins all have it.. we can all hold our liquor quite a bit better than average.  My wife is a redhead and a two drink drunk.  I used to shoot darts on a team that had a woman on it could drink more than anybody I ever say who was a redhead.  But a guy that I used to hang around with after work was a redhead and one beer he was showing it.  So hair color really has nothing to do with it.
KiVHOebQaa	cold is a viral infection. viral infection are usually self limiting. which means it goes away on its own.you dont drink medicine to cure it but just to relieve discomfort. advil or ibuprofen is an NSAIDs. it is an analgesic. it relieves pain and decreases your body temperature. if you have clogged nose you can use decongestant to relieve it. if you already cough out phlegm you can drink mucolytic or expectorant to help you cough out phlegm. those medicines ive mentioned are just to relieve the symptoms. just ease the discomfort. not to cure the Colds. the colds will go away in a week or 2.|`|ljifR0iEaa	Duro-Tuss.

The answer is no. <br>  Just diet and exercise in a healthy way (eating a significant amount, but exercising enough - not pigging out, without exercising it off, and not starving yourself.|`|LtIv573Daa	dont worry about it, if you ever feel too skinny, then just lay off the diet for a few weeks.

I was a junk food freak too, that's all I ate and I craved it all the time, and I haated vegetables. I never ate much beef or pork, and still do now, Overall I was a very picky eater.<br>  <br>  But I got over it, and surprisingly easily too! I started with a 3 day juice fast (water, "master cleanser", home made fruit and veggie juices, chamomile/green tea) and slowly introduced low-allergy foods back into my diet (I initially wanted to see if I could spot any food allergies). And I went hardcore, and still am. I got rid of all the crap in my cupboards, I stopped eating at restaurants and cooked all my own foods, rarely bought canned foods, avoided soda, hydrogenated oils, doughnuts, anything modified, anything artificial, natural flavor, and monosodium glutamate/msg like the plague. (Two good rules of thumb: If you can't pronounce it, don't eat it. The less ingredients, the better.) I never make any exceptions (well, once in a while I have one square of 85% cocoa chocolate of the highest quality, cocoa is known for good things when it's not loaded with sugars and milk (and I used to eat 2-10 chocolate bars a day! Now I don't even crave chocolate at all!!) I eat simple foods, and as little cooked as possible, I don't use the microwave, I buy organic and local when I can, and eat only whole grains. I don't eat wheat or beef or pork, and have plain & active yogurt and goat cheese once in a while. And you know what? I haven't gone crazy yet. I actually feel super satisfied about making these choices and can't believe how it's not hard for me to stick with it. You know what else? I actually love certain vegetables now! I can't believe it! The only thing I still hate is asparagus. I don't crave junk food anymore, I crave fruits. I've lost 15lbs (didn't exercise at all so I could have lost a lot more) practically all my headaches and cravings and find it easy to get up in the mornings now.<br>  <br>  The thing with vegetables that's great is that you can cook/steam/season them differently and they can taste totally different. I like my vegetables steamed, like green/yellow beans, brussel sprouts, broccoli, topped with homemade dressing of extra virgin olive oil, apple cider vinegar, fresh lemon juice, basil or italian spice. I also love to make vegetable stir fry with broccoli, garlic (garlic does wonders for you and is sooo good. I eat it raw now and it doesn't even taste zippy), bok choy, onion, crimini mushrooms (used to loooaaathe them), mung bean sprouts, zucchini or cucumber, sesame seeds and soy sauce. Experiment. And give it time. Once your tastebuds aren't hyped up by loads of chemicals and sweeteners from the foods you used to eat, things taste different, wholesome, and you can totally enjoy low sugar/sodium foods, sometimes even more than the stuff you used to eat in the past.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://whfoods.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://whfoods.org/index.html</a> has lots of information on fruits and vegetables and how to cook them, with lots of delicious easy and quick to make recipes. Take the "food advisor" test to see what nutrients you might be deficient in. I really love this website =)<br>  <br>  This is what I did and do, but everyone's body is different and doesn't react the same. One person's healthy food might be an irritant to another person. Listen to your body carefully, eat wholesome Real Food, eat in moderation, eat slowly and chew your food properly, and be active. If you do this, you don't need all those supplements and stomach gigglers! Don't give up! It might be hard at first but it gets easier =) If you have any questions, feel free to ask. <br>  <br>  I'd write a lot more as there's so many things you can do, but I'm going to run out of typing space...

sHEgcXHaaa	yeah, really anything that you think is bad for you, really is...<br>  We eat so much unnecessary foods that it's the reason america is so fat...<br>  Your body only uses so many calories (Energy that food gives you) per day...<br>  If you exercise, it needs more Calories...<br>  <br>  SO...if you take in too many calories, your body stores what it doesn't use in fat...<br>  If you don't eat enough, you're body uses what energy it has saved up for that purpose...<br>  <br>  So really you can lose weight with exercise, but if you eat too much calories a day, then you will still gain weight, or stay the same weight if you don't cut down your calories...<br>  <br>  And even if you have poor cardiovascular endurance...what you really need to do is GET SOME...<br>  It's hard at first...but once you get used to it it really isn't hard at all...<br>  It's as if there's a barrier thats really tall to get over, but once you're over then you're on the other side...<br>  <br>  So basically if you don't want to get fat...EXERCISE...<br>  There's no other way...and if you want it to work twice as fast, then cut down on crap food.<br>  <br>  Do NOT use Diet pills, and I'm pretty sure that the Acai Berry that someone keeps spamming this websites comments with, is probably fake too...<br>  Diet pills and such work, but make one even unhealthier than one was before one takes them...|`|1FAggU5Zaa	stop eating at night eat like a light cereal... <br>  then STOP going to eat to fast food places!

GvBtoKsqaa	keep eating good. drink plenty of water (64oz daily minimum) and do cardio exercises if you aren't already.<br>  <br>  Doing ab exercises will not help you lose the love handles, all you can do is keep working to reduce your overall body fat.|`|QBa60Hvfaa	hoola hoop|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

I eat lots to try and gain weight, but nothing ever happens. Some people just have a small body frame and have a fast metabolism so they are just naturally skinny and healthy. You're saying that you have to use the washroom almost immediately after you eat. It might be possible that your body isn't absorbing the nutrients in the food you're eating because it's forced out of your body so fast. But I'm not a doctor it's just an idea. You can always talk to a doctor if you're concerned about your weight.
Z9QazmpVaa	I know the feeling and it's totally normal.. It's normal as long as it never gets to the point where it is drastic and you get super depressed but it doesn't sound that way to me.. try and drink lots and lots of water it will actually decrease bloating and may get rid of some of the nausea.. the moodiness if you just need to be by yourself then thats ok.. and if you like to exercise or play sports that can help with cramps and put you in better mood as well just remember it's normal and it's ok if you get sluggish.. it happens to all of us.. it stinks being female!|`|ZOKEWd5Daa	u can find all u need about pms in these 2 articles <a href="http://teensandhealth.blogspot.com/2009/02/premenstrual-syndromesymptomscauses-and.html" rel="nofollow">http://teensandhealth.blogspot.com/2009/...</a> and this for the treatemnts u asked for  <a href="http://teensandhealth.blogspot.com/2009/02/premenstrual-syndrometreatment.html" rel="nofollow">http://teensandhealth.blogspot.com/2009/...</a>

sXeyRD9taa	Don't be scared, I think every girl is scared because you don't really know what's coming you know? And you don't know how it feels. I was 12 when I got mine. I was actually happy to get it(only for that day). It may be a little uncomfortable at first, but you'll get used to it. It's really not the period that hurts. It's just the cramps that really hurt. But it's not as bad as some women put it out to be(but then again everyone is different). Just relax and enjoy childhood. Growing up is scary but you eventually get over it, trust me I was like you five years ago(time goes by fast!).|`|tVHFekZlaa	boob size does not matter in the whole shadele as long as you have started developing. most girls start from 9-16. if the discharge gets too annoying then you can wear a panty liner.

Just wait and it'll come when your body is ready!|`|dpgXzMenaa	Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot* (enough to soak a pair of panties in a couple of hours), so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.|`|d8UjaIEmaa	I got my period in sixth grade when I was 11. Don't be scared. Discharge is very normal and it happens to every girl. It may be annoying but trust me periods are even more annoying. I can't tell you when you will get your period because I don't know, no one does. Only time will tell. You have to be patient. People say you can have discharge from 6-18 months before starting your period. When you get it just tell your mom, no big deal. And bring a pad with you everywhere because you never know! And enjoy having a period free life when you can. Back aches and stomach aches are so not my cup of tea! You're only in 6 grade as wale,  you have got plenty of time!|`|TQCHEKu6aa	Don;t be embarrassed. I was at first-trust me. Anyway, get Always thin pads and put them in your panties and use those. If you need a place to hide them in school that is accessible wear boots and stick one way down it so it won't come out by accident or put it somewhere else. Your period is probably far off, it depends if you have all the hair, moodiness, cramps, cravings, etc! I've had HEAVY discharge for three whole years and it's still not here! Just be prepared because Mother Nature may pop out of nowhere.|`|AA11097638	Get your mom to make an appt to the doctor. Checking it out never hurt anything.

Maybe occassionally, but try looking for alternatives like frozen fruit yoghurt? or only buy sugar free and fat free ice cream if you REALLY have to.|`|wIZNsqG1aa	Moderation is the key, just have small portions. You may also want to try frozen yogurt it has less fat and sugar.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	I think the key to a diet is not banning any type of food, or you will feel as if you are depriving yourself.  If you really want to eat some icecream, then you should have a reasonable portion (maybe 1/2 a cup at the most).  If you eat the whole carton you definitely blew any type of diet. Also you should try the Skinny Cow ice cream sandwiches or ice cream popsicles.  I'm not kidding you, these taste like full fat ice cream cookies but they are super low fat, like maybe 2 grams of fat.  The popsicle ones are good too.  They have a mint ice cream dipped in chocolate popsicle.  MMMMMMmm yum its so good, and low fat.  Also I like frozen yogurt as an alternative to ice cream.  A good low fat frozen yogurt topped off with some fruit is super yummy.  Anyways, if you really want the butter pecan ice cream still, have a little of it.  Then make up for it at another meal, like holding back the cheese off of a sandwich or eating an apple instead of a cookie.  Starving and not eating things you like will only make you gain weight because eventually you will give in to your cravings.  Its all about portions.|`|sJZXhPxyaa	ice cream not good for a diet.<br>  <br>  i know there's weird tofutti ice cream snacks out there.  they're actually not that bad.  sugar-free froyo, sherbet, and popsicles or shaved ice are also alternatives.|`|fOfqPATaaa	Anythings fine in moderation =)<br>  Eddy's Ice Cream has some amazing low calorie ice creams!|`|Vyw9fsFkaa	umm,, only if u puke afterwards.

SlkAl1G2aa	Apple Cider Vinegar, despite its name, is basic, which is sort of the PH antithesis of vinegar. It helps make your body more alkaline which is a good thing.<br>  <br>  For weight loss it helps stops the absorption of some of the fat in digestion and highers your metabolism which may aid in weight loss. Along with this it has a myriad of benefits, lowered blood pressure, healthier higher, and more regular bowel movements.<br>  <br>  To take it simply start with mixing one tablespoon into either a glass of water of juice. It is a very  strong taste at first but you'll get used to it and start enjoying the benefits!|`|fOfqPATaaa	I heard it speeds your metabolism but it tastes so nasty =(|`|1PId0SOGaa	It killed my athletes foot like nothing!!
WRQMTLxjaa	No. You can miss periods because of stress, or if your periods are sometimes irregular.|`|qljdLoyRaa	Don't worry about it.  I didn't get my period once for 5 months.  Sometimes your cycle (especially starting out) is irregular.  Stress and exercise can easily influence it.|`|RPoFBenJaa	omg girl. No, you are not pregnant.

One does not happen without the other.  Your period may be irregular due to hormones or excess excercise or dieting.  Each of these will impact your menstrual cycle.  Finally, if you are making out with your partner, without penetration, but close...you may actually  have sperm travel into the vaginal canal and produce pregnancy.  If you are not sexually active, than you are not pregnant.|`|b1bBbvCtaa	dnt wry its normal <br>  dnt sweat it

Whenever you do something sexual like this - with a partner, or even by yourself, you should pee after to clear out the urethra so bacteria isn't left there that can cause a UTI.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|9EkFrApiaa	You can't "loose" weight but you can "lose" it.  ;)<br>  <br>  You have to diet and I am sorry you find it difficult-- that is why it is called DIETING...no one finds it easy.  Unless you are focused and relentless with your foods-- you won't lose it.<br>  <br>  Cut out almost ALL carbs and sugars.  Eat only veggies, fruits and lean protein (i.e. chicken and fish).  That is sure to slim you down.

The headache sounds normal but if it's the kind of go to the hospital headache, then go to the hospital.<br>  <br>  Yeah, you are going to have side effects from going off this medication and as long as they are the ones your doctor mentioned to you then you should be okay and they'll pass.<br>  Treat your headache like any other and try an over the counter pain med. and drinks lots, I mean lots of water.  Maybe a cold pack for your head and a hot pack for your neck while you're resting.<br>  <br>  Your feelings of anger are probably the same as if you'd never been on this medication.  You just forgot what they felt like or the feelings were just out of reach and now they're on the surface.  Take a deep breath and try to relax through it.<br>  Talk to your doctor.  Maybe you can even consider the possibility of taking the meds. again if it gets too bad...<br>   I don't know.
AA11311516	I have been dealing with anxiety like all my life, and this is very common. My hands and feet get really cold and tingly.

But any, you've got the right medicine now and it should start making you feel better soon.<br>  God bless and help make you better soon.|`|7ywyOq4caa	I'm pretty sure it is, bronchitis just means that your bronchial tubes are inflamed, and pneumonia is when your air sacs fill with fluid, so I think that you can have both at the same time.|`|jNKhiyuIaa	Yeah its possible cuz I have the same thing.

7RbootLlaa	I was having very weird dreams myself there at one stage. There were a comination of factors. Stress being a major one.<br>  But when I was seeking assistance, I was told not to drink after 3 pm Orange juice or anything that contained citric acid. Which I had been drinking. So I stopped and the dreams decreased. 9 months later to now, I don't experience weird dreams - you just made me realise that.<br>  <br>  If that does not help? Do not sleep during the day or take small naps. This will affect your sleep pattern at night. Try and be relaxed when you go off to sleep. Positive thoughts, maybe some music in the background.<br>  I'm really at logger heads with this suggestion with myself. You could do some excerises or an activity that makes you work, as so to make yourself tired, it should make yourself go to sleep, but you could also become over tired - so tired, you can not sleep.

I love dogs, but owners have to be responsible or everyone suffers.  You will feel awful from the shots, but you must do it to be safe. Make this person pay what is due for not getting the dog his shots. It is required by law through our whole country to get rabies shots for dogs and cats.  Even horses get shots in many areas because the disease is so deadly to all mammals. <br>  <br>  Call your local animal control, county and/or city attorney about this jerk of a neighbor.  Then get an attorney, preferably a well known attorney, who will take your case on a contingency (takes part of the settlement and you don't pay anything).  You deserve the money for this.<br>  <br>  Has this dog hurt or threatened anyone else in your neighborhood?  Talk to them about it. Call the newspapers, tv or anyone who will listen while that bite is visible.  Do what you can do to get some justice here.  I feel sorry for the dog, but not the owner.  You should get your medical bills paid at the very least.  I hope that everything goes well for you.  This should never have happened.

9snxL5MMaa	Its no problem...you have several options to choose from...starting with the most appropriate one if its just a small part of your tooth that has chipped off the dentist can fix it or rebuild it with a material called as composite it matches your tooth colour 100%..<br>  <br>  Your next option is Porcelain Veneers it is also very aesthetic but the only problem here being they will cut your tooth to accommodate the veneer.<br>  <br>  The last option that you have is to go for a full ceramic crown on the tooth but this involves gross reduction of the tooth and why would one wanna cut down good tooth structure.<br>  <br>  So i guess your best option is a composite build-up..its strong aesthetic.and cheaper on the pocket than the crown and veneers.<br>  <br>  But ya do one thing before you get your tooth fixed just make sure that you take an x-ray of the tooth just to check that your nerve is not affected or damaged with the blow..cause if it is then you might have to get a root canal done and then put a crown on the tooth.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!<br>  <br>  Pathfinder!!|`|Pe44FuUQaa	Just like how dentists can give celebrities, models, etc. caps on their teeth to give them perfectly rounded teeth, dentists can fix chipped teeth. I had one of my teeth fixed when it was chipped. They sort of filed off some of the tooth and put stuff on it and it looks and seems like it did before it was chipped. (Sorry I don't know all the technical terms for all of it, but I'm pretty sure it can be done.)|`|1LPvMbXAaa	Your best option is probably a porcelain veneer. The dentist will grind off a thin layer of the front and top of your tooth and place a thin porcelain shell on it instead.<br>  <br>  This will look completely natural as the porcelain, just like a natural tooth, is a bit translucent. Veneers are also used to correct dark and permanently stained teeth - the way most movie stars get their movie star smile.<br>  <br>  If your tooth is only chipped on the top then a porcelain crown would be an expensive over-kill and a white filling (a polymer plastic compound) would only be a short term soluiton as it is not durable enough to last long.|`|8xSd0qX6aa	They can fix a chipped tooth...

It's not your lungs that heal, its just your body systems returning to normal function. Your Risk for developing disease decrease the longer you go without smoking.<br>  <br>  Cigarette smoking is the major cause of emphysema and Chronic Bronchitis.<br>  <br>  When exposed to cigarette smoke, the air sacs of the lungs produce defensive cells, called macrophages, which "eat" the inhaled particles. But macrophages are stimulated to release materials which can destroy the proteins that let the lungs expand and contract, called elastin and collagen. This thins the walls of the alveoli and causes a decrease in difussion capacity, so your body can't take in as much oxygen. It also makes the bronchial walls flimsy so they close easier and trap air in the lungs. This is called Emphysema.<br>  <br>  Cigarette smoke also damages the cilia, tiny hair-like projections in the bronchi that "sweep" foreign bodies and bacteria out of the lungs. Your lungs aren't able to evacuate mucus so it builds up making you cough all the time. a cough for 3 consecutive months for 2 consecutive years is defined as Chronic Bronchitis.<br>  <br>  Any damage done to lung Tissue i.e. alveolar and bronchiolar walls is permenant, but not untreatable. Lung tissue does not heal itself. However your blood levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide does return close to normal depending on how long you smoked and how much damage is done. There are lots of wonderful medicines that help people manage lung disease and have very productive lives.<br>  <br>  This probably isn't what you wanted to hear, and I'm not trying to discourage you but it is fact.

LZqPWxJhaa	the lymphatic system is composed of a network of thin vessels that branch, like blood vessels, into tissues throughout the body. Lymphatic vessels carry lymph, a colorless, watery fluid originating from interstitial fluid (fluid in the tissues) which is squeezed out of the blood vessels. The lymphatic system transports infection-fighting cells called lymphocytes, is involved in the removal of foreign matter and cell debris by phagocytes and is part of the body's immune system. One part of it also transports fats from the small intestine to the blood.<br>  <br>  Lymphatic fluid gathers from the tissues and enters the valved lymphatic ducts. This 'lymph fluid' then passes back to the heart. On its way its passes through special nodular glands known as 'glands' or Lymph nodes, which are concentrated in certain zones such as the back of the neck, the armpits and the groin. When a lymph node detects a possible threat passing into it in the lymph (such as a bacterium), it swells up. This is why lymph nodes swell in the region of an infected body part. Generalized lymphadenopathy (all the nodes of the body are swollen) can indicate systemic illness such infection or cancer. When generalized lymphadenopathy persists it is known as persistent generalized lymphadenopathy.<br>  <br>  What this all means for you is that you say that you were sick a few days ago.  The lymph nodes respond to that-it is their job.  <br>  <br>  You have nothing to worry about.  This is normal.  <br>  The nodes are not likely to swell due to your period, btw.|`|G6jTu4Ibaa	relax these are your playing days not to worry like this, this all will be gone within next few months.

I have dealt with depression since I was a young child, and I really don't know what would have helped.  My mother recognized that something was wrong, but the teachers and counselors kept saying that she was just worrying too much.  I had major crying jags, sometimes for no real reason, I felt "weird" or "out of my body" a lot, and it made me really scared.  I couldn't sleep right and spent a lot of time sitting up in bed scared of everything around me.  I had really low self esteem, and could be really withdrawn at times but very hyper and talkative to an extreme at other times.<br>  <br>  I think an understanding therepist can do wonders, and just being there and being a "rock" for this young person can help.
FhKtIk2Paa	There is a serious difference between delusions/hallucinations and mood swings that are normally associated with bipolar disorder.  I think your brother needs to go to a psychologist/psychiatrist and get a second opinion- it could be a misdiagnosis (he's not bipolar- it's something else).  <br>  <br>  If he is taking the wrong perscription because of a misdiagnosis he may not get better or he could suffer side effects and get worse.

szjpsPdXaa	Let's all agree that hospital staff are overworked! But, the patient care should not suffer as a result.  My Mom was just released from the hospital, and it was a battle everyday to get her the proper medical  care she needed.  I had to go to the nurses station many times to get her help.  Among the other things I did, I brought in my own blood pressure monitor and glucose monitor because they were not checking her enough.  I was spending 12 to 14 hours a day at the hospital because I was afraid to leave her in the hands of the nursing staff.   I can honestly say that there were many nurses watching over her who were just apathetic.   I would say that of all the nurses and staff who had anything to do with my Mom, only 2 nurses went our of their way to "CARE" for her.  Overwork is not a good enought excuse, or an acceptable one.   My Mom could have died if they had released from the hospital they day they wanted to.  I pleaded with the nursing staff all day not to let her go. I finally found a nurse who truly cared about her patients and she saved my Mom.  By the way, this nurse works two jobs, has two kids, and is a single mother.  So I thank God this nurse didn't use overwork as an excuse for not doing her best for her patients.  No, she did her job!  Thank-you nurse  Tonya at Mease Countryside in Dunedin, Florida<br>  <br>  I cannot believe people are saying, pay them more, give them day care, better hours, know  everything about your condition so you can monitor what the staff is doing to you....are you kidding me.

Its a part of the norm nowadays simply because they are underpaid, if you are hoping to find a fix for this problem try finding funds for a hospital day care for the kids, a pay raise for the staff, so that way it is adusted to where the staff can work a normal amount of hours, and be able to drive w.o fighting the sleep from hitting them while they are driving home, and are not having to work overtime so that they have money to pay a babysitter.<br>  <br>  also, a good way to prevent mistakes from happening is to pay attention to what you are being given so that you can ask a doctor if it is safe for you if you are allergice to certain medications that contain asprin and what not. communication is a big part of prevention. the doctors and staff are not psychics|`|7RbootLlaa	I was present when this guy collaspsed.

I wonder how often that happens? Plenty of times no doubt.<br>  <br>  Staff could be tired, overworked, lazy. I notice when a doctor in Australia kills a patient, it's always someone else's fault like a nurse.<br>  <br>  More so in the last 12 years there has been a massive increase in Indian (India) doctors and they have absolutely no clue on how to treat a patient.|`|MlJr5YlSaa	Hospital staff is overworked.

ZjhQ6PL8aa	If the arrhythmia is caused by a medication then when you stop taking the medication it'll go away.  If it didn't go away then it wasn't the result of the medication.  As far as it preventing you from getting the job no it shouldn't unless it impairs your ability to physically do the job.  After all they hire some women who clearly can't do the job physically and still hire african americans and that race has a higher risk factor for heart disease and hypertension.
8xSd0qX6aa	Periodontal disease is an infection of the tissues that support the teeth. <br>  <br>  Teeth are supported by the gums, or gingiva. A tooth's root is anchored to its socket by fibers called periodontal ligaments.<br>  <br>  if you want to get the stain out i say you go and see a Dentist about it ... dont go using anything like that until you know for sure.. you dont want to make the disease worse than it already is .<br>  <br>  Use a toothpaste you can buy that will take the stain away .. <br>  <br>  heres some tips that might help you<br>  <br>  Brushing<br>  Brushing cannot completely wipe stains and plaques from you teeth, but regular, proper brushing will definitely keep them at the minimum.<br>  <br>  First of all, brush your teeth at least twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, which works against tooth decay. If you are brushing with a traditional toothbrush, use one with a small head and soft bristles. Evidence shows that electric toothbrushes are generally more effective in removing plaque than manual brushes, so you may want to invest in one. Make sure not to rinse your mouth out immediately after brushing, since fluoride needs to stay in contact with your teeth to build up your tooth enamel, which protects from stains.<br>  <br>  Using Whitening Toothpastes<br>  Contrary to what the name suggests, whitening toothpastes are not meant to increase the whiteness of your tooth. They actually work by removing the stains from your tooth so that the underlying whiteness shows through. Whitening toothpastes contain special chemical ingredients that dissolve the sticky protein and acidic layers on teeth deposited by coffee, tea, tobacco, wine, and other foods.<br>  <br>  Some whitening toothpaste brands contain harsh abrasives that can, in the long term, rob your teeth of their essential enamel coating. <br>  <br>  Bleaching<br>  The difference between tooth bleach and whitening toothpaste is that while toothpastes remove stains to reveal the underlying whiteness of your teeth, bleaches remove stains and actually make your teeth whiter. Bleaching is a cosmetic treatment that can easily produce a stain-free smile.<br>  <br>  Bleaching is not meant for those people with sensitive teeth or damaged gums. Bleach can cause extreme pain if applied on sensitive teeth or diseased gums<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  well i hope i helped you <br>  Good luck <br>  and take care|`|1LPvMbXAaa	The disease that affects your gum is called periodontitis and it is an inflammation in the gum pockets around the roots of your teeth. If it is a mild or beginning case, then it can be treated with a thorough tooth cleaning maybe combined with antibiotic treatment.<br>  <br>  If it is a bit more progressed, then you will need 'closed curettage' which means that your tooth pockets are scraped clean by a dental surgeon.<br>  <br>  If it is far progressed, then you may need 'open curettage' which means that your tooth pockets are cut open in order to get further down with the knife/scraper.<br>  <br>  Far progressed periodontitis will affect your jaw bones which will loose mass and density and your teeth will no longer have 'solid ground' to sit in, so they get loose or fall out.<br>  <br>  I organize dental treatments in Hungary and I have seen several cases where the inflammation has gone untreated for so long that the only viable option is to pull the teeth and replace them with a prothesis. As the jaw bone of these patients have gone back dramatically, then only a few have the alternative to get (very expensive) bone reconstruction (also called bone augmentation or sinus lift if it is in your upper jaw) and then an implant supported bridge. <br>  <br>  If you think you have early stage periodontitis, then go see a professional as soon as possible. Believe me, you do not want your go to the stage of progressed periodontitis.

jNKhiyuIaa	Cover your head in baby oil and put a grocery bag over it, then wash it and comb it out well in the morning. They can't breathe in baby oil.

Those school nurses do not really know. <br>  Ask them to prove that you have lice if they say you do. They did this to my daughter in first grade. I freaked out and took her to the doctor. She never had lice!  I hate public school. If schools were decent places, there wouldn't be problems like this!|`|FkE5ORinaa	cut your hair or make sure to wash alot, and dont use gel( it gives you dander)|`|cK07UqtDaa	Just suck it up and see what the nit checking person says as if you do have head lice they will be able to advise you on how to treat them and prevent future outbreaks!

You can maybe kill lice, but the nits usually won't come off without a lice comb. Besides, if you do have it...you need to know.

It's basically the same concept as baby oil, but there's something about the ingredient composition of mayonnaise that hits them just right. I know it sounds disgusting, but that's what my mom used to do when we were kids, and I swear it works like a charm. <br>  <br>  And even if you don't have lice, your hair will be super shiny when you wash it out the next morning-- it may even help with your dry scalp! :]

Cancer is awful and the horrible thing about it is that the people who are closest to you will turn away from you because they "didn't know what to say."

Or just get the laxative but that could cause cramping and pain.|`|3NOMsk25aa	It is probably gas. Lay on your side on your bed or the floor and pull your knees up to your chest. This should help to 'release' the gas:)haha. It works! Also, you could get on your knees and bend forward hugging your knees to your chest, same position as before but verticle. good luck. If that doesn't work try and sit on the toilet for a while.

May not be done by all doctors. I believe they do it if they're going to do a sinus lift.|`|VriZPTHbaa	Implants are latest to replace the missing teeth; a dental implant is broken up into three phases. Phase one is the actual surgical placement of the implant. The second phase is the abutment that screws into the implant. The third phase is the actual crown that is cemented onto the abutment. I've had my two upper front teeth replaced by implants last year. After my surgery it just felt like I've had my wisdom teeth removed. Yes you can eat almost anything because there's a tissue conditioner on the temporary denture so that the area to be implanted will be safe from trauma!  So before proceeding for the implants save some money to pay out of pocket and then proceed. If you are in urgent need, travel abroad to country like India. Here the dental implants prices are quite cheap.<br>  <br>  Here is a good place for that purpose <a href="http://www.indianhealthguru.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianhealthguru.com</a>

efc2bc05e05812cdbccb77db99dad890aa	I was in the same situation just a year ago. I found out 6 months into my relationship that my boyfriend gave me Chlamydia. He was my first for everything, so I know I got it from him. When I got that phone call... ugh. I went psycho (probably just like your boyfriend). Being told you have an STD by someone you love is really hard to bare. I went through many MANY weeks crying, feeling guilty for myself, and hating him. I think it was a phase. Honestly, we didn't have sex until about 3 months after that. I just couldn't think of anything but the STD. <br>  <br>  The only thing I can tell you to do is have him get tested. You said that you ALWAYS wore a condom, so chances are that he doesn't have it. And honestly, do you know if your boyfriend doesn't have Chlamydia himself? It's very very common. Make sure to tell him this. And, when you go in for treatment, ask the doctor if your boyfriend could go in too. I asked mine and my boyfriend came in with me, and they doctor even gave him and me the antibiotic to get rid of it. It was very very simple to get rid of. Just make sure to get tested in a few more weeks after treatment to make sure its gone. Once the STD is out of your (or both) bodies, the air will kinda clear out. Just have your boyfriend get tested. It's not gonna hurt. And if he comes back negative for it, then he has no reason to be mad at you. Make sure to tell him that you never cheated on him and you got it from an old boyfriend. Also, please talk to your old boyfriend and tell him that you tested positive for Chlamydia. Send it through a myspace message or text or something. Chances are he won't say anything back, but at least you did the right thing and told him that he has an STD. I hope I helped! Just get your boyfriend tested, get treated, and go on from there. Just let your boyfriend have his space because this can be really really hard on some people (myself included). After the STD is gone, talk about what you are feeling and whether or not both of you want to stay in this relationship. I'm still with the guy who gave me Chlamydia. We've been dating for over a year now. It was hard to trust him and it took a lot of time to do it again, but it happened. Good luck!|`|JhmtZPKzaa	Isn't chlamydia really treatable with antibiotics? I don't see the problem if both of you can get rid of it. How would he like it if he gave it to you and u were that closed-minded about it? Because it can happen to anyone. He's being very immature. Let him steam off, and in the meantime do a bit of research on it, so u have the facts on ur side. Because sounds like he's just concerned about the stigma. I'd take facts over stigma any day.|`|n3JtVTgSaa	dont worry so much..i think you can get rid of that in 2 weeks and if he loves you then he'll get over it..give him time and reassurance..u should get in touch with the ex to let him know so he doesnt spread it around ne more and everyone can get it taken care of..its really not that big odeal..he is just wigging..wouldnt you be|`|nXAvk8B8aa	okay explain to him this one fact chlamydia is slient meaning you may never know for a very long period of time and frankly he doesnt have it but he might think you cheated but i know you didnt from experince so just relax and tell him that you didnt know because truly i know you didnt i jus recently found out i had it as well and it was long beofre my new boyfriend but he understood and we got pass it|`|AA12009593	first of all, I would focus on yourself. get yourself treated and see what the doctors can do about your situation and preventing the spread of it. and I would let your ex know so he doesn't infect anyone else. and tell whoever he has had sex with that he has an STD.<br>  I think your boyfriend is an idiot. you'll get over him.|`|SqExrSUGaa	well, that's not a good thing.<br>  <br>  but there is a plus side, Chlamydia is treatable.<br>  if your current boyfriend cares about you, he should be atleast somewhat more reasonable, but i would get it checked out and cured.<br>  <br>  i hope everything gets better dear.|`|OyRX3OxLaa	not ,much you can do really. just wait for him to be willing to return and see what can be done, or otherwise move on.

Make sure you sit on the toilet so you dont poo on the floor|`|AnzssI8Zaa	look for it deeper, if you can't find it then call a doctor<br>  men's health? hahaha
WXkTi3JWaa	Use a sharper razor.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Use a sharper razor.<br>  <br>  Shave in the shower, with a fog-resistant shower mirror. (As long as you're not blind without glasses or contacts.)<br>  <br>  Use Mach-3 or better.<br>  <br>  If possible, shave less often - let the hairs get some length again before shaving. I'm 34, and I shave 2-3 times per week because of red bumps on the neck.|`|uNgw08cuaa	Dont push down very hard. Just slide it down without much pressure. Its okay to go over it more than once or twice to get it all. And make sure you use enough shave gel/cream|`|5eLqZz0Baa	Rinse the shaving cream with the soft brush until the hair are soft. Do not shave from downward to upward. let the hair grow and then shave you will get a smooth shave.|`|AA12098929	Dear use Gillette save gel with extra conditioner along with Mach-5 razor.

rzBxRw7Haa	Hi there<br>  you could have a condition called 'orchitis', my hubby had it and it was painful, this can give pain in the testicles and lower abdomen and will require antibiotics to clear it so visit your doctor and have it checked out. good luck|`|AA11832714	If there has been a change after pain and it persists, Then You would be crazy not to go and see a Doctor.You only have one body, and You had better look after it.
uVMlNvLoaa	Try a progesterone-only pill. A lot of women get menstrual migraines due to the estrogen/estradiol in the pill.<br>  <br>  Also, Mirena is progesterone only, as well as some other products out there. The depo shot is also progesterone only,  which is prolly why you liked it more.<br>  <br>  Some types of BC are just better for others, and devastating for some.

36Ps6EO7aa	Preporation H is good.  Suppositories with cortisone can reduce inflammation.  Some doctors can give treatments in their office that can greatly reduce inflammation and size of the hemorrhoids.  Diet is very important.  Constipation and straining while going to the bathroom can really make it worse.  eat a diet with high fiber, lots of fruits, and drink plenty of water./  The last resort is a hemorrhoidectomy but that is a last resort because if you don't change your diet or lifestyle, they can return.  That's usually saved if they are so severe, and all other treatment options fail.  By the way I had a hemorrhoidectomy in my late 20's because of bleeding hemorrhoids.  It took two operations and it took them away.|`|UxCnpkJaaa	Let me get this straight:  Modern medicine? No.  Yahoo answers? Yes?

OyRX3OxLaa	when is the last time something bigger than a tampon got in there...if there ever has been any.|`|cVhuFVWSaa	The only thing I know about pain with tampons is if it hurts then you are using too high of an absorbancy than your flow needs. Try smaller ones and if your period is really light use panty liners instead.|`|1ed613bb747b97b7785ed2c62ec2b592aa	take your time when you insert one. try moving down to a smaller size (i use the smallest size you can get, i think they are called slim fits) and alternating tampons with pads. if you are still having problems give your obgyn a call and let them know whats going on.|`|2d0e2362a0c1bafcca4c468550b4eba5aa	Well it depends, did you JUST take a tampon out before hand that wasnt completely full (either you took it out too soon, or you are using a tampon with to high of an absorbency rate)<br>  For me, if I do either of those, and I try to put a new tampon in right away, im pretty much dying because its so darn dry in there lol!<br>  You may also have ovarian cysts. My mother developed those a few years back (and got them removed, most of the time they do not cause any damage at all, but you have to have surgery)<br>  Anyways, she is unable to wear tampons because of this.<br>  When are you due for your early paptest?<br>  If so, Id just tell the doctor about it and see what they say|`|az0KD0POaa	change the angle a little bit.|`|GOc5N22Oaa	You might have TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome)|`|AA12098929	Dear stop using tampon immediately.

So I fall down the stairs and I jerk/twitch myself awake...XD Odd huh?|`|d3OaReBYaa	I go through the same thing, it is probably just that your having an image in your mind when your brain is not fully asleep so it processes it as a real image so it causes your body to jerk to wake you up.

sBJOOErMaa	I have been using it for a month and it works great.  Everyone's skin is different, it might work for some and not for others.  <br>  The only way to find out is to try it.|`|4hR06Styaa	I know you said not to answer if you haven't used Pro-Active, but you don't have any other answers yet (that I could see) so Im gonna.  My friend used Pro-Active and she said that it did work.  But now she uses a product from Wal-Mart called Acne Free and says it works JUST as well as Pro-Active and is WAY cheaper!  I also use Acne Free and it works for me as well.  Here in California it runs for about $18 for a bottle of facewash, toner, and moisturizer.  It's advertised here as being compared to Pro-Active.  In today's economy, I would recommend trying the Acne Free to see if it works.  Just my opinion.|`|V5bN02t0aa	everybody had always told me to just wash my face and make sure i dont eat food that's too fatty but I think we know that that doesn't always work. my mom got me this product called clear pores from this website,  <a href="http://sn.vc/clearpores" rel="nofollow">http://sn.vc/clearpores</a> , and i didn't really wanna try it out but it worked out pretty well, i gotta say. the thing i liked about it was that it actually manages to prevent the acne, not just clearing up what's already there.|`|E6A8MKZwaa	After trying it out for 2 months, I gave up on it.  It didn't help one tiny bit for me.  I really didn't like it.  Then I got Acne Free Severe, which cleared up my acne.|`|lPrigrNbaa	Honestly proactive does work, but to what extent depends on your skin for every person is different. But it can be bad for my sister used it and she became very allergic to almost everything under the sun. Also you become dependent on it for if you stop using it you break out really badly; but it really depends on your body.|`|lc9nus8taa	GO TO THE DOCTOR ITS THE ONLY CURE THAT WORKS AND LASTS DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON STUFF LIKE THAT.|`|AQ9JxT5xaa	Proactive is not that effective cuz you have to basically use a bunch of the 2nd step, which is a liquid that opens up your pores.  <br>  Then you have to use large amounts of the 3rd step all over your face to actually see a difference.  The reason why I don't use the 1st step is because it just cleans your skin.  So if you shower before you use Proactive you do not need to use the 1st step since the shower already cleans your skin.
p2TCIUfRaa	Braces are always a pain, but its worth it in the end if you take good care of your mouth.<br>  -avoid hard foods/candy; these can break your braces<br>  -avoid eating taffy and certain brands of gum. these can get stuck on your brackets and it would be difficult to clean them.<br>  -floss your teeth and brush well. teeth can become infected if not brushed/flossed properly.<br>  -after you get your braces off, keep your retainers in your mouth. only take it out during meal times or when youre brushing your teeth. otherwise, you will have to wear braces again.<br>  Thats all i can think of rt now. Your orthodontist will explain more do's and dont's once he applies them to your teeth.<br>  Good luck for the next 2 or so yrs with your new braces!|`|lXpGlAm3aa	They will be sore for the first week or so.<br>  Avoid hard foods,chewy foods etc. Your dentist will advise you on what to eat.Probably baby food,yogurt and ice cream.<br>  <br>  Don't eat hard candy,gum, and ice while your braces are on.Brush day and night.Also floss alot.You should be fine.If you take good care while the braces are on,you will love your new teeth when they come off!!!|`|N14LLgy2aa	you should avoid eating anything sticky or hard such as candy or popcorn
c387d3b011886c724f500a89309da227aa	I'm a dentist in Mexico and I think its a lot of money for a consultation, but, dentistry in USA is way too expensive in comparison with Mexico, I had braces while living in USA (about 10 years ago) and payed a total of 9,000 dllss for the whole treatment (about 3 years), in Mexico this cost you like 900 dlls for the whole treatment. <br>  <br>  For what you are saying, your canine has a malposition and you maybe needing a orthodontic treatment which as I told you is not cheap and it takes time. You need a personal consultations since everybody's bones and teeth are different and what work for someone may not work for you, your age is another point to take in consideration, also, you need to know when you get an Ortho treatment first the Orthodoncist will ask you to get all your cavities done, you may also need some teeth to be removed (most of the time premolars) and those are expensive in the USA too. <br>  <br>  How bad does it look?

c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	About 6 to 8 weeks after...|`|oC3mzKG8aa	Difficult question to answer.  Some women bleed for upto 6 weeks after their baby is born and then it gets heavier, some worry the bleeding from birth is getting worse however it is more likely to be a period. Periods will be irratic following childbirth especially if you are breastfeeding, but be warned you will be at your most fertile.

My brother and I went roller skating a lot when we were younger.  I always fell on my knees instead of my butt where I've got more padding.  My knees were always black and blue.  As a result of that, years later I've got awful knee problems, had 4 surgeries, and can't be as active as I used to be.  Be careful.
xRQAsGRAaa	Creatine dehydrates your muscles, so when taking it you must drink 1-2 gallons of water every day to keep them hydrated. <br>  Creatine could have very likely caused your arm to hurt, because it may have been dehydrated.<br>  <br>  I also want to make sure you're cycling your creatine. 3 weeks on, 1 week off. This is due to your body can become dependent on creatine if you take it long enough without a break. Your body will then stop naturally producing it, which could be very bad.|`|xQAcZkhGaa	No it doesn't. I take creatine myself for baseball I had the same problem except I felt pain and achyness in my shoulder and forearm. They're just sore from working out and the new build in the muscle mass.
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Have you mentioned this to your Dr???|`|AA10481903	Generally, breast feeding prevents the return of your menstrual cycle.<br>  <br>  WHY are you anemic?????????  You are not menstruating, so you are not losing blood/iron through that mechanism.  Your doctor needs to determine WHY you are anemic and not just push iron pills at you!<br>  <br>  Best wishes and good luck.|`|aVU92nXOaa	Regular breastfeeding can cause a delay in the return of normal periods, but it only happens if you're feeding every couple of hours.  Severe anemia by itself is unlikely to cause a delay in your period.  Have you had a dramatic change in weight?  Are you eating a balanced diet? Any other symptoms like heat or cold intolerance?  Did you have serious blood loss during delivery?  Your doctor should check you for a number of hormonal issues, including possible problems with your thyroid, pituitary, and ovaries.  Good luck
Nt7exGYAaa	You should be ok, just have a reliever handy in case she needs it. By this I mean if she gets really enthusiastic and caught up in the act (I'm trying to be polite here lol) she could end up with a slight wheezing at the end of it. It's not a problem believe me. I'm a chronic asthmatic and sometimes need to use the reliever afterwards but it's worth it.|`|SZZkfVzbaa	...<br>  <br>  ?M.|`|9QWkXO4saa	Dude...screw her! If she dies...I'll live with youuu. xDD|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Well thank you for being considerate of your gf. The other day someone asked about essentially the same thing but was more worried about the effect it would have on him.<br>  Seek counseling from her doctor. There has to be a solution which will be acceptable to both of you. Maybe if she takes her inhaler 15 minutes before it would prevent a problem. But please check with your doctor. <br>  And I wouldn't recommend smoking after sex. haha<br>  God bless.
5ZKqU2sIaa	Wow! you sound like you did very well if you could email me with your advice on dieting and working out! You seem to be doing a very good job!|`|zNGWFKXGaa	Remember if your body gets too little nutrition it will save the fat received at places you dont want it! My suggestion are 5 small nutritious meals per day: <br>  7am cereals with fresh fruit, walnuts, joghurt & goji berries<br>  10am lara bar & fresh fruit <br>  1pm soup or salad <br>  4pm nuts or goji berries <br>  7pm fish or meat with steamed veggies, only ingredients, salt, pepper, olive oil and herbs <br>  <br>  Try to exercise 4x per week. Cario is best for weight loss. For example spinning classes. Once lost a enough you can change to 1x cardio (cycling or running) and 1x strengh (rock climbing and/or yoga). That should help!
HxXduL1maa	Masturbation is considered by many to be the cornerstone of sexual health. Because you get to do it by yourself, on your own terms, it’s probably the best way to learn what turns you on. Women are raised with little information about their genitals, and sex, including masturbation doesn’t come naturally for everyone. Some women orgasm from clitoral stimulation, others enjoy vaginal penetration or G spot stimulation. Below you'll find some tips on how to masturbate for women.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Relax as much as you can.Take a warm bath or have a glass of wine. Ensure your privacy: turn off the phone, lock the door, send the kids to a neighbor's. Find a comfy position. Most women start out lying on their backs, legs bent and spread apart, with feet on the ground. Remove your clothing. <br>  <br>  <br>  Recall an exciting past sexual encounter or elaborate on a favorite sexual fantasy. If you need a boost, look at a sexy magazine, read an erotic story, or watch an adult video. <br>  <br>  <br>  Run your hands along parts of your body, lingering along areas that are more responsive to touch than others. Look at your genitals in a mirror  and caress the different parts to see what feels especially good. Find and touch your inner and outer labia, your clitoris, your vagina and your perineum.<br>  <br>  <br>  Using one or two fingers, rhythmically stroke the different parts of your vulva, paying particular attention to your clitoris and labia. Experiment with different types of pressure, speed and motion. <br>  <br>  <br>  Try different types of touch: stroke, tickle, knead, pinch, or lightly pull your genitals. Try using one or several fingers, the palm of your hand, even your knuckles.<br>  <br>  <br>  Learn to hold onto sexual excitement by building up and then reducing or temporarily stopping the stimulation. Pay attention to how your body is responding. It will tell you the particular stroke that feels best and when to pick up or slow down the tempo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Breathe deeply rather than hold your breath. This helps release the sexual energy, rather than fight it. Rock your pelvis as you would during intercourse. <br>  <br>  <br>  If your hand gets tired, give yourself a rest, switch hands, or try a vibrator. If you're on the brink of orgasm, but can't quite get over the hump, try altering you’re breathing, or focusing on a really hot fantasy. Give yourself extra stimulation: caress your nipples, or try also thrusting your other fingers or a dildo in and out of your vagina.<br>  <br>  .<br>  As you begin to orgasm, continue the stimulation through the orgasm. Lighten up on the stimulation during the first extremely sensitive moments but keep it going to enjoy those little pleasurable aftershocks. Your first orgasm may feel like a blip or a blast, but the more you practice, the more variety you will experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't worry if you don't come on your first try, keep practicing, or try some of the variations below.<br>  <br>  <br>  Vibrators take some of the manual labor out of masturbation by providing direct, intense physical stimulation to the clitoris.<br>  <br>  Water helps many women learn to masturbate. Lie back with legs spread in a bath with a shower hose and direct the stream of water at your clitoris. Vary the pressure, the pulsation, and the temperature. Alternate methods: slide your butt over the drain so your legs are up in the air and your genitals are up under the tub faucet (rather awkward but do-able), or use Jacuzzi jets.<br>  <br>  Rub against something--a pillow, the corner of some furniture, a dildo.<br>  <br>  Dildos can be a pleasurable accompaniment to clitoral masturbation, as they offer the fullness of penetration and can also stimulate the G-Spot.|`|amkvqb87aa	totally normal :) dont worry i'm the same way. I dont think you damaged your nerves. Using your finger for some women doesnt really do the trick. Something you might consider trying is getting a really small vibrator that fits on your finger and stimulates your clit.  You can actually purchase these at Shoppers however they have a limited life span which is kinda crap.|`|d3a097e50d7be83cf224920987d04143aa	lol consult doc..!|`|B1AKZY0Eaa	just scrub it with a sponge and go wild|`|v90D1z2vaa	I recommend that you purchase what is known as a "RABBIT" Vibrator.<br>  it's a vibrator that also has a clit tickler on it. You can adjust the speed on either thing to get you there quickly or slowly. also try some waterbased lube that will help with sensation.|`|QN6wngizaa	Did you try the old way again? Everyone isn't the same so yeah. =/ I don't think there's something wrong with you though.|`|ryjdmmsaaa	I don't know whats wrong.. but that sounds hott<br>  Lmao|`|gmrH0sNBaa	It's normal, Some people can't masturbate at all. Continue with the shower|`|SaINc1Plaa	If you don't mind making noise, or a little bit of a mess, then this works great! Be naked except for some underwear that fits you nice and roll of a small pair of socks really tight. The place in you underwear below your clit, then lay on your bed face down. Start rotating your hips around and around, the pressure feels great and you'll come in no time!

I think shaving would make it worse, like why would you want to (possibly) give yourself cuts, razor burn/bumps or ingrown hairs? Trim it if you feel you need to.<br>  The only thing I could think of is to clean yourself really well - use a mild soap like Dove or something that isn't really strongly scented. Dry yourself really well and wear cotton underwear. If that doesn't do anything then I guess you should go see a doctor.|`|B1AKZY0Eaa	You have a yeast infection|`|d3a097e50d7be83cf224920987d04143aa	consult doc..lol|`|YjkkOKSOaa	The most required is Cleaning . <br>   Bathe at least once a day.

Keep well cleaned the under-breast area and nipples)<br>    Wash skin of skull and hairs with natural vegetable shampoo (such as hibiscus etc) but don’t use any chemical shampoo from the market.. Cut the nails of fingers and toes once in a week. Don’t use any sort of nail polish. <br>   Take care to remove unnecessary hairs of the body once in a month without using any chemicals.

2Ws4os0Jaa	I don't think people stop getting hiccups as they get older. I think it just depends why you used to get them in the first place. For example, my dad is 50 years old and he still gets hiccups to this day. The thing is that when my dad eats really spicy chili, he starts the hiccups. So, try to remember what used to make you hiccup when you were younger. Try looking at website I gave you down below. There it explains some of the reasons  why people get hiccups. Maybe you remember doing some of things when you were younger that you don't do now? Hope I helped! :)|`|AA10473274	I'm 41 and I still get them, I hate it...lol|`|yL7ODtuYaa	Let me tell you hiccups one can get them at any age,the reason you are not hiccuping is that you are eateing and drinking slowly, that is why, so please continue to do this and you will never have hiccups at all.
AA11315360	A BS degree is not needed unless you want to get a masters degree in public health or something else later.<br>  What you should do is go to a community college for hygiene and get an AS degree. Then you can transfer into a BS program at a 4 year college and only have to go for 1 or 2 more years and then you would have 2 degrees in dental hygiene (an AS and a BS. it will save you money to do it that way).

Ff7mCzlPaa	For good information you can do a yahoo search for Bipolar Disorder, or How to Cope with Bipolar Disorder.<br>  <br>  I have bipolar disorder and i'm sure the same things go through my mind as other people.  Bipolar is a mood disorder, so we can go from depression to manic (high) states, and there are also normal phases in-between. <br>  <br>  Depression can cause the person not to care about anything, lack motivation, miss work, inability to get out of bed, feel hopeless.  There are different degrees of depression.  Some people are able to cope when depressed... depending on whether it's a mild depression or a severe one.<br>  <br>  Mania can cause agitation sometimes.  But not always.  People who are manic also have different degrees of mania.  Sometimes they are impulsive, overspend, are oversexed, the life of the party, can't be productive enough and the list goes on.<br>  <br>  If the girl has been to that many therapists, she is probably not working the therapy.  It takes hard work to come to any sort of change.  And i'd also like to say that most of the bipolars i know, including me, have past issues and can have difficulty coping.  Plus mood swings can interfere... but we all have brains, and i do believe it's a good idea to use them!<br>  <br>  If a person with bipolar disorder is on their medication, but it stops working or never seemed to have worked at all, they need to talk with the doctor about their symptoms.  Many times it takes a while to get the right meds.  And sometimes we have to switch meds as well.<br>  <br>  If you do a search on the illness you will get loads of info.  good luck.|`|vPI1hVGUaa	Bipolar disease cannot be cured. those suffering from Bipolar disease can manage their disorder. A support system comprised of a competent medical doctor, therapist and family members or friends is also crucial to the Bipolar individual. these individuals should also seek to establish a balanced lifestyle with a low level of stress. <br>  <br>  For some sufferers, periods of depression, accompanied by periods of extreme happiness, often take their toll with failed relationships, lost jobs and feelings of worthlessness and failure. While most of us experience periods of the 'blues' or days when we seem to be walking on Cloud Nine, someone who suffers from bipolar disease will experience these moments in the extreme.<br>  <br>  A support system is also crucial to anyone suffering from Bipolar disease. This support system should include a medical doctor who will help the patient to find medications that will work best for them and their individual condition and symptoms. A warm and caring therapist will also help the patient sort through the confusing feelings and emotions associated with Bipolar Disease. Members of the immediate family and/or significant other are also integral parts of the support system. Theses people can give the emotional support needed to get through the emotional ups and downs associated with Bipolar disease.<br>  <br>  Encourage them to seek help and most of all, be as supportive as possible. You can make all the difference in the world for someone suffering from bipolar disease.|`|hO7EaK3Uaa	Read the short symptom explanation from the Mayo Clinic.  I can speak from experience with my sister-in-law.  She has a severe case of the disease.  Until the doctor got her the right meds she suffered for years.  She heard voices telling her to do weird things.  She had two stays in the hospital before finally getting the right help.  Mood swings like crazy.  She's either way up or deeply depressed.  She demands that all her family call her daily or she calls them constantly all day long.  Even on the meds she is hard to handle.  The last bad episode she had she locked herself in her apartment and was throwing all her clothes and valuables out the window.  My husband and his brother finally got her out and to the hospital.  It is not fun dealing with someone with this disorder.  If this person is not a family member I would try to distance myself from them.  If your friend has a bad manic episode down the line she may look to you for help and a friend is in no position to help someone with this problem.  Only family and their doctors can be of true assistance.|`|6bb02259822110ffe8e4a6d8a5c09237aa	my mom is bipolar.  its a rocky rocky road.I would just suggest that you seriously think about how this is going to affect your life and decide if this is really the direction you would like to go in.  It's never easy and you're always waiting for the ball to drop.|`|ParFJxnSaa	See section 10, on bipolar disorder, at ezy build, below, and take the quiz, if unsure, and if the results are positive, ensure you get an expert diagnosis from a mental health professional, not doctors, who are much better dealing with physical ailments, and don't diagnose complex disorders like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder often enough to develop any real expertise. <br>  <br>            Bipolar disorder usually involves major mood swings, which occur without apparent cause, and often over many months, or a matter of years, rather than days, as with most people (unless rapid cycling). Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. More about this on page R, in section 2.<br>  <br>           If you decide to use allopathy, (modern Western medicine) I recommend trying Lithium Carbonate, or Lithium Citrate. (regular tests are necessary, for these) before trying the other mood stabilisers, but if you aren't good at taking medications regularly, drinking adequate water, and keeping up your salt intake, something else, such as  Lamictal,  or Depakote, may suit you better. Check out "lithium"  at <a href="http://www.drugs.com/," rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com/,</a> and <a href="http://crazymeds.us/" rel="nofollow">http://crazymeds.us/</a> and always research medications first, there, and at <a href="http://www.rxlist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rxlist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.askapatient.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.askapatient.com/</a> (read, and keep the labels/information sheets) so you will be aware of the risks, and on the lookout for side effects. Personally, if I wasn't bipolar type 1, and didn't experience hallucinations, or serious delusional states, I know I'd first try the orthomolecular, and Omega 3 fish oil supplements, vitamins, minerals; a herbal remedy, and a mostly raw food diet, for several months. Note: St. John's wort, and also antidepressants, may trigger mania, or hypomania, in people with bipolar disorder. I'd aso eat in accordance with my "nutritional type". Enter that term in the searchbar at <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a>  <br>  <br>           If not considerably improved, after a maximum of 6 months trial period, consult your primary mental health care provider: you may be one of those who need medications to prevent this serious disorder from worsening.  If you have bipolar type 1, an antipsychotic medication will probably be required. Everyone should take the Omega 3 supplements, or preferably "krill oil" for its other health benefits: use the searchbar at <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> (also enter "diabetes; type 2") Some people refuse medication, using supplements, and a selective, mostly raw food diet (I do not recommended trying this, if bipolar 1, unless you aren't troubled by hallucinations, or delusional states). There are various types, and degrees of severity with bipolar disorder, and although many people with the milder versions can get by without medication, using the alternative treatments, those whose disorder in more serious, really would benefit from taking it.<br>  <br>           Maintain the treatments for the depressive phase, in section 2, at:  <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a>  Some topics in section 10 include: treating bipolar disorder with supplements, vitamins, minerals, and herbal remedies (except for St. John's wort!).  As with all medications, there are risks, and the possibility of side effects, which is why I inform people of the alternatives, to see if they can cope sufficiently well, without resorting to medications or, at least use less of them, with their attendant risks, and side effects. Don't use medications and supplements together, without medical advice, except for Omega 3, which is safe, anytime. It is not unknown for those discontinuing medication, and trying the alternative treatments, (which are not quick to work) to lose their jobs, because of unacceptable behavio(u)r, so I'd start 1 week before vacation, and closely monitor the situation, and use medical advice. Now is not the time to be losing your job!  ~~~~   Many bipolars enjoy the mania/hypomania too much to risk losing it by taking mood stabilisers; others don't like the side effects, so it's advisable to find out what treatment is being used, (if any) so you have a better idea of where you stand. See the BIPOLAR SUPPORTER website, on how to treat bipolars.|`|I8MUpN04aa	well, first i would suggest that you ask her. if she doesn't want to talk about it, then just type bipolar into the search engine of your computer, and you will get lots of stuff. the biggest problem with bipolar is that they go off their meds, and then end up with a manic stage- if your friend stays on her meds, she will probably be fine.
yVbguDvbaa	Your hormones are a very important part of your body.  They help maintain homeostasis and without them, you couldn't live.

At such a young age I can't even imagine the pain you are going through to ask such a question.<br>  <br>  If  you are messing with your testosterone level, you will inevitably cause have an imbalance of your emotions, like depression. I know that too much licorice (like the ingredient in the candy, but buy the powder instead), will cause men to grow breasts and be less manly, however the other side to this is cancer, plus other health issues.<br>  <br>  What is it that you want? To be something that you aren't? Or do you just want acceptance? The world is changing fast for individuals who want to be different, and change is in their favor  :)  Hang on and be tolerant of the ignorant (probably as you would like for others to be tolerant of your individuality - don't let thei ignorance make you crazy like them), there is nothing wrong with you, just give us some time... and give yourself some time as well, so you can accept yourself too.|`|H7KEJ0Fjaa	You mean, you want to have a sex change. It is not humanly possible to remove all of your hormones. To do that would be to cease existing.

Also,  lift heavier weights with less reps.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Yes, it is possible to get bigger without adding fat. You can increase the size of your muscle cells through exercise. Control your diet, by limiting the percentage of fat. All extra calories will be stored by your body as fat cells, so you can not over eat even if you eat only protein. If you are doing heavy exercise you need to consume 0.8 to 0.9 grams of protein every day for each pound of body weight. So your diet should consist of complex carbohydrates and protein, with lower amounts of fat, say between 10-15% of the calories eaten.|`|24oNfacxaa	Protein powder shakes.

iK3YYRaTaa	Depression is not generally listed as a complication of diabetes. However, it can be one of the most common and dangerous complications. The rate of depression in diabetics is much higher than in the general population. Diabetics with major depression have a very high rate of recurrent depressive episodes within the following five years. (Lustman et al 1977) A depressed person may not have the energy or motivation to maintain good diabetic management. Depression is frequently associated with unhealthy appetite changes. The suicidal diabetic adolescent has constant access to potentially lethal doses of insulin. <br>  At this point in time, it is well accepted that psychological factors and psychiatric conditions can affect the course of medical illnesses. There is some suggestion that the stress of depression itself may lead to hyperglycemia in diabetics. The interaction between cardiovascular disorders (such as heart attack and high blood pressure) and depression has been extensively studied. Anxiety and depression can also affect other conditions including irritable bowel syndrome, headache and skin diseases. Treatment of anxiety and depression may lead to a better medical prognosis and well as a better quality of life. <br>  <br>  For over three hundred years, physicians have suspected an interaction between the emotions and the course of diabetes mellitus. Studies have examined whether stressful events or psychiatric illness might precipitate either Type I (insulin-dependent) or Type II (Non-insulin dependent) diabetes. So far, study results are not conclusive.<br>  <br>  Now that we have more accurate methods of measuring glucose control, it has become easier to measure both short-term and long-term effects of emotional factors on blood glucose level. One study found that children judged to have a "Type A" personality structure had an increased blood sugar elevation in response to stress. Children with a calmer disposition had a smaller glucose rise when stressed. (Stabler et al. 1987) A 1997 study suggested that Type I patients with a history of a psychiatric illness might be at increased risk for developing diabetic retinopathy. Those patients with a psychiatric history were found to have a higher average glycosylated hemoglobin. (a measure of long term diabetic control) (Cohen et al. 1997) Children whose relatives made more critical comments had significantly poorer glucose control. Interestingly enough, emotional overinvolvement between family members was not correlated with poor diabetic control. (Koenigsberg et al. 1993) Diabetic adolescents had a higher incidence of suicidal ideation than expected. Those with suicidal ideation took poorer care of themselves. Not living in a two-parent home was associated with poorer long-term diabetes control. (Goldston, et al. 1997)<br>  <br>  Recent studies have suggested that effective treatment of depression can improve diabetic control. In a study by Lustman and colleagues, glucose levels were shown to improve as depression lifted. The better the improvement, the better the diabetic control. (Lustman et al. 1997a)<br>  <br>  Being diagnosed with diabetes is a major life stress. It requires a large number of physical and mental accommodations. The individual must learn about a complex system of dietary and medical interventions. Lifestyle, work, and school schedules may have to be altered. This can consume a lot of energy for both the individual and his or her family. Just as important, are the psychological adjustments. One must adjust to a new view of oneself. For those who liked to see themselves as invincible, this may be particularly difficult.<br>  <br>  Many newly diagnosed diabetics go through the typical stages of mourning. These are denial, anger, depression and acceptance.<br>  <br>  Denial: This can be one of the more dangerous stages of the grief process. It may not occur only once. Many individuals cycle back to this phase several times. The honeymoon phase, associated with early Type I diabetes, may reinforce denial. Denial is a common stance for adolescent diabetics.<br>  <br>  Anger: It really does seem unfair. The type II diabetic, trying to lose weight, may envy heavier people who seem to enjoy good health. One might erupt at someone who innocently offers a desert. Unfortunately, anger can drastically affect glucose levels.<br>  <br>  Depression: Mild depressive feelings are a normal part of grieving and adaptation. As long as they are not pervasive or prolonged, they may not be harmful. However, when the depression lasts a long time, becomes severe or interferes with diabetic management, one should seek prompt treatment.<br>  <br>  Acceptance: Individuals achieve different degrees of acceptance and inner peace. Some will need to experience the denial, anger and depression several times as they move through different phases of life and different stages of diabetes. Some people move through a chronic disease to a state of much greater self-knowledge. They may actually say that the diabetes was, in part, a blessing.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	OK, let's get a grip here, dude!  Diabetes is not to blame for your cataracts, hair growth, eyebrows, OCD, or girl problems.  Yes, you have to watch what you eat, but you can have a hamburger or some pizza every so often if you calculate your carbs and give yourself the right amount of insulin.

It's not unusual to focus on some small aspect and make it into a larger issue. I'm sure you know this, and it takes effort to get over it.   Plenty of women have them, and use eyebrow trimmers.  Lots of hair salons and barber shops can trim them, too.  Wait until you really are 50 and have to trim the hair out of your ears :-)  <br>  <br>  You are still fairly new to diabete, and seem to be having trouble dealing with the anger and depression that are common.  You are not alone in that.  We all go through it.  Most colleges have some kind of counseling available to students - check it out.  It really does help to talk to someone who can do more than just listen.<br>  <br>  You are also not the only diabetic on campus.  Check around for any student associations or clubs.  Most colleges participate in diabetes awareness activities of some type. Being with others who share out difficulties can be really helpful. Even if a group isn't specific to diabetes, you may find one compatible enough since many colleges have organizations for students studying some aspect of healthcare or nutrition, or have similar lifestyle interests such as those watching their weight or eating a more vegitarian/whole food diet.  Lots of diabetics can be found in these groups.  And you can look around in the surrounding town, too, for diabetic groups.  Look online for listings if there aren't any advertised locally, sites like diabetes.org frequently maintain group listings and message boards.  You can always start a group of your own, too :-)<br>  <br>  There is more to college life than beer, pizza, and hamburgers (and as a diabetic, I can still have these if I plan for it).  And diabetes is not your whole existance, it is only a part of your life (albeit an important part if you want to live a long and healthy life).  Any woman who is too afraid of your diabetes to date you wasn't worth dating anyway :-)  But you don't want to drive away the ones that would have been okay with it by beating the diabetes bush constantly, either. The more accepting of the diabetes you are, the more of you they will get to know.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	A good barber can help with the eyebrows.  Stop trimming them yourself.  Do you have a friend that's a girl (as opposed to a girlfriend) or an sister that you can speak to.  Perhaps you eyebrows aren't as bad as you think, as her.  Also, girls love to make over guys!  If you look good, you'll feel a bit better about yourself.<br>  <br>  You can eat hamburgers and pizza and milkshakes - just be sure to count the carbs accurately and set your pump to give you the insulin over an hour or two because of the high fat.  Do you understand all the features of your pump?  If not, more training is in order.  Ask your endo about a continuous glucose monitor - it may help you see patterns in your blood sugar and help you get tighter control.  Does your endocrinologist have any information on support groups?  I attend one with my son (he's 16 with diabetes), and it's helpful to meet other people with the same problems.  <br>  <br>  Do you do any physical activity at all?  Gym, run, swim, football....  Physical activity can help with depression and diabeates management!<br>  <br>  Do you participate in any JDRF fundraising activities, or do anything else that allows you to meet other diabetics?  My family has learned a llot by meeting other families and JDRF events.<br>  <br>  Have you ever been to diabetes summer camp?  Perhaps you should look into being a counselor at camp this year.<br>  <br>  I have found knowing other people with type 1 diabetes to be so very helpful.  My son doesn't feel so all alone when we meet other people with the same issues.<br>  <br>  Also, you'll feel better over all if your blood sugar is good.  Keep a meticulous diary of foods you eat and the insulin you took.  Look for patterns.  You may find that you need to adjust your boluses or basal rate.  These change over time and need tweaking from time to time.<br>  <br>  We see a diabetes educator that is GREAT!  He has type 1 diabetes too.  If you are in the Philly area, you may want to meet with him, see his web site: www.integrateddiabetes.com, there's good information.  If you need help with out of control blood sugar he can help remotely (but this is not a free service).<br>  <br>  Diabetes should not control your life -  you can control it! <br>  <br>  I hope this helped a bit.

Girls don't really care about that at all (if we did we could only date pretty boys and we don't like guys who are prettier than we are!).  I'm sure living with diabetes has given you great strength and maturity which is what girls are really looking for.  I've known a few guys who have diabetes and they got plenty of action! lol  If anyone don't like you because of your health problems they are SO not worth it in the first place.  I know this sounds cliche, but just be yourself.  You don't have "diabetes" stamped across your forehead, so no one even has to know unless you are in a serious friendship or relationship.<br>    Aside from dating, acquiring a health problem in college is really difficult.  (I'm not saying this.  I've been through and still am living it today!)  Food and alcohol seem like the centerpiece for most social interactions.  The thing is, you can still do everything you did before while watching what you eat and drink!  Just because I can't eat pizza doesn't mean I don't go with my friends for pizza.  Just because you can't drink doesn't mean you can't go hang out with people who are drinking.  <br>     When I first got sick, I lost a lot of confidence to because before i had felt unstoppable as most people our age do.  Getting sick took that foundation I always stood on out from under me and it was very hard going day to day no longer being able to take anything for granted.  I didn't know what the next hour would be like, let alone my future, or relationships with people.  I thought I had lost self confidence, but really it was that I had lost confidence in the workings of the world.  It seems like maybe you are going through that now.  Your foundations in life have been shaken, but you are still the same guy you were before.  If you felt confidence in yourself before you got diabetes, there is no reason that you should not feel confidence in yourself now.     <br>     It probably feels like you are the only one with health problems, but I bet there are TONS of people who are going through something similar (the statistics say 1 in 10 kids and young adults have a health problem that interferes with life at least once every day.)  Probably even some people you know, but like I said before, our illnesses are not stamped on our foreheads.  Not to mention that even the healthy among out peers all have their own issues.  That's what makes us human.<br>     To some it all up, of course you will find a girl who will accept you.  I know a ton of people who have health conditions that make them bed bound or hairless or have big scars or all of the above and more and they date just like anyone else.  This lack of confidence you are feeling will ease as you realize that success in life and dating is still just as attainable.  Life will be different, but different does not mean bad.  You'll see!  :)|`|GaJmO2efaa	I am so sorry to hear that.  I am 20 years old like you and was just diagnosed only a month ago.  Diabetes runs in my family, my grandmother, mom, dad, uncle, aunt, and great uncle all have the disease and I was not happy when I heard I did too.  I honestly believe diabetes has helped me tremendously.  Taking insulin and losing weight, I have never felt better.  I am in culinary school and thought the illness would hinder me, but its actually really helped me help others create healthy meals that are tasty.  They are ways for you to make pizza, hamburgers, and milkshakes that taste great and are great for you to enjoy.  Eyebrows aren't really a big deal to most females.  If people can't accept you for who you are, you don't need them in you life, straight up.

I am 24 y/o I am the proud mother of an 18 month old baby. I was diagnosed with type2diabetes. It was hard for me to understand and believe that I was a diabetic especially since no one in my family has this health condition. I felt my world just cruch into a million pieces, especially since I have a little one and I want to see her grow and get married and meet my future g-babies......I started working out and also watching everything that goes into my mouth, but HEY!!!

I know your diabetes and mine are different I am not on medication I control my diabetes w/diet and excercise but still I know the disease is there and I have to take care of myself. You are young and have a life ahead of you dont let diabetes make you feel inferior and less than others. God never gives us a load that we cannot carry.

AA11298562	Good heavens, yes.  Sleep disturbances are one of the key symptoms of depression, both over and under sleeping.  Some people, like you, do both.  On the other hand, it could just be that your body has developed some really bad habits concerning sleep and needs some help to break them.  I'd recommend finding a 'sleep center' in your area, which will help you identify what is causing your sleep problems.  You might also want to talk to a mental health provider about trying a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor-- low serotonin levels are one of the main culprits of irregular sleep.|`|juhim6Bhaa	Yes, depression has associated sleep problems in some individuals. however, you could go in for a sleep study.

These can range from always feeling tired, to staying awake for countless number of hours. Depression and anxieties can effect many people in different ways. My advice and its not a diagnosis, is to talk to your doctor about it. You said that doctor said you were fine physically, so tell him or her that you've been having feelings of depression. He or she may send you to a psychiatrist and/or put you on anti-depressants. The main thing is to just tell someone about it. It seems like you want to feel more positive about yourself. For me personally writing my feelings/thoughts down on paper has helped to get some issues out. But it is a work in progress, you'll have days when you wonder if its always going to be like this or u feel hopeless. But always keep trying and I think going to a psychiatrist or a counselor will help, but make sure to check with your doctor first and see what he or she has to say. Good Luck

HxXduL1maa	Masturbation is considered by many to be the cornerstone of sexual health. Because you get to do it by yourself, on your own terms, it’s probably the best way to learn what turns you on. Women are raised with little information about their genitals, and sex, including masturbation doesn’t come naturally for everyone. Some women orgasm from clitoral stimulation, others enjoy vaginal penetration or G spot stimulation. Below you'll find some tips on how to masturbate for women.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Relax as much as you can.Take a warm bath or have a glass of wine. Ensure your privacy: turn off the phone, lock the door, send the kids to a neighbor's. Find a comfy position. Most women start out lying on their backs, legs bent and spread apart, with feet on the ground. Remove your clothing. <br>  <br>  <br>  Recall an exciting past sexual encounter or elaborate on a favorite sexual fantasy. If you need a boost, look at a sexy magazine, read an erotic story, or watch an adult video. <br>  <br>  <br>  Run your hands along parts of your body, lingering along areas that are more responsive to touch than others. Look at your genitals in a mirror and caress the different parts to see what feels especially good. Find and touch your inner and outer labia, your clitoris, your vagina and your perineum.<br>  <br>  <br>  Using one or two fingers, rhythmically stroke the different parts of your vulva, paying particular attention to your clitoris and labia. Experiment with different types of pressure, speed and motion. <br>  <br>  <br>  Try different types of touch: stroke, tickle, knead, pinch, or lightly pull your genitals. Try using one or several fingers, the palm of your hand, even your knuckles.<br>  <br>  <br>  Learn to hold onto sexual excitement by building up and then reducing or temporarily stopping the stimulation. Pay attention to how your body is responding. It will tell you the particular stroke that feels best and when to pick up or slow down the tempo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Breathe deeply rather than hold your breath. This helps release the sexual energy, rather than fight it. Rock your pelvis as you would during intercourse. <br>  <br>  <br>  If your hand gets tired, give yourself a rest, switch hands, or try a vibrator. If you're on the brink of orgasm, but can't quite get over the hump, try altering you’re breathing, or focusing on a really hot fantasy. Give yourself extra stimulation: caress your nipples, or try also thrusting your other fingers or a dildo in and out of your vagina.<br>  <br>  .<br>  As you begin to orgasm, continue the stimulation through the orgasm. Lighten up on the stimulation during the first extremely sensitive moments but keep it going to enjoy those little pleasurable aftershocks. Your first orgasm may feel like a blip or a blast, but the more you practice, the more variety you will experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't worry if you don't come on your first try, keep practicing, or try some of the variations below.<br>  <br>  <br>  Vibrators take some of the manual labor out of masturbation by providing direct, intense physical stimulation to the clitoris.<br>  <br>  Water helps many women learn to masturbate. Lie back with legs spread in a bath with a shower hose and direct the stream of water at your clitoris. Vary the pressure, the pulsation, and the temperature.

AA10080854	Hi! I feel for you on the headaches! I have them 4 to 8 times a day, or the same headache will last for 4 days. Mine are mostly migraines and cluster migrianes; I suffer from 9 different types, and I have suffered with migraines for almost 35 years. When I was your age I too had alot of headaches and alot of sinus headaches. I also get alot of sinus headaces now as well. <br>  <br>  When you get up from bed or sitting; try getting up slower and in stages, when in bed...bend your knees up , then slowly start sitting up could lean against the wall with the pillow behind you, then sit on the edge of your bed and sit there for a while. Then slowly stand up you might find that will help you. <br>  <br>  You might want to eat dinner later that will help you sleep better<br>  <br>  If you like Cashews they sometimes help headaches go away<br>  Try to involve yourself in projects..something you like to do..making jewelry, reading, etc. My daughter and I like to draw it relaxes both of us but we get into what we are drawing and before we know it we stayed up later than we wanted to and we sleep better. <br>  <br>  I take Tynnol PM 1 hour before I want to go to bed and sleep sound and I get better nights rest that way. You can also use the generic brands they work the same and not as expensive. They aren't habbit forming either. That might give you better sleep and it will help the headache go away too!<br>  <br>  You might try taking a sinus pill to see if that helps your headache go away.<br>  <br>  Its very possible that you have migraines or sinus problems or both.<br>  If someone in your family has migrines then you could as well as it is hereditary. My mother has them, my 2 sisters and I have them and my daughter has migraines..<br>   <br>  You can go to this website and take the migraine test, there is alot of helpful information there. It's one of the best sites I have found on migraines.<br>  <a href="http://www.relieve-migraine-headache.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.relieve-migraine-headache.com...</a><br>  <br>  You might want to see a Neurologist or a ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat doctor). For almost 20 years the doctor couldn't figure out why I was having so many headaches.<br>  <br>  I hope this will help you and I will pray your headaches are better<br>  Feel better soon!!|`|C0n2LK7Paa	There are many causes to headaches but the hard answer is we are not sure. However, to help, there is an emerging theory that is gaining popularity. Dehydration. I recently read a great article (see source) about this and the symptoms seem to fit. Fatigue is one of the symptoms. I highly recommend seeing a doctor. I would leave it at that but if that were an option I'm sure you wouldn't be here so in lieu of going to see the old doc try water. If this continues please see the doctor!!!|`|JVHCFXXVaa	You really need too have a full workup with your doctor. It could be any number of things like diabetes, eye problems or anything, Talk to your doc and have a physical. It' the only way to know for sure but daily headaches are not normal. Since a headache is known as a non-specific symptom (meaning it could be a lot of different causes) you have to get it looked at. You really need to eat more protein too. You will feel somewhat better just from that.|`|gPfK8HQoaa	Missing out on water? People think that something else might be wrong but the human body is mainly composed of water. We get about 98% of our headaches from not drinking enough fluids ( unless you really have a brain tumor or syst or problem) <br>  <br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water and eat less sugar|`|wwP3ONCFaa	Unfortunately, even the doctors who operate headache clinics can't guarantee that they can diagnose which kind of headache a patient has. There's no laboratory test that can tell you this patient has migraine, this one has tension,. Diagnosis is usually based on the patient's history.<br>  <br>  Thus, regardless of the name you give your headaches—tension, migraines, various obscenities—you are the one in the best position to recognize what habits and factors bring on your headaches. And it's up to you to do everything within your control to prevent or treat them.<br>  <br>  Here are some reasons to see a neurologist or Professional Doctor:<br>      *  You are over 40 and never had recurring headaches before.<br>      * The headaches have changed locations.<br>      * The headaches are getting stronger.<br>      * The headaches are coming more frequently.<br>      * The headaches do not fit a recognizable pattern; that is, there seems to be nothing in particular that triggers them.<br>      * Headaches have begun to disrupt your life; you've missed work on several occasions.<br>      * The headaches are accompanied by neurological symptoms, such as numbness, dizziness, blurred vision, or memory loss.<br>      * The headaches coincide with other medical problems or pain.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|K4Y76H3qaa	Sounds like a neurological problem.

It's important - you need ENERGY to function, that's what food is.  It's like trying to drive a car without gas - it doesn't go very far.  You get no protein.  You have no protein for lunch.  You are PROTEIN DEFICIENT.<br>  <br>  You don't get enough sleep, period.  That's why you're tired.  You need 8 hours sleep a night, not increments of under 3 hours here and there.  <br>  <br>  Do you drink enough water?  Dehydration can cause headaches, too.<br>  <br>  Talk to your family doctor.

(gods plan, if you will).. and it may seem like we have noone or nothing and cant go forward and in a limbo state, no progressing no matter how hard we try..  you just need to remember one thing..  all of the people in the world are a part of a larger plan that we cannot see because we are not super human beings.  and once this plan begins to fall into place, your life will change. whatever people you are going to meet in your future is slowly coming into place by gods way.  other peoples lives have to be affected to affect your life and whatever that is could take months.. even years.. until that time.. just remember, we are waiting. during this waiting, if you dont have a job or money to function, you can volunteer for any charity places,like salvation army, red cross, join a missionary group and travel with them, join the peace corps,  there r more things.  if you have children you can still do things.   i am in limbo and i am waiting also. and i think about it everyday.  but i have to keep remembering.. there is that bigger plan out there, and we will be needed in this plan.|`|4fa499688d1bcff78a1b01e2a1eb3149aa	I've asked myself the same question before.

OkZBNhhgaa	It sounds as if your body is just reacting to having so little rest.  Maybe you're just run down and need some sleep and lots of TLC.  Have a relaxing weekend - no booze or late nights - and just pamper yourself.  Give yourself a facial, a hair treatment do your nails and just basically sit on your backside and chill out!  Your whole body will thank you for it, I can guarantee you that.  However, if you still feel sore and stiff then go see your doctor and he will be able to sort you out.  A simple blood test should reveal any mysterious goings on if there are any.  You should be fine though so go ahead and enjoy your down time, ok?|`|ubauKtJxaa	hi,there about 10 years ago I myself felt just like you do right now mine didn,t get any better I went to the doctor and I found out I had Fibromyalgia and my bones in my neck and back was detereateing in the last 3 years I have had neck surgery and back surgery and I have 2 more on my back to go and to more on myneck to go BUT I am not saying the samething is wrong with you but I would not put it off to long if it does not go away I would be going to see your family doctor for some test and blood work. wish you all the best, and may GOD Bless!|`|gXypLAyiaa	You,have used your muscles more this week than any other week in your life.You need to rest up for a while.|`|NPFC6gstaa	you could be coming down with a slight flue bug or something? or yes it could be lack of sleep!!! <br>  i have a 2year old son who Still doesn't sleep all night, the nights he has me up the most and after a few bad ones in a row, my body aches, i feel i've ran a marathon some times, and that's just because of tiredness. i'd suggest some early nights to see if it helps, if not and if your no better in another week, best see a doctor,<br>  take care x

7swefA6Paa	Ok so this is going to be very long, but im going to tell you from past experiences (some of them bad) the best way to lose weight :D<br>  ok so... the best way to boost your metabolism(which will make you burn fat better) and reduce hunger during the day, is to eat how i do:  I eat about 200 calories every two to three hours, starting in the morning around 7:30 am to no later than 7pm.  never eat after 7 (6 is best), unless you plan on staying up all night, for your metabolism slows at night because its preparing to sleep.  .  <br>  oh and eat a ton of veggies because they are very filling and low cal.  fruit too.  some other low cal foods: nonfat cottage cheese, lite jellos; cheese sticks; yogurts; soups; or tuna, grahm crackers, kix cereal,  pria power bars, soy, etc.  if you like almonds, try almond milk instead of regular milk, it is easier to digest and the unsweetened kind is 40 cal per cup. <br>   Oh, and because you get to look forward to another mini meal in 2 hours, you will be less hungry and less likely to snack on things.  especially because you will be full  on water too.  if you eat 200 cal every 2hrs from 8:am-6pm you will only consume 1200cal in a day.  <br>  but dont eat less than, at the very least, 1000 cal (though most  suggest no less than 1200) because  then your body goes into starvation mode and stores everything you eat into fat for energy. so even though youd be losing weight, youd be losing muscle but keeping fat.  and if you binged or started eating more daily then youd gain the weight back twice as fast. <br>  and it is a good idea to buy some 3-6lbs weights and do simple exercises to build muscle and look toned.  And the more muscle you have, the more you can eat in a day because muscle burns fat even when you are just sitting.  Like 3 days a week do 2 sets of bicep and tricep curls, and then 2 days a week do squats, lunges, crunches, etc.  an add at least 20 min of cardio daily. <br>  <br>  I hope that was helpful|`|5dMw30kMaa	She may lose a little weight at first but after a few days the body will sort of shut down and it will try and preserve as much fat as possible so she won't lose anything. Then she will just be really gaunt and sick feeling because she isn't getting enough vitamins. She could lose 20 pounds in a month if she just starts eating healthy like veggies and fruit and cut out fast foods and fatty foods. Drink lots of water. I hope your sister chooses not to puke because thats reallyyyy unhealthy and can cause more problems than it fixes. good luck|`|AA11298562	You might want to tell your sister that puking that much is going to ruin her teeth and make her face look all puffy and gross (it will).  Also, she's getting rid of less than half of what she's eating, so it's not that effective.  Honest, I'd tell your parents about what she's doing, it's seriously not healthy.  I understand she's desperate to lose weight, but if she takes it off like that it's just going to come right back, and then she'll start puking to lose it again, and it turns into a vicious cycle.  Or the weight may not come off at all, for some people, puking makes their body freak out and actually GAIN weight, because the body thinks it's dying.<br>  The only way to take off weight and keep it off is by developing a healthy lifestyle and body image-- that doesn't include puking.  Your sister is probably going to need the help of a mental health professional to understand this, tho, so it really is important that you let someone in charge know what's going on.<br>  Because honestly?  It could eventually kill her.|`|WlZ66KnZaa	Sorry say this but bulemics actually weigh normal or overweight.  Since has an ed she probably wont stop at 20 pounds. I know since eds are addicting and hard to recover. She might be able to lose a pound a week but after about 5 weeks she will have to go to the hospital since purging causes damage to the organs. If she wants to lose 2-3 pounds a week just have her only eat 1200 cals and exercise 30min a day. BTW, most ed victims when they stop they gain way more weight.

oC3mzKG8aa	Hi <br>  You can still use antifungal cream in pregnancy, this can be bought from the pharmacy.  Live Natural yoghrt can be used topicaly on the affected area to soothe the infection and eating it will also help.  Pregnancy hormones can make you more prone to thrush infections keeping clean and as dry as possible not using scented products in the shower and wearing cotton underwear can also help.  Also have a look at your diet keep a food diary and see if you think any foods make it worst, generaly they will be cakes, biscuts, sweets, sweet juice, coke etc cut down on these foods and see if there is an improvement.  If thrush is something you sufferfrom persistantly I would advise you see a gyn/dermatology specialist as there are skin conditions that are wrongly diagnosed as thrush, just similar symptoms.  Don't just put up with these things do some reserch use the internet.  You can see a GP at any stage in your pregnancy.<br>  I hope this helps I am a midwife and fellow sufferer.|`|GCjFPehGaa	yogurt lots of it or putting a wedge of garlic in there (i know its SO weird but it helps.)|`|b9340e25c5c91b1731a01132aab4d92daa	Air it out??

2pNHOCONaa	maybe youre blowing your nose too hard? you need to keep your mouth wide open when you blow your nose. if its hurting you because it wont pop? you need to go to a ENT, ears nose throat doctor..<br>  <br>  but in the meantime, maybe you could try swallowing a few times? or drink a glass of water? just a suggestion.

2608417d95cfdcea5fe45658c7a10facaa	Depends on your version of healthy.  All food is good for you in moderation.  You just have to eat less calories than you consume.  Pretzels have less calories than most snacks.  1 ounce is 100 calories, whereas most chips are about 160 calories for one ounce.|`|AA11603761	Not if they are made with white flour...which most are.|`|d5baf34e65bccce9569de81d9e95fe02aa	Pretzels are a great snack food when you are on a diet. Just make sure you only eat the recommended serving size and not the whole bag. If you don't trust yourself, divide the bag up into snack bags holding the recommended serving size.|`|681d23400657e70e96806d26c6c99975aa	I, personally, would stay away from them. It's basically salty dough.|`|6beb9dcdd784c2c57334696263ad285faa	Pretzels in moderation are fairly healthful. Much better than potato chips!! Stay within the serving size and you will be fine. Look for whole wheat pretzels at health foods stores to make your snack even better! They are high in sodium though which can cause bloating for some.|`|a62a2190eaff27a44b7d03e6f42414c0aa	Depends on what your goals are...They can be alright if eaten in moderation. Just about anything is ok if eaten in moderation. When I say Moderation I mean like 4-5 pretzels. If you have the will power to stop after 5 you will be ok. <br>  <br>  Some things to think about w/ pretzels:<br>  They are like eating bread...which means carbs.<br>  They are heavily salted...the sodium level will cause your body to retain water increasing your water weight.

YdI1SSyKaa	It could be depression or her being stressed by something you are unaware of. But it really sounds like menopause (or like i like to call it, mentalpause). I swear they lose their minds when they go through it, try and notice if she has hot flashes (my mother used to ride w. the window down...at night when it was not hot!!) if she does that is a definite sign of menopause. They can get pretty crazy when going through it so if she is, goodluck to you LoL. Better that than something more serious.|`|EebRapnHaa	She could be depressed because of the hormone imbalances occurring from the menopause.|`|neJbYkJoaa	She might be extremely depressed.  Anger can be   a sign of depression.  I  think it might help her to start doing some things to let her know that you care.  Also, tell her how glad you are that she is your mother.  Look for little things that she used to do for you that were special and made you feel good and then remind her that you remember.  Also, some medications can cause mental changes.  You are right, that menopause may also be causing something, but whatever it is, just try to let her know that you care and that you love her and send her a note to let her know you don't take her for granted.  It might not hurt to even tell her that you' ve noticed that she seems sad.  Just be her friend.  I will pray for her after I finish this.

1HBTNU5Oaa	i'ts not your bones that are popping. most likely, its your tendons or ligaments. i don't think you'll have to worry about it unless things start to pop out of place, ie. bones and such. i'm 26 and my ankles pop, wrist, and knees. i played football for a long time and i've never had any problems with things popping. you'll be alright. its natural
rzBxRw7Haa	Hi there,<br>  you have a muscle at the top of the thigh which becomes a tendon lower down the leg and to the knee it is called the 'tensor facia lata' muscle. This may have become tight and gone into spasm so try running your fingers down the outside of the leg from thigh to knee and feel for any areas that feel sore or bruised and give them a good massage to loosen it off. Also press/feel on the outside of your hip and see if there is any soreness there and massage this muscle also and hopefully that should loosen it all off. Keep doing this for a few days till it settles down but if it doesn't try a sports massage therapist or chiropractor. Good luck
uTW2KW9raa	They dont make you sign up for anything extra. The e-book helps and gives you tips and guides and stuff but its not really necessary to have it - I mean; you dont need it.<br>  <br>  The diet isnt a scam - it works..

You can even post your questions up. :-)|`|zNGWFKXGaa	The cheapest way to loose weight is to exercise regularly and cut out on all junk foods (sodas, high fructose corn sirup etc.... ). Quickest way to loose weight is doing 3-4x cardio per week, that could be spinning or running. After loosing a bit you can switch to 2x cardio (cycling or running) and 2x strengh (rock climbing/yoga). For maintaining you can just go 1x cardio and 1x strenght per week. Hope that helps.

b876bdbe9593c6e05de8ebd41f870433aa	I've had both hips replaced.  I couldn't cross my legs BEFORE I had the surgery and tying shoes was enough of a problem that I wore slip-ons for a year before surgery.<br>  <br>  It took awhile for me to be able to tie shoes - several months.  In the meantime, I used a couple of the handy gadgets that I was given that helped me put on and remove sox & shoes.  Although I had my surgeries 7 years ago, I still am not comfortable crossing my legs and probably never will be although I can and do do it for short periods.  It isn't painful - it just doesn't feel right.  And I can't sit "indian" style any more.  <br>  <br>  I was in misery & pain BEFORE I had the surgery, not after.  Any post-op pain was treated aggressively and by the time I went home I needed very little pain meds - used mostly Tylenol.<br>  <br>  Hip replacement is major surgery and while it isn't a walk in the park, it is definitely worth it for people whose only other alternative is a life of pain and misery - probably ending up in a wheelchair-bound existence.  I would do it again in a heartbeat.  I couldn't walk without a cane before I had the replacements. Now I can walk miles, have no limp, no pain, take no pain meds, and need no cane.  I consider it a sort of miracle surgery and definitely worth the effort and work required to rehab from the surgery.|`|ubauKtJxaa	yes you will be able to tie your shoes but you will have to sit in a chair and lean over to tie them about crossing your legs that might be hurtful  I say this because my mom had both her hips replaced 6 months apart and it has been almost a year and she is doing good as long as she don,t cross her legs--- then I have a male friend had 1 hip replaced if he crosses his legs his hip pops out of place and it is very painful so I guess it just depends on what kind of shape you was in before the hip replacement just take it easy and don,t try anything you think that might hurt you, GOOD LUCK!
UCPY4AtUaa	You're a rookie and you're tripping out.  Once you get used to dope, you'll fondly remember the days you tripped out.  Soak your pipe in rubbing alcohol overnight and dump some shake or tobacco in a petri dish full of the liquid resin.  You can smoke it when it evaporates.<br>  <br>  Or you can stick to drinking beer.|`|CLB32006aa	Try to get in a relaxed setting where you feel comfortable and get in a good state of mind.

When we are stressed-up or maybe tensed and smoke maryjane, normally we feel calm but the stress level which is not linked directly- affects the beat of the heart making it unstable.<br>  <br>  My mate whenever he use to smoke at home, its common for him to have panic attacks bcs of fear from parents, he always get paranoid that one of his parent will knock his door.<br>  <br>  Sometimes due to personal health conditions, maryjane doesnt suit everyone. <br>  <br>  The way to enjoy maryjane is to chill and stay calm...forget all stress and tensions.<br>  <br>  When i used to smoke, i kept my pipes and bongs clean all time, before and after using. But i guess the resin wont give u panic attacks mate.<br>  <br>  If you are a new user, i wont advice you to stop maryjane. Once u get hooked, its very hard to quit. People say that we can quit maryjane anytime, the real fact is that, it is very hard to quit- a person easily becomes dependable. It took me awhile and alot of hell to quit maryjane.|`|AA10185707	Thats common, its called paranoid and it will happen even to pot heads.. The resin or pipe has nothing to do with it.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	i. Eat more calories<br>  <br>  This involves some calculation. The approximate normal daily caloric requirement for an average male who performs light activity is 2,200; for a female, it is 1,900.You need to eat around 1,000 extra calories per day to gain less than half a kilo a week.<br>  <br>  Do the math. Eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day.<br>  <br>  Your actual caloric requirement can differ depending on your height, weight, activity level and your body's metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  ii. Make smart choices<br>  <br>  For example, choose dairy products, Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca.<br>  <br>  *<br>  One hour spinning = perfect body<br>  <br>  iii. Protein is important<br>  <br>  Increase your protein intake. Your body needs a lot of protein to build new muscle. But since most of the calories for weight gain comes from carbohydrates and fats, do not replace them with protein.<br>  <br>  iv. Snack a lot<br>  <br>  Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars.<br>  <br>  *<br>  healthy Ayurvedic mantras<br>  <br>  v. Fluids help too<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories; milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks are good examples.<br>  <br>  vi. Intensify workouts<br>  <br>  Aerobics are great, right? Not for weight gain!<br>  <br>  You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Is walking better than running?<br>  <br>  vii. Weights are the way to go<br>  <br>  Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbells, not fancy gym machines.<br>  <br>  Free weights put the most stress on muscles and stimulate the maximum number of muscle fibres.<br>  <br>  The best weight training exercises for building muscle mass are free weight exercises like squats, dead lifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips.<br>  <br>  These exercises are best done under supervision, but they don't need machinery.<br>  <br>  viii. Space out your workouts<br>  <br>  If you have a high basic metabolic rate -- which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest -- you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Are carbs bad for you?<br>  <br>  ix. Creatine?<br>  <br>  Creatine supplements can help some athletes gain weight. It is not known if it is because it gives them spurts of energy or because it adds water weight.<br>  <br>  More research is needed in this area before Creatine becomes that magic pill. Creatine supplements are available at all major health food stores, but do not take it without consulting your doctor.<br>  <br>  x. Be consistent<br>  <br>  It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results.<br>  <br>  Your body will only responds to a consistent schedule. No weight gain programme will work for you if you are not regular.<br>  <br>  Heredity does pay a major role in determining your weight. Effective weight training and a smart diet can help you exceed your genetically predetermined weight.|`|CUqXYNHvaa	just eat and sleep,use rise,butter,rajma with low spicy.|`|dm0jeunKaa	You could try weight gainer shakes<br>  Eat a lot of carbs, complex carbs<br>  Don't eat junk, thats just unhealthy<br>  Don't workout, sit around LOL, the more you workout the more you're going to burn.<br>  Increase your calorie intake, larger meals, more frequently.<br>  Basically, Eat more, eat healthy, higher calorie meals.

G6jTu4Ibaa	After Mirena? is placed, you may experience heavier periods over the first 3 to 6 months because the lining of your uterus is shedding. This may also result in irregular periods and irregularities such as "spotting" (a small amount of blood loss) or light bleeding outside of your monthly period. During this time, you may need sanitary protection, like you do during your period.<br>  <br>  Remember, these menstrual benefits are not harmful. The reason you may eventually have a shorter period, or one with little or no menstrual flow, is because of the thinning of your uterine lining. When Mirena? is removed, your uterine lining and menstrual cycle will return to the way they were before you used Mirena?.<br>  <br>  Not having your period while you are using Mirena? is not abnormal. Nor is it harmful or anything to worry about. <br>  <br>  Every month, the lining of the uterus thickens during the first half of your menstrual cycle <br>  The lining is shed as menstrual flow <br>  On average, a woman's menstrual flow lasts 3 to 4 days. It may last shorter or longer, depending on the woman <br>  <br>  <br>  The levonorgestrel in Mirena? reduces the monthly thickening of the lining of your uterus <br>  Less thickening means less menstrual flow <br>  Eventually your menstrual flow may stop completely <br>  Once Mirena? is removed, your menstrual cycle will return to the way it was before you used Mirena? <br>  During the first 6 weeks of use, you should contact your healthcare professional to rule out pregnancy if you do not get your period or if you have other symptoms of pregnancy.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	I bled for three months straight.<br>  Just this month I finally got my first real period, and it was short!<br>  I love this thing!
xRQAsGRAaa	Eating one meal a day is the worst thing you can do if you're trying to lose weight. Your body will become like a sponge, and it will absorb ANYTHING you put into it, and store it away as fat just to try to survive.|`|zNGWFKXGaa	If you eat too little your body will store anything that comes in at places you dont want it. To loose weight you actually want a healthy body with good nutrition income to burn. Try to eat 3-5 very small meals per day, including only fruit, veggies, meat, fish, olive oil, salt, pepper, vinagre, nuts, dairies, goji berries. Cut out all the rest, mainly no sauces, mayo, fast food, sodas, corn syrup etc.... No diet soda! For drinking stick to water! Try to exercise, like spinning, running, yoga, rock climbing.|`|fOfqPATaaa	It sounds to me that you have an eating disorder and as someone recovering from one I can say that I know how you feel =(<br>  Your meal today is not a lot at all!<br>  As for only eating one meal a day it will make your body hold on to every bit of fat and sugar in everything you eat so don't do this!<br>  I know it's hard to eat 5 or 6 times like people say you should so try to eat 3 or 4 sensible meals =D<br>  Hope I helped!
AA11298562	Don't go all-protein.  There's lots of things your body needs, and depriving it of any of them is going to do damage.  If you want to cut down on carbs, that's fine, most people eat too many anyway, but don't cut them out completely.  Make sure you're still getting the vitamins you need, or your body is going to freak out on you and you won't lose any weight.  The more HEALTHY things you eat, the less you will crave unhealthy stuff, because your body will already have everything it needs.<br>  The key here is the walking-- it's not the distance, it's the time.  Studies show you need to walk at least 30 minutes a day, 6 days a week (or an hour, 3 days a week) to get results.  And we're talking a nice brisk walk, here, not a window-shopping mosey.  That plus a healthy diet will take the weight off just about anyone.|`|UETAqR8Taa	try cutting down on carbs not stop them completely. do not try any of the salespeople here selling teas and acai berry.<br>  <br>  You have gone all protein in your diet. Does this mean you have cut all carbs, bread, pasta, rice etc..<br>  <br>  You can do a low carb diet too with small portions of proteins.<br>  <br>  look up High carb foods on the net and avoid or at least lessen them<br>  <br>  look up low carb foods to know what you can eat fully.<br>  <br>  I would though have a small amount of protein in your diet too. eat as much fish as you can. Not just for protein but for omega 3 too.<br>  <br>  dont stop your walking. weight loss sensibly is a slow healthy process.<br>  hey! keep it up !!! dont get down your only 53 for heavens sake.
EcCbforQaa	It doesn't necessarily. It depends on you.|`|TsjqzanQaa	It varies from individual to individual.<br>  <br>  Some men retain their sex drives --called libido-- into old age, others don't.<br>  <br>  Same for women.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Why worry about something you have no control over, Bubba?  Cross that bridge when you get to it.  Life is waaaaaay too short to be worrying about things that haven't even happened yet!|`|HxXduL1maa	For both women and men, sexual desire or drive decreases gradually with age. However, testosterone, the hormone which primarily controls sexual drive in men, never stops being produced entirely. This is why it is not uncommon for men in their seventies and eighties to have an active libido. However, there are certain reasons why a man's libido may be affected for temporary periods of time at any point in their life cycle: stress, fatigue, preoccupation with work, side effects of medications, medical conditions, dissatisfaction with a relationship, and lack of desire for a partner, among others. <br>  <br>  A man's sexual life does change with age, however, even as desire is maintained. From ages twenty to thirty-five, men tend to masturbate less often, and they have fewer wet dreams. Some men in this age group notice that their penises are not as hard as they once were, and that they require direct stimulation to get hard. Around ages forty to fifty, in order to get an erection, a man may require direct stimulation, and his erection may not be as full or firm as before. It is easier for his penis to lose its hardness, and, once lost, more difficult to regain. Men's angle of erection may change -- a penis that once pointed up may now just stick straight out; one that once pointed straight out may now still be stiff but point slightly down. The need for orgasm is less pronounced than in younger years. The force of the ejaculation is less, as is the amount ejaculated. As men reach their fifties through seventies, physical and mental arousal become much more critical to erection. It takes longer to ejaculate, and men find they don't need to ejaculate every time. Semen may seem to seep out rather than "shoot out." <br>  <br>  What's important to remember is that these changes are normal bodily aging processes. Just as you wouldn't expect an Olympic runner to maintain his Olympic speed at age sixty, you shouldn't expect to maintain adolescent levels of sexual arousal twenty to thirty years later. However, the penis and the rest of the body never lose their capacity for giving and receiving pleasure! Alice hopes you enjoy a lifetime of good sex -- don't start worrying at age thirty!|`|NXBmcEz7aa	For some women, after the menopause, because their vaginae get drier and Sexual intercourse in no fun for them anymore, most especially if husbands do not apply lubricating creams or jellies.<br>  For most men, it depends on their health.  They usually slow down after 60, may be once a weak will be satisfying to them already.  But no sex at all will make them moody and grumpy.  Average age can't be definitely determined, usually it depends on their health, peace of mind and cordial relationship between each other.  Love never gets old, it just fades away!

Wear pajamas to bed not the same u/w from that day. <br>  <br>  Go commando on weekends.

lTnrjAXfaa	It doesn't really matter at what time you go to sleep, there really isn't any scientific proof that the human body needs to sleep to 'rest.' The same thing used to happen to me, and I tried this,<br>  <br>  1. Get two alarms, loud ones, set one 10 minutes after the other and place them close enough so you can hear them but far enough you actually have to get up te reach them. You'll be awake by the second one. (Or put them inside a small box with holes, so you can hear them but can't turn them off, eventually you'll wake up)<br>  <br>  2. This one worked for me but when it didn't I would usually wake up really late. Set the alarm really early, like 2 hours before the normal time you wake up, you will be at a sleeping stage where it's  easier to wake up. When you do, set the alarm to go off one hour later, afterwards make it some 30 minutes. By the time you need to be awake you will be.|`|600U6iAWaa	LOL Same story with me and I'm a high school senior.<br>  <br>  I've had this problem throughout all my years of school.

Getting up in the morning or getting out of the shower is a horrible feeling for me.|`|racnq84Vaa	Because you are not getting enough sleep.  12 is way too late.  You need to go to bed earlier.

AUOp1j5Saa	Did you just have an abortion?<br>  It's kinda hard to understand what you mean by that first sentence.<br>  You should probably consult the pharmacist before you take it in your case.<br>  <br>  You can get it at specific drugstores that carry it which you can look up on Plan B's website<br>   <br>  www.go2planb.com<br>  <br>  It usually costs between 40-50 USD.<br>  <br>  No studies have shown that it becomes any less effective with more uses, by the way, that's a total fabrication.<br>  <br>  It is effective within the first 72 hours after sex but not after that so be sure to get it soon.<br>  If you had sex a week ago and want to buy it now thinking it will induce abortion, you're out of luck.<br>  Sorry, I wish I could be more accurate in my response but it's hard to understand your question.|`|juhim6Bhaa	I think it's prescription.

Just ask your mom to leave the room.  If you ask her to leave that is your right, you are entitled to your privacy especially with your doctor.  If he tells your mom anything sue his a*s for all he's worth and tell your mom to back off your shiz.  <br>  <br>  And the bleeding is normal, that's what Plan B does.|`|amkvqb87aa	i really dont think it will matter that much.

I'm assuming you're in the US, so that makes you an adult. That means your doctor has no legal right to tell your mom anything without your permission. So, unless your mom goes into the exam room with you, she doesn't have to know anything, just make that clear to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Second of all, don't take chances with your health. You should try to understand your body. Do some independent research, ask your doctor some questions, don't let your embarrassment scare you away from taking care of yourself, and don't take nasty medicines like plan B unnecessarily.  <br>  <br>  Go to you OBGYN, tell her you took plan B, and let her know your concerns. If you think there is any glimmer that your mom might be a reasonable women, let her know about certain aspects of your life. A lot of times (but not always) moms can be valuable sources of information and support if you're honest with them. (Use your judgment)<br>  <br>  The journal is a good idea, the more you know about your cycle, about how your body feels, what feels right and what feels wrong, the more confident you'll be and the less chance you'll panic or let your fear paralyze you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
xpKRPVIIaa	Your period doesn't usually become regulated for a while.<br>  Even the first year or two.<br>  If you miss up to 6 months, however, it might be an issue. <br>  I found out I have cystic ovaries, which stop the blood flow.<br>  But if it's your first period it's unlikely that this is an issue.|`|KRqse9eeaa	all women are different when it comes to their periods but in answer to your question it may take a lil while for your periods to regulate so don't worry things should be ok.

HRQjffv8aa	Okay..so im going to be honest here kay?<br>  <br>  Your body is really in good shape EXCEPT your stomach =/<br>  <br>  Sorry to say that half the people here are lying.. because they're commenting on your hair and avoiding your real question. But im still going to say , nice hair. <br>  <br>  Your stomach is the only problem really, from what I can see your legs are good too and your face doesnt look fat at all. Your arems are nice and toned as well, your stomach just seems to be flabby compared to the rest of your body.<br>  <br>  And to answer your question, yes it is your stomach but the rest is sexy. Try doing some crunches when you wake up or before you eat, like 50 when you wake and 50 before you sleep, do that every other day and keep increasing the number of times you do crunches it'll get better. <br>  <br>  Sorry if I offended you in away but you asked for the truth, oh and im just wondering.. Do you drink beer? because that might be the cause of it, if you dont then you just seem to gain weight in your stomach more than at other body parts. <br>  <br>  Anyway, like I said crunches would do good for you and try some pilates too. =) but I think you look pretty good now, actually very good. Im just saying that fixn up your stomach to make it more proportioned with your body would make you look even better.<br>  <br>  Well there, my honest opinion =)|`|koXcq0l1aa	The truth is that with exercise, you will be just curvy and you really should watch what you're eating.<br>  <br>  And btw, your stomach and love handles are the only fat on you.|`|TAmMzRIfaa	You look really cute.<br>  You're thin but i have no idea why your stomach seems slightly chubbier. well, anyway,love your hair.<br>  (:|`|AA10026200	Well first off I thought you look very pretty, on a second look  tho it's hard to tell  I would  think you are pregnant, which is not a judgment an if that's the case ..congratulations|`|ArtZzDU8aa	You are really cute!

5GW5xGCwaa	You should tell him to chill.  Men don't typically show symptoms of HPV and it's even rarer that they get tested for it.  So, experts believe that 90, yes NINETY percent of sexually active people have HPV and men are the carriers who pretty much never have to worry about it affecting them beyond the angry chick that comes at them with pre-cancerous lesions that came from the HPV they spread around.  But anyways, honestly, if it hadn't been you someone else would have given him HPV.  He should be glad it was with someone he connected with and not some two-bit hussy.  <br>  <br>  And not all strains of HPV clear up. Nope, some you carry with you FOREVER.  Not to scare you.  <br>  <br>  But if you gave him some perspective on the disease, like the fact that almost anyone who has sex carries some strain of it and the fact that he will likely never deal with the symptoms I don't see why he'd still be freaked.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	Too bad, no, never.

O23x96t5aa	Any ear infection has to be seen by an ENT surgeon or at least your GP because it can damage your ear drum leading to permanent hearing loss.  It is not wise to put ear drops for ear infection unless advised by a doctor after looking inside your ear because if the ear drum is perforated the drops may do more harm than good.  Most ear infections will need an antibiotic for at least 7 days for complete cure of the problem.  So do go and see your doctor preferably an ENT as soon as possible.  In the mean time don't put any drops in the ear.  If there is any delay in seeing the doctor I think you should start on an antibiotic like amoxycillin or amoxyclav now (if you are not allergic to penicillin).  But it is always better to start antibiotics after doctor's consultation.  Go to emergency dept. now.|`|gWX21Jtwaa	It is getting worse.<br>  Go see a doc|`|494f917287bcb72589c802dc7322ca19aa	Your symptoms are common for ear infections, however you have to get some antibiotics to get rid of the ear infection, or it might get worst
FZWkA9X5aa	I had a colonoscopy recently myself and used MoviPrep for it as well. The MoviPrep will clean you out pretty good no matter what, so it's not completely necessary that you begin prepping now.<br>  <br>  Though, if you're super scared about being on the safe side, a few days before you go in for the colonoscopy, you may want to start eating lighter foods that won't weigh you down. I know that at least two days prior to mine, I was really nervous about eating too much of anything, just because I didn't want to have tons and tons of waste to eliminate during my day of prep.<br>  <br>  As for the actual procedure itself, DON'T WORRY AT ALL!!! It goes relatively smooth and you barely feel anything at all, especially since they will use light sedatives to make you relax, if they don't put you to sleep all together. The nurses are usually pretty good about giving you lots of blankets and things to make sure you don't feel so "naked" during the procedure either. Honestly, the day before when you are having to drink that awful MoviPrep solution and nothing but clear liquids is really the worst part of the entire experience!|`|lQbyeAcHaa	no do not take any fiber the doctor will give you a prescription for one on the following : Golytely (also called Colyte, or Nulytely), phospho-soda, and sodium phosphate tablets (Osmo-Prep and Visicol). and that will clear you out pretty good|`|wdz5RMaeaa	Wow, me too!

wFzizI2faa	i havnt read to much on the subject, but i smoke a lot of hookah! I smoke a lot of cigs too. in my experience, hookah tobacco seems a lot less harmful. the smoke is smoother, cooler, and doesnt contain as many chemicals. cigs have a lot of added chemicals and much more nicotine, making it more addictive and more harmful. im sure hookah smoke does contain more tar, but only cause you smoke it for a longer period of time. but id have to imagine that the hookah tobacco is better for you than cigs mainly because of the additives and other crap that gets put into cig tobacco.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Please if you're on here asking about it than you're  Intelligent enough to realize it's a ridiculous habit.

But don't worry too much, for one thing, most of the time, people don't keep up with friends from middle and high school. As you grow older, your interests will differ from one another and you'll start making new friends in college. Dealing with a bully can always be hard, and if you let it bother you, it will just keep getting worse. They feed off making you unhappy, and the more you show it gets to you, the better it makes them feel. Your best bet is to just ignore them.<br>  <br>  I know its so so hard to just ignore it, but even if it really bothers you, don't let them know. Even a few good friends are more than some people have, so be thankful for the good friends you have. Invite other people to hang out with you, and don't be picky about friends because someone is "nerdy" or a "loner." They can be the most interesting people, and I bet would really love to have good friends like you.<br>  <br>  If the bullying keeps up and you've asked her to stop, talk to your school consellor or another teacher and let them know shes picking on you. No one should have to endure that, so make sure to speak up, because odds are, if shes doing it to you, shes doing it to someone else.|`|TE9eJZYlaa	I was bullied in jr high as well it sucked but you just need to find friends that will stick with you, i just graduated high school last year and i still have 2 of my clossest friends from grade 7 still by my side and in the end i was one of the more popular kids in high school by grade 12, btw i know how adults think they can solve their issues by talking to them about bulling but honestly i went down that road and its not worth it. in my opinion id recomend talking to your good friends or a older brother or sister  or somone near your age about how you feel take care hope you find somone to talk to :)

After its completely healed you can buy scar ointments and patches that can work fairly well. Concealler makeup can be used to cover up scars/tattooes AFTER its healed.<br>  <br>  I would give your son a stern talking to as well. While he may have had good intentions, hurting himself to make a point is not the way to go. Try not to yell and hear him out about it. Also, maybe you can talk to him about the proper methods for helping his girlfriend. Shes obviously suffering from depression or desperately craving attention. Its a red flag there is something seriously wrong and she needs proper help from a therapist.|`|8xH05DqDaa	if the scar is still scabbed you can put aloe gel (off the plant) on it, then get one of those cocoa butter sticks and keep it moisturized. <br>  <br>  the only other and best thing is to do a water fast for 3 days or just eat organic for 3 days (no meats or milk at all). In that time you will be able to practically watch the scar heal - but if it is healed already, you would have to fast for about 2 weeks, which is scary because if you don't know exactly what you are doing you could kill yourself << if you decide to do that >> speak to a holistic doctor who may be of assistance << really!!<br>  <br>  Scar tissue can't heal most of the time because of our diet, and eating too much causes such havoc on our healing since digesting is one of the hardest things our bodies can do (even more than running a marathon), and it also takes away all of the energy that would be necessary to heal us - late night eating meats... a no no, since that is the time we heal.|`|edb57fef84d664564d81c344939ca8bfaa	Yes, do it Neosporin is good. There will be no infection. It will heal him.<br>  <br>  Look for God. Go to a Christian Church and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and you will see the change in all of you and in your house. Pray  for your son or ask for prayer to the Pastor of the Church. Pray is when you talk to God about all your situations. (John 1:10-13); (Jeremiah 33:3); (Psalm 34); (Ephesians 1:3); Etc. God has beautiful promises for our children. <br>  <br>  I always pray for my children and I know that God will take care them.

fk9AvB25aa	Possibly. No I'm are not doctors but I can try to offer advice with out being an a-h0le and praying probably won't make some thing like this go away. <br>  The first out break usually hurts but if it's mild enough all it could feel like is a bad rash. You should know that you can get herpes with out cheating, it could have come from a past partner as well. All it takes is for one of you to have either oral or genital herpes and not even know it. Most people have cold sores and don't know that they can be cause by oral herpes. You don't have to be fooling aroud or having sex to get cold sores, you cen get them by innocently kissing some one who has them. They can be passed to the genitals during oral sex if your partner has any signs of an out break (same thing happened to me so it's possible). <br>  I have been monogamus with my boy friend for over 3 years and he managed to pass cold sores onto my genitals.<br>  You should tell your wife about this, she does deserve to know before she spreads it to a new partner. You should see a doctor, try looking up some free clinics or phone up planned parent hood and see what they can do for you.|`|AA10558731	For the millionth time ... we are not doctors. We lie about everything under the sun just for the hell of it. Why would you ask Yahoo Answers for medical advice?<br>  <br>  Go see a doctor. They went to medical school, for cryin' out loud. They have big ol' books filled with color pictures and charts and diagrams and everything to tell them just what you did to your pecker and how to deal with it. They have a sheepskin on the wall telling what medical school (or schools) they went to and when they graduated so you can check up on them. You can bill your insurance company if you want. You can even go to a free clinic if your city has one.<br>  <br>  But don't ask us. We'll just laugh at you and lie. Folks here will tell you a sure cure is to put calamine lotion on it and go screw a giraffe while singing "I Left My Heart in San Francisco" in a minor key.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but it's the truth.<br>  <br>  Besides, herpes shows up quicker than a divorce.

29b322b8dad8da9d3bba5c207f440a52aa	well, ill try, i dont know whats wrong, but a way you might be able to understand what changes you is to keep a journal, with full detail, and time to time, go back and read what you have written, and when you wrote it, if you see a pattern you may be able to realize the problem, and then you can try fixing it. I think, you can also try just letting it out, i kickbox, and it just lets all my energy go into somthing productive.

I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).  I go through everyday alot of the same symptoms: the depression, the "mask", as I call it by joking and smiling all the time until I'm alone and then I scared and angry and feel so empty inside.  My emotions jump around like you wouldn't believe.  I song or a look from a girl (good or bad) and I'm up and down like a yo-yo.  Parnoid about yourself and others, judging yourself to the point where you don't know actually who you are. I talk to myself all the time.  I have had some really bad s#!+ in my life and ended up to the point of  it was easier to be alone, to be by myself so know one would hurt me.  But at the same time, wanting to be with people and not be so alone.  I know it's scary, God I know.  But is there anyone in your life you can trust, like a guidance counsulor, a friend, anyone who can help you.  The first step is the scariest part, but you need help.  It's not a phase, your not going to grow out of it.  But most of all, your not going crazy.  You have something that is treatable with counsuling and medications.  But you have to make the first step on your own, that's why it's the scariest of all, you have to do it yourself.  Go to your doctor and tell him what's going on with you, with what's inside of you.  I first went to my regular doctor and he listened to me, he didn't judge me.  And he got me some help.  Please do what I'm asking.  I was 27 before I started, till I made myself go get help.  Don't wait that long.  do it now, so you can get better.   I go to <a href="http://www.nami.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nami.org/</a> , the national association of mental health.    There are links you can go to that show you where there are places you can go to find help.  There are message boards that connect you to people who m are living the life you are, with problems like you have, who help each other and suppport one another.  But the first step you have to do alone.  E-mail me if you need help.  Please take that first step because to get yourself help.  Be strong.

I would recommend that because this is bothering you that you find a reliable therapist in your area and go talk to them. In order to really help you get to the problem more information is needed. We're you or are you abused, physically and or verbally? Has anything traumatic happen to you early in your life? How is your family life? Without knowing all this it's hard to make any kind of diagnosis's. But one thing I can tell you is that reading your bible and praying to God can and will help.

"People are very bothered by skin discoloration," offers Lynn McKinley-Grant, M.D., a doctor in Washington, D.C., who is board-certified in dermatology and internal medicine. "Whatever kind of discoloration it is — from melasma to age spots, people want it gone," says the private-practice dermatologist. For the most part, any type of discoloration — if it's that bothersome — can be rectified, with the arrival of the latest lasers and other innovative medical treatments.<br>  <br>  Off-Color Skin Problems<br>  From age spots to vitiligo, unsightly skin color changes can embarrass even the most thick-skinned among us. These are some of the most common skin-souring marks:<br>  <br>      * Birthmarks. The dark marks come in various shapes and sizes, appearing at birth or soon after in shades of red and brown. The exact causes are not known, but some are related to blood vessel deformities occurring as early as the embryo's first month.<br>  <br>        Today's Treatments. Some types disappear during childhood — for other, lasers (including those called the Flash Pump Dye and the Q-Switch Ruby) can often reduce or obliterate the blobs).<br>      * Moles. Medically known as pigmented naevi, the brown-to-blackish blemishes can be flat or raised and can grow or disappear with age. Moles are formed when the skin's natural pigment (melanin) coagulates.<br>  <br>        Today's Treatments. The Ruby laser can remove moles (proven benign in biopsies).<br>      * Age Spots. These spots, which often appear on the face, chest and hands as we age, are technically known as solar lentigo. Don't mistake them for freckles — age spots tend to be larger and more irregular in shape. Age spots appear when sun damage throws off the patterns of pigment-producing melanocytes.<br>  <br>        Today's Treatments. Lightening creams, chemical peels and laser procedures can help make age spots a problem of the past.<br>      * Melasma. These brown stains on the face or chest are most common in women during the second half of pregnancy and those taking the birth control pill. Hormones from pregnancy or the pill can increase the body's production of melanin, which can land unevenly in different areas. Sunbathing can enhance the staining effect — staying out of the sun is best, and using an SPF 15+ sunscreen is the next-best thing.<br>  <br>        Today's Treatments. Options range from topical creams, to light glycolic acid peels, to the Ruby laser for resistant remnants.<br>      * Vitiligo. This total loss of skin pigment, which some say accounts for changes in Michael Jackson's skin color, affects 1 percent of the population. People may be at higher risk for this skin bleaching if they have thyroid disorders, pernicious anemia, decreased adrenal gland function or a condition called alopecia areata that causes hair loss. Possible causes include abnormal nerve cells that hinder the body's production of pigment or an autoimmune or autotoxic reaction in which the pigment cells are attacked.<br>  <br>        Today's Treatments. There are two ways to go: When a high percentage of pigment has been lost, an oral medication can rid the body of the remaining pigmentation to achieve a uniform lighter look. For those with less pigment loss, a type of so-called ultraviolet therapy sometimes restores a significant amount of pigment to the white patches.<br>      * Thread Veins. These are dilated veins that manifest as fine red traces on the cheeks or legs. More common in women than in men, contributing causes might include heredity, hormones, skin type, photo-damage, injury, long periods of sitting or standing and other things that could increase pressure within the veins.<br>  <br>        Today's Treatments. Lasers are used a lot these days, but another option is a procedure called sclerotherapy, in which saline solution or another chemical is injected into the vein, shutting off the blood supply. But because of sclerotherapy's risks, especially around the face and ankles, vascular lasers are the treatment of choice for these areas.<br>  <br>  Blotch-Be-Gone<br>  Choose your treatment — there's no need, anymore, to let unsightly blotches impose on your otherwise even skin tone. The last few years have brought to life lasers that lighten and color-changing creams, as well as other cosmetic procedures that in yesteryear were the stuff of cosmetic dreams.

gnLyauf8aa	dude, life teaches u a lesson! " do in when it's small or don't do it at all".... you can't stop erections and it usually happens during your REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep, this is usually before and after deep sleep.. so go to your doctor and ask for some pills so it'll ease the pain... good luck!|`|84e3267504eea1bf89bf550ce051e4f9aa	gosh, that's too  bad.  when i got cut, the doc put some gauze around me so that the base of my penis would erect, but not the top part.  that really helped.  i got night wood, too, and i could feel it pulling on the stitches, but it wasn't all that bad.  but then, i also have a high pain tolerance.  as long it doesn't pull any of the stitches out, you should be fine.  i'd lay off the drugs--they might be contributing to the undbidden wood.  by this point it'll be sore, yes, but it shouldn't hurt all that much.|`|AA10404836	That is going to happen. Just make sure the site is kept clean - and real clean so you wont get an infection. The erections should go away once you start healing..there really is nothing you can do about them at this point.|`|2b585d84b2ef2cd546d498a301c7710aaa	Yes. Call your doctor, he may have a pill to suppress this.

You can look forward to it now that you have cut the skin off that protected all the nerves.<br>  <br>  Buy the way...get ready for pre-mature ejaculations now.<br>  <br>  Just keep it clean and when it is all healed you won't have to take care of it anymore.  I think that you have made a terrible trade off! Less cleaning is going to equal quicker sex.<br>  <br>  I do hope there was a medical reason involved.|`|8b7f8e496ede0dcde287f7fa3adf10c8aa	poor dude I feel for you....|`|CKA1Ts7Vaa	vikadin, the answer to everything|`|rQ0SJrsjaa	Didn't the doctor tell you what to do.

AA11522944	Undescended testicle, called cryptorchidism, refers to a testicle that fails to move into the scrotum. This is a condition that is present at birth.<br>  <br>  The primary treatment for this condition is surgery. Often, a child is watched until the age of one to see if the testicle will move into the scrotum by itself. If not, affected testicles can be brought down into the scrotum using surgery. Surgery improves cosmetic appearance and makes examination of the testicles to check for cancer easier. Surgery may also improve the chance of future fertility in some cases.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below<br>  <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/undescended-testicle/overview.html" rel="nofollow">http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.allhealth.com.au/html/s02_article/article_view.asp?nav_top_id=4&id=4&art_id=22770&nav_cat_id=205&history=2&cr=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.allhealth.com.au/html/s02_art...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/pageContent.asp?pageCode=AZUNDESCENDED" rel="nofollow">http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/pageCo...</a>|`|AA11785060	Do you have two testicles in your sac that you can feel?  Your balls are dropped dude. Not sure what you are expecting. They don't necessarily hang down further when puberty starts, just get bigger as they mature into functional sex organs.  Balls drop at or around birth. If your balls had not dropped your pediatrician would have noticed, as would your mother or dad, and they would have made sure the problem was addressed well before puberty. <br>  <br>  Most guys your age pretty much have a taunt sac all the time, ready to unload at a moment's notice. Doesn't usually hang loose and low all the time, until you are around 35 or 40 yrs of age. If even then. <br>  <br>  If you actually don't have any testicles in your scrotum, which I seriously doubt, you do need to see a doctor.

And no, you aren't supposed to be dry.|`|M9JAJ7DYaa	normal       :P|`|dwlV84IMaa	discharge is completely normal. it's the body's natural way of keeping you clean and moist in that area. clear or white-ish discharge is normal. if it's a little bit clumpy, that usally means you're ovulating or it's getting almost time for your period. if it's a little brown, that's normal for after your period. the brown-ness of it is dead blood cells left over after your period. but if it turns a yellow or green color along with a particularly foul odor, you should call your doctor. that's definitely not normal. don't freak out and call 911, but make an appt. with your ob-gyn and they will be able to tell you exactly what the problem is. it's also not normal for women who are still menstrating to experience vaginal dryness. the only time that would be semi-normal is if you're going through menopause. hope that helps :-)

You are right that everyone reacts differently to all medication, so it would be hard to guess what possible side effects you may have. I just wanted to let you know, if you do find it makes you feel a bit nauseous, you can take the pill at night, just before you go to bed. This way you are going to sleep and are less likely to suffer from the mild nausea. Anyhow.. best of luck with it!

lQbyeAcHaa	omg go pee you can get very sick from holding in your pee for to long you bladder is holding anywhere from 50 to 500 milliliters of urine before we feel the urge to relieve ourselves. The bladder wall has receptors that measure how much the bladder is being stretched to accommodate incoming waste. When our bladders are about half full, these receptors send a signal to the brain telling us it's time to visit the bathroom. In normal situations, the brain then signals the bladder to hold on tight until the right time, place, and toilet presents itself. Most adults have control over bathroom urges, and can act on or delay urges as needed.<br>  <br>  In other words, while bladder function is an automatic process, it is our brains that choose when to visit the bathroom. How long a person can ignore the need to pee depends of the size of a person's bladder and their will. Consciously holding in your urine will eventually cause the body to override the brain's attempts to delay urination, and in all likelihood, the person will simply wet their pants. Research has not shown that holding your pee will cause rupture of the bladder or bladder infections — just incontinence.<br>  <br>  A bladder infection, or cystitis, is an inflammation or infection of the bladder, and is not likely to result from holding urine too long. Similar to urinary tract infections (UTIs), bladder infections occur when bacteria make their way into the bladder via the urethra, the tube that urine travels through to exit the body. Women are more likely to get bladder infections because they have shorter urethras than men. Sexual activity is a common cause of UTIs and bladder infections for women and men. Although bladder infections and UTIs aren't caused by holding your pee, they may make you to feel like you have to pee all the time — one of the most common symptoms of these infections is feeling the urge to urinate very frequently.<br>  <br>  While the treatment for bladder infections is a fairly simple antibiotic routine, untreated bladder infections may lead to more severe outcomes, including kidney damage or bacterial bloodstream infection (bacteremia). Bacteria in the bloodstream can be dangerous <br>  So, when you've got to go, try and make your way to the toilet before you become uncomfortable. But if you have to hold it, you can sit tight knowing your inconvenience is unlikely to lead to an infection.<br>  <br>  sorry i am a medic in lamens terms take a piss and stop holding it|`|Xq16SZAiaa	holding it in can cause bladder problems|`|ZvU093GPaa	yes that could cause bladder infections . not to mention water retention in the body it self|`|SeVyIfQ6aa	bad idea, let it go
kjEKhP7Paa	You do know that all the above is actually air pollution right? You may even have an allergy to some of it. Or you, like me are just sensitive to heavy scents. Do you know why an air purifier kills all of those smells you listed? Pollution. IF your family doesn't believe you, you can look it up.
xRQAsGRAaa	Ah this one will be easy, finally someone who will actually give it some time. Everyone else on here wants to lose it in a month or less, which is impossible to do it healthily. <br>  <br>  I do not know your weight right now, or your goal weight, so I will just give you the chart that I use as a general rule for my female customers. <br>  <br>  You want to try to eat 4-6 small meals a day. I know this sounds weird, but let me explain. When you eat only 3 larger meals a day, you have a huge gap between your meals. Your body resorts to storing the unused calories as fat to get you to your next meal. If you eat 4-6 meals a day, your body learns(and adjusts), and knows another meal is coming up right away, so it doesn't need to store the food as fat, it just uses what it needs, and passes the rest right through you, storing MUCH less as fat.<br>  <br>  Here's a rough chart I use for the women who come to me. It's very accurate, although every person's body is different. (by the way, the elliptical is ok as a replacement for running if you have bad knees)<br>  <br>  If you're over 200 pounds: eat 1800 calories a day, in 4-6 meals. <br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  If you're between 160 and 200: eat 1600 calories a day, in 4-6 meals.<br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  If you're 130-160: eat 1500 calories a day, in 4-6 meals<br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  100-130 pounds: Eat 1300 calories a day in 4-6 meals<br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  Under 100 pounds: eat 1200 calories a day in 4-6 meals<br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  Every time you get bumped down to a lower weight class, decrease the calories according to this chart. Since I'm not gonna be there with you, you may need to adjust it slightly to suit your needs. Also remember that the first few pounds are very easy, then you usually hit a wall for about a week, then you'll start losing weight again. Don't be intimidated if you lose 5 pounds the first week, then only 2 pounds the second week. <br>  <br>  Once you hit your target weight, increase your calorie intake by about 200 calories. If you're still losing weight, increase it more, as needed to maintain your weight(assuming you continue to work out).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

And the more muscle you have, the more you can eat in a day because muscle burns fat even when you are just sitting.  Like 3 days a week do 2 sets of bicep and tricep curls, and then 2 days a week do squats, lunges, crunches, etc.  an add at least 20 min of cardio daily. <br>  <br>  I hope that was helpful|`|uTW2KW9raa	the only way besides EATING HEALTHY and EXERCISE is liposuction/surgery.<br>  <br>  Start going to the gym 4-5x a week, and doing strength training 3-4x a week and eating more healthily; 1200 cals a day.<br>  <br>  and just cut out all junk foods and sweets and pastas, rice, potatoes, pop/soda, white bread and so on.<br>  <br>  The formula for weight loss is really simple - but its hard for people to stay commited and motivated.

More stress at work or home could be a cause. Had any children recently or a job change? Also, what kind of water do you have in your home? Is it different than the water you used to use? DO you still live in the same area? Is more or less polluted than it used to be? Also, look at your diet. If it is not balanced, it will effect the oil production in your glands. Also, check to see if you have this problem anywhere else on your body.  <br>  <br>  Start looking at these things instead of focusing squarely on the skin. Since you have gone to several doctors and have tried almost everything you can, you have to start looking at other things around you. Don;t make drastic changes all at once.

I'm only 20 but it started early for me..i was around 11 when i got my first break outs and it only became worse..Its cleared up a lot and what i think has helped alot is stop using the products..just stop completley..you might not listen to me or even think im telling you the truth but its true and it works...but that doesnt mean you shouldnt wash your face..wash it atleast 2-3 times a day with plain water! just water. eventually you will notice that it helps..because sometimes acne can just be irratated by acne medication and make it looks worse and red. what your skin needs is natural water. just do it for alteast 2-3 weeks or a month put away all the chemically stuff and do it. it just might work. most acne product cause you to scar because they are all so harsh and dry out the skin..trust me i know!|`|2NwI03Mtaa	well my mom uses lemons yes lemon, and she squeezes them then put sugar, after leave it in your face for 5 minutes rinse it towel dry , put a face cream , make sure you do it before you sleep do this every 4 days. also wash your pillow cases =)|`|aOFdtoR4aa	WARNING!

Do this a couple times daily and it will help draw out the impurities, dry the sores out, and prevent future breakouts.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|fOfqPATaaa	I don't know too much about wrestling so I'm not sure what a good weight class for you is but I can tell you this..<br>  I watched my cousin starve himself for 4 years to make weight for wrestling and since he's quit(about a year, he quit when he graduated high school) he's been so happy!

oC3mzKG8aa	Hi<br>  It is not easy to say in terms of weeks pregnant only that the levels of the hCG should double every couple of days.  So I guess the best way to put your mind at ease would be to have the blood work repeated and make sure the hCG is on the increase.  I also found this on a web site.<br>  <br>  <br>  Normal HCG blood levels vary widely between different women and in different pregnancies for the same woman. Be very careful when trying to 'interpret the numbers'. During the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the level itself is NOT as important in how much it is rising every few days. Some normal pregnancies will have quite low HCG levels and still progress, ending in the birth of a healthy baby. The best way to confirm if a pregnancy is progressing is to repeat the blood test in 2 to 3 days time, and perhaps again 2 to 3 days after that. This is aimed at seeing if the HCG level is rising adequately. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=6620&page=8" rel="nofollow">http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=6...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps good luck
XscVe0AYaa	There are two methods I use that almost always work:<br>  <br>  1.  "Massage" the back part of the roof of your mouth with your tongue.  Just bring your tongue as far back as you comfortably can and pretend you're massaging the roof of your mouth.  It will relax the muscles down farther causing the hiccups.<br>  <br>  2.  Drink a glass of water "upside down" by putting your upper lip over the FAR side of the glass (not the near side), then slowly bending over and drinking some of it in that position.  This one works all the time.|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	It's a lot easier to huff a whippet.|`|vIw47BEFaa	There are two types of hiccups.  One that we all normally experience and know, which can be stopped by drinking water, thinking somewhere else, by bhastrika pranayama or other techniques.  But, there is another type of hiccups which is called hysteric hiccups.  It need be investigated and proper medicines taken.  The underlying cause could be serious, in some cases the lungs, the heart and the pulmonary veins would be involved or in some cases the bones and its marrows may be involved, apart from stomach &  oxidation process.  In such hiccups it very dangerous to drink water as the water caught between air could cause suffocation and is  highly painful.  In the case of drunk person as I see it, the brain is not in its efficient function due to the effect of alcohol and therefore, thoughts in certain directions tend to get stuck which effects the normal faculties of the brain including the necessity to breathe normally.  When the gaps between the breathing increases consequently, the carbon dioxide accumulation in the body increases and starvation for oxygen takes places which induces Yawning.  When Yawning is broken up due to some reason, it takes the shape of hiccups.  Inorder to evaluate that it is necessary for us to have a separate science tracking the movement of gases(air) inside the body just like we track the cold current and hot current and the like on the surface of the earth through contours etc. <br>  <br>       Hiccups are cured in homeopathy through various medicines.

If you google 'weak on left side' there are a number of forums that come up with an assortment of suggestions and many seem to be related to nerve disorders.  It could be something like a blocked nerve.  It could be a misalignment that a chiropractor giving a proper adjustment could correct. It could be thyroid or other glandular problems.  Sometimes when nerves are blocked it can cause weakness in that region of the body.  I've also discovered through studying Homeopathy that there are a number of ailments that produce symptoms associated with a particular side of the body.  Abnormal bloodwork could be something as simple as low potassium so it's best to wait and see what the second results are before coming to any conclusion.  Your best bet is to wait and see what the results are.  It could be something simple and easy to resolve, and there is the possibility is something more complicated.  If there's no immediate resolution seek out second opinions, and even look to alternative treatments, like chiropractic, or treatment by a wholistic physician or practitioner like a Homeopath or Naturopath.

8CGOfmk3aa	Protein deficiency, especially in newborns, will cause fatty liver. It is the liver's job to process carbs, fats, and proteins. The liver processes fats by putting a protein coat to make a lipoprotein so that it can be able to be transported in your circulation. However, since there is a protein deficiency, the liver is not able to apply the protein coat on the fat, and as a result, the fat stays in the liver and thus fatty liver. This is also called kwashiorkor.

4RDfca9saa	Nausea with migraines is very common. I always get really sick to my stomach when I have a migraine. Dizziness is pretty common too; I experience that a lot as well. However, if you are experiencing this a lot then you need to talk to your doctor about it. Have you mentioned how often you get headaches and migraines? You may need tests run, and at the very least you should be put on medication for your headaches/migraines. I get headaches and migraines a lot, but you shouldn't be getting them so frequently.<br>  <br>  As for the diarrhea and severe nausea...I can tell you that it is more than likely from anxiety. Your anxiety about your emetophobia is probably the cause of your nausea and diarrhea. Severe stress will cause stomach upset. You would be surprised at the problems stress and anxiety can cause. Take it from someone who knows and has been there. My stomach was messed up for years because of stress. I was sick all of the time. <br>  <br>  Here are some tips to help with nausea and the panic you feel because of emetophobia:<br>  <br>  -When you feel a wave of nausea, close your eyes and take small but slow breaths. <br>  <br>  -Try to avoid that state of panic where full-blown anxiety takes over and you can't think properly. When you get so worked up and upset it makes you feel even sicker, which makes your anxiety even worse. It's a vicious cycle.<br>  <br>  -Try to carry mint or ginger with you. Mint gum is great for helping nausea. I carry mint gum with me all the time to chew when my stomach is upset. You can buy ginger capsules OTC and they are also great for nausea. I find the gum helps me with anxiety whenever I suffer from a panic attack.<br>  <br>  -Do something to take your mind off your nausea. Watch TV (something funny will help a lot...laughter is the best medicine!), play games, or read a book. If you are in public, close your eyes and visualize your "happy place" to help stay calm. If you are in something like a work environment, step outside and get some fresh air for a few minutes. Fresh air always helps.<br>  <br>  -If you can, try to sit in front of a fan or maybe carry a mini portable fan with you. I get really hot when I feel sick and a fan helps my nausea a lot.<br>  <br>  -Remember that you WILL be okay. Chances are you will NOT get sick. Even if you do, though (I know it's a terrifying thought)...you will be okay. You will get through it. <br>  <br>  <br>  As I said...it honestly sounds like anxiety to me. Anxiety can make you feel incredibly sick and cause all kind of gastrointestinal problems. Try these tips. If you still are having a lot of these problems, go back to your doctor and explain your symptoms. If the doctor blows you off or doesn't take you seriously then find one who will. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you need to talk (emetophobia is very difficult to deal with, after all) then feel free to e-mail me. I would be glad to listen if you need to talk, and I can recommend some great books and websites. Good luck to you, and I hope you feel better soon!!<br>  <br>  Also...be careful to make sure you don't take too much Zofran as that could cause you further problems. If Zofran doesn't help then I would recommend Phenergan. Phenergan was the only thing that helped me when I suffered debilitating nausea.|`|lQbyeAcHaa	the bad news is that zofran has the same side effects that you are trying to get rid of More common side effects may include: <br>  Constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, headache and nausea give the medication a little more time or ask your doctor for a different drug like Compro, Atarax or Compazine Spansule hope that helps|`|T0KxzmS7aa	Hep A

6P2ADOAzaa	Mosquitoes are rather a rare sight during broad day light.  So they tend to lie low anywhere in the home or school buildings.  Biting time is from dusk to dawn and they home on carbon dioxide we breathe out to find their targets.<br>  <br>  First get rid of breeding places which the mosquitoes can use, that is stagnant water, so fill in any holes on the ground or trees around your school or home.  Also get rid of any disused containers such as pots, tins, mugs, glasses or bottles.  The mosquito is a very opportunistic creature and it can take advantage of any small body of water, and quickly lay eggs which hatch and transform into adult mosquito within a very short time in deed.  If there is no breeding ground the mosquito wont hang around.<br>  <br>  In the evenings, if you have to stay outdoors, wear a long trousers and hat.  Air conditioners in the house not only dissipate the carbon dioxide, but it can blow away the mosquitoes.  By all means sleep inside a mosquito net if you have to.  Insecticide spray can help, but they tend to become ineffective fairly quickly.<br>  <br>  I hope this will help you in your quest to prevent malaria by getting rid of the mosquito from your environment.<br>  <br>  Pellegrini Kitara-Okot<br>  http:www.malariapreventiontips.com|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Sorry but i have no idea what you're asking.

Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|XN0sRoqpaa	play basketball. its proven that it makes people taller|`|uQKh8b5Haa	A lot of those things you are doing do help but is really minimal.<br>  <br>  A huge part of how tall u're gona be depends on ur parents/family gene.

HeBFxZVCaa	Why do we wake up" makes much more sense than the question "Why do we sleep". "Why do we wake up" is an easily answerable question, too. For one thing, the body's metabolic system shifts into the catabolic phase. The body's cells are tearing themselves down in support of the body's need for energy to be mobile, to obtain food and to procreate. Being awake, however, is a very destructive metabolic phase, something that the body can only tolerate for a matter of several hours, after which the body must revert to its 'default' mode - sleep, the anabolic phase when damage is repaired, growth can take place and the body's heightened immuned defenses intensify their battle against the foreign organisms and viruses that have invaded the animal. For current research and excellent reading on the topic and importance of sleep, read Reuben Naiman's book, The Healing Night.<br>  <br>  Each night, about a quarter of time spent sleeping, is given to REM sleep, during which the brain is anything but idle. REM stands for rapid eye movement, and it corresponds with vivid dreams, suggesting that it plays a role in consolidating memories. But there’s probably more to it: Though antidepressants suppress REM sleep, patients taking them suffer no memory impairment.<br>  <br>  It's possible that sleep, generally, is the way that our mind transfers short term memory (RAM) into long term brain and muscle memory (Disk). This would help explain many phenomena, from the superior performance of students who sleep rather than "cram" prior to a test, to the documented importance of repetition across sleep cycles as a way to train the mind and body for athletic and musical performance.<br>  <br>  it's like rebooting a computer once its finished downloading its ready to go again.|`|pSpWOsiQaa	something wakes you up, partners movement,alarms,etc.
jPooSycJaa	Adderall tends to give slight depression for about three or four days after abruptly discontinuing.  After that, you just go back to the symptoms you had before starting the medication.  If you don't feel good now, you may want to ask your doctor for a trial of a different stimulant medication (these are not evil medications - unless you ask Tom Cruise.)  If the medication doesn't make you actually feel good (normal) then try something different, there are many choices - even of the cheaper generics like Dexadrine or Methylin.  Good luck!|`|I8MUpN04aa	why are you stopping the medication? is this what your doctor told you to do? you should never stop a medication without an ok from your doctor because you may cause more harm to yourself. always try to follow the doctors advice- sometimes you think you are better and don't need the medication anymore- but the reason you think you are better is because the meds are doing their job- if you quit you will just get sick again.|`|CSV50KHKaa	Adderall is a powerful stimulant in fact it is almost equal to speed. You shouldn't have just stopped cold turkey because it can be very bad for your health. You should get back on your medication until you can talk to a doctor and come up with a consistent weaning plan for you. However, if you continue to discontinue your medication this way just stay hydrated monitor your vitals and if you start to feel really sick or you vitals get high go see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sorry, in the case of a stimulant you want to make sure your vitals don't go to low also.|`|0SAYzdFYaa	Do not start using adderall without doctor approval. This medication can be habit forming and must be used with caution . Use this medication only as directed.
kVEeV4jQaa	I have referred an Optician colleague for a "kink" in his vision.  Did a layer-by-layer scan of the retina and all tests that you can think of - the conclusion is possibly some swelling that's occured at some point and now that's a residue and isn't progressive.  Can't even tell if it'll disappear but it's something that might be there for sometime.<br>  <br>  I guess if it's something that they have ruled out any sinister causes and it is non-progressive, there's nothing much they could do but just monitor.|`|8436981597659ae2a44f3a6c63d4a5c7aa	Yes, I had something like that for several years in my right eye: <br>  a small residual from an episode of Central Serous Retinopathy.<br>  <br>  The original episode was visible to the ophthalmologist, but I could detect a minor effect long after the retina appeared "clear".<br>  <br>  Now, 10 years later, I can't really find it, with colour chart or Amsler screen.  But that level of recovery does not always occur, and a minor "kink" to straight lines is not uncommon.  If it doesn't vary, it is unlikely to benefit from any active treatment.|`|1lewFV8oaa	I suggest seeking a second opinion.

I went to the optometrist Thursday and he changed my prescription from a -2.00 to a -2.25, which shouldn't make that big of a difference in my vision.

What's funny is that I didn't have this problem until I put in the sample pair of contacts from the optometrist with the new prescription.

GXiCrhVYaa	I am sure the first answerer had good intentions, but I would not recommend lamictal with regard to weight loss. In most cases, it is considered a weight-neutral drug, although it can sometimes cause people to gain weight (but not as much as lithium or depakote). See the following link.<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&aq=h0&oq=lamictal%20weight%20g&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4DKUS_enUS302US302&q=lamictal+weight+gain" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=na...</a><br>  <br>  To be fair, lamictal occasionally causes weight loss. These opposite side effects are not unusual in the wild, wacky world of psych meds. <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&aq=h1&oq=lamictal%20weight%20&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4DKUS_enUS302US302&q=lamictal+weight+loss" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=na...</a><br>  <br>  I take lamictal as a back-up drug for major depression. Initially, I gained weight with lamictal. However, I had success with the alternative health remedy below.<br>  <br>  I CANNOT offer you any guarantees, but what helped me lose about 20 pounds in 3 months is an old, very inexpensive natural remedy that might sound very strange to you. Put 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar (ACV) and 1 tablespoon of honey in 8 ounces of warm water and drink this mixture. Do this two (or possibly three) times a day. It may take a while to get used to the taste. If you really don‘t like the taste, add extra honey. <br>  <br>  Use Bragg's ACV or other brands from a health food store, not stuff you buy in a regular grocery store. Also avoid the ACV capsules sold in grocery stories and drug stores. They are a waste of money. As I said, the ACV did work for me. For the 3 to 4 weeks, I don't think I lost an ounce, but maybe my metabolism was speeding up. In the second and third month, the weight started to come off. <br>  <br>  ACV has been used for hundreds of years for a variety of health issues, so this is not the latest fad diet. If you want more info, google “apple cider vinegar health benefits.” <br>  <br>  Finally, talk to your doctor about your weight gain issues on your current meds. In some cases, MDs can prescribe meds that may help you lose weight.<br>  <br>  Finally, I assume you are bipolar from your meds. From a support group I attend, I have heard that lamictal with abilify can be useful for bipolar disorder. Actually, this combo helped me with unipolar depression. It might be worth a try if your shrink agrees.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Have you tried Lamictal? ~~~ You can eat a LOT, yet still lose weight, and have a LITTLE of your favorites every day, to prevent cravings, by consuming mostly low energy foods, such as cucumber, tomato, capsicum/bell peppers, celery, onion slices pickled in vinegar, grated carrot, cabbage, spinach, asparagus, watercress, alfalfa, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, capers, a few olives, etc., with some lean protein, to delay the emptying of your stomach.

Lately i let myself go and gained about 50 lbs and was weighing about 190. I was in perfect shape around april/may last year. was festively plump by october.<br>  <br>  first thing is to start running or doing some cardio or something. <br>  im running on a treadmill. i started 2 weeks ago. running like 2-3 times the first week and 2-3 times last week. im sick this week and i cant breathe. im down a pants size or 2 already (from about 36 to 34). i work out about 30 minutes a day. usually about 15 minutes ona  treadmill at about 4.5 - 5 miles an hour running. if i have to i alternate between that and the exercise bike. the bike is my cooldown exercise while i get ready to run again. make it fun. get invested and dedicated into it and figure out what you like about it. get an ipod or mp3 player and listen to music, get a nice water bottle and some workout clothes that make you feel comfortable in your current physial condition (made a huge difference for me, made me less self conscious at the gym). now that i feel like im invested in it and i HAVE to go. <br>  <br>  i generally hated exercise BUT ive realized its helping with my depression (i dont take my meds). it gives me a physical outlet and it gives me time to think. plus it makes me feel better about myself. so thats a benefit i can actually relate to. <br>  <br>  ive cut my night eating which i used to do a lot. when i get a food craving i eat fruit. lately its been navel oranges. sometimes its grapefruit, tangerines and sometimes other fruit. if i MUST have something hearty at night, plain oatmeal with some spleda. or cereal with the skim extra milk (tastes like 2 percent but about as thick as water, not bad). <br>  <br>  eating a banana or something when you first wake up kicks your metabolism on, so thats good for people like me who dont eat breakfast cause no time. <br>  <br>  i cut soda out of my diet again. eating slightly healtheir choices. have a general knowledge of what youre eating and how much the calories are. it helps. also, im vegetarian which has its shortcomings (i wasnt vegetarian in 2006). its tempting for me to eat pastas and starches all the time but i have to be carefull of that. <br>  <br>  im seeing results already and its only been 2 weeks, its very very motivational seeing it happen. may not be a huge leap but its progress :-) and results dont lie.<br>  <br>  <br>  the future steps for me:<br>  the last thing im now starting that ive changed my habbits is im going to get on some suplements with the help of some friends that are already using them. im going to be on some whey protein for my protein, some creatine for when im running. lots of water and negative calorie foods as snacks (things that use more energy to burn than they contain, like celeary).  and the final supplements im getting on is ephedra. when taken safely it can be very beneficial, and its a bronchial dialator or something which should help me when im running. having the healthy habbits can make the difference between being some fat person who says something doesnt work versus being one of the guys on the commrecial that actually got better results from the methods. (slimfast, etc included).|`|WlZ66KnZaa	A way to lose about 2-3 pounds a week (more is unhealthy and will come back on)  is a low calorie diet.

Seriously...it works wonders. Take beef/chicken stock (depends on ur choice), boil it and add vegies like carrot, grren beens, cabbage etc to it and a bit salt and black pepper to make it taste good. You can add a bit venegar as well. Drink as much soup as you can (depending on your appetite) the whole day; the more you drink the more it will wash out your fats. At night you can have a treat of a boiled potato, bread, fruits etc (non-fattening things). You can use low fat milk also. You have to do it four days a week, then take a break of two days and take your routine diet (but dont over eat). After a two days' break repeat that four day diet the same way and two days' break again. Repeat it for as long as you want to. It is amazing; you should loose about 5-6 pounds even in first week. and its not difficult either as theres no limit to the amount of soup to drink so doesnt lead to weakness.<br>  TRY IT, it is easy and wonderful.

AA12266052	A transient ischemic attack is a "mini-stroke" caused by temporary disturbance of blood supply to an area of the brain, which results in a sudden, brief decrease in brain function.<br>  Knowing your risk factors and living healthfully are the best things you can do to prevent a TIA. Included in a healthy lifestyle are regular medical checkups. Also:<br>      * Don't smoke. Stopping smoking reduces your risk of a TIA or a stroke.<br>      * Limit cholesterol and fat. Cutting back on cholesterol and fat, especially saturated fat, in your diet may reduce buildup of plaques in your arteries.<br>      * Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods contain nutrients such as potassium, folate and antioxidants, which may protect against a TIA or a stroke.<br>      * Limit sodium. If you have high blood pressure, avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to food may reduce your blood pressure. Avoiding salt may not prevent hypertension, but excess sodium may increase blood pressure in people who are sensitive to sodium.<br>      * Exercise regularly. If you have high blood pressure, regular exercise is one of the few ways you can lower your blood pressure without drugs.<br>      * Limit alcohol intake. Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. The recommended limit is no more than one drink daily for women and two a day for men.<br>      * Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight contributes to other risk factors, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Losing weight with diet and exercise may lower your blood pressure and improve your cholesterol levels.<br>      * Don't use illicit drugs. Drugs such as cocaine are associated with an increased risk of a TIA or a stroke.<br>      * Control diabetes. You can manage diabetes and high blood pressure with diet, exercise, weight control and, when necessary, medication.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	I've a friend who had a mini-stroke and your whole side goes out to lunch. A finger going numb is different.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Strokes don't affect one finger, usually all or most of a hand, forearm or whole side of the body.   Most likely you have a pinched nerve in your elbow.  This manifests by numbness in the 4th and 5th fingers.   You may need surgery to free up the entrapped nerve, but sometimes it resolves by itself.   See an orthopedic doctor if it continues to be numb.|`|vQrR8H3Aaa	It's not a stroke I don't think. It could be anything from Carpal Tunnel to vitamin deficiency. Of course, a doctor could tell you for sure (at least give you a better guess than we can).
ajOlzSJ1aa	As above, go and see your GP/CPN. As this medication is supposed to treat panic/depressive disorders, I would think an increase in dosage would have the opposite effect. Yo may just be entering into an episode of your illness, and this is a coincidence, or, you may be one of the people who are hypersensitive to this medication.|`|faeb1306f0340a76195dea4e4298a6b5aa	Speak to your GP.|`|rumq927Xaa	Absolutely not, if you are over 18 and taking it for depressive disorder you should be starting on 10mg. <br>  <br>  It takes 2-4 weeks to proper effect. It definitely should not make you feel more depressed.<br>  <br>  Go to your GP with these symptoms it may be appropriate to try a different SSRI.

Odds are, you have tonsillitis or something of the nature. It's perfectly normal and not at all dangerous. If you gargle salt water, that will help rid your throat of the bacteria. I would also suggest taking Tylenol for the pain and fever.|`|E7smxUOZaa	Yer it could be, go see your doctor|`|AA11230809	its bacteria. i get it a lot too. gargle on salt water.|`|JX9gAD7oaa	It might be a tonsil stone which is stuck in the crypts of your tonsils.  They are absolutely foul smelling - gargle with salt water or try to dislodge it, it should come out easily.  I get them now and then, and I use a cotton bud, and gently press the area around the tonsil stone, until it pops out (I know it sounds gross!!).
b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	All doctors document the treatment of the patient. It is ultimately the patient's responsibility to insure they have copies of their records. Some doctors don't charge but most do and there is a maximum amount that can be charged. You should always ask for copies of test results and keep the information organized in one safe place..
KOYC3XkJaa	The fastest way to heal something is to create an optimal healing environment for it. Keep it clean, keep using the ointment, and keep it bandaged. Covered wounds heal, on average, 3 days faster than uncovered ones. And I agree with the previous answer: use the splint during the day as well. The more your knuckle is bending, the more stress it will put on the cut, and the longer it will take to heal.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	wear the splint especially during the day when you are apt to move it and bend it. It may be an inconvenience for a few days. keep doing what you are doing, but wear the splint during the day too.

I8MUpN04aa	yes, i think it happens to all of us. we all forget phone numbers, but we can write them down so we can look them up. the problem with PIN numbers is that you aren't supposed to write them down, and that's why they are so easy to forget- we cant check on them. it is so common that very often you can ask them to send you your PIN number- that's why they ask a question when you apply- that way, you answer the question and they tell you what the PIN is again. your not loosing your mind, your just like the rest of us.|`|Gzk1TQFAaa	You're not losing it, it happens to everyone once in a while.

856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Absolutely!  I have it right now, and I have no tonsils.  In fact in the 15 years since I had my tonsils removed, I have probably had it 15 times..lol.  Your tonsils don't protect you from that virus.  Go to the doc and get your throat swabbed...easy as that.  If it is strep, you need an antibiotic.|`|1BaeFYnEaa	The tonsils are areas of lymphoid tissue on either side of the throat. An infection of the tonsils is called tonsillitis. Most commonly, the term "tonsils" refers to the palatine tonsils that can be seen in the back of the throat.<br>  <br>  Like other organs of the lymphatic system, the tonsils act as part of the immune system to help protect against infection. In particular, they are believed to be involved in helping fight off pharyngeal and upper respiratory tract infections.<br>  <br>  Having them removed thus makes you more vulnerable to pharyngeal and upper tract infections, so that means "strep throat" is easier to get. You should protect your throat more from cold and have any related problem checked immediately for treatment, as to avoid complications. Also, NEVER take antibiotics by yourself, and ALWAYS respect the prescription given by your doctor. If you don't, your infections will become resistant and then antibiotics will become useless. <br>  Take care!
JwecpnBVaa	Yea, I have actually lost 10 in two days.  All I did way lay around and drank a huge boat load of Sprite Zero, whenever I was hungry I ate a few saltine crackers.  Not healthy and I was about to pass out, but if you added a few veggies and fruits every once in a while and also had water or tea instead you would feel a lot better than I did.  <br>  <br>  Stick with about 500 or less calories a day from water based foods.<br>  <br>  Exercise at least 30 minutes, even if its just walking.  Also do a few toning exercises.<br>  <br>  Try the laxatives that you insert in (gross I know, but they're effective).  Use one every night, they're more effective if you hold them in as long as you can and then.... yea.  This will help clean build up out of you and keep things moving.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh and be sure to get enough sleep to keep from getting dark circles, try for 10 hours.  The longer you sleep the less time you have to be distracted and tempted by food!|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Yes it's possible. There were many weeks when I was on Weight Watchers that I weighed in at losing 2.8 pounds a week. As long as you eat 3 normal balanced meals a day, there's no reason why it shouldn't work.|`|jF94WiDnaa	Perhaps it is possible but not wise at all as far as your health is concerned.|`|VoQN7ADvaa	I'm not going to say that I condone this, but you asked for help so I'm going to give it.<br>  <br>  Check out the Master Cleanse, aka the Lemonade diet. You can lose 2-4lbs per day on it, but it's not pleasant.<br>  <br>  It involves a 'lemonade' the recipe for which you can find on line, drinking a glass of water with sea salt everyday and drinking an herbal laxative tea every night.<br>  <br>  THIS IS ONLY FOR SHORT TERM RESULTS.<br>  <br>  In addition, it's very difficult to keep this weight off.|`|cku5S9WLaa	Hmmm... you're goiing to reeeealy struggle with that one because I am losing just 1 pounds a week.

vygYFdsSaa	I went on it strictly for pregnancy prevention reasons I never had bad acne. Of course I didn't get depressed. It works very well thats probably why its one of the most-prescribed brands out there. It regulated my cycle perfectly got my period like clockwork; only problem is if you take it even like half a day late you'll get a withdrawal bleed (like a one or maybee two day period very unpleasant).|`|b9340e25c5c91b1731a01132aab4d92daa	I was on it for years.

To  make your boos big you have to do  breast massage also.|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	No. Sorry.|`|12ALGqtdaa	Okay I need to make a few points here... <br>  <br>  First and foremost the word "boob" means someone who is unintelligent and no woman has unintelligent or stupid breasts, so I hope you have more respect for yourself than to refer to your breasts in that manner... <br>  <br>  Secondly if you want your breasts to grow more quickly you have several options... The first would be herbs such as: Fennel, Wild Yam, Saw Palmetto, and Fenugreek. The second is to build up the breast muscles: place your hands together, then separate your hands until only your fingertips touch then push your fingertips together. That should work well for the muscle...<br>  <br>  Overall, eating healthfully is wonderful and should be done all the time, not just because you want larger breasts, too it will help your body develop to its optimum... And as my own personal aside I really recommend that you eat organics, they are so much better for you and the earth.|`|87e0ded175c7b1e6686806afc8bb6b44aa	No

Iq8DwIGwaa	Have you talked to a counselor?  You've just had a major set of changes in your life.  It sounds like you're overwhelmed.  If this depression lasts (or has lasted) for several weeks, you should probably at least discuss it with your regular doctor.  (Seriously!)<br>  <br>  With regard to the binge eating:  The endorphins you're getting when you eat are likely the reason you keep doing it.  They make you feel better temporarily, but make you feel far worse in the end.  Unfortunately, the only "cure" for this problem is determination.  Find ways to distract yourself.  A vigorous workout will give you a longer lasting endorphin rush than junk food.  Plus you'll feel good knowing you made the right choice.|`|Av2GR6Wbaa	Learning how to play the guitar is a great thing to do, however finding somewhere decent to learn it is difficult as reading mags and tabs will only go so far.

Try these:<br>  <br>  Belly Rolls<br>  Works: vertical ab muscles<br>  What to do: Sit with your legs bent, feet flat on the floor and arms straight in front of you. Exhale and roll back until your lower back touches the ground -- stop. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. Now exhale and roll back until your shoulder blades touch the ground -- stop. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times.<br>  <br>  Tummy Curls<br>  Works: horizontal ab muscles<br>  What to do: Lie on your back and bend your knees at an (almost) 90-degree angle with the floor, raising your feet slightly higher than your knees. Exhale, lift your butt and roll back to your shoulder blades. Inhale and roll to your tailbone -- stop (don't let your butt touch the ground). Repeat 20 times.<br>  <br>  Cross Crunches<br>  Works: waist<br>  What to do: Grab a liter bottle of water and lie on your back with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle with the floor. Cradle your left hand behind your head. Now hold the water bottle in your right hand, lift your head and shoulders off the ground and reach across your body, so the bottle is outside your left knee. "Pulse" 20 times. Switch sides and repeat.<br>  <br>  Tailbone Lifts<br>  Works: lower ab muscles<br>  What to do: Lie on your back, arms stretched straight over your head and legs fully extended and crossed in the air. Exhale and lift your tailbone, then slowly lower as you inhale (don't just drop -- resist on the way down). Repeat 30 times.<br>  <br>  Inverted Crunches<br>  WORKS: lower back<br>  WHAT TO DO: Lie on your stomach, arms in front of you as if flying. Exhale and lift just your right arm and left leg as high as you can. Inhale and lower. Then switch, lifting your left arm and right leg. Alternate, doing 20 lifts on each side. Finally, lift both arms and legs 20 times.<br>  <br>  Its kind of a long list but yeah. If you stay on this you should lose weight and maybe get a flat stomach :)<br>  <br>  the running helped the best for me.|`|xRQAsGRAaa	I know you're 14, so this diet/exercise plan might be tough for you, but if you stick to it, it should work. I use it for most of my female customers that want to lose weight.<br>  <br>  I do not know your weight right now, or your goal weight, so I will just give you the chart that I use as a general rule for my female customers. <br>  <br>  You want to try to eat 4-6 small meals a day. I know this sounds weird, but let me explain. When you eat only 3 larger meals a day, you have a huge gap between your meals. Your body resorts to storing the unused calories as fat to get you to your next meal. If you eat 4-6 meals a day, your body learns(and adjusts), and knows another meal is coming up right away, so it doesn't need to store the food as fat, it just uses what it needs, and passes the rest right through you, storing MUCH less as fat.<br>  <br>  Here's a rough chart I use for the women who come to me. It's very accurate, although every person's body is different. (by the way, the elliptical is ok as a replacement for running if you have bad knees)<br>  <br>  If you're over 200 pounds: eat 1800 calories a day, in 4-6 meals. <br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  If you're between 160 and 200: eat 1600 calories a day, in 4-6 meals.<br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  If you're 130-160: eat 1500 calories a day, in 4-6 meals<br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  100-130 pounds: Eat 1300 calories a day in 4-6 meals<br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  Under 100 pounds: eat 1200 calories a day in 4-6 meals<br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  Every time you get bumped down to a lower weight class, decrease the calories according to this chart. Since I'm not gonna be there with you, you may need to adjust it slightly to suit your needs. Also remember that the first few pounds are very easy, then you usually hit a wall for about a week, then you'll start losing weight again. Don't be intimidated if you lose 5 pounds the first week, then only 2 pounds the second week. <br>  <br>  Once you hit your target weight, increase your calorie intake by about 200 calories. If you're still losing weight, increase it more, as needed to maintain your weight(assuming you continue to work out).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. If you have any more questions, or want to give me more details(age, weight, height, body type) so I can help you more, and give you a general meal plan, click my profile and send me an email.

Better to be losing it slowly and steady .|`|ZDjafGVkaa	Firstly well done my sister is in the same situation as you. But what you have to remember is if you are doing exercise muscle weighs three times heavier than fat so at the same time as losing loads of fat you are gaining small bits of muscle that are making you lose it slower. The best way to measure is the old fashion way of how you feel and look and also measure your waist arms etc. to see how many inches you are losing. Also what everybody falls into the trap of is thinking it will happen overnight. just stick at it you are actually keeping up a very good fat burning pace. <br>  <br>  Drink loads of water because being sightly dehydrated slows down your metabolism so by always staying hydrated you keep your metabolism high. Also make small changes like when you walk to the shop (exmaple), take it at more of a brisk walk rather than a stroll these small changes make a massive difference.<br>  <br>  Stick at it and don't lose faith. WELL DONE!|`|pzvzzhBmaa	Given your height you are about 2 stone overweight. This isn't too much and as a relatively fit, young individual you should have very little point shifting it.<br>  <br>  You are absolutely right that in order to lose weight you do need to eat and drink. Starving yourself just puts your body into storage mode and you'll never shift anything. Water is vital in helping your body operate at maximal performance.<br>  <br>  1-2lbs a week is the ideal amount to lose each week. So just keep up what you're doing.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is that the body can change weight through out the day (by anything up to 6 lbs). Weigh yourself once a week and at the same time. I do this Sunday morning, straight after waking and before breakfast.|`|IjxyGwubaa	One of the main things about losing weight is to make sure you have good nutritious food. If you do not feed your body it goes into starvation mode as it doesn't know where the next meal is coming from. There are some things you can do if you wish to lose those extra inches and get into better shape. Losing weight can sometimes be a matter of just changing your normal eating habits to a healthier diet combined with better nutrition.<br>  <br>  For instance your healthy way of eating becomes your healthy lifestyle.<br>  <br>  A balanced diet is essential to provide your body with all the nutrients to make it function properly. Sometimes according to national statistics we make the wrong decisions and find making healthy choices a challenge.<br>  <br>  Here are just a few key points to optimise your health.<br>  a) you need a balanced diet with colourful fruits and vegetables, lean protein, good carbohydrates and the right amount of good fats.<br>  b) vitamins, minerals and fibre to provide the nitrition missing from your diet that your body needs for good health.<br>  c) regular exercise to condition your heart, relieve stress and to make it easier to maintain a healthy body weight.<br>  d) lastly, try to drink 6-8 glasses of water a day, excluding tea and coffee.<br>  <br>  There are 2 options that may be of interest to you,<br>  <br>  I'm fairly slim but like you there was unwanted flesh around my middle, I weighed just under 11 stone.

rzBxRw7Haa	Hi there,<br>  If it is throbbing it sounds like muscle spasm. You have a lot of muscles in your upper back and neck. The trapezius muscles are shaped a bit like a kite, they start at the top of the neck, extend to the left and right to form the shoulders then come in again between your shoulder blades and attach to the spine there. Sorry difficult to describe.<br>  <br>  Any way, this muscle takes a lot of hammer not only from being involved with lifting weights but also from stress and tension that affects it in the neck and shoulders. If you press your shoulders firmly do the muscles feel bruised, if so I would suspect it is your trapezius muscles causing the problem. Get someone to massage your shoulders for you.<br>  <br>  You don't have to lift heavy weights to get muscle spasms, just carrying a tray and turning can trigger things off.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't settle in a couple of days seek the advice of a doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|FaTW91XHaa	I'm a hairdresser and have the same problem when i work and stand..

7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	Some cancers can have a genetic link.<br>  <br>  Breast cancer is one of them.<br>  <br>  If your mother's cancer was also breast cancer, then it is possible.<br>  <br>  However, only about 10% of cases of breast cancer are genetically linked and you don't mention the age of your Nan when she was diagnosed.  Age is the biggest risk factor.<br>  <br>  Even if your family carries the gene that doesn't mean you will get it, just that you may have a bigger risk.<br>  <br>  My family has been tested after my sister was the 3rd generation to develop breast cancer.  We all carry the gene.  Of 2 brothers and 4 sisters she is still the only one to have a genetically linked cancer, although 3 others have had cancer, including me having non genetically linked breast cancer.|`|LIY8QrgMaa	Unfortunatly cancer often is hereditary, so yes, you probably are at risk. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is make sure you have regualr breast-screenings to catch it early if it develops.|`|aCDWwsisaa	Cancer "runs" in almost everybodies' families...we all have about a 1 in 4 chance of getting it at some point.  A family history of one kind of cancer seems to predispose other family members to that kind of cancer in many cases...|`|FicyC2TXaa	Hereditary cancer is rare - fewer than10% of all cancer cases are hereditary.<br>  <br>  And only 5- 10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary and due to a rare faulty gene.<br>  <br>  You don't say whether it was breast cancer that your mother had. If it wasn't, there's nothing in what you've told us here to suggest hereditary cancer.<br>  <br>  A sign that cancer MAY run in a family is when several members of the same side of that family have had the SAME type of cancer - eg all had breast cancer, or all had colon cancer - especially if some developed it at a younger than usual age.<br>  <br>  Isolated cases of any type of cancer in a family, or a number of members having had different types of cancer, isn't hereditary. You don't inherit a general tendency to get cancer.<br>  <br>  If your mother's cancer was breast cancer then there is a possibility of a heredity factor, assuming that your nan was her mother. But with one in nine women getting breast cancer, it isn't unusual for two or more women in the same family to have had non-hereditary breast cancer.<br>  <br>  If breast cancer was hereditary in your family and your mother carried one of the rare faulty genes, it would not mean you would necessarily have inherited the gene - that's a 50% chance - and if you did inherit it it wouldn't mean you would definitely get breast cancer.<br>  <br>  You ddidn't mention how old your nan was - cancer, including breast cancer, that is diagnosed after the age of 50 is far less likely to be hereditary.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|F9Ll7oLJaa	do kapalbhati pranayam for 10 minutes|`|L1Y94qYZaa	There are a few ways you can do it<br>  <br>  1: get sick. this way you can loose between 5-10 kgs in just a week<br>  2: go to the gym and work on very light weights. this will help tone your body a bit.<br>  3: watch what you eat. the best option to go for, stop eating mackers, KFC, that sort of stuff.|`|dsivvZm4aa	YOU CAN LOOSE  2 KGS IN TWO WEEKS  BY EATING kellogs'special K  its really good my mother is eating that and she looses 3kgs|`|TU6hZ2Beaa	1) Eat only vegetable<br>  2) Drink a lot water<br>  3) Go to gym everyday|`|zppFwoRaaa	Don't eat

Smoking is a risk factor for a number of cancers, though by no means all cancers. Excessive sun exposure is linked to skin cancers - so that's another thing to avoid.<br>  <br>  But on the whole there isn't anything you can do. While a healthy diet and exercise are always important, they won't prevent cancer.  It's sometimes less scary for people who haven't had cancer to 'blame the victims' - they convince themselves that cancer is caused by lifestyle choices like bad diet, lack of exercise, stress etc. Less scary than accepting that cancer is a largely random disease that can strike any of us at any time.<br>  <br>  Nobody knows why, of two people with the same risk factors (or lack of them), one will get cancer and the other won't.<br>  <br>  I thought - when I thought about it at all - that my healthy, largely organic vegan diet, coupled with the facts that I've never smoked and I exercised regularly, would probably protect me from cancer. But I got cancer anyway.|`|oOly8Wj2aa	Avoid all carcinogenic chemicals: this is a long, long list, which includes alcohol, asbestos, tobacco smoke.<br>  <br>  Avoid all sources of ionizing radiation, such as radon gas (naturally-occuring), sunlight, and possibly - depending on whom you believe - mobile phones, microwaves, wireless networks, and so on.<br>  <br>  Do not catch any cancer-linked diseases, such as HPV, hepatitis, or HIV. To be absolutely sure of not catching these, you should avoid sexual intercourse or blood transfusions.<br>  <br>  Hope that you haven't inherited a genetic predisposition to cancer from your ancestors. Hard luck, there's nothing you can do about this one until we get effective gene therapy.<br>  <br>  Put simply: all you can do is *reduce* your risk of cancer. There is no way to prevent yourself from getting cancer, because causes of cancer include things that you probably wouldn't want to do without (like sunlight).|`|yvQpQjv1aa	not smoking is a great start. ;) i would just say try and be as healthy as you can. eat all your veges, exercise, don't stress and be happy. enjoy your life. have regular check ups with your doctor. and if you are worried about something regarding your health, see the doc right away.|`|E87JwnACaa	eat healthy, exercise, stay fit.<br>  <br>  other than that, don't breathe the air (polluted), drink the water (polluted and treated with chemicals) or eat anything.|`|Y42J2P2Naa	Eat healthy foods. <br>  Exercise Frequently.<br>  Get monthly check-ups. <br>  Don't stress out too much.<br>  Get enough sleep.<br>  Don't ever get addicted to smoking, drugs, alcohol.

5FuRcRdKaa	You need to go to the doctor. It does sound a bit like appendicitis. <br>  <br>  Look at the symptoms <br>  <br>  Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a finger-like glandular piece of tissue that connects to the beginning of the large intestine, usually at the lower right side of the abdomen. In older children, the classic symptoms of appendicitis are abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Abdominal pain usually begins in the center of the abdomen, around the area of the navel ("belly button"). Later, the pain may move downward and to the right - to an area called McBurney's point, roughly corresponding to the location of the appendix in the lower right portion of the abdomen.<br>  <br>  After his abdominal pain begins, a child with appendicitis usually develops a slight fever, loses his appetite, feels nauseous, and may vomit. The fact that abdominal pain begins before nausea and vomiting, rather than after, is one clue to suspect appendicitis rather than an intestinal infection.<br>  <br>  Other symptoms that may be seen in older children with appendicitis include: diarrhea (usually small stools with mucus); urinary tract symptoms (urinating very frequently and/or an uncomfortably strong urge to urinate); constipation; and, sometimes, respiratory symptoms.|`|AA11722428	unless you feel like you've been stabbed, you probably have soreness from the excercising, or possibly a hernia.  <br>  <br>  also, you might want to ask your doctor about hypochondria treatment, there are medications and treatments for it, and it's as real as any other psychological condition, even if the less educated tell you otherwise|`|VS9ewDRkaa	If it only happens when you exercise, it isn't appendicitis. <br>  <br>  It normally starts off with pain in the middle of the stomach and then it spreads to the right lower side of it.

Those stages are:<br>  <br>  Denial: The initial stage: "It can't be happening." <br>  Anger: "Why ME? It's not fair?!" (either referring to God, oneself, or anybody perceived, rightly or wrongly, as "responsible") <br>  Bargaining: "Just let me live to see my son graduate." <br>  Depression: "I'm so sad, why bother with anything?" <br>  Acceptance: "It's going to be alright.<br>  Growth: Grief is a chance for personal growth. For many people, it may eventually lead to renewed energy to invest in new activities and new relationships. Some people seek meaning in their loss and get involved in causes or projects that help others. Some people find a new compassion in themselves as a result of the pain they have suffered. They may become more sensitive to others, thus enabling richer relationships. Others find new strength and independence they never knew they had. After the loss, they find new emotional resources that had not been apparent before. Kübler-Ross originally applied these stages to any form of catastrophic personal loss (job, income, freedom). This also includes the death of a loved one and divorce.<br>  <br>   Kübler-Ross also claimed these steps do not necessarily come in order, nor are they all experienced by all patients, though she stated a person will always experience at least two.See www.amazon.com/ for books on the various stages. After a while, consider making a photoalbum/scrapbook and/or a shrine, in remembrance, and set aside; say; one day every month, perhaps on a significant date, (for example; the 17th, or the second thursday) on which to reflect. Many religious organisations offer counselling, or you may feel more comfortable with a therapist, to express your thoughts, and feelings. Journalling may help in this. Celebrate that life; be thankful for the experience, and remember the good times. If there is depression: visit your doctor, and see depression treatments, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a>  in section 2. ; view page R first.

Like after 1 hour of exercising have a yogurt or something, you may think that it will not help you exercise but after a while when you are back into the routine you will not have to use the treat anymore.<br>  And last, this one may sound really mean but it works just as well. <br>  Imagine yourself in 20 years if you stop exercising.<br>  So go out there.<br>  Have fun.<br>  and be fit!|`|bXmRWbEdaa	I force myself to do five minutes of exercise when I am not in the mood to exercise.

Try these:<br>  <br>  Belly Rolls<br>  Works: vertical ab muscles<br>  What to do: Sit with your legs bent, feet flat on the floor and arms straight in front of you. Exhale and roll back until your lower back touches the ground -- stop. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. Now exhale and roll back until your shoulder blades touch the ground -- stop. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times.<br>  <br>  Tummy Curls<br>  Works: horizontal ab muscles<br>  What to do: Lie on your back and bend your knees at an (almost) 90-degree angle with the floor, raising your feet slightly higher than your knees. Exhale, lift your butt and roll back to your shoulder blades. Inhale and roll to your tailbone -- stop (don't let your butt touch the ground). Repeat 20 times.<br>  <br>  Cross Crunches<br>  Works: waist<br>  What to do: Grab a liter bottle of water and lie on your back with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle with the floor. Cradle your left hand behind your head. Now hold the water bottle in your right hand, lift your head and shoulders off the ground and reach across your body, so the bottle is outside your left knee. "Pulse" 20 times. Switch sides and repeat.<br>  <br>  Tailbone Lifts<br>  Works: lower ab muscles<br>  What to do: Lie on your back, arms stretched straight over your head and legs fully extended and crossed in the air. Exhale and lift your tailbone, then slowly lower as you inhale (don't just drop -- resist on the way down). Repeat 30 times.<br>  <br>  Inverted Crunches<br>  WORKS: lower back<br>  WHAT TO DO: Lie on your stomach, arms in front of you as if flying. Exhale and lift just your right arm and left leg as high as you can. Inhale and lower. Then switch, lifting your left arm and right leg. Alternate, doing 20 lifts on each side.

If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women.

Squirting is a build up of fluids (not urine) from the paraurethral ducts through and around the urethra during or before orgasm. The exact source and nature of the fluid continues to be the topic of debate among medical professionals. To squirt by practice, you have to orgasm a few times and it has to be a certain method, so that it is a whole body orgasm, usually the orgasms are brought on my g-spot stimulation for squirting to occur. Here is a video (sorry its on redtube) about how to do it, <a href="http://www.redtube.com/15878" rel="nofollow">http://www.redtube.com/15878</a>|`|b9340e25c5c91b1731a01132aab4d92daa	Orgasm doesn't equal "squirt".

PDcnXgE6aa	Just study this article very informative.....<br>  <br>  To understand the mechanisms of female ejaculation you must first have a clear picture in your head of what men and women have in common and what it takes for the common male to ejaculate. When we are conceived we all start out undifferentiated as to sex. Therefore, it is only common sense that we have the same parts. Male testicles descend, my conclusion is they are the organs that would have been ovaries without the Y chromosome. The clitoral hood (prepuce) becomes foreskin of the penis. The labia majora becomes the scrotum, while the labia minora is the actual skin that envelopes the urethra and erectile tissue and becomes the outside skin of the penis.<br>  <br>  It seems very simple when spelled out in this manner but science makes no such correlation. Now to the actual fluids: Male ejaculate is a combination of things, prostate fluid, produced in the prostate gland, as well as sperm produced in the testis. This is combined prior to ejaculation. For women there is no sperm, nor is there any need for the fluid to be thick and goopy protecting the sperm within. In women the fluid is exclusively produced by the female prostate (or para-urethral sponge) it is equivalent to sweat, produced by the lymphatic systems of the body, not the urinary system. Many will claim that it is urine, but test on the fluid show there is little comparison. The fluid is much more like that of the male prostate gland. Containing the same prostate specific antigens as well as a very high concentration of sugars, which neither are present in urine.<br>  <br>  Now most all of us realize that there is little feeling on almost 3/4 of the male penis. The entire head of the penis is super sensitive, equal to the clitoris. This provides a great ability to create sexual stimulation there for both men and women. However, very few men will ejaculate by only giving attention to the head of his penis, though it is not impossible. They will have a sexual climax (peak of the hill), but rarely fully ejaculate (top of the mountain). This is what I believe most non-vaginal orgasms are to women. There is a climax, but only to a small degree of what could be. The top and sides of the penis have little sensation. The real area needing attention is the base of the penis where the urethra is clearly visible. The entire shaft of the penis needs consistent pressure and stimulation in order to cause full ejaculation. If you were to imagine an erect penis within an oversized cylinder of equal length and you only had 2 or 3 fingers to access this area around the urethra what would you need to do to cause stimulation and ejaculation. This is how you need to picture, in your head, what is necessary for a woman to ejaculate.<br>  <br>  There is a distinctive area just inside the vagina on the upper wall running from the very end of the urethra and just behind the clitoris that is the "E-spot, the ejaculation spot". This area runs on both sides and behind the woman's urethra on the abdomen side. It varies in length and diameter from person to person, just as the penis comes in all shapes and sizes. There has been a widespread idea that a "come here" motion with the fingers will bring an ejaculation orgasm for a woman. This is only partly true. The real situation is that you need to have the smooth area between the first two segments of your finger apply pressure while sliding on this area. It is much more like a Disc Jockey when they slide a record back and forth. Now what happened to the erectile tissue, ah its in there! If you are using the correct motion and pressure you will feel very specific changes to the interior of the vaginal canal.<br>  <br>  Upon entry you will feel an area (mound) of ribbed tissue bulging from the top of the vaginal canal, it feels sort of like our throat. After a small amount of time in an excited state there will be changes. First there will be a complete smoothness and opening up of the entire inside of the vagina. Then there will be a tremendous build up of pressure. It will become difficult to keep your fingers inside, but you must. This is the point that 90% of all women stop you or quickly change positions to stop the feeling of having to pee. The only way past this part is trust. As I trusted my friend knew more than I did at age 11, you must trust your partner. There is no way past it without trust and being comfortable enough with your partner. You are both choosing to venture into unknown areas of sexual relations. If you are not comfortable enough with each other there is no way to achieve ejaculation. Men unlike women don't care, they just want to come. For women sexual relations are so emotional that there must be comfort and relaxation in order for ejaculation to occur.<br>  <br>  It is the job of the partner giving to assure her (the receiver) that it is OK to let it go. When you are getting the feeling that you are being pushed out from the tension of the vagina you are very close and your job is to let|`|Ek1x32WHaa	Go ask your dad!|`|HxXduL1maa	The Gr?fenberg spot, or G-spot, is a female erogenous zone which when stimulated can lead to high levels of sexual arousal and powerful orgasms<br>  <br>  The G-spot is usually said to be located about one to three inches in on the anterior wall of the vagina. Some women report that stimulation of parts of the posterior wall of the urethra and the anterior wall of the Anus at about the same depth creates a similar sensation.<br>  <br>  Two primary methods have been used to define and locate the G-spot as a sensitive area in the vagina: <br>  ? the first is based on self-reported levels of arousal during stimulation; <br>  ? the second based on the idea that stimulation of the G-spot leads to female ejaculation. <br>  In a published case study of one woman, it was reported that stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall made the area grow by fifty percent and that self-reported levels of arousal/orgasm were “deeper” when the G-spot was stimulated. Another study examined eleven women by palpating the entire vagina in a clockwise fashion, and reported a specific response to stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall in four of the women.<br>   <br>  The G-Spot is an area on the front wall of your vagina that when stimulated, can cause women to orgasm and sometimes ejaculate. For some women, stimulating the G-Spot creates a more intense orgasm than clitorial stimulation. Not all women can have an orgasm through G-Spot stimulation. Here's more about how to find your G-Spot and Female Ejaculation<br>  How can you tell if you ejaculate? You might notice a gush of wetness right before orgasm. Or you might experience a nice big spray of come at orgasm. Potentially, all women can ejaculate and if you'd like, you can learn how. <br>  You can explore your urethral sponge (or G-spot) with a firm, curved dildo or your fingers. Insert your fingers or dildo, aiming for the front wall of the vagina. Stroke this area with a "come hither" motion. If you use your fingers, you'll feel the difference in texture between this area, which is rough, and the rest of the vaginal walls, which are smooth. Some women like to stimulate the opening of the vagina just below the urethra. You can also press down on your pelvis with your free hand, applying pressure just above the pubic bone. Stimulate your G-spot until you feel intensely turned on and like you're about to pee. As you approach orgasm, push out, as if urinating. The stream you produce is ejaculate.|`|RvpWs34Saa	A womans g-spot is a hard pea sized shape found on the front vaginal wall. It has a rough texture. To locate it, the woman lies down on her back, legs spread and bent and her partner inserts a finger, normally middle index finger into her vagina, curls the finger towards the front of the vagina,( as you would when you are calling someone)<br>  Make sure she is aroused, maybe stimulate her clitoris and done correctly, esp when she is relaxed, will produce an intense orgasm|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	The G-Spot is described as "an area approximately the size of a dime, located about two-thirds the length of your middle finger inside the vagina entrance,on the tummy side of the vaginal wall"<br>  The location of the G-Spot is different for every woman. It is a spot of increased pleasure and usually allows women to reach climax.<br>  How to find it? From <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2095416_find-wom..." rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2095416_find-wom...</a><br>  <br>  Step1<br>  Wash your hands thoroughly and be sure that your fingernails are clean and trimmed. The fingers are very involved in finding a woman's g spot, so it's very important that they are clean to avoid spreading infection or bacteria. Long fingernails could scratch or cut the inner parts of the vagina, so trim them as short as possible.<br>  Step2<br>  Lie flat on the bed with your back down. Pull your knees up towards your chest and rest in the position you find most comfortable. You may want to put a pillow beneath your lower back or behind your neck in order to cushion these areas and help maintain the best position.<br>  Step3<br>  Ask your partner to lie down between your legs. He might want to kneel next to the bed or rest on his stomach with his head close to your vagina, depending on his personal preference and comfort level. Be sure that your partner is as comfortable as you are, as he will be required to do the majority of the work in this situation.<br>  Step4<br>  Tell your partner to insert two fingers, held close together, about 2 to 3 inches into your vagina. Explain that he is looking for a small bump that is usually about 1 inch in diameter. Try to guide him by telling him when you feel him touch it, as it's generally a very strong sensation.<br>  Step5<br>  Have your partner use a firm amount of pressure when looking for your g spot. Though it's important to be cautious, some women need to feel a strong touch in order to be sure that their g spots have been located. The vagina is a very sensitive part of the body, so try to help your partner find the balance between being gentle and forceful.<br>  <br>  There are other tips on that site. However, a lot of women have explored their own bodies and usually can guide you to their G-Spot, and tell you how they like it stimulated.

Depending on your age, this tenderness may also be a result of breast growth, or simple hormonal fluctuations that are commonplace during puberty.<br>  <br>  I have heard from many girls that nausea and stomachaches are very common during their period.  As I said, every woman/girl is different and will have varying symptoms.  Just because someone else lacks a symptom of yours, doesn't mean you're abnormal.<br>  <br>  Some tips for dealing with your PMS issues:  Try taking some acetaminophen or ibuprofen.  This can aid the breast tenderness and also relieve some cramping.  Because you said you're experiencing some stomach issues, I recommend you eat something with this medication so it does not upset your stomach.
FLAtdWrmaa	No.  See a doctor -- if necessary, get a referral for tests and a specialist to administer and interpret the test results.  Do it now.<br>  <br>  Some tinnitus is permanent, but many kinds are not.  You may just have ear-wax build-up pressing the wrong places inside your ear -- in which case, one visit and the problem's solved (the doctor flushes the build-up out with warm water).  You may have damage from something that's affected your ear (loud music/a nearby explosion/a past illness that went into your ears/etc), and the damage may be permanent.  Only you know your history;  only a doctor can determine the cause and the treatment(s).<br>  <br>  Leave this un-treated, and there is every possibility that a temporary condition will become permanent, and/or that a low-level tinnitus becomes much worse/louder, and seriously interferes with your hearing.<br>  <br>  Do not wait!!!|`|abx5VNsOaa	Sounds like you may  have industrial disease.That means you have had prolonged exposure to loud noises and the cilia in the ear canal have flattened against the ear drum.The hair(cilia) usually function at an angle to help carry sound waves.Exposure to noise for a long time will flatten these out and hearing is affected.<br>  It is not normal to hear ringing (tinnnitus) when it is quiet,go have an auditory examination by an ear,nose and throat specialist.|`|RvuKTT0Jaa	Ringing in the ear is a symptom associated with many forms of hearing loss. The sounds associated with ringing in the ear may be high or low pitched and vary in the type of sound produced. Ringing in the ear may come and go, or you may be aware of a continuous sound. <br>  <br>  If you believe you have ringing in the ear, you should contact your doctor. Your doctor will run tests to determine what is causing your ringing in the ear. Ask your doctor to check to see if it is related to blood pressure, kidney function, diet, or allergies, or medicine you are taking.<br>  <br>  Your doctor may refer you to an otolaryngologist or an audiologist. An otolaryngologist is an ear, nose, and throat specialist. An audiologist will measure your hearing and determine if you need a hearing aid. <br>  <br>  Ringing in the ear is also called tinnitus. People with severe cases of ringing in the ear may find it difficult to hear, work, or even sleep.<br>  <br>  The most common symptoms of ringing in the ear are noises, such as humming, clicking, buzzing, whistling, chirping, or roaring. One or both ears may be affected. The symptom(s) may be short or long in duration. It may be constant or intermitten<br>  <br>  Most cases of ringing in the ear are caused by damage to the microscopic endings of the hearing nerve in the inner ear. <br>  <br>  Some of the most common causes of nerve damage to the endings of the hearing nerve in the inner ear are:<br>  <br>  Hearing loss <br>  Too much exposure to loud noise <br>  Side effects of medication <br>  Allergies <br>  Advanced age <br>  Low thyroid levels <br>  Neurological disorders <br>  Brain or ear tumors <br>  Problems in the heart and blood vessels, jaws, and neck <br>  High blood pressure <br>  Head trauma <br>  Depression <br>  Stress <br>  Treatments for ringing in the Ear<br>  <br>  Some common treatments are: hearing aids, maskers (small electronic devices that use sound to make ringing in the ear less noticeable), medication, and counseling.|`|0494d957cdc898138da2648f6185a57eaa	it's called Tinitus i have it, try to have some back ground sound like a raido when your trying to go to sleep, i'm used to my constant ringing.|`|T6y2zIO1aa	Yes.

YCmvBc05aa	By mentioning the "drilled in" tooth the dentist is referring to the implant supported crown.<br>  <br>  That is the best but the most expensive procedure of all. <br>  <br>  Benefits :<br>  <br>  1. You don't have to get any tooth drilled down<br>  <br>  2. You can floss between the teeth like a normal, natural tooth,<br>  <br>  3. The procedure is localized. No other area gets messed with.<br>  <br>  4. You don't have to pay for the whole procedure at once. You pay for the surgical portion first. Then you wait for a few months for the area to heal / the bone to remodel. Then you pay for the fake tooth that gets attached to it. Altogether (with both phases) it may cost you around $3000 - $3500 . It maybe less or more depending on which practice you go to. So, shop around. It will be cheaper at dental schools / teaching institutions.<br>  <br>  For more info :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.atlantadentist.com/dental_implant_crown.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atlantadentist.com/dental_imp...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://dental-implants.com/cms/web_partners/patient_treatment/implant_crown_and_bridge.html" rel="nofollow">http://dental-implants.com/cms/web_partn...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck !!

Just pay close attention to what you put in your body.  You are what you eat.  Avoid frozen, preserved food as they are high in preservatives and can clog you up inside and impede(slow down) digestion.  Try to eat more veggies and fruits, whole grain cereals like cheerios, not too much red meat.  Eating foods with fat in them will not automatically make you fat either.  AVOID SODA... in fact DONT DRINK SODA EVER<br>  <br>  Do some weight training in the gym and build some muscle.  Not like huge, hulking muscles of course.  Muscle raises your metabolism which will allow you to burn fat much faster.|`|gDrLtqOIaa	dont say people what to do .others can judge u as u judge them u know what i mean.dont be so selfish and let people answer ok?<br>  <br>  i think u will lose 5 pounds if u do the diet rightly!|`|AA11230809	theres no approximate number but you will lose around 5-10 pounds...
yf0tevyfaa	I would clean them at least twice a day. If the pus is funky smelling then I would take them out or think about seeing a doctor about it. You may have infection and need antibiotics. <br>  <br>  If the pus is a normal color and smells almost odorless, then it should be just the skin trying to heal.<br>  <br>  The clear liquid sounds like plasma, which is the watery fluid that is present in blood. You see plasma mostly when you get burns or "raw" scrapes on the skin, just deep enough for plasma to soak through, but not enough for blood to be present. Try to keep them clean and dry, the plasma can keep them wet and then they'll take longer to heal.<br>  <br>  Again, if anything looks funny, go see a doctor! The infection could spread to your ear. I know whenever I would stretch my ears my glands would get swollen, almost as if I was sick.<br>  <br>  Good luck  (:

Although I'm no fan of Dr.'s either (for two reasons: first I loathe going to the Dr.'s and secondly because I like the use of alternative medicine) I think you either need to see a Dr. (Western Medicine) or a qualified Alternative health care professional just to double-check that it is palpitations.|`|kvHewjK6aa	you might have heart problems. go and get this checked out.|`|1dI1QiVJaa	I AM EDITING THIS PART IN CAUSE I JUST SAW THE FIRST PERSONS ANSWERS.

Either your dr. or SINCE U DON'T HAVE HEALTH INS. then there are clinics for people who cant afford a dr. Like go to the SOCIAL SERVICES DEPT OR CALL around and ask the Dr's their rates or something.  But if u go to Social Services Dept. then they maybe able to help find some dr who's cheap but good. WITHOUT KNOWING UR HISTORY OF HEALTH(UR'S AND UR FAMILY'S) and not being a dr I don't want to and it is hard to give advice, but sometimes my heart beats fast too.  I am an older male in my 40s and had a stress test just last week(nothing was wrong just my cardiologists said it was almost 5yrs since i had my last one) and everything is ok.  I with me i guess my heart beats fast sometimes from stress but i did once have an atrial fib where it beats fast and doesn't slow up and i ended up in the hospital. BUT NOW AS I SAID WHEN IT BEATS FAST ITS EITHER BECAUSE OF STRESS OR THAT IM OUT OF SHAPE OR A LITTLE OF BOTH. NONETHELESS YOU SHOULD SEE A DR,   IT MAYBE NOTHING WRONG WITH U BUT STRESS OR OUT OF SHAPE AS U SAID BUT IF U GO TO A DR THEN AT LEAST U WILL KNOW FOR SURE AND BE MORE RELAXED ONCE U KNOW.

HD29O7Ataa	It doesn't work this way, and if it did, the organs would be useless.<br>  <br>  Your body needs oxygenation to survive. If you let someone die, you're probably causing the body harm and thus rendering the organs not viable.<br>  <br>  For example<br>  <br>  Let's say someone was in a traffic accident. Ambulances and rescue workers are on scene rendering care to the accident victims. Here's...Billy...and billy has obvious brain damage from this accident. The brain damage is so severe he stopped breathing completely. <br>  <br>  What happens if you stop breathing? Remember how I said your body needs oxygen? If you stop, parts of your body will begin to die off due to lack of oxygen. On an accident scene, we would still provide the EXACT same level of care to an organ donor as a non organ donor. In the case of billy, we would still be breathing for him using our equipment and giving IV's and other procedures to try to sustain his life AND his organs. We follow the exact same procedures for treating an organ donor as a non organ donor. If he comes back, great. If not, we've probably done everything we can to sustain the body's life, mainly breathing for the patient. We still transport to the hospital. <br>  <br>  This is quite hard to explain, but in a nutshell. If you LET someone die, their organs would be useless in most cases. It's a myth that we treat organ donors and non organ donors differently on an emergency scene. They both require the same treatment to both sustain the organs and sustain human life. They go hand in hand.|`|14nj25eNaa	No, a doctor can not let someone die in order to procure their organs for someone else. There are rules for specific incidences however. If a patient has been treated but death is imminent, and if the family agrees to organ donation, the patient may be kept alive (life support) temporarily in order to save organs for donation. Not all organs must come from a live donor though. Hospital inpatients who pass away may be, with family consent, donors of certain organs such as eyes. Either way, it is illegal and unethical for a doctor to allow a patient to die in order to obtain organs for other patients.

From a psychiatrist, from your sister, from anyone, just get it.  <br>  <br>  Tell your feelings to anyone who will listen.  What you posted here is a good start, but you need to tell those who you trust.  Your Dad, your mom, your sister, your teachers, your friends, anyone who will listen to you.  Even if they don't want to listen to you, keep telling them until your message sinks into their heads.<br>  <br>  Take your medication.  Zoloft may have some side effects, but that's nothing compared to what you're contemplating.<br>  <br>  You also need to get rid of those negative feelings.  Negative feelings are good at times, but not at the levels that are in your head.  The best way to get rid of these feelings is to take your medication and to seek professional help.  Also, get a notebook.  Write down all your concerns, all your horrible thoughts into it, then go back to it later, when you're feeling better and have a clearer head.  You need to get those thoughts off your chest.<br>  <br>  You need to convince yourself that even if things look really, really, really bad now, these times will pass, and better times will eventually come your way.  Maybe you need to take action to force things to go your way.  Get a composition notebook and list down all the things you want to do in life.  Then, every day, force yourself to take at least one step to move yourself towards your goals.  If that's not challenging enough, then take two or three steps, but you must do something to make your life better every day.  Whenever you accomplish something, write it down in your notebook (so every day, there should be an entry there.)  Even if your progress is slow, it's better than not doing anything about your situation.<br>  <br>  The future can change in ways that you can't think of now.  Think of it this way:  So far, you have only lived about 1/5 of your potential life span.  This means that everything that you have experienced, not just in the past couple of years, but in your whole past, everything in your head, has occurred in this time period.  You still have about 4/5 of your life to live out.  That's a long time!  You have no idea how those years will turn out.  The future can always turn out better, so don't give up on it now.  Convince yourself: you must keep living.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.  Please, don't give up!!!|`|juhim6Bhaa	No. Seriously. It does get better. Being 14 is like being in hell.

5FuRcRdKaa	There is no other way than exercise. <br>  Try these<br>  <br>  Multi Muscle & Single Muscle Thigh Exercises"<br>  <br>  Multi Muscle Leg Exercises - Dumbbell Lunges:<br>  Thigh exercises like this are good for working your glutes, quads, inner and outer thighs and hamstrings. You can perform upper leg exercises like the lunge in either a stationary position, or you can walk across a large area in a straight line.<br>  <br>  Hold a dumbbell in each hand and pull your shoulders back. Lift your chest up and look straight ahead. Position your right leg forward in a long stride. Your foot should be far enough in front of you so that when you bend your right knee, your thigh and lower leg form a right angle.<br>  <br>  Slowly bend your knee lowering your hips so your knee just clears the floor. Pause briefly in this position, then slowly straighten your legs and raise your body back up to the standing position.<br>  <br>  Complete a full set, then switch legs and repeat. Or you can switch legs and move forward across the floor with each repetition. Try and pay close attention to the angle formed by your thigh and lower leg. Your knee should be directly over your ankle. Don't let your knee stray over your toes. Your knee and toes should be pointed in the same direction.<br>  <br>  Multi Muscle Leg Exercises - Leg Extensions:<br>  Multi muscle thigh exercises like this will help to define and shape the front of your thighs, known as your quads.<br>  <br>  Using a leg extension machine, sit in the seat and hook your feet under the padded bar. Adjust the pad or the seat so that your knees hang off the end of the seat and the foot pad rests on the lowest part of your shins, right above your ankle.<br>  <br>  The pad should not be on your feet or in the middle of your shins. Grip the handles on the machine or hold onto the edges of the seat to keep your hips from lifting up as you perform the thigh exercises.<br>  <br>  Extend your legs until your knees are straight, making sure you remain seated flat on the machine. Raise the weight up all the way, lock and hold briefly, then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position.<br>  <br>  Like all thigh exercises, it's very important to get the full range of motion and for you to feel the contraction in your muscles all the way up and down.<br>  <br>  Multi Muscle Leg Exercises - Leg Press:<br>  Sitting on a leg press machine, position your feet together against the footrest about shoulder width apart with your toes pointed slightly outward. Grip the handles or the sides of the seat.<br>  <br>  Bend your knees and lower the weight as far as possible without changing the position of your hips. Don't lower the weight so far that your hips start to curl up off the seat.<br>  <br>  Pause briefly in the bottom position then slowly push the weight back up using your heels, not your toes. Do not lock your knees at the top, but rather take the weight to just before lockout. Then begin to lower the weight again in a slow and deliberate fashion.<br>  <br>  Multi Muscle Leg Exercises - Barbell Squats:<br>  This is by far the most effective and efficient out of all thigh exercises for overall leg development.<br>  <br>  Rest the barbell on the upper portion of your back, but not on your neck. Firmly grip the bar with your hands almost twice your shoulder width apart. Position your feet on a heel raise so that the balls of your feet are resting on the floor and your heels are elevated.<br>  <br>  Your feet should be about shoulder width apart with your knees bent slightly outward and your knees over your toes. Keeping your back as straight as possible and your chin up, bend your knees and slowly lower your hips straight down until your thighs are parallel with the floor.<br>  <br>  Once you reach the bottom position, press the weight up with your heels. Be careful and don't lean forward or curve your back. This will stress your back and decrease the effectiveness of the exercise.<br>  <br>  Multi Muscle Leg Exercises - Back Extensions:<br>  Thigh exercises like back extensions are excellent for your lower back, glutes and hamstrings.<br>  <br>  Lie face down on a back extension bench and lock your ankles in place, or hook them under the roller pad if a footrest is not available. Adjust your hips on the pads so that when you bend forward your back is perpendicular to the floor, but not rounded. Your hips should extend over the edge of the pad. Fold your hands across your chest.<br>  <br>  Keeping your head in alignment with your spine lift your torso until your back is perpendicular to the floor. Lifting your torso higher than parallel is unnecessary and may place harmful stress on your back. Reverse the technique to return to the start.<br>  <br>  After a few workouts, when the exercise becomes easier, hold a weight plate across your chest to increase resistance.<br>  <br>  Do not, however, place any weight on your head or neck or this could result in injury.|`|ho73OV9Uaa	ignore the first response...ASSHOLE! <br>  try something like pilates or get a personal trainer. tell them the areas you want to target. lunges are a great leg workout! there are also useful magazines with exercises you can do at home-- and they normally tell you which muscles each exercise works.|`|ouUkY2t7aa	Do cardio.

X2Ks0tfHaa	Well i've heard of people collapsing and dying when exercising with flu...maybe you should just take it easy till you feel better|`|980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	Yeah it's okay you don't have to go.
15Uz3lO2aa	of course! more so actually! <br>  <br>  When the hymen breaks during your first time, it can hurt and bleed (not always but it can). Sports and tampons can break the hymen. It's a natural thing to happen, don't worry. <br>  <br>  Consider yourself lucky that your hymen is already broken, it doesn't make you any less a virgin, but it will make the first time more comfortable than it could be!<br>  <br>  But don't expect to thoroughly enjoy sex the first time anyway! Just focus on your partner and relax.|`|KVEGzknvaa	Not having to worry about breaking your hymen the first time around will take a lot of pressure off of the occasion.  You will likely experience little pain.  <br>  However, don't walk in to your first sex experience thinking it will be some fantastic event.  For some couples, it is enjoyable, but it is unlikely you will find losing your virginity to be extremely satisfying.  Especially if he is a virgin as well, he is unlikely to last very long, and may not be able to maintain his erection.  You probably won't orgasm from sex alone.  Aside from those potential issues, the new sexual relationship will obviously need some time to develop between you two, and eventually things become more enjoyable as a whole as you learn together.  <br>  <br>  The bottom line is to remember that your sex life is a learning experience.  Each partner is different, and your experiences together will be different as well.  Don't expect things to go perfectly from the start...just remember that it will get better in time.|`|5GW5xGCwaa	Sex will not be pleasurable the first time you have it.  Most of the time it's awkward and you will be so distracted that it's unlikely you'll have an awesome time.  And having a hymen would only make your first time that much more uncomfortable.  Having a hymen is irrelevant to enjoying sex.  In fact having one makes it hurt more.|`|xRQAsGRAaa	Yes, and you won't have to deal with the pain associated with it.|`|3rrZU8Ioaa	yeh... dont worry!!|`|vygYFdsSaa	An unbroken hymen is what often makes sex UN pleasurable the first time.

IRFbj0G9aa	I personally have not suffered from anal fissures but a loved one did, I lived it first hand so here goes.<br>  1. We first followed our doctor's advice and used the perscribed nitryoglycerin patch/cream in the affected are.  It was awful but helped to relieve the sphincter muscle from spasms which worsened the condition.  As long as you are in pain you keep reopening the fissure.  It is crucial that when you go to the washroom, the sphincter is relaxed.  Now it isn't a picnic this medication, it makes you feel horrendous!  But it helped, honestly.<br>  2.  Avoid foods like beans, for example large kidney beans were murder for us and always set us back weeks.  Or foods in general that cause you to stray from your normal smooth bathroom habits.<br>  3.  Good thing about the water, keep it up it is crucial.<br>  4.  And finally the best and most important.  Psyllium husk powder.  If you do not know, it is a fibre.  It made the difference.  We began with 1 teaspoon a day mixed in a glass of water, and gradually over a two week period work up to 1 tablespoon a day.  If you do not find that a tablespoon does the trick gradually increase till you find your proper dose ( lets not overkill! Women need 25 grams a day of fibre and men need 35 grams per day).   Now a few points about using this supplement<br>  *  if you are on any perscribed medication, always ensure you take your medication at least 30 minutes to an hour before you take your psyllium.  This is because the psyllium will affect the absorption in your stomach (it acts like a lining in your stomach) and hence possibly less active ingreadiants will be absorbed from your meds thus efficacy deminished.<br>  *  keep up with drinking plenty of water.  Cause systematic use of this and no water could get you constipated.<br>  * keep up with the fibre rich diet despite the use of this supplement.<br>  *  be consistent and don't give up. Systematic use! But if you do only the supplement and eat the foods that affect you negatively it's counterproductive dont you think?<br>  * and one last thing, resist the urge to push when you are excreting, it only causes damage.<br>  Patiance and keep at it, it will take a while for things to heal. It took about 2 months to see results.  But the great news is   we avoided surgery.  And now are asymptomatic and of course pain free for 8 months now.  And one last thing, stop using toilet paper only baby wipes.  You will never stop the psyllium husk, it will become a daily constant in your life.  This is not a quick fix type of problem.  You have to alter permanently certain things, like what I stated above.  Good Luck and please don't give up.|`|X5l6oeWnaa	Best thing is buy NIRANJAN PHAL  (SEEDS)  It is available in ayurvedic medicine shop .  You can buy 100 gm or 250 gm.  Take one seed wash in water little then take a glass of drinking  water and put the seed in it at night. In the morning drink this water after brushing and then eat your breakfast.

Hmm... ur bf and his dad's body are just over-reactive to those types of things. Cos like, for example when you sneeze ur body is trying to protect itself from whatever it is ur smelling (morphine, pollen, ect).<br>  <br>  Yes, everybody has allergies! =D<br>  <br>   But as I said before it varies. Some peoples bodies over-react to certain types of chemicals.

It says "money can't buy your happiness." The reason it's true is because true happiness always comes from within. You can have lots of money and luxurious things but the pleasure and happiness they bring are fleeting. These things along with the sensations they bring, they don't last. I don't know about Muslims. I've seen as many happy Muslims, as I've seen unhappy ones. Some people say that our happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions, it depends on inner conditions. It's not what you have, or where you are, or what you're doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It's what you think about it. As a Christian, I would say, that we have to be grateful for what we have. I think it's when we start thinking that we are the cause of our own happiness, that we are the ones in control, then we are in real trouble. We live in such a fast age, we're never sure of what's gonna happen next. In fact, we're never sure of anything. I suffered plenty from depression myself until I came to Christ. God gave me the true freedom and happiness. And believe me, I've tried every possible tack, every possible means there is but I couldn't find happiness elsewhere. Because the true love, peace and stability can only be obtained through God, our loving Father. My guess is that people are unhappy because they need a purpose in their lives, they need a meaning. Christianity reveals that meaning. More than any other religion there's. It just makes perfect sense.|`|AA11199260	In europe the depression and anxiety is caused due t o overwork and tense situation of the cities. Luxury does not give remedy for the depression, rather it increases depression and anxiety. The over work and the desire to have as much money as possible in the European population is causing such mental abnormalities. In my opinion physical , mental and spiritual health is necessary to over come such ailments. good luck|`|eLWr4HhEaa	europeans are way too cerebral...they think to much|`|ae4kktdqaa	The question itself is wrongly posted. For your kind information, anxiety and depression doesnt depends on Geographical boundaries. Its the problem which is present everywhere Be it US, India, China you name any country you get it there.<br>  <br>  The reason is Self centered approach. When we are depressed we tend to be more self cenetered and selfish in our dealings. The simple solution is to be more social. <br>  <br>  Once someone asked Vivekananda whats the way to achieve mental peace and calm. He suggested Happiness can only be achieved by doing little bit of social service.<br>  <br>  Whenever somepne helps others it gives you immense heartly pleasue. This you can try or you must have tried you can recall those moments when you helped someone and it filled your heart with joy.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|GelbRB8qaa	Because money can't buy you love or happiness.

AA11298562	Get more sleep?  I'm going to assume you tried that.  B12 can boost your wakefulness.  Caffeine, of course, but you have to be careful about that.  It's addicting and too much can cause heart problems (I have a friend who landed in the Emergency Room from drinking way too much caffeine for way too long).  Those energy drinks have the same problem.  Eating healthy is actually a great way to stay awake longer, your body can't function without the right nutrition.  Exercise gets your blood moving, but only for a short period if you're truly exhausted.|`|AA11617874	Walk around. Stretch. Do some boxing exercises in the air. Schedule sufficient amount of sleep a day: 6.5 to 8 hours.|`|W5AWUOm0aa	Dependant on your age, you only need a certain amount of sleep. if you set a schedule and stick to you can optimize the hours you are awake. I f you are really tired, that is a sign that your body needs rest. It is when our bodies at rest we naturally heal. More exercise and proper sleep and eating along with adequate water intake can boost your energy to allow for more wakeful hours.|`|juhim6Bhaa	Peppermints help

J9QUjetqaa	I dont think its about "hate"- she probably just doesnt want to deal with the drama. You and your boyfriend getting into physical fights is no good for anyone, she most likely wants to avoid that happening again. You two are so young, the easiest thing to do is just keep you separated, its not like youre in your 30s and married or anything.<br>  As far as her blaming you, whether or not it is actually your fault, she isnt going to want to put the blame on her own child. Its just easier to blame the outsider.<br>  You probably dont "deserve" to be banned from her home, but it is HER home and you and her son should have respect for it.|`|G6jTu4Ibaa	the condition in which she found both of you sepecially you was much more dangerous for her son (if used correctly).<br>  <br>  you could have ended up the matter with him behind the bars of attempted rape.  even she could have been behind the bars under few sections<br>  <br>  she is definitely not overprotective, but the way you both have reacted does not show any future bond together.|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	He is abusive. Leave him.|`|rSautofoaa	You do not deserve to be treated this way by either of them. If you were smart you would do exactly what she stays and stay the hell away from her AND her son. My best friend's mother was murdered by her abusive husband in front of one of her children. You don't want to wind up like that, do you? You need to speak with your own mother, or another adult that you can trust and find the help you need to deal with your own depression issues and find the strength you need to move on from him. Also, a supportive, trustworthy adult could help you find a safe way to remove this boy from your life. I really hope you pay close attention to what I've said. Your life surely depends on it.|`|qXFACB58aa	First off.. quit the pills, they only make you more depressed. If anything on her side she just sees someone who is not going to be good for her son. If you were her, would you do that to protect your kid? So quit the pills, apologize, and go from there. If her motive is she just doesn't like you, then it's wrong, but if it's because she feels like she is protecting her son, then you have to respect that|`|hqtOKXThaa	Considering you suffer from Depression, I would recommend focusing on yourself and what makes you happy. I have been where you are and it really sucks ,I know I have been thrown far but one day I decided i need to be in places that make me feel good about myself. It is not easy but if  you work at it one day you won't care if your BF mom hates you. You sound like a nice girl so you should take care of yourself.|`|3rrZU8Ioaa	sweetie i suggest you get out of it... if u ended up with a cut lip and bruises then i take it he hit you... no man should hit a woman... even if you did provoke him. and as you sy if he got mad over nothing and started hitting you then sweetie he ain't worth it... and no i don't think she should treat you like that but maybe you should take it as a warning... he isn't any good for you!!!|`|YLYPBf4waa	No you don't deserve it, but you have to understand that moms seem to take their kid's sides on things like that....well most do any how.  sorry to hear about it tho.   hang in there|`|Ffcmfzt8aa	HECKKKKK NO!!!THAT MOMS OVERPROTECTIVE AND PRETTY MUCH A PHYCOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!GOOD LUCK!|`|dSeKZlsQaa	Maybe she's worried that he hurts you again then ends up in jail|`|USsDzaIsaa	No, you don't deserve that treatment.<br>  <br>  But she probably did you a favour.

Sorry but I really can't stay quiet about that.
sHvp8yfCaa	Yes, It's called a thyroplasty. <br>  <br>  The surgery is performed in an outpatient setting under general anesthesia. After you are asleep, a one to two inch incision is placed parallel to, or in a skin crease of your neck over the Adam’s Apple. A strip of cartilage is removed from one or both sides of the voice box and the new edges sutured together.<br>  <br>  Your voice will likely be changed immediately, though the final pitch may not be settled for several months.|`|948e3b6ee25d102e90f2f75aa81982bfaa	Have your legs off|`|klQEScPJaa	yes, a rock singer called Bonnie Tyler had an op to lower her voice but it made her sound like she had laryngitus.
ZkwtldYlaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|Vg8QdPoIaa	i guess why do you think those basketball players are so tall? and you should try jumping jacks/jumping rope. a doctor told me to do that if i want to grow taller. and even if it doesn't work, it will definitely make you thinner. do from 300-600 jumps a day and if you want you can do 6 sets a day, 50 jumps for each set

AA10283855	There is a possibility that you could test positive from being in the room where the marijuana is being smoked.|`|AA10341097	ya don't worry about it you are still drug free as long as you haven't done it.<br>  <br>  But just a little advice from me to you, i am 18 years old and just recently (about christmas) smoked weed for the first time after years of peer pressure from friends and classmates to try it. I was in a very comfortable situation with my 3 best friends and there was no way of getting caught, and i had nothing to worry about like drug tests or anything like that.<br>  <br>  Always before doing it, i made a big deal about not wanting to try it (i really dont even know why) but once i finally did it (still have only done it once) i realized, its not as big a deal as i always made it out to be. Like it was really nothing, just smoked it, laughed for a while and ate with my friends, then went back to normal and no one ever found out, and i was and still am in a position where if people found out that i smoked pot, it could really hurt my reputation.<br>  <br>  I have always been the good guy in school and top of my class (valedictorian) so someone finding out about that might hurt my stuff a little but after doing it, i realized there is absolutely nothing to it.<br>  <br>  the moment it happened i actually just told myself in my head "It's not like i'm doing something destructive like heroin or cocaine, this is a one time thing to try it out, don't be such a pussy!" and i was psyched<br>  <br>  i would say just try it once in your life and don't make a big deal out of it and now is the best time in your life to try it when everyone else is trying it too and no one will feel that bad because they know its a stage of life when you try those kinds of things|`|yAJE2lbraa	Uhm listen buddy get away from these people before you end up just like them. Idk how old you are maybe college, high school? Well I'm a high school student. I try to stay away from people like that. I've hung out with pot heads before...for a while and trust me. The friends you thought were so great are actually selfish losers that want you to be just like them. There's also a thing called contact highs. It is what it sounds like. You can get high from being in a pot smoke filled room. I would say your drug free but I think you should get away from these people.

5GW5xGCwaa	Don't worry about it. <br>  <br>  You don't have to tell your other friends.  And seriously, it's not any of their business.  Experimenting with your sexually is so totally normal.   I know you said you aren't gay, and that is probably true.  But at some point everyone has their curiosities and some choose to explore them.  <br>  <br>  And if you're bi, no big deal. Let him know how you feel about it either way.  If you think it was a mistake and don't want him to do that again, tell him.

eqC5EBkJaa	can you explain your question better?  If you're asking 'does your height restrict you from doing dips' then the answer is not really.  A bigger difficulty may be your weight (if you're really heavy and not much arm strength - males; or if you're normal weight and normal strength - females)|`|7LvjFpOCaa	Your question is not very clear.As per my understanding,perhaps you want to know whether you will stop growing in height by doing dips?Well,this exercise does not have any negative effect on height growth.On the contrary,all exercises (including dips) promote growth,including height.In your early teens,even light weight training helps in gaining height but heavy weight lifting should be avoided since your bones are not so strong and are in a growing phase.Height is largely dependent on your genes and hereditary factor.

PAvYZJK2aa	i am circumcised and happy|`|TsjqzanQaa	As an infant, I was tied down, assaulted, sexually molested and mutilated by the process called circumcision, which is male genital mutilation.<br>  <br>  This caused more than the usual (50-75%) loss of sexual sensitivity and resulted in my inability to achieve orgasm in normal sex.<br>  <br>  Doctors NEVER disclose and in fact suppress the adverse effects and complications that result from the mutilation of circumcision, as they don't want to discourage anyone from having it done to themselves or their defenseless infants.<br>  <br>  Doctors make money from circumcision, and they are very frequently members of the religions that try to impose the mutilation of circumcision on all males.<br>  <br>  There are no benefits to circumcision.      It damages the penis, sexual sensitivity and sexual ability.    It decreases the pleasure and enjoyment of sex and masturbation, and in fact was used about 100 years ago to try to prevent boys from masturbating.<br>  <br>  I have restored my foreskin, and the increased sensitivity and intensity of orgasm are so much better than without a foreskin.       Nature intended males to have a foreskin, and it is normal and natural; circumcision is not normal or natural.<br>  <br>  You should look at the site CIRCUMSTITIONS to see some of the bad effects of this mutilation that the doctors don't want people to know about.<br>  <br>  Very, very few men ever choose to be circumcised.<br>  Most circumcised men had it forced on them as infants, when they had no choice in the matter, and couldn't defend themselves against this abuse and assault.<br>  <br>  Circumcision amputates the foreskin with its thousands of nerve endings.      Other nerves and nerve endings on the penis are permanently damaged.      Veins, blood vessels and capillaries are severed, permanently disrupting the normal penile blood flow.<br>  <br>  The glans and surrounding tissues are exposed, and they dry out and keratinize.       This keratinization continues throughout the lifetime of the victim, steadily, gradually, inexorably diminishing sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  There is no skin movement during sex or masturbation, as the skin is tight, sometimes so tight that there are painful and distorted erections.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|7mCCAqXzaa	I like being uncircumcised I have been all my life.

I understand that it's a controversial issue because people equate it with genital mutilation and say that it causes unnecessary pain.<br>  <br>  personally, I don't mind being circumcised at all. Sex and masturbation still feel good(i'm straight). In porn, you will rarely see an uncut person. I've only seen like 1 or 2 uncut on tv no less and it looks weird to me. Maybe because I'm not used to it.<br>  <br>  Being cut is easier to keep it clean since I don't have to roll the foreskin back.|`|5VqfLJcmaa	I have experience with having both types of penis. I personally feel that the only guys who can give you a truthful answer are those who spent several years as an "intact" person and then went on to be circumcised as adults. In my case, I chose to have this done when I was a 26 year old medical student.There were no medical "issues" here but my knowledge of the pros and cons led me to choose the surgically altered penis. I have never regretted this choice in the slightest.I feel that circumcision has enhanced my sexual pleasure by intensifying the orgasm as well as by prolonging it. I have felt no diminution in pleasure. So much of a male's sexual pleasure revolves around visual issues. I believe that the circumcised glans adds attractiveness to ones sexual apparatus and enhances oneself-confidence. Good luck in whichever choice you make for yourself.|`|W7l1awFPaa	Apparently, according to some medical studies there is something in the foreskin that can enhance a man's sexual pleasure, but I have no idea how they might have researched this.

I'd see a dermatologist if they're really worrying you. however i personally think freckles are BEAUTIFUL--think lucy lu :)<br>  hope this helps
SRh6rKPJaa	What To Eat To Gain Weight<br>  Increasing your intake of junk foods and greasy foods is not a good way to gain weight. Junk foods usually contain unhealthy trans fats or saturated fats. Even though you need to increase your calorie consumption to gain weight, those calories should come from foods that are good for you. <br>  Healthy fats include omega-3 essential fatty acids sources like tuna, salmon, flax, and walnuts. Good sources of protein include lean meats, fish, poultry, nuts, seeds and legumes. Healthy carbohydrate sources include fruits, vegetables and whole grains. <br>  <br>  It may be easier to eat five or six smaller balanced meals per day rather than eating three large meals, especially if you are not used to eating much at one sitting. <br>  <br>  Protein powders and nutritional supplement drinks such as Ensure (buy direct) can be added as in-between meal snacks if you still need more calories. Some protein powders are flavored and only need added water and some others can be blended with your choice of juice or milk to improve the taste. <br>  <br>  It would also be a healthy idea to add a small amount of flax seed oil and some psyllium powder to add some omega-3 essential fatty acids and extra fiber. <br>  <br>  Dietary Supplements and Gaining Weight<br>  A high-quality multivitamin and mineral supplement is a good idea to make sure you are getting all of the vitamins and minerals you need. Some people find that their muscle mass increases with protein supplements that contain certain blends of amino acids such as creatine (buy direct) and glutamine (buy direct). Some people who are very ill may need liquid nutritional preparations that are available through their doctors. <br>  Resistive Exercise To Gain Weight<br>  Exercise is also important for healthy weight gain. Resistance training exercises such as lifting weights will help to increase your muscle size. Aerobic exercises such as running and stationary bicycling are better for fat loss and excessive aerobic training may cause you to lose more weight. Resistance training can be done at a health club, gym or at home with the proper equipment. <br>  Remember that it can take a while to gain the weight you need, but be patient and continue to choose healthy foods until you reach your goal weight. <br>  <br>  Tools to Help You Gain Weight<br>  Use these tips and tools to help gain weight:<br>  Start with this Calorie and Nutrition Guide to find out how many calories you will need to reach the weight you desire. <br>  Use a food diary to track your calorie intake to be sure you are getting all of the calories and foods that you need. <br>  You can also use an online program such as Calorie Count Plus to track your calorie intake, your exercise and your changes in weight. Calorie Count Plus has a large data base of nutrition information for almost any food you like to eat. <br>  Add healthy calories to breakfast with an extra slice of whole-grain toast and peanut butter. <br>  Mid-morning and afternoon snacks should be nutritious, not junk. Trail mixes contain healthy nuts, dried fruits and can add healthy calories to your diet. <br>  Don't add calories to your meals by choosing unhealthy fried foods such as french fries, chicken nuggets and fish sticks. Choose healthy foods such as baked potatoes, baked chicken and fish, just make your portions a bit bigger. <br>  Keep your meals balanced. One meal should have a healthy protein source such as fish, low fat meat, chicken or legumes plus two or three servings of vegetables. Green vegetables add lots of vitamins and phytonutrients while starchy potatoes and corn add extra calories. <br>  Drink healthy beverages such as milk and fruit juices to add calories. Don't choose sugary sodas, which only add calories and no nutrition. <br>  Design a weight training program with help from About.com's exercise site and our weight training site.

They are an irregularity in the walls of the arteries in the brain and other parts of the body. They are sometimes so small that it is hard to pick them up on scans.  There are usually high pressures that cause the break in the wall.  If you are truly afraid of this you should be checked out. There are many other causes of headaches that have nothing to do with aneurysms.  I hope this helps and take care of yourself.

U4ek1lCLaa	I am a nurse in a nursing home and can honestly say some people need this medicine while sometimes they may actually have something else going on. What is the reason she is taking it? Has it helped or does it make her worse? My experience says she probably has behavioral issues going on and is the reason why she is taking Risperdal. Although different medications affect people differently reading all the adverse reactions and side effects is scary and can be cause for concern which is understandable but sometimes the benefits outweigh the side effects. Most of the people that I take care of really do benefit from this medication but if you feel her condition worsens or affects her safety then it is possible to D/C and change medications. Usually you have to sign a consent form for this type of medicine before it is given or notified of the new order. I would give it some time because nurses document and chart any side effects and report to the doctor anything abnormal (or they should) and keeping the family informed is also important. If you just don't want her to take it at all and your the POA then it will be D/C'd because the doctors usually do as the family requests. I hope this helps.|`|494f917287bcb72589c802dc7322ca19aa	Every drug will have it's side affects, some side affects are even worse then what your trying to cure.

9c7c4192016169baf847ee7ae4705422aa	Here's your real answer, the DIY answer.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming March 14th, the day after Friday the 13th.<br>  <br>  Since you're targeting fat loss, the important thing to remember is that the body will burn carbs before it will burn fat; therefore, the first thing you want to do is stay away from as many carbs as you can until Saturday.  This does NOT mean you remove carbs from breakfast.  This is important.  Stick to eating these foods:<br>  <br>  Meats<br>  Cheeses (moderate)<br>  Eggs<br>  Chunk Lite tuna in water (very good)<br>  Baked chicken<br>  Anything low-carb from the store, like Atkins brand<br>  <br>  Take the first two days and remove toxins from your body.  Eat nothing during this purge period, and drink a mix of fresh lemon, orange and grapefruit juices only.  You will experience a sick feeling under your skin.  This is the toxin being removed while fighting, kicking, and screaming on its way out.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  This next part will sound sickening, but just understand that this is what fat is.<br>  <br>  You know you are excreting fat from your body when you go to the bathroom, do #2, and the following occurs:<br>  <br>  1. it burns slightly<br>  2. it pours like diahrrea<br>  3. it is yellowish-brown in color<br>  4. it is murky or "cloudy" by looking at it<br>  5. it does not immediately mix with the water<br>  <br>  This is fat being removed from your body and might happen during the purge.  I have experienced this on periods of refraining from eating for a few days.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Let's go ahead and tune-up your body during this time by continuing the trend of toxin removal, but we can eat now.  After the purge, drink water, cranberry juice, and sugar-free (sugar = carbs) things but stay away from preservatives and soda.  Soda is the number one cause of osteoporosis, and milk is the enemy of soda, but limit your intake of milk during this time.  Preservatives = toxins.<br>  <br>  NO HIGH ENERGY SUPPLEMENTS EVER!  You want to be thin; not kill your heart.<br>  <br>  Eat more often during the day; just make the meals smaller.<br>  <br>  Stretch your arms and legs- important.<br>  <br>  Perform cardiovascular exercises in the morning after eating a breakfast of, say, bran and orange juice.  Remember: carbs in the morning = beneficial.  Fiber is necessary in helping clear out your intestines.<br>  <br>  When starting this type of routine (and you can take or leave however much of it you like) you will feel unbalanced during times of sleep and wake.  This will balance out into a much more fulfilling sleep pattern and much much less discomfort.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  PAIN VS. DISCOMFORT<br>  Concerning discomfort: take an area of your arm, for example, and give it a good slap a few times or so.  Notice how there is a sharp and immediate pain followed by a warm sensation, and maybe a buzz.  You know there will be pain but you also know that this will result in no major injury.  <br>  <br>  Now, wait a moment or two afterward and observe how it feels.  There is less of a feeling there then regular, isn't there?  This is because there is a contrast of the pain that was immmediate with a slightly prolonged state of "no discomfort" afterward.  <br>  <br>  That PAIN you felt is the same as putting your body through the riggers, or giving your body a good jolt during the exercise process.  (At the start of your entire exercise program) after the workout, you will feel so good that you will almost surely fall asleep afterward and experience a deep sleep.  That deep sleep is the unbalance that I was talking about- the unbalance of not having a history of exercise that will almost surely "level out" over time which is the long term reward of exercise.<br>  <br>  From now on, realize that everyone experiences pain at all times, called DISCOMFORT.  Their level of physical fitness dictates just how much of that discomfort is evident in their lives.  The more physically fit a person is, the higher their threshhold for immediate pain.  This means they can handle immediate pain easier than someone not fit because their body is tuned to receive the longer term benefit that comes as a result of enduring that "pain".<br>  <br>  Example: Person A sits in a chair for about 10 minutes before adjusting his butt.  Person B never adjusts his butt while sitting the same type of chair.  Which one gave in to discomfort?  The one who was less physically fit is the answer.  Imagine being able to keep a much longer attention span than the normal person.  Exercise will do this for you.<br>  <br>  pain = immediate<br>  discomfort = long term<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  You will lose weight on the purge process alone.  This is liquid weight mixed with fat, hence the description I gave earlier.<br>  <br>  Take this amateur advice however you like.|`|uPw4tjmNaa	water fasting is very affective if you are commited enough, only drink water for whatever period of time u feel is ok but no more than 50 days, its gets all of the toxins out of your body too i am currently on day seven, you will prob lose 3-4 pounds the first day then 1 pound everyday after that but for it to be safe drink alot of water and do not exercise unless its just light, like stretching hope i could help.|`|WlZ66KnZaa	It takes longer than a week but you can lose a good 2-4 pounds. Eat only 1200 calories and exercise for 1 hour. On Saturday you can also fake weight lose and wear a girdle (get them at walmart). Salads are good since they are basically just water.

xRQAsGRAaa	I do not know your weight right now, or your goal weight, so I will just give you the chart that I use as a general rule for my female customers. <br>  <br>  You want to try to eat 4-6 small meals a day. I know this sounds weird, but let me explain. When you eat only 3 larger meals a day, you have a huge gap between your meals. Your body resorts to storing the unused calories as fat to get you to your next meal. If you eat 4-6 meals a day, your body learns(and adjusts), and knows another meal is coming up right away, so it doesn't need to store the food as fat, it just uses what it needs, and passes the rest right through you, storing MUCH less as fat.<br>  <br>  Here's a rough chart I use for the women who come to me. It's very accurate, although every person's body is different. (by the way, the elliptical is ok as a replacement for running if you have bad knees)<br>  <br>  If you're over 200 pounds: eat 1800 calories a day, in 4-6 meals. <br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  If you're between 160 and 200: eat 1600 calories a day, in 4-6 meals.<br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  If you're 130-160: eat 1500 calories a day, in 4-6 meals<br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  100-130 pounds: Eat 1300 calories a day in 4-6 meals<br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  Under 100 pounds: eat 1200 calories a day in 4-6 meals<br>  Run/jog at least 30 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week<br>  <br>  Every time you get bumped down to a lower weight class, decrease the calories according to this chart. Since I'm not gonna be there with you, you may need to adjust it slightly to suit your needs. Also remember that the first few pounds are very easy, then you usually hit a wall for about a week, then you'll start losing weight again. Don't be intimidated if you lose 5 pounds the first week, then only 2 pounds the second week. <br>  <br>  Once you hit your target weight, increase your calorie intake by about 200 calories. If you're still losing weight, increase it more, as needed to maintain your weight(assuming you continue to work out).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

In this mode, the body stores everything it can as fat so it can survive. This slows the metabolism rate and when start eating again, the body stores this new intake as fat. Controlling calorie intake is only one part of the energy equation.<br>  <br>  Understand Energy Balance & Weight Management to lose weight effectively<br>  <br>  Rather than go on extreme diets by starving oneself or eating selected food groups, maintain a balanced diet. Eating small meals more frequently would help to maintain the metabolic rate and allow the body to get use to normal functioning with less calories.<br>  <br>  Dieting is temporary deprivation and not the best solution. Eating healthy means developing a new mind set. Reducing weight and weight maintenance is a lifelong pattern of moderate exercise and balanced diet.|`|F32uPjAraa	Avoid all food that contains any Sugar or flour.

Fruit juice and rolled oats, with a little honey for breakfast. Any fruit and carrots or celery with some cold chicken for lunch. A nice steak with sauteed vegetables for dinner.  You can nibble on nuts during the day for snacks, and drink lots of fresh clean water all day. <br>  <br>  I find that whenever I become a little peckish, a long glass of water stops the cravings for food.

I know they are horrible. With a 1200 calorie diet you can lose 2 pounds a week (more if you exercise 1 hour a day). Drink lots of water, dehydration leads to hunger.

Lately i let myself go and gained about 50 lbs and was weighing about 190. I was in perfect shape around april/may last year. was festively plump by october.<br>  <br>  first thing is to start running or doing some cardio or something.<br>  im running on a treadmill. i started 2 weeks ago. running like 2-3 times the first week and 2-3 times last week. im sick this week and i cant breathe. im down a pants size or 2 already (from about 36 to 34). i work out about 30 minutes a day. usually about 15 minutes ona treadmill at about 4.5 - 5 miles an hour running. if i have to i alternate between that and the exercise bike. the bike is my cooldown exercise while i get ready to run again. make it fun. get invested and dedicated into it and figure out what you like about it. get an ipod or mp3 player and listen to music, get a nice water bottle and some workout clothes that make you feel comfortable in your current physial condition (made a huge difference for me, made me less self conscious at the gym). now that i feel like im invested in it and i HAVE to go.<br>  <br>  i generally hated exercise BUT ive realized its helping with my depression (i dont take my meds). it gives me a physical outlet and it gives me time to think. plus it makes me feel better about myself. so thats a benefit i can actually relate to.<br>  <br>  ive cut my night eating which i used to do a lot. when i get a food craving i eat fruit. lately its been navel oranges. sometimes its grapefruit, tangerines and sometimes other fruit. if i MUST have something hearty at night, plain oatmeal with some spleda. or cereal with the skim extra milk (tastes like 2 percent but about as thick as water, not bad).<br>  <br>  eating a banana or something when you first wake up kicks your metabolism on, so thats good for people like me who dont eat breakfast cause no time.<br>  <br>  i cut soda out of my diet again. eating slightly healtheir choices. have a general knowledge of what youre eating and how much the calories are. it helps. also, im vegetarian which has its shortcomings (i wasnt vegetarian in 2006). its tempting for me to eat pastas and starches all the time but i have to be carefull of that.<br>  <br>  im seeing results already and its only been 2 weeks, its very very motivational seeing it happen. may not be a huge leap but its progress :-) and results dont lie.<br>  <br>  <br>  the future steps for me:<br>  the last thing im now starting that ive changed my habbits is im going to get on some suplements with the help of some friends that are already using them. im going to be on some whey protein for my protein, some creatine for when im running. lots of water and negative calorie foods as snacks (things that use more energy to burn than they contain, like celeary). and the final supplements im getting on is ephedra. when taken safely it can be very beneficial, and its a bronchial dialator or something which should help me when im running. having the healthy habbits can make the difference between being some fat person who says something doesnt work versus being one of the guys on the commrecial that actually got better results from the methods. (slimfast, etc included).|`|SRh6rKPJaa	Cardio Workouts at the Gym <br>  <br>  The following workouts should give you some ideas on how to spice up your workouts and burn more calories by raising and lowering the intensity. Modify each workout according to your fitness level and feel free to increase or decrease speed, incline and/or workout time to fit your needs. <br>  <br>  For each exercise, warm up with 5-10 minutes of light cardio and keep track of your Perceived Exertion or monitor your heart rate. Use this calorie calculator to determine how many calories you're burning. End with a cool down and stretch. Treadmill <br>  <br>  Start with incline at zero and speed at a comfortable pace (walking or jogging). Perceived Exertion (PE)=Level 5 (see Perceived Exertion Scale). <br>  1 Minute: Raise incline one or more percent every 15 seconds. PE=5-6 <br>  1 Minute: Reduce the incline one percent every fifteen seconds. PE=6-7 <br>  3 Minutes: Walk or jog at a steady pace. PE=5 <br>  Repeat entire cycle for 30 or more minutes <br>  Approximate calories burned: 320(based on 140 lb person) <br>  Elliptical Trainer <br>  Using manual program, enter workout time as 30 minutes and choose appropriate level <br>  6 Minutes: Set ramps (if option) and resistance levels at medium level. PE=5 <br>  2 Minutes: Set ramps at highest level and increase resistance every 30 seconds. PE=6-8 <br>  2 Minutes: Lower ramps and resistance to comfortable level. PE=5 <br>  6 minutes: Set ramps and resistance to medium and go backwards. PE=5-6 <br>  Repeat entire cycle for remaining time <br>  Calories Burned: 250-300 (based on 140 lb person) <br>  Bike <br>  <br>  Using the manual program, enter your workout time as 30 minutes and choose appropriate level <br>  5 Minutes: Cycle at a comfortable pace. PE=5. <br>  5 Minutes: Raise level several increments and decrease a level every 30 seconds. PE=6-8. <br>  5 Minutes: Cycle at comfortable pace. PE=5. <br>  5 Minutes: Raise level higher than before and decrease a level every 30 seconds. PE=6-8 <br>  5 Minutes: Cycle at comfortable pace. PE=5. <br>  5 Minutes: At current level, increase a level each minute. PE=7-8. <br>  Calories Burned: 245 (based on 140 lb person) <br>  Hit the Road <br>  <br>  Instead of spending 40 minutes inside a sweaty gym, head outside for a walk/run. <br>  <br>  Warm up with a brisk walk/slow jog for 5-10 minutes. <br>  Jog/walk briskly for 3 minutes <br>  Sprint or speed walk for 30 seconds <br>  Repeat this cycle 6 for the remaining time, keeping PE between 5-8. <br>  As you can see, it's easy to spice up your workouts by playing around with your speed, incline and resistance and alternating high intensity intervals with recovery periods. This not only keeps you from getting bored, it also helps burn more calories and increases your endurance very quickly. Use this technique with any cardio activity to keep things interesting!|`|kvHewjK6aa	you think 140 pounds is fat? your kidding.
Iq8DwIGwaa	Honey, it's probably an ingrown hair.  The follicle can become infected.  If you're not having sexual contact (without your clothes) you cannot have an STD.  However, you may need an antibiotic to clear the infection.  Staph infections are very common, but they need treatment too.  It's nothing you did wrong, but it needs to be addressed. <br>  <br>  It's going to be okay, but you need to take care of it.|`|Gy9kt139aa	I agree with the first answerer about the ingrown hair. Pubic hair is very thick and curly, and can sometimes curl in on itself under the skin, especially if you've been shaving there. If it isn't bothering you too badly, I'd say leave for a few more days and it will probably go away. If it doesn't, see your doctor because there is a possibility that it's something more serious.|`|b9340e25c5c91b1731a01132aab4d92daa	In-grown hairs and cysts hurt like hell!

Once you get used to the wierdness, it's supposed to be cool. I'm thinking about buying one, but I don't know. <br>  <br>  Btw, I only have ONE bit of helpful tampon advice. When you're putting the applicator in, put it in all the way and let go for a second. That lets the applicator angle itself correctly. THEN, use the applicator to push the tampon in. That seems to have helped me a lot. I wonder if the Diva cup is better? It would safe an *** load of money in the long run|`|GcCdTgrxaa	Use pads lol|`|84f4374bdc6d86131ec48ade47938d4faa	I've never tried the mooncup but I can only imagine that if your periods are heavy they are messy.  I wouldn't fancy faffing around with one in public loos either.  Have you tried using Lillets rather than the applicator type like Tampax?    The reason I ask is that Lillets expand widthways unlike the others which expand lenghtways and, for me, have a tendency to push out.  Start with a larger size when heavy and use the mini one when light.  I find them much more comfortable.  Lots of people use a pad or liner for extra protection.

I thought this was just normal. <br>  <br>  What I do is... have different sized tampons readily available so that when I'm heavy I put in a bigger one, sometimes with a panti-liner for safety! and when I'm light I put in a smaller one or just wear a panti-liner on those lighter days without any tampon. I hate those thick pads so this system works for me.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I've heard great things about the mooncup.<br>  <br>  ---edit---<br>  <br>  you could very well be putting them in wrong... i just remembered that it took me a year to figure out how to put those damn things in. I thought it was the tampons, but when i finally did it right, it all made sense. try putting it in on different angles and positions until it just slides in deep enough.|`|ZKw46efXaa	two women i used to work with used the mooncups! i cant say i like the idea of them but they seemed to like it!! I think you just take it out every so often, wash it and put it back in! i dont quite get how you insert it but that will all be on the instructions! i have heard it is very good!<br>  i tend to use tampons and i love them! if i am on heavily i will wear a pantyliner to for my ease of mind but as long as you change regularly leaking shouldnt be a problem! i also wear pads to bed!!

SRh6rKPJaa	To lose stomach fat you have to throw out the junk food. But, why is junk food so bad? Mostly it is due the the high sugar content of junk food. Most junk food consists of refined carbs and sugar, which when eaten quickly raise blood sugar levels, leading to reduction in fat burning and increase in apetite. <br>  <br>  Consumption of carbs is essential, but there are good carbs and bad carbs. Refined flours and the foods that they create can cause bloating, poor digestion, and lead to accumulation of fat. <br>  <br>  Your body cannot metabolize too much carbohydrate at once because the body doesn't need so much energy at once. The excess sugar will just turn into stomach fat. Slow release carbs are also beneficial, such as oats, brown rice, some pulses and sweet potato.<br>  <br>  Avoiding carbs increases fat burning metabolism (lipolysis) which helps to reduce stomach fat. <br>  <br>  Combine your meals with a good combination of protein, carbohydrate and vegetables. Your source of protein should be in a size of a deck of cards; the carbohydrates in a size of your palm and the major bulk of your meals should come from vegetables.<br>  <br>  Try not to have late night snacks. The main problem with late night snacking is that there is not much activity done afterwards. People go straight to bed right after the late night meal because they are tired. So, this will cause high sugar levels in the blood stream and no energy spent after that. The excess sugar will just turn into fat. Losing stomach fat requires a strict diet. <br>  <br>  Decrease that alcohol consumption. If you drink a lot, you will accumulate fat around your waist.<br>  <br>  One gram of alcohol, which is can be calculated as one ml of alcohol contains 7 calories. Even thought the amount of calories is lesser than of fat, alcohol calories are completely useless. Alcohol does not contain any nutrients at all. So, the entire amount of calories consumed through alcohol will be stored as fat! <br>  <br>  Lastesly 30 minutes aerobic exericse and 30 minutes of weight lifting will help u lose stomach fat :)

VS9ewDRkaa	Normally clots can form in the legs when you are immobile for long periods of time, such as post-operation or long flights on cramped economy seats. However, nowadays, patients normally get blood thinners while in hospital to reduce the risk.

I have sleep apnea (I stop breathing for short periods of time when I sleep). A breathing machine (CPAP) is what was prescribed for me.

It is best to have an empty stomach and wear loose, comfortable clothing. <br>  <br>  “This is a meditation in which you have to be continuously alert, conscious, aware, whatsoever you do. Remain a witness. Don’t get lost. While you are breathing you can forget. You can become one with the breathing so much that you can forget the witness. But then you miss the point. <br>  <br>  “Breathe as fast as possible, as deep as possible; bring your total energy to it but still remain a witness. Observe what is happening as if you are just a spectator, as if the whole thing is happening to somebody else, as if the whole thing is happening in the body and the consciousness is just centered and looking. <br>  <br>  “This witnessing has to be carried in all the three steps.

I had found one thing that worked and dont ask why but it did. First i found the best moisturising cream i could find on the market, one that is thick and heavy (nivea) etc. I used about a spoon of moisturising cream and added two drops of Tea Tree oil (100% pure type NOT the mixed) to the moiusturising cream. Mix the tea tree oil in the moisturising cream the cream would be oily then apply a thick layer to the eczema affected area leave it on for as long as possible hours even if possible. The cream might cause i slight burning sensation, but the next day i woke up the next morning and the eczema had cleared alot. i continued applying the same cream in a week it had completely gone. try it whats there to lose.

ufgv7oTjaa	I'm surprised you haven't gotten an answer yet. There isn't much of a difference when you really look at it... they are both Magnesium. The only difference is obviously the Oxide vs the Citrate, but what that means is just how easily your body can absorb it.<br>  The detail behind that is that the body doesn't absorb pure minerals (like Magnesium) very efficiently, so they are bonded with another molecule (like the Oxide or Citrate in this example) that the body absorbs easier. When the body absorbs that "other molecule", the Magnesium just gets sucked along with it. That's why you don't see just "Magnesium" or just "Calcium" in the ingredients in a product... there will always be another molecule listed with it. <br>  You should have no problem taking the Citrate instead of the Oxide. Oh, and adding some fiber to your diet and drinking enough water daily should help your constipation, too. Good luck and I hope I helped!

While I understand that going to the doctor can be scary especially when you're expecting such a terrible diagnosis you're just going to have to suck it up. The only way to know for sure is to have a doctor check you out. For all you know it's probably something really minor and you're just stressing over nothing.

1BaeFYnEaa	An immune disorder is a dysfunction of the immune system. These disorders can be characterized in several different ways:<br>  <br>      * By the component(s) of the immune system affected<br>      * By whether the immune system is overactive or underactive<br>      * By whether the condition is congenital or acquired<br>  <br>  According to the International Union of Immunological Societies, more than 150 primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) have been characterized.[1] However, the number of acquired immunodeficiencies exceeds the number of PIDs.[2]<br>  <br>  It has been suggested that most people have at least one primary immunodeficiency.[3] Due to redundancies in the immune system, though, many of these are never detected.<br>  <br>  Immunodeficiency (or immune deficiency) is a state in which the immune system's ability to fight infectious disease is compromised or entirely absent. Most cases of immunodeficiency are acquired ("secondary") but some people are born with defects in the immune system, or primary immunodeficiency. Transplant patients take medications to suppress their immune system as an anti-rejection measure, as do some patients suffering from an over-active immune system. A person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind is said to be immunocompromised. An immunocompromised person may be particularly vulnerable to opportunistic infections, in addition to normal infections that could affect everyone.<br>  <br>  A number of rare diseases feature a heightened susceptibility to infections from childhood onward. Many of these disorders are hereditary and are autosomal recessive or X-linked. There are over 80 recognised primary immunodeficiency syndromes; they are generally grouped by the part of the immune system that is malfunctioning, such as lymphocytes or granulocytes.[1]<br>  <br>  The treatment of primary immunodeficiencies depends on the nature of the defect, and may involve antibody infusions, long-term antibiotics and (in certain cases) stem cell transplantation.<br>  <br>  Immune deficiency may also be the result of particular external processes or diseases; the resultant state is called "secondary" or "acquired" immunodeficiency. Common causes for secondary immunodeficiency are malnutrition, aging and particular medications (e.g. chemotherapy, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, immunosuppressive drugs after organ transplants, glucocorticoids).<br>  <br>  Many specific diseases directly or indirectly impair the immune system. This includes many types of cancer, particularly those of the bone marrow and blood cells (leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma), and certain chronic infections. Immunodeficiency is also the hallmark of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV indirectly attacks the immune system.<br>  <br>  The kind of defect to the immune system determines the symptoms of immunodeficiency. Generally, the problems that lead to the diagnosis of an immunodeficiency include recurrent or persistent infections, or developmental delay as a result of infection. Particular organ problems (e.g. diseases involving the skin, heart, facial development and skeletal system) may be present in certain conditions. Others predispose to autoimmune disease, where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues, or tumours (sometimes specific forms of cancer, such as lymphoma). The nature of the infections, as well as the additional features, may provide clues as to the exact nature of the immune defect.[1]<br>  <br>  GO TO THE DOCTOR TO FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM AND GET TESTED FOR EVERYTHING!!<br>  Good luck! Hope it's nothing irreversible! Be strong!|`|juhim6Bhaa	You should consider the failsafe diet. Google it.|`|967f41157f4d51aaff0de6b543b865bdaa	You need to undergo a comprehensive medical check up involving blood tests and x-ray.

The way you work out your maximum heart rate is 240bpm minus your age. e.g. if you were 25 your maximum heart rate would be ruffly 215 bpm so 60% would be 129bpm.<br>  <br>  One common mistake is people work way to hard to burn fat and think that if they are not feeling like they are going to collapse then they are not doing it right but take it at 60 percent and this is your perfect heart rate zone. The reason for it being at 60% is because fat is a hard energy for your body to access so if your body is not overworking then you can access the fat easier.<br>  <br>  If you need to know more or want me to calculate your fat burning heart rate jsut e-mail me and I'l be more than happy to do this.

You can try natural breast enlargment methods . Details are as under<br>  <br>  Breast massage as a method of natural breast enlargement and breast health has actually been used for years as a means of stimulating healthy breast growth and promoting breast tone, pliability and firmness.<br>  <br>  Here are some guidelines for breast massage you may want to follow:<br>  <br>  1.) Use a olive oil or any other oil of your choice to help prevent friction and increase the enjoyment and relaxation of the massage for a more pleasurable and therapeutic experience. This can be an herbal mixture .<br>  <br>  2.) Light to moderate massaging using a gentle back and forth gentle “swishing” action is best. This can be in a counterclockwise circle around the breast to help promote maximum lymphatic drainage.<br>  <br>  3.) To gain maximum benefit and therapeutic effects, breast massage should be practiced daily, as part of a routine - perhaps when fresh out of the shower, since the skin is still somewhat moist and the room may still be steamy, for a smoother massage which may be more easily lubricated since there will still be moisture in the air. If you prefer, even several times a day can be a great benefit. It depends on what fits into your schedule. A few minutes at a time should suffice.<br>  <br>  .<br>  <br>  Enjoy Life|`|AA11199260	Yes. You can increase the size of your breast by messaging with olive oil.

d40e4596ee31f7749a7773684fe3ab6baa	Hi. There isnt a hard and fast answer to this. Every persons body is different and reacts differently to substnce abuse. 20 years is a long time and many adicts dont get that far. If the substances they are using are clean and not cut with any toxic products then they could go on abusing for a long time... but it only takes one bad batch and they die. Sorry i cant give you the answers you are looking for|`|YuTFG3feaa	If the clinic you go to for methadone treatments is administering the methadone correctly, they will slowly begin to decrease the dosage of it given to you on regular intervals.  The decrease amount varies with each individual.  The clinic will continue to decrease the dosage until eventually you are off the methadone all together without any effects.  Methadone is not intended to be a permanent lifetime replacement for the street drugs and if the clinic you go to hasn't reduced the methadone dosage you receive in small increments and you have been receiving the treatment for a length of time, then they are not doing what they are supposed to be doing.

YdI1SSyKaa	Yes see a doctor to see if it is best for your body and lifestyle. What happens is your getting a lengths dose of hormones all at once instead of spreading them out daily like with the pill, or having them slowly released like with a patch or ring.

Also it causes extreme weight gain in some people so beware.|`|BlVJCUUJaa	Yes it works. <br>  Statistics have shown that this method is effective for most users, <br>  although there is a chance of bad side effects on some unfortunate ones. <br>  You should talk to a doctor about this, and find out your chances of getting these effects. <br>  It is more convenient than The Pill as you do not have to eat it at a specific time every single day. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this only prevents pregnancy, <br>  it does not protect you from STI-s (eg.

2QOcTTTuaa	Saponification is the name for the process (a chemical reaction) that produces soap from lye (extracted from ash) and fat (animal or vegetable-based).  This is the ancient and natural way of making soap.  The chemical reaction, when performed by an experienced soapmaker, completely neutralizes the lye and changes both lye and fat into soap molecules.  No lye should be left in the finished natural soap, and pH testing should be done to detect the presence of any remaining lye.  If pH shows lye remains, soap must be discarded.  It is completely natural.|`|yAJE2lbraa	from what I remember lye is a chemical? I'd be careful when washing with the lye soaps. Sometimes active ingrediants can cause some pretty painful affects when washing with them. If you are a female then I suggest to not wash with the soaps containing lye in the bathtub because it might cause bladder infections, skin irritations. If you are a male it might also be risky. I would wash with a soap that is all natural. I wouldn't necessarily consider the lye soaps natural.<br>  Hope that helped|`|juhim6Bhaa	I think lye is just one of the real ingrediants in soap.

nAp688tZaa	There is a severe shortage of immediate release oxycodone (roxicodone) and has even been reported at the FDA's website.  The reason is because one manufacturer was shut down for quality control issues because most of the pills were too large and people were getting more medication than intended.  This also happened with many of their other medications like cardiac meds.  There are currently only 2 manufacturers that are making the med and trying desperately to keep up with the demand.  Most pharmacies where I live do not have any of the immediate release strengths of this medication and are on back order.  I know of several people in my Pain Management clinic that have had to change their medications until this problem can be fixed and the other two companies can start producing enough medication to meet demands.  You may want to try a local independent pharmacy and not a chain like Walgreen's or CVS as they may still have some since they are not used as often as national chains.  Just be aware that some of these local pharmacies do not take any insurance and you may have to pay cash for your prescription.  If you do, you can submit the bill to your insurance and see if they will reimburse you since I am sure they all know what it going on and why you would have to use a n out-of-network provider.  If you can not find them at all, you need to see your doctor and get your medication changed until the shortage has ended.|`|Jy9KORHDaa	what did your pharmacy say|`|AA10483214	i kno they didnt stop producing them.wht MG do u have? i loved roxi's they helpd my pain out sooo much it was a great pain supresser.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Yes it is possible and it can be done on the NHS as well as privately. Your best option is to see if the Dr who did the original sterilisation can do the reversal,- success really depends on the method that was used for your sterilising. Sometimes clips are used, or cutting/removing part of the tube or tying the Fallopian tubes together.<br>  <br>  If the clips were used, then the reversal is very likely to be successful. Even if the tubes were cut or tied, micro-surgical techniques are now very successful. Success rates vary from between 65 and 95 per cent. Only if the tubes are very damaged would there be a problem- this is actually not that common.<br>  <br>  You will need to see a Gynaecologist who will need to have a look at your tubes with a laparoscope, he will then be able to give you an idea of the success rates. Have a chat with your GP, he should refer you. The only downside of having it done on the NHS, is that there may be a long waiting list.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	It is sometimes possible to reverse the procedure, but I don't need to remind you that you agreed that it was assumed to be irreversible when you originally signed up for it.<br>  <br>  The problem is not just rejoining the tubes but producing a smooth, scar free passage.

SI46bZ8vaa	well, have you seen his penis?<br>  as a general rule, a guy will probably add 2.5 inches when describing his penis.|`|AA11785060	He is lying, can guarentee it. Only 12% of all adult males are larger than 6.2 inches.  But 90% claim to be.  A guy with a 10 incher would have loads of problems, since most young guys get stray erections popping up all the time. A average 5-6 incher is hard enough to hide, a 10 inch erection would be impossible to not notice-- and your boyfriend would be known as the stallion around school.<br>  <br>  Of course you can always have him show it to you-- and pull a measuring tape out of your purse to measure it. You measure along the top, from the base of the penis to the tip.  Some not very bright guys measure from underneath, below the balls so get really really big numbers that mean nothing since the measurement along the top is the "size" that can be inserted in a vagina.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	That would be most unusual dear.

NONETHELESS, there are ways u can tell.  Obviously you haven't see it yet or you would be able to tell not the exact size maybe but approximate size by looking at it and you'd be able to guess around if it  was 10 inches or not. SO I would say  there are ways u can tell. U can ask him if u can touch it (IF IT DOESN'T BOTHER U TO DO SO) AND either touch it by grabbing the pants where the shape of his penis is or getting him naked then touching it.  You can also tell if hes lying by the expression on his face.  If you ask him to tell u it again then watch his face. If he smiles or looks away then most likely he is exaggerating about the size(either for some other reason or just to make himself look good to u and impress u)ALSO  THE OTHER WAY is to just look at him naked , ask him  if u can and then u will know the size.  U MAY NOT WANT TO TRY IT IN THE ORDER I MENTIONED CAUSE I JUST THREW OUT SOME IDEAS FOR U.|`|FU4TyghIaa	okay, 10 inches seems pretty big.  The fact that it's such a neat number, rather than 9 1/2 or 10 1/4, that's pretty strange and adds weight to the notion that it's fictional.<br>  He might just be joking or trying to get a reaction, cause 10 is on the largish size?  But maybe if he was joking etc he would have told you 12.<br>  I wonder what he thinks of you that you may be attracted to a large member?<br>  Does he think you're a bit of an air head?  What's the rest of your relationship like?  Does he think all you want from the relationship is a portion from the butcher shop (meat department).<br>  Do you have any common male friends that he feels threatened by, like you're giving attention to them?<br>  From the info, can't say anything conclusive.  Just more questions, sorry.<br>  The only way you can tell if he's lying is to get out the ruler and to get the meat out and get it ready to be assayed.  <br>  In that regard, maybe he's just wanting you to have a look.  If you want to, you can follow his lead, go for the ice breaker and make the move.  It's a pretty unromantic come on, but hey?<br>  If you do, and it's not up to scratch, be prepared for the disappointment so as not to be too crestfallen.<br>  There's so many questions on YA guys asking about the size of their stuff.  Like, what, i mean, who would in their right mind sit around, getting aroused and measuring it?  This is a weird world, and you can't blame him for being susceptible to it i guess.  Bit like women getting self conscious from all that fashion beauty stuff that's designed to make women feel bad so they spend money on those lousy products.  Same goes for all the guy stuff enlargement stuff.  Like cures for baldness and stuff.

He doesn't want you to be stuck in the past any longer, but He wants to give you a new life—and the reason is because He loves you.<br>  <br>  This is why the most important step you can ever take is to turn to Christ and ask Him to come into your life. He will forgive your past, and He will help you become the person you should be. The Bible says, "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come! All this is from God" (2 Corinthians 5:17-18). By a simple prayer of faith ask Christ to come into your life today—and He will.<br>  <br>  When you come to Christ something remarkable happens: God Himself comes to live within you by His Holy Spirit. You may not feel any different—but you are different, because God now lives within you. And one reason He lives within you is to help you, by giving you the strength you need to live a pure life. The Bible says, "The Spirit helps us in our weakness" (Romans 8:26).<br>  <br>  Commit your life to Christ today. Then ask Him to strengthen you spiritually by reading His Word, the Bible, and praying, and having fellowship with other believers. Then begin each day by committing it to God, asking Him to guide you and help you resist temptation.

2NRCJgq2aa	OCD obsession symptoms:<br>  OCD obsessions are repeated, persistent and unwanted ideas, thoughts, images or impulses that you have involuntarily and that seem to make no sense. These obsessions typically intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things. <br>  <br>  OCD compulsion symptoms:<br>  OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform. These repetitive behaviors are meant to prevent or reduce anxiety or distress related to your obsessions.

However, the likelihood that a dreaded event will occur, or the causal relationship between the performance of compulsions and the reduction of this likelihood, tends to be imagined or exaggerated.The symptons are     *  Fear of contamination or dirt<br>      * Having things orderly and symmetrical<br>      * Aggressive or horrific impulses<br>      * Sexual images or thoughts<br>  <br>  OCD symptoms involving obsessions may include:<br>  <br>      * Fear of being contaminated by shaking hands or by touching objects others have touched<br>      * Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove<br>      * Thoughts that you've hurt someone in a traffic accident<br>      * Intense distress when objects aren't orderly or facing the right way<br>      * Images of hurting your child<br>      * Impulses to shout obscenities in inappropriate situations<br>      * Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands<br>      * Replaying pornographic images in your mind<br>      * Dermatitis because of frequent hand washing<br>      * Skin lesions because of picking at your skin<br>      * Hair loss or bald spots because of hair pulling<br>  OCD compulsion symptoms<br>  OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform.

FU4TyghIaa	No One.<br>  Having sexual thoughts and questions when you haven't been intimate with anybody is pretty normal.  Really for a straight guy to fantasize about sex with another guy is pretty normal too.  Male sex can be a rampant and indiscriminate urge.  <br>  <br>  Then, being in a relationship, like intimate with a person is a whole lot more than getting down to it.  There's other things that constitute attraction to a person.  It takes time, and meeting the right person in the right situation for you both to hit it off together.  <br>  <br>  So, just because you feel turned on, you don't feel attracted to them.  Like it might be hot to think about men sexually.  But to actually look at a man, think i like his face, his manly skin, his bristly chin?  Like girls have generally finer, softer feminine features.  They're softer smoother.  Men smell like men.  Women smell like women.  There's a whole lot about gender that is different.  That you ultimately are attracted to and want to be with.<br>  <br>  I suggest, not to let these sexual urges, or the feeling that you're at an age where you haven't had it yet and so you might feel bad.  Trying to force yourself into a situation, any situation (straight or gay) just to get it on.  <br>  <br>  Be patient with yourself, be kind to yourself.  <br>  Hope you can love yourself so that others may find you and love you for you as person as you should accept them.|`|eELS8zSRaa	It's normal for all males to go through this process, the best thing to do is to jump into a relationship with a girl and see what happens.

After a while, you will see which gender you enjoy the most...<br>  <br>  <br>  Have fun and remember that practice makes perfect.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	I think you are still confused about your sexuality , mainly because you haven't yet had a serious relationship . There is no need to tell anyone anyway , especially since you do not really know yourself . My advice is to have as wide a circle of friends as possible of both sexes and see if you do actually develop a relationship with anyone . I knew from around 13 I was gay , even if that word hadn't really been invented then , but like lots of gay guys I wanted to fit in with my friends and had some relationships with girls . However it was the occasional sexual activity with another guy that really satisfied me and made me accept that I was gay. That is what you should try and do   Good Luck.   By the way don't let anyone put any pressure on you to lose virginity for the sake of it , wait till you find someone you really feel attracted to and make it special|`|Mwhclezaaa	You sound bisexual at the moment.

Also, where on the body the odor is coming from, or is it all over the body in general? <br>  <br>  Could it be an infection? Bacterial or yeast? <br>  Is there a possibility of a tampon that has not been removed? <br>  Any other symptoms? <br>  <br>  Actually, we sweat, but the wetness evaporates quickly and therefore, we don't realize that we are sweating. Sweat is odorless, but when it comes in contact with bacteria or something else, an odor is produced.<br>   <br>  I would strongly suggest that she talks to her doctor about this. It must be very difficult for her, psychologically and socially. <br>  <br>  Check the website, emedicine, "Bromhidrosis", which may be helpful and "body odor" in Wikipedia for more information.  <br>  <br>  I truly hope that she is able to get this cleared up very soon !|`|AA12266052	Treatments and drugs<br>  If you're concerned about sweating and body odor, the solution may be simple: an over-the-counter (OTC) antiperspirant and deodorant.<br>      * Antiperspirant. Antiperspirants contain aluminium-based compounds that temporarily block the sweat pore, thereby reducing the amount of perspiration that reaches your skin.<br>      * Deodorant. Deodorants can eliminate odor but not perspiration. They're usually alcohol-based and turn your skin acidic, making it less attractive to bacteria. Deodorants often contain perfume fragrances intended to mask the odor of perspiration and are used on the hands and feet as well as the underarms.<br>  If over-the-counter antiperspirants don't help control your sweating, your doctor may prescribe aluminum chloride (Drysol, Xerac). For best results, apply the antiperspirant at night to the areas most prone to sweating. Prescription antiperspirants are strong solutions that can cause red, swollen and itchy skin. To prevent irritation, wash the medication off in the morning.

Myself, I am Bipolar, so this comes alone with being bipolar.  I have tried to shoot myself before and have thought of  it several times.  But thank God I didnt do it.  There is so much stress in the world tody that I suppect there will be more sucides because people are having a hard time handling the  issues in the world today.  I get depressed a lot because I dont go out and do anything,  I take care of my dad and I spend like 24/7 with him ( dont take me wrong, I am not complaining)  I love him dearly and when he passes ( if that is before me) I will have all these sweet memories of him.  But I dont make time for me  "me time" and sometimes that makes me depressed, but I would never let my dad know.  And it is very hard for me to have a relationship because I think he feels someone is going to take me away from him.  This I would never let happen.  I dont have any friends except my dad and he doesnt either except me.  I told him we need to make friends with others.  I remember once telling him "I dont have any friends" and his reply was "I thought I was your best friend"  I thought that was sweet.  I think sucide is a selfish act because look how many people you hurt.  Yes it may take away your pain, but look at the pain it will cause your family.  I think if anyone thinks of this they should talk to somone about it because talking to someone makes these feeling go away.  I am sorry my answer was so long.

Basically having the bodily fluids (blood and urine) to be in thier 'pure' state.  If youhave eaten recently before your cholesterol test, the blood level tested will be high, and therefore give  a false reading.

Sta i sprecando gli anni più belli della tua vita in quanto sono quelli producono allegria, giocosità, creatività, voglia di strafare, di coinvolgerti nell' esperienze più emozionanti, spingerti oltre i confini della sudditanza, delle paure. Per cui non capisco perché vuoi violentarti con questi pensieri precoci scompaginando il ritmo di una vita concepita all’ insegna “ vivi l’attimo fuggente”. Devi considerare che il futuro non è altro che la conseguenza di tutto ciò che semini nel presente per poi raccogliere i frutti di ciò che hai seminato. Tuttavia, e qui è d’ obbligo lavorarci sopra, devi crearti degli antidoti contro eventuali avversità della vita prodotti dai comportamenti altrui. Intendo dire che anche la persona più cara, quella ami alla follia,  ebbene  può ferirti come e quando vuole, perché è la sua personalità a corromperlo. Tu non puoi modificare niente, tranne quello di essere più selettiva quando scegli la persona con cui legarti, ma per il resto lascia fare alla tua capacità di sdrammatizzare sempre le avversità della vita. Piangersi addosso non modifica di una sola virgola le nostre responsabilità di scelte sbagliate. Oggi va di moda il “personaggio” , cioè una sorta di pulcinella che s’ inventa giorno per giorno come rimorchiare e incantare le sue vittime. Del resto tutto questo marasma è creato proprio da voi minorenni che già a 12-13-  anni vi concedete al cuor leggero senza rendervi conto quanto sia triste collezionare delusioni.   <br>  <br>  Pensierino di Smanettatore: < L’ uomo saggio comprende l’ uomo stolto, perché lui stesso fu un tempo una persona stolta.

ParFJxnSaa	It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. <br>  <br>  Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now".|`|46HhlH2Kaa	Sorry, I cant help you there because I do the same thing, so I will just keep an eye on your post and see if someone writes something that might be helpful to me also.  Take care..Debbie in Ky|`|JTI2Pmkaaa	all negative thoughts come from stress. Since stress is very unhealthy for both your mind and body (which are connected... :P) you should try to calm down. And I know that is not easy. Try to work with yourself and take care of yourself. Working out helps your body stay in normal hormonal balance and if you try it out I'm sure it will make you at least a little happier. Another thing you can do is try to think of let's say 2 things about yourself that you like and 2 things that happened during the day that you like and then write them down. <br>  Don't worry about what others think of you either! That's not important. I don't believe it is at least...:) <br>  Work on your selfesteem. Good things to know if you want to show others that you are sure about yourself is that you walk with straight back and shoulders, look people in the eyes, and show your palms. That makes one look confident :D|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	Write down all of your negative thoughts and when things don't turn out as negatively as you imagined, realize that thinking negative thoughts is a waste of time.

AA10849780	Woudn't recomend using tampons for nothing except your period. Tampons are great for periods, but even when your flow is rather mild, when you take it off it is rather abrasive to the internal wall of your vagina. And if you hurt that area, infections can occur and complicate matters even worse. I suggest using daily napkins, and if the discharge is rather cottage cheesy looking, go to the gyno because you may have some infection or problem down there.|`|18c40002e1865391a9f8fc19cf0792d8aa	No, you shouldn't, because you risk getting Toxic Shock Syndrome.

First of all, that stuff needs to come out of your body. If you have excessive discharge, you should go get checked for bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection...or something else. A little discharge is normal, but if you need a tampon, that sounds like a lot!<br>  <br>  Pantiliners can irritate the area and actually cause more vaginal discharge according to my OB GYN.|`|32281e2ace9430f52f82b98c0a3e738baa	NO!!!! only use tampons for your period|`|558b39af0f230a7328e9834879ac8c5aaa	No, well I guess you could, but you shouldn't. You could get TSS. Also, discharge uis meant to clean and clense the vagina and you putyting something in to stop it could be dangerous in other ways than TSS. <br>  You can if you want for swimming because discharge in a pool might sound gross, but I would not suggest it because it will really hurt when or if you take it out dry.|`|7f40a0efee482e94e2baa04fac426e33aa	no its not safe to use tampons for just vaginal discharge but you can use a panty liner or pad|`|98fdbd5cd1b814cad2a0336c5272ae4faa	If discharge is to the point where you are considering a tampon, then you need to go & see your doctor.

If you continue to be this way you can take medicine to help.  Although I take Wellburtin and Lexapro with Klopin for this. in the past I have realized that the best medicine is exercise.  I would walk five miles a day and I felt great and took very little medicine.  I wish I have someone who could help me get back to the walking so  can get off some of my meds.  My ex-husband says I am never happy with anything and he is right.  With these symptoms you might want to talk to a doctor and get help because if mental illness (bipolar) is not taken care of in someway, it will lead to a person being suicidal because this is what happened to me.  I wish you the best of luck.  Debbie in KY

It is indigenous to the rainforests of the Amazon and other tropical areas throughout the world, including the Bahamas, southern India, and China. P. niruri is quite prevalent in the Amazon and other wet rainforests, growing and spreading freely (much like a weed). P. amarus and P. sellowianus are closely related to P. niruri in appearance, phytochemical structure, and history of use, but typically are found in the drier tropical climates of India, Brazil, and even Florida and Texas.<br>  <br>  The Phyllanthus genus contains over 600 species of shrubs, trees, and annual or biennial herbs distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of both hemispheres. Unfortunately, there remains a great deal of confusion among scientists regarding plant identification and, in many cases, plant misidentification makes evaluation of published information difficult. P. amarus (Thonn. & Schum) and P. sellowianus are often considered a variety of P. niruri, or no distinction is made among these three species in published clinical research. Oftentimes one name is indicated to be synonymous with another and, sometimes, both names are used interchangeably as if referring to one plant. It became so confusing that, in the 1990s, a major reorganization of the Phyllanthus genus was conducted (which classified P. amarus as a type of P. niruri).<br>  <br>  TRIBAL AND HERBAL MEDICINE USES<br>  <br>  The Spanish name of the plant, chanca piedra, means “stone breaker” or “shatter stone.” It was named for its effective use to generations of Amazonian indigenous peoples in eliminating gallstones and kidney stones. In Brazil, the plant is known as quebra-pedra or arranca-pedras (which also translates to “break-stone”). In addition to kidney stones, the plant is employed in the Amazon for numerous other conditions by the indigenous peoples, including colic, diabetes, malaria, dysentery, fever, flu, tumors, jaundice, vaginitis, gonorrhea, and dyspepsia. Based on its long documented history of use in the region, the plant is generally employed to reduce pain, expel intestinal gas, to stimulate and promote digestion, to expel worms, as a mild laxative.<br>  <br>  Chanca piedra has a long history in herbal medicine systems in every tropical country where it grows. For the most part, it is employed for similar conditions worldwide. Its main uses are for many types of biliary and urinary conditions including kidney and gallbladder stones; for hepatitis, colds, flu, tuberculosis, and other viral infections; liver diseases and disorders including anemia, jaundice and liver cancer; and for bacterial infections such as cystitis, prostatitis, venereal diseases and urinary tract infections. It is also widely employed for diabetes and hypertension as well as for its diuretic, pain-relieving, digestive stimulant, antispasmodic, fever reducing, and cellular protective properties in many other conditions. <br>  <br>  Try to get this Plant. Grind it to a paste make a ball of 50 grams and boil it in a glass of water for 5 minutes. Have it in empty stomach in the morning and before u go to sleep. This Plant is Used for more than 5000 years in Ayurveda for the cure of Liver. its better than Allopathy and will get cured 100%.|`|ls9m9LSIaa	I'm sorry to hear that, i hope there is a cure|`|YtpN4YXIaa	:-(<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear that.  I think the treatment of chronic hepatitis B is palliative, however, i am not 100% sure about it.  I would strongly recommend you to consult a liver specialist ASAP.|`|PkXJRfaBaa	Yes there is a cure. Although none of the available drugs can clear the infection, they can stop the virus from replicating, and minimize liver damage such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Currently, there are seven medications licensed for treatment of hepatitis B infection in the United States.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and I hope she gets better.

In about a week I took another test and it came back with a clear not so faint line. Than I went to my dr and he confirmed I am pregnant so you are probably pregnant. I would go to a womens clinic or the health department and see if you can do one there for free and she what that says.|`|Uh2x306Caa	You're probably negative.  Wait for your period to come on now.

I like the variety of flavours offered.<br>  <br>  i start my day out drinking coffee (usually a whole pot myself before days over). after lunch is when i usually start in  on the tea.<br>  <br>  provided you watch (which by the sounds of it you are), your caffeine intake, i don't see that drinking all that tea is harmful<br>  <br>  well, maybe other than ALL the pee ing you gotta do<br>  :):)|`|hQMiSlvMaa	I drink a lot of tea as well, but not near as you.

12ALGqtdaa	I feel your pain... I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease (Coeliac disease in the UK) when I was 10 and the pain from it is very very intense. I know that they said one test said you had it and one didn't but I would really suggest that you try a Gluten Free diet (meaning a wheat, oat, barley, and rye and all it's derivatives free diet) and see if that doesn't help. Your symptoms sound identical to Celiac Disease.<br>  <br>  Also you may try cutting out corn and soy as people with Celiac  Disease can have major sensitivities to those grains. Another thing that can help are probiotics (like in yogurt, but I would recommend that you get them in capsule form as they are more natural). <br>  <br>  I hope you feel better very soon...|`|mh0QRDE9aa	I am not happy with the comments your doctor made to you.  You may need to go to another doctor.  Maybe a gastrologist or a hospital that specializes in stomach digestive orders.  Did the doctor do a colonscopy or endoscope?  I feel another doctor is in order, since you are not getting any better with the doctor you have now.|`|AA10661392	Talk to a doctor, a real MD, not people on the Internet.|`|PGkR813Jaa	You need to get the Doctor who sees you next, to write a referral to a Gastroenterologist for a Gastroscopy.<br>  <br>  With the Domperidone giving you some relief and your symptoms, i would hazard a guess that you are suffering from a very often misdiagnosed condition called Gastroparesis.<br>  <br>  I also have this condition and your symptoms match mine to a tee. Except i get nausea and vomiting as well to anything sweet.|`|f5cfa5b32bcffac3b4de6dd36954a8baaa	Obviously something is wrong with you. From my personal experience Doctors in the UK at least know very little more than you do! <br>  What I do know from personal experience is that our health is very much affected by our state of mind, so much so that some people have apparently beaten terminal diagnoses simply using their mind.<br>  I can personally attest to being able to "choose to ignore" quite severe pain.<br>  I therefore suggest that while continuing to try the conventional path you at least look at alternative and 'mental' cures - after all throughout history people have attested to the power of prayer in the curing of illness (or dis-ease).<br>  Be well!
M63kq3AYaa	Depends on when he starts really and how well and hard he trains (not to mention any injuries he'll have to deal with along the way). If he's been doing a lot of running at primary school (between 5 and 12 years old) he'll probably peak at around 18-25, but if he's later he'll probably peak older, but not as well as he could have if he started younger.|`|4uike3ARaa	The longer distances belong to older runners, by and large. You won't peak until you're in your twenties, but as long as you stay seriously in training, that peak can last 10 or more years.<br>  Sprinters peak earlier. 18-24.<br>  But every body's different.|`|eELS8zSRaa	After puberty... so around 24 years old. Depends on how much you run now, email me how much you run... etc. Along with your age. For track I assume?

Just take some extra pads/tampons with you so you can change.

mGEwdQyvaa	Well, here are some things my boyfriend and I use/will soon be using in our home. We are both blind and live entirely independently.<br>  <br>  -Braille paper<br>  -Braille label maker<br>  -Braille printer (for school things. We're both in college)<br>  -Our laptops are running Text to Speech software which you can sample at freedomscientific.com. It's called JAWS and it's very commonly used by blind people, especially those in college. <br>  -Our clothes have tiny buttons sewn on the inside so that we can feel whether something is neutral and matches with everything or is not neutral and therefore only matches with certain things. Not all blind people do this though.<br>  -Our microwave has adhesive bumps stuck onto the buttons so we know where the numbers and certain settings are located.<br>  -Our oven has bumps on the high, low, and medium heat settings so we know where to turn the knob to, and a few of the temp settings so we have a point of reference when determining where 350 degrees or what ever is. <br>  -Our washer and dryer are also marked with adhesive bumps. <br>  -We keep plastic baskets in our pantry to sort canned foods. One basket holds vegetables, one for fruits, and one for things like soups or spaghetti o's or other quick and easy things.<br>  -We have a scanner that we use to scan our mail or directions on frozen food packages or new electronics or anything we need to read. We scan the directions and use software on our computer to hear what they say. <br>  -We do not use canes or any mobility aids in our home because hell, we live here. We know our way around. We keep our canes leaning against the wall by the door, or occasionally hanging from a hook by the door. <br>  -We don't have a house phone at the moment, but our cell phones have text-to-speech software like the kind we use on our computers. It's called Nuance Talks and you should be able to google it. <br>  -We do most of our reading via e-books on the computer, but we do own some braille books and books on tape that would be kept on a book shelf like in any other household. <br>  -We each have a slate and stylus which is like the blind person's pen and paper. Google "slate and stylus" to see what one looks like. <br>  -Specifically, our canes are long, white NFB canes. They do not have red tips, nor do they fold. We do not believe in using these types of canes as we feel they are more inefficient and not meant to promote independence. <br>  -We still have a TV in the livingroom and bedroom and we still watch movies and have a nice collection of them in fact. We just listen to them. <br>  -We keep one of those frosting squeezer things on our toothpaste tube to make it easier to squeeze every last bit out, but this isn't really a blindness thing. Just something we think everyone should do with the economy the way it is. <br>  -We have a talking alarm clock. It announces the time when you press a button, and it speaks settings aloud so we can set it and adjust the alarm without assistance. <br>  -We use a double spatula when cooking on the stove top as it makes it a lot easier to flip things without worrying about missing the pan. <br>  -We have a tactile measuring pitcher. There are ridges on the inside that mark the intervals on a normal measuring pitcher. We just make sure our hands are clean and feel where the liquid stops to measure it.<br>  -We have a set of adjustable measuring cups/spoons. You move a sort of blocker to make the "cup" larger or smaller, and it clicks at one cup, half cup, third cup, etc. <br>  <br>  Other than that, I can't really think of anything in our home that isn't just like anyone else's home. We don't label our foods. We know what we went shopping for and we know that frozen chicken feels like frozen chicken and a bottle of ketchup feels (and smells) like ketchup. We cook and clean for ourselves and we know what products to use for this as well, though I imagine some might mark them. We keep our backpacks near the door as well though since when we do run quick errands (going out to grab milk or something) it's a lot easier to carry things in a backpack since we need at least one hand free to use our canes and like to have the other free as well for opening doors and things. Other than that, I can say that we (should) keep our home very well organized... We always (usually) put things back where we found them so we're less likely to lose things or misplace things and so things are easier to locate the next time. This is especially true in our bathroom/medicine cabinet as it's a bit of a nasty shock to reach for toothpaste and get hand lotion instead (well, I wouldn't know, but I imagine it's a shock). Some other small details may be that we fold our money a certain way so we can tell one's from fives, tens, and twenties, and we keep bank cards and such in specific pockets in our wallets so we can find them quickly and easily. <br>  <br>  Does your character have children? If so, there is a lot more that she will likely be using in her home. I know many blind couples who raise kids independently, so i
b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	If you actually sprained your ankle, then no you won't be able to walk on it.  It's going to take a while.  You won't be able to walk completely normal for probably at least 3 weeks or so.  It will slowly get better and you'll be able to walk a little bit before then, but it will take a long time for it to heal completely.  <br>  <br>  It's going to hurt really bad tomorrow.  In fact, the next 2 or 3 days will be the worst.  Be ready for that.  Put ice on your ankle (15 minutes on, then take the ice off for a while, then put it back on.  Don't leave ice on for too long, just long enough to reduce swelling and pain.)  Just lay down or sit with your ankle elevated and avoid walking.  Take ibuprofen for pain.  <br>  <br>  The first few days are the worst.  If you put any weight on your foot or turn your foot left or right, your ankle will hurt like crazy.  So just try to sit still and avoid walking.  Depending on how bad the sprain is, you might be able to put a little bit of weight on it after 4 or 5 days, but it's going to be sore for a while.  Just take it easy.<br>  <br>  You probably just twisted your ankle or have a minor sprain, if you can actually walk on it.  I doubt your broke it, but it would still be a good idea to go to a doctor just to be sure.<br>  <br>  It's going to hurt like hell for a few days...be ready for that :(|`|F69WYrtBaa	No, the likeliness of you being able to walk tomorrow, (without a limp) is slim to none.<br>  It's most likely going to be very painful to even touch your foot tomorrow.<br>  <br>  I broke my four toes on my 12th Birthday, the day after I broke it, the pain was un-bearable. <br>  <br>  I would recommend going to a doctor, (if not already) - placing ice on your ankle, getting lots of rest and sleep.
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|qQKOAdSjaa	There is no easy way. I have been athletic my entire life, play 15 hours a week of tennis from age 13-15 and I didn't have a six pack. You need to dedicate approx 24 hours over the course of 6 weeks to build up the abs and an additional 50 hours of cardio to burn any subcutaneous fat covering over your abs. You should be able to get a 4 pack really easily, but nobody gives a **** about those. So you need to work really hard to get the six pack. Crunches are good for beginners but eventually you need to do serious exercises.|`|VSw6eN4Baa	purple
JghXh9dQaa	i had mine done 3 weeks ago, so far iv had no problems,& my friend had it done 5 years ago,  you dont say how old she is, im 38 & had mine done due to breast feeding 3 kids it had left me with one side alot smaller & emptyer id wanted mine done for along time but waited till i knew i didnt want any more kids. silicone is so much safer now & more natural looking & feeling.you do get more of a unnatural look & rippling with saline, BUT as a mother i would not let my girls have it done until they were definatly mature enough to know whats best & also that they have reached an age where there body have got no more growing to do, 18 may be adult age but there not always mentaly grown up by that age. im torn with this because i know how much more confidant i feel, mentally & physically, problems with your body image can cause massive problems, i dont agree with them just for vanity or getting that job, i saw a therapst for 18 mths before i had it done. only get it done for the right reasons, reasearch surgeons & if she is young [ late teens or even early twentys] try to convince her to see if she feels the same in a year or two, but mother to mother  im doing great & had no problems. good luck|`|iGxVGuitaa	dont let here!!!! she is letting her body being ripped open and then something artificial put inside her.  and she wont be able to breast feed which is important to new born baby as can only get proper nutrients this way.|`|p6UCpPrxaa	I don't have personal experience but a friend of mine has had them they cost her ￡3000 she went from a size A to a size C she was proud of them to begin with but now she complains that her veins in her breast stick out like varicose veins she says there blue purple and horrible and she has also lost the feeling in her nipples I wanted to have them from being 18yrs old I'm 32 now but after hearing  my friends complaints I've been completely put of so I would really think hard about what could happen after there done because there maybe no way of going back. hope this helps.|`|WVNMnvXLaa	i think she should it will give me somthing to look at

If you would like to be able to hold reasonable weights for longer periods of time then you want to be doing more continuous training when you do more repetitions over a longer period of time. e.g. 10mins of continuous push ups at your own pace, short break, and another 10mins. Also try holding smaller weights (or baked beans cans) out for as long as possible horizontally, then rest, then again.  but don't over do it =P. If you would like to be able to lift heavier weights at once then start stop training is the way to go.  Try doing as many push ups as possible in 2mins, 20minute rest then another 2mins as fast as possible... plus find something around the house that fits in your hand but is weighty. Use this for bicep curls where the palm faces upwards and the weight is brought into the upper arm (bicep). After finding your starting point the only way to go is up. keep increasing your variables. eg. how long u hold the weights, how much time for repititions. Hope this helps!

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	i. Eat more calories<br>  <br>  This involves some calculation. The approximate normal daily caloric requirement for an average male who performs light activity is 2,200; for a female, it is 1,900.You need to eat around 1,000 extra calories per day to gain less than half a kilo a week.<br>  <br>  Do the math. Eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day.<br>  <br>  Your actual caloric requirement can differ depending on your height, weight, activity level and your body's metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  ii. Make smart choices<br>  <br>  For example, choose dairy products, Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca.<br>  <br>  *<br>  One hour spinning = perfect body<br>  <br>  iii. Protein is important<br>  <br>  Increase your protein intake. Your body needs a lot of protein to build new muscle. But since most of the calories for weight gain comes from carbohydrates and fats, do not replace them with protein.<br>  <br>  iv. Snack a lot<br>  <br>  Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars.<br>  <br>  *<br>  healthy Ayurvedic mantras<br>  <br>  v. Fluids help too<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories; milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks are good examples.<br>  <br>  vi. Intensify workouts<br>  <br>  Aerobics are great, right? Not for weight gain!<br>  <br>  You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Is walking better than running?<br>  <br>  vii. Weights are the way to go<br>  <br>  Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbells, not fancy gym machines.<br>  <br>  Free weights put the most stress on muscles and stimulate the maximum number of muscle fibres.<br>  <br>  The best weight training exercises for building muscle mass are free weight exercises like squats, dead lifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips.<br>  <br>  These exercises are best done under supervision, but they don't need machinery.<br>  <br>  viii. Space out your workouts<br>  <br>  If you have a high basic metabolic rate -- which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest -- you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Are carbs bad for you?<br>  <br>  ix. Creatine?<br>  <br>  Creatine supplements can help some athletes gain weight. It is not known if it is because it gives them spurts of energy or because it adds water weight.<br>  <br>  More research is needed in this area before Creatine becomes that magic pill. Creatine supplements are available at all major health food stores, but do not take it without consulting your doctor.<br>  <br>  x. Be consistent<br>  <br>  It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results.<br>  <br>  Your body will only responds to a consistent schedule. No weight gain programme will work for you if you are not regular.<br>  <br>  Heredity does pay a major role in determining your weight. Effective weight training and a smart diet can help you exceed your genetically predetermined weight.

You get tired really easily and quickly after OHS (open heart surgery).  She will have some pills to take and her chest will ache a bit and she mau have difficulty sleeping for a little while too.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.

S5H0NmEWaa	The most likely problem is that you aren't breathing properly. It's difficult to do so when you're speaking, partly through nerves and partly through the impracticalities of breathing normally at the same time as projecting your voice. Take your time, practice doing the speech, stand up straight, slow yourself down and pause for drinks of water and to take a few breaths every now and again. Any sort of voice/breathing training would be useful too.|`|fPMMeufiaa	In speaking, obviously you open your mouth to say the utterly words.<br>  <br>  In this speaking you inhale with your nose or mouth then, say the words again isn't it.<br>  <br>  When you inhale, OXYGEN is utilized by your body.<br>  <br>  You feel dizziness by the process of increase carbon dioxide that you exhale than the oxygen that you inhale.<br>  <br>  <br>  The compensation of inspiration is, the increase CARBON DIOXIDE in your system, so auto regulatory process that you are allowed to inspire OXYGEN to get rid of the CARBON DIOXIDE.<br>  <br>  <br>  For your information, CARBON DIOXIDE in nature is a volatile acid.<br>  <br>  IF you know the acid-base balances.<br>  <br>  The effects of acid is dizziness, increase breathing, blurred vision, weakness.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You can fixed this by rebreath your breath using your palm.

GQZDcfUiaa	Having braces put on hurts. For the first week or so they may give you blisters all around in your mouth where the are rubbing (some orthodontists will give you wax to cover them, it helps a little). <br>  For the first few days eating will be awkward.

oFtwiquCaa	yes it does but you should go to the Dr to make shore it is not your heart|`|ParFJxnSaa	Yes. Limit "worrying time" to around 45 mns, daily, possibly when you get home, or after your evening meal, but not too close to bedtime) after which, resolve firmly to refuse to worry again on that day: realise and accept that to do otherwise would be counterproductive to your mental health, and enjoyment of life. You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is a version for use in public places, (you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> refers: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Or Google: "neurofeedback; therapists" Herbal remedies, such as chamomile, passionflower, or St. John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect.|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	Yes indeed.

A quick fix is bananas!!!<br>  We need sugar in the form of fructose, and potassium, which is one of the things you lose lots of when you drink. Bananas are also a natural antacid to help with the nausea, and are high in magnesium which can help relax those pounding blood vessels causing that hangover headache. As a non chocoholic, my best cure is a peanut butter, honey and banana sandwich on white bread with a glass of orange juice for the Vit C <br>  And for the chocoholics, put back the sugar now - try a chocolate milk with all the bits n bobs (mini marshmallows). I find that chocolate milk offers the tummy a soothing coating for the nausea. It also repletes some of the vitamins your body is now  lacking. The sugars (lactose & sucrose) and salt seem to be the perfect balance of the carb:salt fix.

12ALGqtdaa	You can try the baking soda but I would more recommend that you use hydrogen peroxide and baking soda together. Take a dry toothbrush and pour the hydrogen peroxide into the cap from the bottle. Then pour about a teaspoon of baking soda into your hand (make sure your hand is clean). Take the toothbrush and dip the bristles into the cap of the hydrogen peroxide, then dip the brush into the baking soda and brush your teeth gently and only for a few seconds. In essence, the hydrogen peroxide will disinfect your gums and the baking soda will as well... These combined will also whiten your teeth naturally, though I'm sure that's not why you're asking this question but it's a fun fact for you.

One example is Minamata disease, which is caused by organic mercury compounds.<br>  Bad air quality can kill. Ozone pollution can cause sore throats, inflammation, chest pain and congestion. Oil spills can cause skin irritations and rashes.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|Q5PwNDHXaa	guys tend to lose weight faster than girls so i imagine that's very possible for you, but i also agree with the answer above. best of luck!
FMuCItoeaa	Garlic-like odor can be because of medications such as disulfiram (given to some alcohol abusers as a deterrent to drinking),  certain drugs (eg, penicillin, bromides),  or supplements (selenium). <br>  <br>  It could be due to chronic arsenic poisoning, exposure to Tellurium, Diethyltelluride or DMSO. <br>  <br>  It could be because of foods, including garlic, onion, curry.<br>  It could originate from a metabolic disorder.  <br>  <br>  Liver diseases are usually associated with ammonia or "fishy" smells.

God bless you for sticking with your husband for the last 15 years and through these difficult times.

I don't care if he says he is 'regular'.  The other issue when someone has excess odor is yeast/candida (bacteria) running through the body.  Alcohol is known to be a contributor as well as sweets and even diet pop...so sounds as if he has a double whammy going.  To combat yeast there's acidophilus at health food stores...(best kind is found in refridgerated section) also very basic foods such as yogurt, specifically that 'activa' brand...has small amounts of acidophilus in it.  I also recommend the herb "olive leaf' also health food stores...good stuff for yeast and helps the immune system too.<br>  <br>  I hope you go to al-anon to deal with the drinking and worrying.  Normal under the circumstances, of course...but you have to take care of you too.  Good luck!

U0vlOvrRaa	Its really sad to know your condition and to see your efforts going fruitless! its because, each person's bodily requirements are different. Please go to the dietitian. Take an advise on what exactly you need to do. I am sure, you will get a right advice.|`|KRyY1rRUaa	Weight loss and gain are a function of how many calories you eat and how many you use.  IF you are gaining weight you are eating more than you are losing.  <br>  <br>  Metabolism plays a part, exercise can help.  Does your cross country trainer give you muscle strength or resistance training?  Building muscle will help you to maintain a higher metabolism and to lose more weight.<br>  <br>  If you are going to diet you should be sure to get a well round nutritious diet.  Whole Grain Carbs, Lean Protein, a number of servings of  Fruit and Vegtables, "good" fats, and dairy.<br>  <br>  But if you are gaining weight, you are taking in more energy than you are using up...there is no way around it.

The first is always the worst as there is the fear of the unknown.<br>  <br>  You can't do anything to reduce the discharge on your own, but you should mention it to the nurse who may which to take a bacteriology swab at the same time as the smear, this will not cause any additional discomfort.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Doctors and Nurses see naked body parts all day every day. There is no need to be embarrassed. Almost all women of reproductive age get discharge. This is quite common and normal. There is nothing you can do to reduce discharge.<br>  <br>  As Dr Frank has already said, it might be a good idea if you ask the Nurse to take a high vaginal swab for bacteriology at the same time. Normal physiological discharge is white or clear with a non offesnive smell. <br>  <br>  Most women describe smear tests as being uncomfortable rather than painful. A smear test basically involves a Dr or Nurse using a speculum (an instrument that is inserted into the vagina, which opens to view the cervix) to collect a sample of cells from the lining of the cervix- this is done using a plastic spatula or brush. The cell sample is then sent away to the lab to be looked at under a microscope. The aim of the test is to detect abnormal/precancerous cells. The idea is that if precancerous cells are present, treatment can be given before the cells turn into cancer.|`|2oPTgm9baa	It doesnt hurt but it is slightly uncomfortable, you just need to relax and it'll be easy.

d6f3f16a24596ee000a34bde13aec73caa	I know you've heard it before, but stop smoking. Now.  <br>  <br>  That said, you should see a doctor, and realize that a pediatrician is more familiar with developmental issues and diseases in children in general.  I was 21 and in the pediatric ward when I lacerated my cornea and let me tell you I was glad to be there.  Apparently 21 is the oldest you can be and still go to pediatrics, and they put me there because the nurses actually check in on you more often and tend to be gentler, which was important for me because I had a bad injury to my eye.  <br>  <br>  In contrast, when my brother was in the hospital with gangrene, it took  FOREVER to get any help.  He was 34 and in the adult ward, and they just did not respond quickly EVER!  Most of the time the person who would respond was not a nurse, and we had to wait AGAIN for him to get help, because the orderly is only allowed to do so much.<br>  <br>  Ok, enough about me.  I'll admit I don't know jack about Cat Scratch Fever, but I do know that waiting doesn't help anything.  If you wait, then go to a doctor with no clue, you might not have time to find one that does before it gets really bad.  If you start taking care of it now, there will be more time to find a specialist that can help you.<br>  <br>  As for your symptoms, they can be lots of stuff.  Consider that you might have  several ailments presenting at the same time, like a lingering bacterial infection that never goes away AND a hormone imbalance.  If your mucus is green, that means infection, and believe it or not, you can be getting the same cold over and over, that is, you are never getting rid of it all the way and it comes back.  And smokers get bronchitis a lot more often than non-smokers.  <br>  <br>  It could also be a vitamin deficiency reducing your resistance, so when you go to the doctor you should get a complete physical, not just a treatment of your symptoms.  Talk to them about really wanting to know what's going on, and ask them to do complete bloodwork, check for hormones, nutrient levels, heavy metals, cholesterol, allergies, etc. The best thing you can to find out what is wrong and beat it, is to keep a good diary of your symptoms, starting with when you first started feeling sick and continuing through present day.  Make it as accurate as possible.  Write down EVERYTHING you eat EVERYDAY.  Also note if any new symptoms occur, if and when your existing symptoms lessen and worsen.  And keep track of your general mood, how awake you feel, what times you feel more awake or less awake throughout the day, and how much sleep you are getting.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds like a lot of work, but after you get used to it, it should really only take ten or twenty minuets a day, and it will help you and your doctor work as a detective team to find the real root of the problem(s)<br>  <br>  Good luck, and let me know how you do.|`|AA10555568	Cat Scratch Fever is a one time thing-once it's cleared up it doesn't come back,it is caused by a scratch from a cat, or a splinter of wood, or a thorn.It is normally a blister or abscess.None of the symptoms you describe are anyway related to it.From the way you describe your self and your habits ,I would guess you don't eat healthy and don't take vitamins.Hand washing and keeping your hands away from your face will help not get so many colds.Your white bumps are part of adolescence and will go  away.I don't think a doctor can do much except tell you to eat better,get enough rest, exercise and quit smoking.

It was previously once thought that Pill-users had an increased risk of developing breast and certain other cancers, however a recent report produced by the Royal College of General Practitioners showed that Pill-users have a 12% REDUCTION in their risk of developing cancer. The report also found that breast cancer rates were the same in women who have used the Pill, and women who haven’t. <br>  <br>  Whilst some studies show that the combined pill increases the risk of certain cancers (I think liver and cervix), it actually protects against and reduces the risk of other cancers such as ovarian cancer, uterine cancer and cancer of the colon. Therefore there is no justification for you to stop taking the pill.<br>  <br>  I just found this link below from the Cancer Research website,- it does not quote the resent study which has shown that breast cancer rates are roughly the same in Pill-users and non Pill-users, however it does state that; "the Pill can also protect against some cancers.

A certain level of stress is unavoidable, in modern society, so it is a good idea to develop effective coping methods. Light to moderate daily exercise helps fight stress. For some people, it helps to visualise a quiet, relaxing scene (imagine, as vividly as you can, that you are on a tropical beach, reclining comfortably; you luxuriate, as the the sun warms you, and a gentle breeze caresses your skin lightly, inhaling the tangy, sea scented, salt laden spray from the sparkling, translucent, aqua waves, crashing on the white, coral beach sand, and feeling the hot sand slip through your fingers in one hand, sipping your favorite drink with the other; all the while, the seagulls call, swoop and cavort playfully overhead in a cloudless, azure sky: you feel just like one of them, free to soar and cartwheel, or just glide in the moist, heavy air, and that this moment will last forever ... ). <br>  <br>  Options: Try: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat...</a>  & <a href="http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio.asp?f=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio...</a> & <a href="http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditation-content/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditat...</a> & <a href="http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hypnosistreatment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hyp...</a>  Relaxation Hypnosis  & www.meditainment.com/stress-buster/ Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. The supplement DHEA is thought to counter the stress hormone, Cortisol. Ginseng & Lady's Slipper are recommended herbal remedies: see section 55, at ezy build, below. Practise daily, one of the relaxation techniques in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i; whichever works best for you, but the mindfulness breathing for 15 - 20 mns is ideal, although the progressive muscle relaxation can be learned quickly, and takes only several minutes, if pressed for time.

Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o refer. "Even though I sometimes suffer from stress, I deeply and completely accept myself".

htBHCNDtaa	Ok - the bumps after shaving are normal, that's why waxing is better.<br>  <br>  As for the itching and burning BEFORE shaving sounds like a mild case of thrush. This is normal for women - all you need to do is go to the pharmacy and ask for some 'canesten cream' which you should apply to the area.<br>  The paper inside the box will explain better.|`|AA11777322	if you had crabs you would have seen little blood spots before you shaved.  and you would actually see them when you shaved off your pubic hair.

Left untreated, they can cause blood poisoning, loss of a kidney, or perhaps even death. Unless you regularly suffer from kidney infections, most people don't recognize the symptoms or think the symptoms are another disease.<br>  <br>  Here are some warning signs of a kidney infection:<br>  <br>  -- burning during urination. This is also a good sign of a UTI (and untreated Urinary Tract Infections can lead to kidney infections). Don't confuse the burning with the itching/burning of a yeast infection. This burning is painful and will sometimes bring tears to your eyes.<br>  <br>  -- a pain in the lower back, right around the waist. It could feel like a dull ache. It could be a sharp stabbing pain. It could feel like someone punching you repeatedly. Any pain concentrated to that small corner of the lower back could indicate kidney trouble.<br>  <br>  -- fatigue. For people who get frequent kidney infections, the number one sign is the fatigue, which can hit suddenly. You'll be fine, no other symptoms to speak of, then, boom, you are so exhausted that it becomes a struggle to keep your eyes open. It takes every bit of energy you can muster to keep from slumping in your chair.<br>  <br>  -- fever. Usually a low-grade fever goes along with a kidney infection in the early stages. If the infection goes untreated, the fever will rise.<br>  <br>  If you have any of these symptoms, call the doctor immediately. Doctors don't fool around with possible kidney infection. Ask to speak to a nurse about your symptoms, and the nurse because the nurse will probably arrange for you to be seen as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do have a kidney infection, the doctor will most likely prescribe a sulfa drug, which is most effective. However, a good number of people develop allergies to sulfa drugs (even if you've been using them for years). If you develop hives or other side effects, call your doctor immediately! For those allergic to sulfa drugs, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics. There are also some new drugs on the market to help prevent UTIs in people who are prone to them.<br>  <br>  How can you prevent a kidney infection? Many recommend drinking cranberry juice regularly. Ask the doctor for a definitive opinion on that. But all doctors will recommend lots and lots of liquids daily. A minimum of 8 glasses of water is a must.<br>  <br>  If you should end up with a kidney infection, remember that, no matter how you feel, you are seriously ill. As several nurses and doctors have said, "This is not something to fool around with." Take the time to rest and drink lots of liquids. Also, don't expect to recover within a day or two. Even the most mild kidney infection takes about two weeks for a full recovery. A severe infection takes months. Allow your body to recover fully before resuming strenuous activities.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	It does sound like a UTI, drink plenty of fluids, it really need not be cranberry juice which does not help current infections, but marginally reduces the risk of recurrences. Contact your GP who will prescribe an antibiotic, which is ALWAYS indicated in UTI. He may ask for a sample first.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	pelvis pain could be caused by various reasons, not just water poision. hmmm, if you have a water comtamination you need to call local authority to fix that, and it has to be fixed. the government knows that since they dont wanna create social unrest.<br>  <br>  meanwhile, go to see a doc.

X9QOHRLFaa	VLCC is a big scam company i wasted over Rs 12000, on one so their weight loss program, their service is crap. The oil that you are referring to which is suppose to reduce the body cellulite lol , its a total joke it wouldnt make any different in your body fat percentage. Ys their is side effect, which is waste or money and time. I tried it cause i was desperately looking for help, hence i got scammed i hope you are gonna be better informed then i was   .Sadly my friend the only way to loose weight successfully and permanently is to workout and eat healthy. well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.<br>  <br>  www.xattack.in

Was there something you once wanted to do but you got the message from somewhere that you didn't have the gas to get it done?<br>  <br>  Whatever it was take it out and turn it round and round in your mind.  Dust it off and look at it from all sides.  Polish it up.  Just do this once a day for a week or two.  You will begin to notice other ideas coming about it.  Act on them.  It doesn't matter how small the ideas are or how small the actions but begin to act on them.<br>  <br>  Every night as you fall asleep muse over this idea.  If you are sedating yourself with TV to fall asleep stop, tune into your own channel and make this dream whatever you'd like it can become as big as you make it.  <br>  <br>  Now the crazy part, your dreams will become your reality if you start taking these small steps.  <br>  <br>  This process is based on something called the law of attraction and it is working in your life right now, you are just not attracting the things you want.

9PChI0Bxaa	Most men who get HPV (of any type) never develop any symptoms or health problems. But some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types can cause penile cancer or anal cancer. The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types that can cause penile or anal cancer.Anal cancer is not the same as colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is more common than anal cancer, but it is not caused by HPV.<br>  There is no treatment or cure for HPV. But there are ways to treat the health problems caused by HPV in men.<br>  <br>  Genital warts can be treated with medicine, removed (surgery), or frozen off. Some of these treatments involve a visit to the doctor. Others can be done at home by the patient himself. No one treatment is better than another. But warts often come back within a few months after treatment—so several treatments may be needed.  Treating genital warts may not necessarily lower a man’s chances of passing HPV on to his sex partner. Because of this, some men choose not to treat genital warts. If they are not treated, genital warts may go away on their own, stay the same, or grow (in size or number). They will not turn into cancer or threaten your health. <br>  <br>  Penile and anal cancers can be treated with new forms of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Often, two or more of these treatments are used together. Patients should decide with their doctors which treatments are best for them.|`|gu1A1arKaa	70 million are afflicted with STDs in the U.S. alone and an estimated 200-400 million worldwide. <br>  <br>  According to the report from  ___<a href="http://www.stdchatting.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stdchatting.com</a>  ___, the new subscribers have increased 42% over 2007.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|igiCJuF9aa	60 min cardio and  30-60 min of weights, followed by a good 15 min full body stretch after (hold each stretch for 30 seconds)   you need cardio to burn fat, you need weights to build lean muscle which will help you burn fat, you need to stretch to become flexible and reduce soreness, also half of the game is propper diet. eat healthy, get all the correct food groups in and amounts in.   the more often you workout , the better, i'd say 6 days a week if you want to lose body weight FAST.  if you are doing 60 min of cardio, switch it up, take all the cardi machines in your gym (lets say there are 5 of them) do 12 min on each, one after the other, each one works you a different way and will keep you from getting bored. do not take a break inbetween unless its for water or to go to the bathroom.   JUST KEEP IT UP, DO THIS DAILY if you can and the weight iwll come off. if in the 1st couple weeks you see your weight fluctuate (even go up some days) dont worry, your body is just getting used to your new lifestyle. the important thing is that you DO IT and that you KEEP IT UP. good luck huni, we're all in this together.|`|XCzFEpvlaa	u must be stubborn and fight whit it!!<br>  find something in sports .... or walking anything just cancel TV, COMPUTER, FAST FOOD itd. :D <br>  <br>  and u will be fit ! cu|`|Qq2so2H7aa	Eat cheese

FU4TyghIaa	I am diagnosed with epilepsy for many many years now.<br>  I have full tonic clonic seizures where you thrash around and lose control of your body and stuff.  It is controlled successfully with medication at the moment.<br>  I tell ya, it's weird, cause the common thought by stupid people is that while you're doing the dance down there on the street and slapping the pavement or whatever, you're right out of it.  <br>  Most times i think back about it i think i was.  <br>  But that last seizure i had, like it went on for five minutes at least, and i was thrashing around and whatever.  The weird thing i was conscious.  I was even trying to stop the spasms from happening, but i couldn't.  No control at all, but i was awake, if a little hazy.<br>  This isn't consistent one way or the other for me.  Conscious during seizure, (epileptic) i would say, maybe yes maybe no.<br>  Hope for his peace that he was unconscious, cause to drown like that and not be able to stop it, how absolutely horrible.<br>  <br>  Oh and the guy that says 100% unconscious, haha, he believes in god right?

ZEJwrCo5aa	that's not ''normal'' but it's not a stretch. everyone in my fraternity does adderall like crazy during midterms and finals week and we usually end up getting 4-5 hours per night. however, we usually only take 30 or 40mg max in one day, so that might be it. also, if you smoke cigarettes, we've found (in our experience) that they enhance the effects. you should be able to sleep fine tonight. you'll probably end up dozing off today somewhere around 2 or 3 pm.|`|0SAYzdFYaa	First of all don't take adderall with alcohol.

It's always best to reach your goal gradually so that your body can get used to its condition. Exercise is important and its good that you do workout every morning. Try to push yourself further maybe, perhaps increase the workout to half an hour rather than its intensity? Also it is always worth looking at what you eat. You don't have to eat less, but perhaps you can make healthier choices eg. replace full cream milk with skimmed milk or eat a fruit for a snack rather than junk food like sweets or crisps. <br>  <br>  It takes patience and it can be difficult, it requires a lot of will power too. Just make sure that you keep a balance. It is most important to make sure that you are staying healthy through out the process of losing weight. Also always take into consideration of your body, some people for example, are born with small frames while others are more strongly built.|`|igiCJuF9aa	i dont eat terrible means you do not eat well, (eat better!)<br>  the same workout every morning is going to make your body get used to it and you will plateau, change it up,  and increase your workouts. i'd workout a minimum of 60 min a day. try a new workout video or routine, when you start to plateau, increase the time or change the video.  at the very least do your turbo jam workout 2x a day for the next week and see what happens. good luck|`|152yEf1Jaa	Exercising is a very good thing you are doing.Slowly increase the time.Take some expert's help in deciding the work-out.Weight-loss definitely requires proper diet.Minimize your sugar intake & avoid fatty food.Refined flour & polished rice are also bad for weight-losers.So try to avoid that totally.Eat a lot of fruits which are low in sugar e.g.oranges & sweet lime.Berries are also good for health.Green leafy veggies are also advisable.Last but not the least drink plenty of water.Surely yu will see the results.All the best|`|QiWlINCiaa	sometimes the fat can turn into muscles instead, but most part of it get lost if you work hard. it's better to do it for 30 mins,because that's when it starts the fat starts to burn...<br>  <br>  hope this helps.

It's probably the masturbation. It can't explain all that your feeling. I know from personal experience that masturbation makes me feel guilty about myself. After I do I feel as if I just did something so horrible. I feel really really guilty, which causes me to become emotionally unstable. But their are also some physical effects that I feel afterward that aren't as great either. They vary the different times that I did it. Some would make me feel sick, others would be me a headache, and so fourth. It's noted that right after masturbation hormone levels get really low, and hormones at high levels tend to skew the images that the brain sees, but because the hormone levels drop so quickly right after release. The mind gets a full perspective of what it just did, and it does it so quickly that the mind doesn't get the chance to reconcile the actions. But this is just a theory, it is true that the hormone levels do drop right after release.<br>  I think  about half your issues can be associated with guilty after masturbation. The other issues can be associated with the physical impact masturbation actually has on the body. Masturbation takes a lot of energy for the body, which probably relates to all the feelings associated with fatigue. Keep in mind I am not a doctor! Note the use of the word -probably-. Hope my answer helps!|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Maybe you are possessed.Not kidding, it happens.See an exorcist if medical science can't help you.|`|N1IqgXfvaa	Sounds like anxiety and panic attacks, go see your doc, they can help you.
ox85tnblaa	T he safest way to cleanse your colon is a giant salad!!<br>   Mince a clove of garlic in a bowl and then add tomatoes and cucumbers (his is so the garlic oils don't dry out). Sprinkle salt over and stir. Then add iceburg and maybe red or green leaf lettuce. any other fresh raw vegetables that you like. sprinkle a little more salt and ground black pepper. snap a tight lid on it and shake it up. Put it in the fridge to rest a while. The lettuce is going to wilt up some and it will probable look like half of what you put in there. Make this the last meal that you have in the evening. Eat as much of it as you can. The salt and wilting creates something of a dressing so you may not even add any more. but also any dressing you might want (I use a bit of ranch)  Will be streched and you need only add a very little.

uzYnw1vEaa	theres no way to know exactly. there are some online calculators, they will give you numbers between 250-300 calories. Speed doesn't really matter as much as the distance does (but it does a little bit, there is an optimum "calorie burning speed," but you weren't going that fast).
UXwFJOwuaa	Glad to hear you are a sensible 13yr old. :)<br>  its normal for it to be late, i wouldnt let it worry you too much. if it continues the next time you are due see your doctor they will probablt just keep a close eye or put you on a contraceptive pill to regulate it. there are manythings which can stop your period. heres some info i got from a site for you most of it wont apply becasue of your age, hope it helps nontheless<br>  <br>  Nothing strikes fear into the heart of any woman like a missed period, unless she is trying to get pregnant. Am I pregnant? Pregnancy is the first thing that we think of when our period is delayed. But is pregnancy the only reason for people to have a late period? Here are the 10 most common reasons that you missed your period:<br>  <br>  <br>  Stress<br>  Stress can affect many things in our lives, including our periods. Sometimes we're so stressed out that our body decreases the amount of a hormone (GnRH), which causes us to not ovulate or menstruate. Working with your doctor or midwife can help you figure out what you need to do to relax and get back on schedule. <br>  <br>  Illness<br>  A sudden, short illness or even a longer illness can cause your periods to be delayed. This is usually temporary. <br>  <br>  Change in Schedules<br>  Changing schedules can really throw off your body clock. This is particularly true if you go from days to nights at work or vice versa. <br>  <br>  Change in Medications<br>  Perhaps you're trying a new medication and a delayed or absent period is the cause. Be sure to talk to your doctor or midwife about this side effect. It is very common with some methods of birth control. <br>  <br>  Being Overweight<br>  Carrying around too much weight can hormonally shift your cycles and even stop them. Most women will see a return to normal cycles and fertility with the loss of some weight. <br>  <br>  Being Underweight<br>  If you do not have enough body fat you will not have regular periods, sometimes you can eve cause your periods to stop all together. This is called amenorrhea. Typically a weight gain will help you have your periods return. This is a frequent cause of a missed period in women who work out to an extreme or are professional athletes. <br>  <br>  Miscalculation[<br>  The menstrual cycle varies from woman to woman. While we say that the average menstrual cycle is 28 days long, that is not true for everyone. Sometimes our period is believed to be late when in all actuality we have simply miscalculated. If you have irregular menstrual cycles, but know when you ovulate, look for your period about two weeks after you ovulate. That may help you keep an easier track of your periods.<br>  <br>  Peri-Menopause<br>  Peri-menopause is the period of time where you are transitioning from reproductive age to a non-reproductive age. Your periods may be lighter, heavier, more frequent or less frequent - but mostly just not normal. If you do not wish to get pregnant, be sure to continue to use birth control because you are likely to still be fertile at least some of the time. <br>  <br>  Menopause<br>  Menopause is when you have reached the point in your life where you will no longer ovulate or menstruate. Menopause can be a natural life event or may happen surgically through hysterectomy or through chemical such as chemotherapies. <br>  <br>  Pregnancy<br>  Finally! Yes, your missed period might be because you're pregnant! A simple pregnancy test can usually help you determine if you have missed your period because you are pregnant. The urine pregnancy tests and blood pregnancy tests look for the hormone hCG.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	First off, don't freak out just yet.  There are a bunch of reasons (other than pregnancy) that could cause your period to be late.  Stress, changes in your dietary habits, having a cold, flu or virus and even age itself can be factors.  So, if there is absolutely no chance of you being pregnant, just wait it out a bit longer.  Hope this helps to calm you a bit.  Take care.|`|35u9RVVFaa	ur still irregular. it takes about 3-4 years to become regular. so even if u think u r, UR NOT!|`|aHER8myJaa	if you're under 16 a doctor won't be concerned but if you're over 16 they'll prob want to put you on birth control to regulate it|`|14nj25eNaa	Have you started exercising more than usual?

BAMBBKMdaa	There are tear glands beneath the eyelids of both the eyes. Eyelids take some liquid from these glands and give a wet wipe to the cornea with each blink of the eyes. If this phenomenon did not take place then cornea would become dehydrated ultimately resulting in blindness. Further, tears are necessary for removal of dust particles settling on the cornea. But more important is the protection against bacterial infection given by anti bacterial constituents in the tears. After cleaning the eyes with each blink, the tear drops drain into the nose through an internal tube where they are quickly evaporated by breathing. Crying or much leaguing brings pressure on the muscles above tear glands. These muscles in turn squeeze tear glands which result in flow of tears, some of which also come out of nose. A flow of cold air on the eyes during winter also causes constriction of the muscles above tear glands bringing tears in the eyes.<br>  <br>  Keep smile :-))|`|UiFpSA73aa	why u can Pass u r urine when u sit for hahahahaaaaaaaaaaa|`|suxunLtLaa	so that every one get informed that yes i am crying|`|gqZQuhBvaa	Tears are not comming only during crying but also camming during Laughing. it is because of mental stress.

My eyelid start twitching at around the time i got this disorder. I was stressing out around than, perhaps...anyways, my arm muscle also twitches. It might be the stress. It is transient twitching though. It comes and goes. It happened just within these few years. I'd seek a professional opinion. They will probably say its stress, but, if you want to take something minor, and really find if you have some other disorder, than check out the post traumatic stress disorder. its not a symptom of post traumatic stress disorder, but i noticed the twitching around the time i got post traumatic stress disorder, so it might be a symptom they have not listed. check it out anyway, to keep yourself informed, if that path should check out. do not mean to alarm you, or attract your attention to mundane tasks, but its worth a brief investigation.|`|c0cb626af96c331010cc96b4bf5f7dc3aa	uhhhhhhhhhhh............|`|c964d0fbb2a5c53391571a65f9957861aa	It is related to stress.

Nem t?o pouco "fazer reeduca??o alimentar", porque na verdade você vai continuar "fazendo dieta", só que será uma dieta saudável, mas ainda será dieta.<br>  O problema de qualquer dieta, mesmo a reeduca??o alimentar, é que estamos for?ando uma barra. For?ando a barra de uma alimenta??o mais saudável. For?ando a barra de uma quantidade menor porque se a alimenta??o é saudável, n?o podemos e nem devemos nos exceder.<br>  E aí você está cortando um prazer... Tenho certeza que você tem prazer em comer um bolo, uma pizza. "-Mas todo mundo tem!", você me diria, e eu te respondo: é, mas nem todos comem essas coisas com a freqüencia e a quatidade que VOCê provavelmente come. E o "todo mundo" provavelmente n?o se importa tanto assim de ficar uns dias sem essa ou aquela delícia, porque o "todo mundo" provavelmente n?o se orienta tanto pelo desejo de comer.<br>  Portanto n?o se iluda: comer quitutes o tempo todo, ou comer em quantidades exageradas, é UM VíCIO COMO OUTRO QUALQUER. E a origem dios vícios é uma só: carência. De si mesma, de se dar aten??o, de se ouvir, de se dar a m?o pra enfrentar os seus próprios conflitos pessoais. Os conflitos que você tem medo ou é orgulhosa demais pra admitir que est?o dentro de você.<br>  Portanto, a minha sugest?o pra você é: procure um terapeuta como eu fiz, mergulhe nas suas frustra??es, fique mal por um tempo, porque as vezes é só na crise que a gente acha a resposta. Exorcise seus medos, angústias e frustra??es. Aí você vai ver, como eu vi,  que a vida é maravilhosa mesmo sem guloseimas, que uma salada pode ser uma delícia melhor que um brigadeiro quando você sabe que aquilo é um gesto de amor e respeito consigo mesma... Enxergue a vida com outros olhos e ela passará a ter muito mais sabor pra você. Muito mais do que aquela empadinha de frango...|`|73e5685a1bc30771690034d25c604d4aaa	Acredito que a sua pergunta foi bem respondida por várias pessoas, mas n?o custa nada enfatizar:<br>  <br>  Evite dietas radicais ou que se dizem "miraculosas", pois, como você disse, chegou a perder 12 Kg em um mês, mas engordou novamente. Você conseguirá um resultado muito melhor mudando seus hábitos alimentares (o que definitivamente n?o significa passar fome) e praticando exercícios aeróbicos (ex.: caminhada, nata??o, hidroginástica - exercícios de longa dura??o) regularmente.<br>  <br>  Mas, é claro, n?o adianta fazer tudo isso pra depois que chegar no peso ideal parar tudo e voltar aos "hábitos engordativos". Acredite, se alimentar bem e praticar exercício n?o é nenhum sacrifício, muito pelo contrário. N?o precisa ficar de jejum nem come?ar a malhar feito uma louca, o segredo é n?o esperar um resultado do dia pra noite. Procure orienta??o de especialistas (nutricionistas e profissionais de educa??o física) que será bem mais fácil.<br>  <br>  Outra coisa: algumas pessoas realmente tem tendência a engordar, por mais que cuidem da alimenta??o. Em alguns casos, pode ser algum tipo de problema hormonal (ex.: hipotireoidismo, comum em mulheres), ent?o vale a pena procurar um endocrinologista se o tratamento usual n?o funcionar.<br>  <br>  Medicamentos para emagrecer: fuja deles como o diabo foge da cruz :-P. Só s?o indicados para os casos de obesidade mórbida, e efeitos adversos é o que n?o falta.<br>  <br>  O que ajuda a emagrecer sem causar problemas é a ingest?o de fibras mas, na minha opini?o, n?o precisa comprar aquelas que aparecem na tv...

A dieta é uma exce??o, ent?o será ilusória, porque t?o logo você volte à regra (comer coisas que eram proibidas na dieta), irá recuperar todos os kilos. O segredo é o seguinte: REEDUC???O ALIMENTAR + EXERCíCIO AERóBICO + MUSCULA??O + DEVO??O = SEU OBJETIVO. Reeduca??o alimentar n?o significa que você nunca mais poderá comer guloseimas. Por ex., se você está indo para a academia, permita-se comer uma barra de chocolate, pois esta energia será importante. Você n?o deve comer ou tomar produtos com a?úcar antes de dormir, pois isso será transformado em gordura. Coma um blanquet de peru sadia à vontade, porque é composto praticamente só de proteínas. A muscula??o ajuda o corpo a acelerar o metabolismo e os exercícios aeróbicos, como corrida, ajudam a queimar mais calorias. A devo??o é necessária para manter a disciplina com amor, isto é, com a consciência de que você quer ficar em paz consigo mesma e ter saúde.|`|f57e3ab09617f0c05372108eeb647211aa	Remédios definitivamente n?o fazem milagres, regime ent?o... n?o n?o.<br>  <br>  Se você simplesmente resolve cortar calorias na sua alimenta??o, por conta própria, pode ocasionar diversos traumas ao seu corpo.<br>  <br>  1- Você estará n?o só cortando calorias, mas nutrientes.<br>  <br>  2- Quando seu corpo passa fome, uma hora você mesmo n?o vai poder aguentar, vem ent?o as chamadas recaídas: você como o dobro do que estava comendo antes do regime e consequentemente, engorda... muitoi mais.<br>  <br>  3- As células de gordura, custam a reduzir de tamanho.

Este horm?nio é capaz de causar saciedade no indivíduo, porém é produzido por suas células adiposas, e portanto, passa a ser produzido em baixas quantidades quando você emagrece. Com isso você volta a se alimentar em excesso e adquire o peso que havia perdido. Estudos recentes vêm apontando a leptina como a substancia responsável pelo efeito sanfona.

Até que em 2002 eu comecei a refazer a minha alimenta??o, limitar as quantidades, aumentando as vezes que eu comia. Cortei a?úcar e frituras e fui lidando com os carboidratos e proteínas aos poucos. Uma refei??o eu comia salada com mistura, ovo, carne, frango, salsicha, etc(proteína) e outra com sala e massa, arroz, etc(carboidrato). Parei de mistura proteína com carboidrato ou pelo menos evitava o máximo. Claro que aos poucos e sempre. Todo dia era "2a.feira" se eu me alimentava "errado" ou seja fora desses padr?es no dia seguinte recome?ava com a mesma disposi??o de 2a. feira. Uma coisa sobre líquidos: é verdade que a gente tem que tomar pelo menos 2 litros de água por dia. Mas água. Suco, refreigerante, água de coco e outros n?o é a mesma coisa. Se acostume e tome. E caminhe. Após 20 minutos andando você já queima mais calorias que o seu metabolismo normalmente já queima. Por falar nisso o tal "Sr. Metabolismo" é a chave o efeito (ou defeito) sanfona. Ele no come?o queima mais, porque você tá pesada e perde muito mais no come?o e rápido porque o seu organismo gra?as a ele, lê que você precisa de ajuda para carregar o seu peso ou eliminá-lo para o seu corpo funcionar.à medida que vamos ficando mais leves essa bomba que queima as calorias "bate" com menos for?a nas calorias, requerendo uma ajuda extra do externo: Academias, Corridas, caminhadas mais longase em diferentes trajetos, e até plásticas, tratamento de estética e etc. Enfim esse processo todo eu passei (e passo), e hoje mantenho os 63 kg com 39 anos. Após 02 anos de luta mais rigorosa para manter essa dinamica diária. Levei 02 anos para ficar com 60 kg. E só n?o engordei porque fui emagrecendo lentamente, e continuamente o que fez o meu metabolismo acostumar-se aos poucos com o meu peso e as minhas células memorizarem(se acostumarem) com a minha nova constitui??o, porque quando eliminei peso muito rápido, o meu organismo "lutou contra mim" acionando um tipo de alarme que eu precisava de adquirir e n?o eliminar caloria, porque ele acostumou com os 102quilos e qualquer coisa que diminuísse isso muito rápido era lido por meu corpo como perigo. A propósito cheguei aos 102 gra?as ao efeito sanfona. N?o tem mágica. é fechar a boca e se exercitar. Acreditar que vai dar certo e em Deus para se acalmar e espera porque o tempo fará seu trabalho lenta, mas eficazmente. O Tempo aliás é senhor de si mesmo, e Deus Senhor do tempo. For?a e que Deus te aben?oe.

Try to remember that "losing 15 pounds in two weeks" is nothing to celebrate. It is important to realize that the more quickly weight is lost, the more likely the loss is coming from water and muscle, not fat.<br>  <br>        Since muscle tissue is critical in keeping our metabolism elevated, losing it actually leads to a decrease in the amount of calories we can each day without gaining weight.<br>  <br>        Fat loss is best achieved when weight is lost slowly. Strive for a weight loss of no more than 3-4 pounds per week. One pound of weight is equivalent to 3500 calories.<br>  <br>  <br>      * Set Reachable Goals<br>        For instance, if you know you need to get more exercise, begin with a manageable goal of, say, walking 10 minutes a day that you know you can achieve. Then build your self-esteem by achieving the small goals you set yourself.<br>  <br>        The same logic applies for losing weight.<br>  <br>      * Stay off the scales<br>        Don’t get discouraged when your progress seems to be slow according to your bathroom scales. They do not provide a true measure of what is going on with the body.<br>  <br>        If exercise levels are adequate (5-7 days a week), you may be putting on muscle but losing fat, thus losing inches even if you are not losing pounds. It's always a good idea to do several body measurements to have a second objective way to monitor progress.<br>  <br>      * Stay focused on being healthy, not thin<br>        # Many people become more successful at long term weight loss when their motive changes from wanting to be thinner to wanting to be healthier. Change your mindset to think about selecting foods that will help your body's health rather than worrying about foods that will affect your body's weight. The Food Pyramid offers a basic outline of the types and amounts of food you should eat each day to give your body the nutrients it needs for optimal health.<br>  <br>      * Fat Free?<br>        We've known for some time that limiting high fat foods in the diet can be helpful with weight loss. That's because fats pack in 9 calories per gram compared to only 4 calories per gram from proteins or carbohydrates. To many, the message to limit fats implied an endorsement to eat unlimited amounts of fat-free products. Just to clarify, fat-free foods have calories too. In some cases fat-free foods have as many calories as their fat laden counterparts. If you eat more calories than your body uses, you will gain weight. Eating less fat will help you to lose weight. Eating less fat and replacing it with excessive amounts of fat-free products will not.<br>  <br>      * Drink plenty of water<br>        Drink eight glasses a day. Water is a natural appetite-suppressant. Nettle tea is a great weight-loss tea as it supports metabolism and has diuretic properties.<br>  <br>      * Reward yourself<br>        # Each time you reach a goal, such as losing 5 pounds, reward yourself with a gift or a massage.<br>  <br>      * Seek help if you need it<br>        # A big key in long term weight control comes from receiving encouragement and support from others. Find a friend to lose weight with or you can check to see if groups such as Weight Watchers, or eDiets offer programs and resources in your area by clicking the links. You may also wish to check with your local hospital to see if their registered dietician conducts group weight loss programs.<br>  <br>      * Watch your portions<br>        With the advent of "supersize" meals and increasingly huge portions at restaurants, our concept of normal serving sizes is a distant memory. Be mindful of the amounts of food you consume at a sitting. When necessary, divide your food in half and ask for a take home bag. It is all too easy to be a "plate cleaner" even when served enormous portions. Learn to pay attention to your hunger level and stop eating when you feel comfortably full, not stuffed.<br>  <br>      * Eat your food slowly<br>        Did you ever notice that thin people take an awfully long time to eat their food? Eating slowly is one method that can help take off pounds. That's because from the time you begin eating it takes the brain 20 minutes to start signaling feelings of fullness. Fast eaters often eat beyond their true level of fullness before the 20 minute signal has had a chance to set in. The amount of calories consumed before you begin to feel full can vary significantly depending on how quickly you eat. So slow down, take smaller bites and enjoy your food.|`|20909ff87bbd05d3b0d4b8bce56b932caa	Dieting for teens is not a good idea.

F6fI9tG7aa	You can continue to run, however it may slow the progress of your healing.  If you insist on running do so carefully.  you may want to heat up your knee before activity to get the blood flowing and warm up your muscles (only if you don't have any swelling), stretch before and after workout, and ice when you're done.  Just take it easy. The MCL gets good blood supply so if it's injured it will heal on it's own.  You just have to rest a bit and give it time to do so.  Tendinitis can be tricky and come back if you don't give it time to heal properly.|`|BiZR6UcDaa	Yes,actually you can run with both of them,depending on how bad the case,it could cause minor discomfort to extreme pain,if you insist on running,i recommend buying the icyhot patch for your knee(s) and a knee brace wouldnt be a bad idea either,and when your done running,walk for 5-10 minutes to slow down,and get regular blood pressure back to your knee(s) or else it will cause more pain when you stop|`|ENCzmxf6aa	I would avoid running for at least 3-4 weeks to allow your tendon to heal. Tendonititis is inflammation of the tendon, and if you do not allow it to heal properly it could tare causing a longer healing time for recovery or even surgery.<br>  I would elevat your knee and keep ice in it, 20minutes on, 20 mintues off to help releive the swelling an pain. You can also use a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory like advil, but I would advise Tylenol as advil can cause stomach problems. If you decide to you over the counter pain medication, make sure you are reading the directions on the bottle and following them carefully.<br>  Good Luck!
206a9226cd64c2aaf2c45700eb474010aa	TRANS FATS:<br>  There are four kinds of fats: monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, saturated fat, and trans fat. Monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat are the "good" fats. It is generally accepted that consumption of saturated fat should be kept low, especially for adults. Trans fat (which means trans fatty acids) is the worst kind of fat, far worse than saturated fat. <br>  <br>  Partial hydrogenation is an industrial process used to make a perfectly good oil, such as soybean oil, into a perfectly bad oil. The process is used to make an oil more solid; provide longer shelf-life in baked products; provide longer fry-life for cooking oils, and provide a certain kind of texture or "mouthfeel." The big problem is that partially hydrogenated oil is laden with lethal trans fat.<br>  <br>  FATS<br>  Knowing which fats raise LDL cholesterol and which ones don't is the first step in lowering your risk of heart disease. In addition to the LDL produced naturally by your body, saturated fat, trans-fatty acids and dietary cholesterol contribute to blood cholesterol. Monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats don't. Some studies suggest they might even help lower LDL cholesterol slightly when eaten as part of a low-saturated-fat diet. <br>  Saturated fats<br>  Saturated fat is the main dietary cause of high blood cholesterol. The American Heart Association recommends that you limit your saturated fat intake to 7–10 percent of total calories (or less) each day. If you have coronary heart disease or your LDL cholesterol level is 100 mg/dL or greater, your doctor should recommend the Therapeutic Lifestyle Change (TLC) Diet. It recommends 25–35 percent of calories from fat, with less than 7 percent coming from saturated fat. Cholesterol is limited to less than 200 milligrams a day.<br>  <br>  Saturated fat is found mostly in foods from animals and some plants.<br>  <br>  Foods from animals — These include beef, beef fat, veal, lamb, pork, lard, poultry fat, butter, cream, milk, cheeses and other dairy products made from whole milk. These foods also contain dietary cholesterol.<br>  <br>  Foods from plants — These include coconut oil, palm oil and palm kernel oil (often called tropical oils), and cocoa butter.|`|3fccf1045188ac87e477d3dcb20a72bdaa	Trans-fatty acids are a subset of fats.  Fats, in general, are not always bad for you.  The body needs fat to survive, believe it or not.  Trans fats, however, are pretty much fats with all the good stuff in them taken out.

They promote the growth of skeletal muscle (anabolic effects) and the development of male sexual characteristics (androgenic effects), and also have some other effects. The term "anabolic steroids" will be used through-out this report because of its familiarity, although the proper term for these compounds is "anabolic-androgenic" steroids.<br>  <br>  Anabolic steroids were developed in the late 1930s primarily to treat hypogonadism, a condition in which the testes do not produce sufficient testosterone for normal growth, development, and sexual functioning. The primary medical uses of these compounds are to treat delayed puberty, some types of impotence, and wasting of the body caused by HIV infection or other diseases.<br>  <br>  During the 1930s, scientists discovered that anabolic steroids could facilitate the growth of skeletal muscle in laboratory animals, which led to use of the compounds first by bodybuilders and weightlifters and then by athletes in other sports. Steroid abuse has become so widespread in athletics that it affects the outcome of sports contests.<br>  <br>  More than 100 different anabolic steroids have been developed, but they require a prescription to be used legally in the United States. Most steroids that are used illegally are smuggled in from other countries, illegally diverted from U.S. pharmacies, or synthesized in clandestine laboratories.|`|AA11466150	totally increases the size of your johnson...shrinks the nuts for a while, but your jimmy stick is permantly giganticized.

I gather from your mention of an accident that your legs were injured; if this color change has become more apparent recently, it might be a good idea to consult your doctor.  If surgery was done on your legs, it's possible that circulation could have been impaired or otherwise compromised.  You don't state your age, but if you are still growing, the changes that are occurring migh be getting influnced by those "old" injuries.  I would definitely contact a doctor no matter what your age; circulatory difficulties are certainly the most treatable when they are dealt with early.  Good luck!|`|c487ac1352e2cf98bc3c82c0bb29c3d2aa	sounds like the circulation, yes.|`|AA10395708	I have no way of knowing if it is your circulation.  A doctor could tell you the answer to that.  You could have scarring which is effecting the looks of your legs.  I recently heard of people with this condition and their problem was mites under their skin.  Tiny little bitty bugs that borough under the skin and cause the skin to look red and white and in between.  Some of these people took years to discover their problems, because doctors were NOT familiar with mites.  I know someone whose legs got terrible looking and she couldn't figure out why.  It turned out she had gotten some animals which she let stay in the house.  Her legs were always itchy.  Her problem turned out to be fleas biting her, but jumping back on the animals so she wasn't seeing them.  <br>  Check out that mite problem.  You need to checkout whatever the problem is to solve it quickly.  Best wishes!!!|`|f7065ee905a30a5793f1d0aa275df83caa	hmm... sounds like a problem with the circulation in your legs. you should probably just get some tanning cream or tanning moisturizer -- it actually works pretty well. and it's cheaper than going to a tanning salon, and probably healthier. just keep doing that until the problem goes away. if it doesn't go away for a REALLY long time, maybe you should go get it checked out -- it might be more than just bad circulation.

69aefde42efeb87de7bd08278b404067aa	You've been trying to lose 20 lbs for 10 years?<br>  20 lbs in 3 weeks will probably be a lot of water loss and some fat loss.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you really need a lifestyle change and get rid of the "quick fix" mentality.<br>  <br>  1.  Honestly, look at what you're eating and how many calories.<br>  2.  Remove all of the junk food and fast food from your diet.<br>  3.  Increase your activity level - 30 minutes of exercise and weight training.<br>  4.  Stop relying on "fad" diets.  You've probably read it all and know quite a bit about healthy eating.  You just need to commit to it and stop looking for the quick fixes.|`|f0c76216b9bbf24a56744310a20d6a20aa	Exercise everyday like jogging around the block<br>  Skip meals. Eat 2 times per day than 3 times per day<br>  Dont eat until you're full<br>  Eat fruits at night if your hungry.<br>  Drinks lots of water and stop all the fast food and chocolate.<br>  There are more tips and info.<br>  there's a video on success fitness too.|`|0cC91jIVaa	I'm in agreement with most of what the first person said. <br>  <br>  Quick-fixes result in yo-yo's.  However, having said that, I personally don't see anything wrong with having short term goals.  A vacation is a good goal to work towards... the question is: what will you do afterwards?<br>  <br>  Hardcore Atkins fans like the diet for rapid weight loss.  It works.  But I've seen a number of my friends go on it/off it over the years, and I question the "longevity" of this diet...<br>  <br>  Which is why, I'm a big promoter of the GI Diet.  When I decided to get serious about weight loss, I wanted a formula that I could stick with, and not worry about whatever chemical changes would happen in my body (ie: Atkins talks about going into ketosis).  More info here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis</a><br>  <br>  Here's the thing: for my personally, I didn't want to be on a plan where if I cheated even once, I'd be out of ketosis and ruin the affects that Atkins is supposed to create in your body.<br>  <br>  That's the single biggest reason for changing to GI. I got sick of the yo-yo, and go serious.  <br>  <br>  It wasn't just diet either. It was exercise.  <br>  <br>  So, having said that: <br>  <br>  - select a program that works for you... if Atkins is no longer something that's appealing, look for GI inspired programs.<br>  <br>  suggestions: South Beach, GI Diet, Meditterean Diet, Weight Watchers Core.<br>  <br>  - keep your calories down.  Yep, that's right.  I'm giving you bad news.  Even with atkins, CALORIES MATTER.  Create a daily caloric deficit.  <br>  <br>  - Add some exercise.  <br>  <br>  - Stay focussed beyond this one goal and get serious. <br>  <br>  Finally: Good luck!  I hope you find something that works for you long term.|`|Njcub1PEaa	I think you need to change your attitude to food and dieting.  I am speaking from experience.  First off all Low carb diets will not work if your diet is high in fats eg red meat, bacon, etc and anything you fry.<br>  <br>  it sound like you have a low metabolism (like me) from yo-yo dieting and your body is in permanent starvation mode.  The first thing you need to do is (I know it sounds scary) is EAT.  5-6 small meals a day of white meat, fish, lots of veg, fruit ( but i would check the calorie content of some) and lots of water.<br>  <br>  Another thing go for a long walk first thing in the morning before breakfast, thats when you are likely to burn more fat - but eat soon after cos if you dont the body will think you are starving and hold on to more fat and burn your muscle protein for energy.  try to do some weight training as well.  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you eat junk food cut it out obviously and if you  drink alcohol that has to go too.<br>  <br>  As for your holiday body I would not advice any form of extreme dieting if you do that you will make it worse for yourself.  Try this from tomorrow and I am sure you will lose some weight - the healthy way 2-3 pounds a week not 10! that way its guaranteed to stay off.<br>  <br>  I know you might be very unhappy but have a positive outlook, you are beautiful no matter what the scales say and if you want to lose weight its because you are worried about your health - not because you think you are "ugly" or not good looking enough.  <br>  Good Luck, you are a star<br>  This is a lifestyle change.|`|ePA4lYxXaa	I found a great way to lose weight fast and keep it off.  I do body cleansing.  I lost 13 pounds in  9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. Cleansing will help the body get rid of impurities.  Impurites come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives etc.  The impurities get stored in the fat in our body.  To shrink the fat, we have to get rid of the impurities by cleansing.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow.   To learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  Cleansing was good for me. Good luck whatever you decide to do!  <br>  <a href="http://losebigweight.com" rel="nofollow">http://losebigweight.com</a>
8026f858400be8d2c8e3b384ce4fe4bfaa	Estrogen and progesterone are sometimes called "female" hormones, but both men and women have them, just in different concentrations. <br>  <br>  Progesterone causes the surface of the uterine lining, the endometrium, to become covered with mucous, secreted from glands within the lining itself. If fertilization and implantation do not occur,(meaning if u dont get pregnant) the spiral arteries of the lining close off, stopping blood flow to the surface of the lining. The blood pools into "venous lakes" which, once full, burst and, with the endometrial lining, form the menstrual flow. Most periods last 4 to 8 days but this length varies over the course of a lifetime. <br>  <br>  Some researchers view menses as the natural monthly cleansing of the uterus and vagina of sperm and bacteria they carried. <br>  <br>  <br>  Women can experience a variety of sensations before, during or after their menses. Common complaints include backache, pain in the inner thighs, bloating, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, headaches, breast tenderness, irritability, and other mood changes. Women also experience positive sensations such as relief, release, euphoria, new beginning, invigoration, connection with nature, creative energy, exhilaration, increased sex drive and more intense orgasms. <br>  <br>  Uterine cramping is one of the most common uncomfortable sensations women may have during menstruation. There are two kinds of cramping. Spasmodic cramping is probably caused by prostaglandins, chemicals that affect muscle tension. Some prostaglandins cause relaxation, and some cause constriction. A diet high in linoleic and liblenic acids, found in vegetables and fish, increases the prostaglandins for aiding muscle relaxation. <br>  <br>  Congestive cramping causes the body to retain fluids and salt. To counter congestive cramping, avoid wheat and dairy products, alcohol, caffeine, and refined sugar. <br>  <br>  Natural options to alleviate cramping:<br>  <br>  Increase exercise. This will improve blood and oxygen circulation throughout the body, including the pelvis. <br>  Try not using tampons. Many women find tampons increase cramping. Don't select an IUD (intrauterine device) as your birth control method. <br>  Avoid red meat, refined sugars, milk, and fatty foods. <br>  Eat lots of fresh vegetables, whole grains (especially if you experience constipation or indigestion), nuts, seeds and fruit. <br>  Avoid caffeine. It constricts blood vessels and increases tension. <br>  Meditate, get a massage. <br>  Have an orgasm (alone or with a partner). <br>  Drink ginger root tea (especially if you experience fatigue). <br>  Put cayenne pepper on food. It is a vasodilator and improves circulation. <br>  Breathe deeply, relax, notice where you hold tension in your body and let it go. <br>  Ovarian Kung Fu alleviates or even eliminates menstrual cramps and PMS, it also ensures smooth transition through menopause <br>  Take time for yourself! <br>  Anecdotal information suggests eliminating Nutra-Sweet from the diet will significantly relieve menstrual cramps. If you drink sugar-free sodas or other forms of Nutra-Sweet, try eliminating them completely for two months and see what happens.|`|AA11600320	Your muscles in your uterus are contracting which causes the cramps and it helps the lining push through your cervix.  Cramps are a pain, but without them, our periods would be extended.  Now, that would be terrible!!!
xjyCvY7Qaa	Questa cosa che dici si chiama fimosi.Consiste nelle presenza di un frenulo troppo corto, che impedisce la completa discesa del prepuzio e quindi la piena fuoriuscita del glande. Le principali conseguenze di questa condizione sono dolore all'atto sessuale nonchè possibilità di infiammazioni (balanopostiti) ed eventualmente alcune difficoltà nell mantenimento di un'igiene accurata della zona.<br>  Posso dirti che è un difetto molto comune, e facilmente risolvibile. Necessita di un piccolo intervento chirurgico (circoncisione) che ti viene fatto dall'urologo in anestesia locale. Per qualche giorno dovrai portare delle garze e bende nella zona, non potrai giocare a pallone nè ovviam.avere rapporti sessuali e non potrai lavare la parte. Ma solo per qualche giorno....i risultati sono eccellenti e si ha il pieno recupero del problema!

2a8d8682b29ed897f4c2b133cf0ad03aaa	I'm not a runner anymore (knee issues) but I know a bit about these issues.  The best combo for healthy weight loss is reduce calorie intake by 500 *and* burn off 500 calories by exercise.  It's not hard to reduce intake by 500 but exercising 500 worth can be hard so just do your best at the start.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine just started training for a marathon and is part of a running club (I've never done either).  He told me that they start lot of new members (which he is) with this combo:<br>  <br>  Run/Jog:  4 minutes<br>  Walk:  1 minutes<br>  Repeat<br>  <br>  Take it slow.  It's the lack of pacing that kills ya and nobody important cares what you look like.  Loved ones should appreciate your effort.  Healthy people just like to see more people exercising.  By-standers will only find fault with you to make excuses for their lack of participation.  In other words, don't care about how you look - you will be more graceful soon.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|gJvUNoMZaa	Running and jogging is a great way to loss wait i did the same thing. Don't get discouraged the best way to start is to go to the gym and work on treadmills and other aerobic machines ...... but don't use the bikes there. Sitting is not a Good way to stay balanced and it takes longer. that where you can listen to your ipod. Once you get fitter (3 to 5) pounds less You should start on jogging to places and for fun. If you really don't want to be seen just go to an uncommon place. Then to go the extra mile walk to get the milk or walk to work(depending were work is). When you walk try to bring water no SPORTS DRINKS +(  (sport drinks = more fat) =()()() Here are some sources|`|P4Jc76GPaa	1. The best form is keep your legs bent a little and your body slightly forward. The motion in your arms would be like you are going to hit your chin if you were to bring them up that far, but you don't. Your feet should be straight when you hit the ground, this keeps your body in line with your neck, back, legs, knees and ankles. When you are running don't bounce, this adds more weight when you land on each foot. make sure your body doesn't sway side to side and look forward and slightly down to the ground. <br>  <br>  2. Remember. when you run, with every step you take take, you have a force of up to 4 times your body weight on each foot. As for your stride, your body will tell you what is comfortable. Don't force it, work with it.<br>  <br>  3. make sure you get a good pair of running shoes. If you are not sure go to a running store and they will get you set up. A lot of running stores will let you run in them to see how they feel right there in the store. <br>  <br>  4. Be committed to run 3 days a week for the next 3 months. I guarantee you will not only get better, faster, and more fit, you will enjoy it more. <br>  <br>  5. As for zoning things out it's different for each runner. I like to thing I am running in a race or competing in the Olympics. It also may help to have a running partner, or join a running group. They have runners from beginners like yourself, to advanced. <br>  Good luck superstar!
2T2qQ6QKaa	I love exercising. Dieting also works, but if you cut your portions in half, you can shrink your stomach and lose weight, while still having a normal diet. Don't go overboard and stop eating whil exercising super hard. Its not good for your system. I would reccomend fruit, raw veggies (like celery, carrots) and some protein shakes. Protein build muscle and thats great for a nice six-pack.<br>  <br>  For the exercise part, you can never go wrong with crunches. I like doing crunch sets to songs. Plug in your ipod (or whatever) and do different variations on crunches until your song ends. You can do crunches:<br>  <br>  *twisting your bady so that one arm meets the opposite leg<br>  *with your hands behind your head<br>  *with your arms crossed in front of your chest<br>  *with your legs held about 6 inches above the ground (this kills, but make sure not to arch your back, just keep your lower back on the ground at all times.<br>  <br>  The crunch sets can be really fun if you play a really fast and upbeat song. It gets you so into it. <br>  <br>  Another thing you can do is called leg lifts. You lie on your back and you bring your legs up to about 100 degrees (so before they go straight up in the air) and then back down SLOWLY AND WITHOUT TOUCHING THE GROUND, you hold it there, and then slowly bring your legs back up.<br>  <br>  For your butt muscle, you could do leg curls. The thing is though, you need someone else to help you. (or some really heavy ankle weights) You lie on your back and the other person pushes down on your ankles while you try to bring them up to your but. Don't stick your butt up in the air though, it defeats the purpose. Then they pull your calves toward your head while you try to bring them down to the ground. You only need to do about 3 sets 7 a day if the person pushing is pushing with a lot of force.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|vurN9Wsjaa	To loose weight:<br>  <br>  1.

Sit-ups and tummy "crunches" will do it for you EVERY time.   Just make sure that every day you start with about 5,000 repititions (or more if you need them).  Its also a good idea to cut down on the calories you consume - plain salads seem to work best.<br>  <br>  If, after a year (or so) of doing the recommended number of daily sit-ups, crunches and eating the salads as suggested, your tummy has not considerably reduced, you can always try the surgeon's knife. <br>  <br>  See,  not so hard, is it?

I used a protein based diet after a friend who had lost a lot of weight with this recommended it to me. All the way through you feel great and energized, you also get great coaching and support along the way. The people are very friendly and gave me lots of great advice. I needed to lose 40 pounds and I did so with no problems. The products really work and you feel great whilst losing weight. I lost all my weight in less than four months and they have helped me to keep it off. I would definitely recommend using them. My sister did this also and lost 76 pounds in five months (She works out, I don’t). There is no pressure and they will even send you a load of free samples so you can try before you buy. The samples were the thing that initially convinced me that this was the right diet for me. You also a get a free complete health consultation with the samples, I just paid the postage and handling, but for what I got it was well worth it. You just go to www.myhealthabc.com to register your details to get the free samples and the free advice etc and then they just call you up and ask you a few questions. It was so easy. Their main site is www.myhealthabcmall.com and you can see all the products and packages and order from their. Its nice to have contact with real people who care about you losing weight and improving your health. I am in better health now than I have ever been thanks to these products and I know that I will continue to keep the weight off with the help I have received. I hope this helps.|`|JdT5s5iIaa	November 21, 2004 will go down in history as the day that Hoodia Gordonii <a href="http://www.gordoniihoodia.net/hoodia-diet-review/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gordoniihoodia.net/hoodia-die...</a> was discovered in America.

5d65fcfb0d15c9dc51751b1ddcdc3c4faa	La tosse è un riflesso di difesa del nostro organismo in risposta a un'azione irritante sulla trachea o sui bronchi; inizia con una profonda inspirazione cui segue un'espirazione forzata, esplosiva, che ha lo scopo di espellere o smuovere l'agente irritante<br>  <br>  La tosse è un sintomo di malattie tra loro molto differenti, e quindi non va affrontata sempre allo stesso modo. La prima grande suddivisione è tra tosse secca e tosse grassa (vale a dire con presenza di catarro). Nel primo caso può essere utile (e quasi sempre lo è) somministrare un sedativo della tosse, mentre nel secondo sopprimere lo stimolo è assolutamente controproducente, in quanto il riflesso della tosse serve a liberare le vie respiratorie dall'eccesso di muco. Se il muco ristagna nei bronchi, infatti, oltre a rendere difficoltosa la respirazione, costituisce un buon terreno di coltura per i microbi che causano le infezioni delle vie respiratorie.

gOsjK6eEaa	Hi. My sister nearly died of hemorrhage during an early miscarriage.  She was not herself for a few years, but is completely over it now. This also happened in front of my then-five yr. old niece, which bothered my sister more than the child.<br>  <br>  Please don't let Lorri's answer scare you.<br>  Did he have several traumas, or was he traumatized by war ?  VERY different from what you went through.<br>  <br>  What you experienced is very frightening and traumatic, but look at what you DO have now.  Your life, your son, and Hope.<br>  <br>  There are varying levels of personal and psychic trauma and, in certain cases, some people can recover from most effects if treated early on.  PTSD can be controlled (but not cured).<br>  <br>  Continue with your therapy. Attend a group of people with PTSD, preferably women.  Often, sharing with a group of other trauma survivors will help you feel less "alone" and better understood. You will see new ways to handle life's stresses.  Medication can help with the OCD.<br>  <br>  With any depression or trauma, you need to push yourself to keep going sometimes.  Each day, make yourself do what you need to for yourself and your child. Take a few minutes out of the day to pray or meditate about why you are grateful to be alive.  Do something pleasant each day for yourself - play and be creative with your son, take a bubble bath or shower with lovely scented body wash, or take a walk, enjoy the sun and flowers. You get the idea; it can be simple but make sure you enjoy the moment.<br>  <br>  Links below.<br>  <br>  Note esp (on left) Common Reactions to Trauma, (on right) Type of Trauma, and Issues Specific to Women<br>  <a href="http://www.ncptsd.va.gov/ncmain/information/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncptsd.va.gov/ncmain/informat...</a><br>  <br>  Sanctuary<br>  <a href="http://www.mhsanctuary.com/ptsd/communities.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mhsanctuary.com/ptsd/communit...</a><br>  check links, resources<br>  <br>  Geared toward veterans, but good resources.<br>  try the link on Right, "Free for Downloading" articles on PTSD and coping.<br>  <a href="http://www.patiencepress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.patiencepress.com/</a>|`|b137703ca5c98072094a73e7cb603db1aa	I went through this with my brother, he eventually took his own life cause he just couldn't deal with feeling diffrent anymore - don't let this happen to you !!!<br>  Seek out people, find a church, make some real friends you can call anytime you feel you don't want to be alone. And only positive people!!!! No downers - it's ok if they have problems, you need to be a friend too, but don't hang out with anyone who brings you down or cause you to lose self esteem - self esteem is the only thing that can help you cope - everyday look in the mirror and tell yourself you are a great, healthy, happy woman. Sounds like weird advise, but get up at a certian time everyday, take a shower, put your face on, wear pretty perfume, get dressed in clothes so you can walk out the door in just a few minutes - and do just that, go somewhere everyday, even if it's just for a walk - the more you get out of your home and face the world, the less paranoid you will become - your paranoid cause you closseted yourself away from the world.<br>  Keep it together for your son, he needs you - my brother left behind 2 daughters that do not understand why he left them.<br>  Don't ever feel you aren't worth getting better - you are, and you can do it, but only if you want to - if you want to get past this you will - you will get healthy and whole but only if you want to - deal with your fears, don't let obstacles get in your way - if something bad happens deal with it head on, no hiding from things - confront any demons you have, drag your skeletons out of the closet and kick them to the curb - live a life based on NO FEARS!Good luck - email me if you want and I'll add you to my messanger and we can talk - doesn't have to be about anything you posted here - I like making new friends and I am a good listener - Lorri|`|d76068f7391307fe2b165054f8c1d86faa	I have been diagnosed with the same thing, but for different reasons.

La prima è la pancia... <br>  Io però guarda... dopo anni di diete e di fissazioni sul cibo, ho capito che non importa davvero come si è fisicamente, ma che energia si emana. Nessun ragazzo vuole stare con una strafiga magrissima sempre imbronciata. Un mio amico ha appena lasciato una strafiga magra che se la tirava e ora sta con una ragazza cicciotella, con la quale ride e sta da dio...|`|1ad768539b377779d4e3e89651541b5aaa	Anch'io ho lo stesso problema pur andando spesso in palestra e ho visto dei miglioramenti con questo esercizio. Prendi un bastone (può anche essere il manico di una scopa), mettitelo sulle spelle e tienilo con le mani, dopo di che gira il busto a destra e sinistra lasciando le gambe ferme e leggermente divaricate. Dovresti farlo per circa 15 minuti al giorno...|`|GWpkvaTPaa	Forse sei fatta così, se proprio non ti piaci l'unica soluzione è la liposcultura, io l'ho fatta sulla pancia perchè non mi diventava proprio piatta malgrado diete e ginnastica. Non farti spaventare dalle recenti notizie di morti per chirurgia estetica, per ogni intervento che va male ce ne sono 1000 che vanno bene. Se decidi di farlo, fai esami del sangue ed elettrocardiogramma e scegli una struttura sicura, con la sala operatoria, non farlo in ambulatorio; si fa anche in anestesia locale, vai dentro al mattino e prima di sera sei a casa. I costi sono scesi, soprattutto se non devi poi passare la notte in ospedale, la mia pancia poco più di un anno fa è costata 2000 euro.|`|QQ3KhqULaa	bellissima risposta Pippo.. ;)<br>  io credo che già fai abbastanza..forse ti senti grossa invece sarai uno schianto ..le ragazze con un pò di forme sono belle..tutti piatte non vano più ..sono malate XD|`|R6QzgITCaa	le manigliette dell'amore sono molto sensuali... e non serve che ti rovini la vita per cercare di essere un mucchietto di pelle e ossa...|`|4MFEqeoaaa	prova coi limoni. per limoni intendo delle lime grandi<br>  <br>  <br>  e va beh stavo a scherza`|`|PgTSfFxdaa	lasciale le maniglie e sarai piu apprezzata... w le BBW e non le magre|`|c894311fa9f4240952ed43de43411344aa	Anch'io ho il tuo "problema"...mi sa che ci vogliono gli addominali laterali! Però più di tanto mi sa che non succede se si è fatti in un certo modo! Consoliamoci con le riposte precedenti...grazie!|`|rPHixTiMaa	Per esperienza diretta ti dico che è preferibile che li sia un pò morbido piuttosto che un osso sporgente...<br>  Togliere il "grasso" è la parte più tosta. Devi fare tanta attività aerobica (vale a dire corsa, bici, step e simili, minimo per 20 minuti altrimenti non consumi).  Come esercizio mirato puoi usare un bastone sulle spalle (o un bilancere se ce la fai: maggiore è lo sforzo e meglio è) e fare rotazioni. Altrimenti con 2 manubri ti mietti in piedi con le gambe divaricate e le braccia stese sui fianchi, dopodiché ti pieghi a destra e a sinistra alternativamente facendo scendere i pesi lungo le gambe. Non so quanto sia chiaro... Comunue rivolgiti al tuo istruttore/istruttrice in palestra, è la cosa migliore.<br>  <br>  Prova a dare un'occhiata a questo sito, anche nella sezione maschile :)

hAjYAG2waa	Muscles only grow/get harder with increased stress not continual stress, so doin a million & one sits up aint really gonna help. <br>  Try Leg raises but hold a light weight (maybe start with 2/3kgs) between ur feet. then once u can do 10/15 up the weights.<br>   Also daggle from a pole (not the one u dance with :-P) and curl your legs up to your chest :-)<br>  <br>   Happy work outs ;-)|`|xzlPfqLNaa	If you're really serious you need to be VERY careful about your diet or all the ab exercises wont be effective.

4be9a8620dc0e576dd62be3ca1ac96f5aa	A sharp box cutter will make a cleaner (non-jagged) cut so if you need stitches, or not, it should heal with less scaring.  A dull box cutter may not go as deep as a sharp box cutter.  Your best bet is to be careful and not get cut at all!|`|GFgMBwDtaa	It is not better to be cut by either.  Getting cut is never a good thing.<br>  <br>  But as far as a cut healing.  A sharp box cutter will make a "cleaner" incision making it easier to mend resulting in less scarring.|`|AA10891848	try both and figure it out for yourself.

IaDjldcUaa	You could wind up with pelvic inflammatory disease and end up infertile. I wouldn't suggest ignoring BV. If your partner didn't get treatment, he probably re-infected you.|`|Z4pSCaaNaa	It wont cause any serious risks unless you are pregnant or plan to get pregnant. I have BV too and for me it is very disturbing to have it because I do have the typical strong odor. I had a week long treatment too and now im sure its back again...so im just gonna leave it like that now. Nothing can guarantee that it wont come back so why damage my stomach with lots of antibiotics. You can use the cream...it works good too. Dont worry you'll be fine. Just get checked regularly to be sure that you dont have any other infection. Good luck/1 :)|`|iA4c0kr9aa	Continue to seek medical attention|`|9TjwsH7waa	It is related to changes in vaginal ph in response to external or internal factors. Yeast (candida) and bacteria (predominately lactobacilli) live in a peaceful equalibrium.  The effects of male ejaculate and/or lubricant from condoms can alter this pH (or acidity) to faver increased bacterial growth; hence the name Bacterial vaginosis.  As well, Antibiotics can kill bacteria leading to a yeast infection.<br>  <br>  The best solution is to use different types of condoms, ie:latex, sheepskin, polyurethane or lubricants until you determine which agrees with your body more.  Or else,  encourage your mate to withdraw at the time of ejaculation. You should see a decrease in incidence of BV.|`|AA11197832	You should get more treatment, sometimes it take 3-4 tries before BV actually goes completely away.  Just be patient and see the doc again to get some more antibiotics, it will go away eventually.
53edd4bc645b906105feab969aa6df2faa	Senza dubbio i prodotti a base di aloe vera danno grande sollievo (io ne utilizzo uno puro al 100%) ed inoltre aiuta la pelle a cicatrizzare velocemente evitando gonfiori, croste e cicatrici. Cercando, puoi trovare degli stick naturali che tenuti vicino al letto sono repellenti per le zanzare. Non ho mai usato lozioni chimiche sulla mia pelle. Inoltre consiglio la prevenzione ambientale con zanzariere alle finestre, ce ne sono di vari tipi e costi, aiuta tantissimo. Importantissimo eliminare i ristagni d'acqua nelle vicinanze della tua casa e la disinfestazione dei tombini con pastiglie insetticida a base di temephos o principi attivi simili acquistabili sia negli empori che in farmacia. Senti il tuo Comune, spesso le distribuiscono gratuitamente.|`|AswSd3isaa	Una bella birra e ti passa tutto...o prova con le penne che vendo no in farmacia che le punti dove ti hanno punto esce un pò di ammoniaca e ti passa tutto...|`|UcT0NSzuaa	per te non ti posso consigliare nulla ,ma contro le zanzare usa uno di quei vetrini luminosi k si mettono vicino al letto di notte|`|ry4sg8nlaa	l'ammoniaca...|`|MjILDePlaa	Geranei davanti alla finestra, zanzariere. La lavanda non piace alle zanzare, però se ne metti troppa le attiri.

Si riproduce nell'acqua, basta un filo d'acqua sul fondo dei vasi perchè si riproduca vertiginosamente. Se hai piante bada bene che non resti acqua nei sottovasi. Se hai un balcone o un giardino attento all'acqua, le uova le mettono lì.|`|UzRaXajjaa	vai in erboristeria...trovi rimedi alle erbe

WQlKXzsVaa	Try eating smaller portion meals, also ALWAYS eat breakfast, it starts up your matabolism. try skipping lunch, or eating very little, for dinner, eat at least before 6:00 p.m so you won't gain the next day. Also, eat many fruits, you can often replace fruits for your breakfast, try not drinking soda or juice, go for water....you might not like water, but it does a lot more than you think. Veggies are also important, try avoiding most meats, ecspecially the greasy foods. Yogurt really helps, you can replace one of your meals for that yoplait light yougurt, is really healthy for you, it only has 100 calories and NO fat whatsoever, plus it helps gain a waist, it's true! I tried all these methods and lost 20 lbs. and I feel great! The most important thing is sticking to your diet.|`|HPhmeEsfaa	watch what you eat.<br>  eat healthy food.|`|ZDSWsXVlaa	If you neglect to exercise, you will experience a multitude of health problems later in life besides weight gain.  The only way to lose weight fast and permanently is through a combination of healthy diet and exercise, not fad diets or pills.<br>  <br>  Absolutley no refined sugars or fried foods.  Eat fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and drink plenty of water to lose weight and keep it off permanently, combined with a moderate exercise routine 4-5 days a week at the very least.<br>  <br>  Any fad diets or pills or fasting will help you lose weight quickly but it will be unhealthy and come back as soon as you stop that behavior - the ONLY way to lose weight properly is diet and exercise.|`|sNcltYb3aa	I'm sorry to say that if you don't want to do it the "pill" way then eating healthy and exercising is the way to go. You could go to the YMCA and get a personalized training schedule that doesn't involve that much exercise.
