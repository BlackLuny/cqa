I have thought for the past year that i have a big head but when asking a few people today they said that it is more that my shoulders aren't very broad so my head seems out of proportion a bit. I am 5" 9 and i understand what they say. Im not "Lancy" but compared to some other guys my shoulders aren't broad! Like i say i do boxing and have the beginning of a six pack - so it would be good to have my shoulers matching and a head that is in proportion with the rest of my body!      Please tell me what exercises i can do to broaden my shoulders or any other ideas/thoughts/advice!      Thanks - any help appreciated!

20090304122933AA7ZDAt	Health;Men's Health	I am a married 27 year old male and am having trouble getting and maintaining a normal erection...why?	I'm a very sexually active person, with myself and/or my wife only.  I've noticed that for the past 3 or 4 years my erection has softened and my amount of ejaculation has decreased.      About 5 years ago I had surgery to remove vericose veins in my left testicle.  It got infected and killed the testicle.  However, I know my sperm count is okay, as I've had 3 kids since then.  When the testicle first died, the erections were fine and ejaculation was as powerful and large as ever.  It was that way for about a year or more.      What could be causing this?  I'm still horny and aroused...but just can't do anything about it....please help.  Thanks!
20090304123442AAlU65T	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Told to leave my GP practice because of one horrid dr ??!! Help ..?	I have been with my GP practice for 2 years now. There is one Dr who is rude and arrogant and I don't see anymore. He told me at one appt there was nothing he could do for me, another GP at the practice then refered me to a consultant and sorted me out ! Anyway yesterday I rang for an appt and he was the only one available. I said I wouldn't see him because he was rude etc and they offered me a phone appt with another GP which I gladly took. 5 minutes later they phoned me back with a cancellation with another GP, I was well chuffed. I went to the appt and was sorted with medication etc and that was that...   This morning I got a letter saying they would treat me for the next 8 days but I had to leave the practice. They said due to the nature of the practice there may be times when I would have to see this GP therefore they couldn't treat me anymore !!!! I couldn't believe it. I have never ever been any trouble in the 2 years I've been registered with them. I have extensive medical problems and close relationships with the Dr's i see there and I am so upset that this is happening. My whole family are registered there which will make things awkward. Can they do this to me ?? I have spoken to the PCT who are looking into it for me but I have been left devastated. The GP in question really is rude and arrogant. The thing is all of this has come from the receptionist telling tales ... It's purely her word against mine. There was no investigation, nothing just a letter saying I have to leave.   What can I do ????      Thanks x

It's mostly on my forehead and a bit on my cheek. Not much at all.. one red dot. Though my face is just awful. I've got a really important performance in 2 days and I really want most of it gone.. It's probably not going to happen, but just not as red and a bit better.. I've been putting make up and other cover up on it for the past 2 weeks though that really isn't the answer.

I have a petite figure, however, over the past 5 months, I stopped working out and gained a significant amount of "fat". (I typically weigh 117-120 lbs.) I don't care so much about the number on the scale, but the shape of my body has changed and I want to get it back to being tight/leaner and less pudgy.      I will be working out 5-6 days a week. This will include three days of hour long classes (Step Aerobics, Kickbox Cardio, and Weight Training + Abs) as well as regular cardio workouts of an hour on alternating days (I will also do a 15 min pilates video on those days.)      It's tough for me to diet so I'm going to do so by eating healthy, limiting some carbs, but not going overboard. 5 small meals, not eating after 7, etc...      I just started this week. How long until I notice results/reach my goal?

20090304102820AAX1gra	Health;Other - Health	Weird symptoms question?	I normally wouldn't ask about this sort of thing on here, but I wasn't sure how to do a symptom check on WebMD as I have some weird symptoms.   Starting yesterday afternoon, I got a horrible headache in the front left part of my head. I tried taking my glasses off, taking a break from the computer (I work on a computer all day) and nothing helped. I had also been sitting all afternoon. When I got up to leave for the day, I felt like the entire room shifted and was wobbling back and forth. I was very, very dizzy. I went outside into the cold and that seemed to help some. I drove home in a bit of a haze.   I got home and it continued on. There's no way to describe it other than I felt like I had drank 6-7 beers and was at that "tipsy" stage. I drank a little soda, as I had drank water all day, and felt a little better but not much. The symptoms continued into the night and got really bad around 10 p.m., where I almost threw up from riding in the car. I went to sleep hoping this would go away. Woke up this morning, still no better. I almost fell in the shower a few times from being so dizzy. I also had a lot of drainage in my throat which, when I initially was coughing it out, was yellow/brown with a bit of blood. This went away after a few minutes.   I don't understand what is wrong and I'm hesitant to go to the doctor as the day has gone on and I feel a little better. However, I still don't feel right and my eyes won't focus, it's very strange.    Could I have some kind of viral or bacterial infection? I haven't been sick but I did have a very runny nose over the weekend and a bit of a sore throat. Nothing online seems to match up to my symptoms.    Any suggestions would be appreciated!

They even edited a video one time that made me look like i was jerking off in class. And when I was 15, my "best friend", cut off two of my fingers with scissors and than threw them at my face.  I have a huge alcohol and drugs problem and for some reason, i shoot heroin into my cuts after i cut my self, what is wrong with me!!!!!

20090304105729AA3UwM8	Health;Other - Health	Persistent pain in big toe?	For the last couple of months I have noticed that that if I put my weight on my right big toe in a certain way, it hurts.       The toe itself does not ache or hurt in any way when I am not standing or when I am walking except when the weight goes on it at a certain angle, usually turning towards the left, so most of my weight is on the toe.       The toe is not swollen, looks the same as the other big toe, and I do not remember injuring it in any way.      Ideas?      I know it would be much better to ask a podiatrist, and I will as soon as I can, but I really can't afford it right now. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

They aren't rotting, decaying, or yellow or anything, but they definitely aren't as well taken care of as they should be. And I *do* have several cavities.   Over the past year (being a single, SAHM since my husband is deployed) I haven't had a chance to go and get a plan worked up with my dentist. However, my husband is due home in about 3 weeks (Yay) and I plan on going back then, when I will have someone to watch our daughter. Also, I am 12 weeks pregnant (hubby came home for a few weeks in December...LOL) so it's important that I get some of this taken care of.      My plan right now is to really go at my teeth with the best toothpaste/mouth wash I can find until I can get that appointment, which I am assuming will be some time in April or May. I know it won't erase the year or so of not taking the best care of them, but it definitely can't make things worse.      So, anyone know which products are the best?      Thanks.

20090304103429AASxG2y	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Post-surgery foot tingly-ness?	Hey everybody.  I just had surgery on my heel on feb. 20 (not last friday but the friday before).  I had to wear a boot they gave me so I could walk (if you call hobbling around the house walking).        Well I went back for a check-up visit last friday and my doc said I didn't have to wear the boot anymore but to still keep off the heel.  So since then i've noticed that whenever I touch the top/left side of my foot, anywhere from the big toe to where foot meets leg, with any pressure (even just barely touching) the whole top/left side of my foot gets tingly and numb.      I did have the middle strap of the boot maybe tighter than it needed to be sometimes, but I wanted it to stay on and did NOT want my heel touching anything in the boot (i'm paranoid like that).  But it seems like that wouldn't have prolonged consequenses, unless it injured a nerve, or something.      I go back next week to get the stitches out and i'll either ask the doc then or, if it gets worse somehow, i'll call them up sooner but I wanted to see if anybody here had a similar experience, just out of curiosity.        Because I don't have any idea what's going on lol

Instead, I had been looking for feedback and brainstorming with fellow sufferers.  Any suggestions appreciated.

[which, of course irritates me during the week when we both work fulltime].     last night i didn't want to and he got very frustrated/irritated.  he tried to get it on two hours after we went to sleep..to which i turned him down because i was SLEEPING!  he brought it up again this morning sounding very annoyed.  I have been with him 3 1/2 months.  we have a great relationship on a whole.  awesome conversation.  same views.  love each others families.  its just this one thing i'm confused about.  i love sex...there are days where i'm a total nympho!    i know he has an addictive personality-  2 years ago he was a coke addict and he just quit smoking weed 4 months ago.     what to do?   i want to please him but i don't want him to get such a bad attitude when there is the VERY occasional times i don't.

20090227065351AAvK5DA	Health;Mental Health	How can i handle the fact i got angry  after doing well for so long?	i always feel let down in myself when this happens, ive worked very hard on myself and my conduct for a lot of years now...      iam now 31 and have endured a very tough, unfair life full of mental abuse, persistent bullying and trauma. many years ago i used to have ' involuntary ' rage outbursts in public where id lose it , lash out at people, explode with rage , get attacked by strangers , cautioned by police few times etc.      the rage comes from years of abuse an bullying and stored anger, when i used to have the rage attacks , people in society were outcasting me, rejecting me, singling me out , acting aloof and stand offish all the time......even provoking me.......through mind games etc.      even though ive managed my conduct and rage outburst for years, have insight, been seeking and asking for help, been trying to change my angry demeanor and aloof, guardedness - people still in the community behave standoffish , aloof - i get funny looks still, intrusive looks.      which i try to ignore , because i know i have no control over what people think, perceive and do.      last night i rang the samaritans because i was feeling really low , in a deep depression , a few times when ive rung , ive had a hotline worker, ' goad ' me, play mind games , ' repeat ' , back every word i say , condescend me - in one call - 15 minutes into explaining my circumstances , one lady said in a smarmy british voice '' mmm and how can we help ? ''      and another times, one arrogant, man answered with a provocating tone, not really listening , every few seconds saying ' what ? ' ' i cant hear you ' - when i was clearly talking into the receiver.      when he finally seemed to listen he said '' sounds like you took a battering in life there '' in a goading belittling tone .      on both those occasions i lost control of my rage , so enraged that i couldnt even assert myself , words couldnt form into sentences , i was choked with anger my these stupid spineless, cowardly , snivelling.....rude helpline workers.      i erupted and cursed them both out, through clenched teeth , threatening to do some serious damage to them, asking for their ' names ' and ' branches ' where they work at so i can file complaints.   they then - in mid flow of my rage - laugh mockingly - then hang up and one lady even said in a sarcastic , provocative tone -      '' not at all......notttaaa all.............notta all not at all ''' -- all the time whilst laughing and mocking me.      i feel so let down with myself then even over the phone , i lost control of rage , caved in to provocation of these spineless, cowardly '' faceless - slimey helpline workers....      i really overeacted , ripped into them shouted abuse and threats.         i was diagnosed with borderline personality years ago, suffer with PTSD traits to, been doing very well for years, seeking help, controlling behavior.........have a struggle because the help i want is not available because of crappy resources.....and in general the systems failed me.......not give me the proper help for my disorders......im still struggling to get the help..               but how can i get over losing control of rage over the phone in response to be provocated ??            and the fact i couldnt handle myself with people as well as i thought i could ?      couldnt cooly, calmly assert myself because i lost control ?

All I can do is keep breathing and wait for it to pass.      Unfortunately I don't always remember to take small frequent sips to prevent this.

20090304113936AAuqkCc	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	What can I do about this sore throat that's causing me to lose my voice?	Monday was a really bad day for me because I woke up with a high fever and a sore throat. My dad stayed home on Monday because he was sick too. So I went with my dad to run some errands. Even though I wasn't feeling good, I still wanted to get out of the house. I layed in the car the whole time. When we got back from running errands, I went to lay down because my fever didn't get better. I fell asleep for a little while and when I woke up my fever was worse. I got out of bed to take a tylenol pill. I didn't get a chance to take the tylenol because while I was in the kitchen, I felt like I was going to vomit so I started walking to the bathroom. While I was walking I started feeling dizzy so I sat down on the bathroom floor in front of the toilet just in case I was going to vomit. I didn't vomit so I started standing up and felt dizzy again. I decided to lay down on the floor until I felt better. The bathroom floor is tile so it was cold. Laying on it helped my temperature go down. When I felt better, I got up and went back into the kitchen to take a tylenol since I didn't get a chance to take one. After taking it, I checked my temperature and it said 100.08. My fever ended up going away within the hour of taking the tylenol but to this day my throat is still hurting. in fact, it's gotten so bad that I'm losing my voice. What do I do?

20090227065859AAP2T98	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Friend did a 12 hour fast blood test, numbers were good, but still exhibits symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes, why?	My friend is an overweight middle age male who occasionally experiences symptoms of thirst and swolen numb-tingling feet.  He also had a weird little rash on one leg recently and also suffered from  inexplicably sore neck muscles, light-headedness, as well as feelings of fatigue and depression.  He did a 12 hour fasting blood test the other day and the report said all his numbers were in the average to good range.  What gives?  He's showing a lot of the symptoms that someone with Type 2 Diabetes would show.      A couple years ago his glucose level was high, so he went on a diet, lost 30 pounds, and the doctor said he was fine after he lost the weight.  The doc also said he was never diabetic at that time but glucose intolerant.  However, he also said the cheque was in the mail for future problems with diabetes if he didn't continue to lose weight and exercise regularly.  He put on a few pounds since then, had a minor heart attack in June, but made a full recovery.        He never experienced any symptoms of diabetes other than numb swolle feet when he was first told his sugar levels were high.  His doctor told him once he lost a lot more weight the feeling would return to his feet and the feet would stop swelling too.  The doctor at that time thought the numb, tingling, swelling feet was more of a case of poor circulation because of vericose veins as opposed to any sign of sugar diabetes.  Agan, any ideas?      Now, he tells me the symptom of pangs of thirst never happened to him before.  What do you think?  In the last 2 weeks he has eliminated sugar from his diet, is exercising and is eating only nutritious foods.  He says he feels a lot better but once in a while the thirst creeps up and the tingling numb feet (they are no longer swollen when he exercises) come back occasionally.   I'm taking him back to the doctor next week, but I'd like some information from those of you who might have some ideas of what is going on here before I speak to his doctor.  Thanks.

Maternal Great-grandmother diabetic, maternal grandmother diabetic, maternal aunt diabetic (diagnosed in 50's), MY MOM is not.  I was tested for diabetes a couple years ago, they said I don't have it, but I do suffer from hypoglycemia.      I read that hypoglycemia is really common and effects a lot of people.  When I get an attack, I feel scared, anxious, light-headed, times 20.       After a night of drinking, I'm done the next day.  Everything is horrible and I can't get my sugars stable, no matter how much I eat.  I could literally eat a piece of chicken and it still wouldn't stabilize.        Why is that?      Someone told me that i have a good chance of becoming a diabetic b/c right now my pancreas is producing too much insulin and is going super fast and when I get older (I'm 24), my pancreas will be burnout and stop making insulin.      If i get pregnant, will this (having hypoglycemia) be a problem?

20090227070622AAw9Nzk	Health;Dental	How long after an extraction should I wait to have a bridge fitted?	How long to wait for bridge/implant after extraction?   I had my first molar (top right) removed on Wednesday. I had been scheduled for a root canal but elected to have the tooth extracted on my dentists recommendation. She advised that I may not need anything to fill the space however the gap is much larger than I first thought it would be, I am regretting not trying to save it now. For both asthetic and practical reasons I'd like a bridge or implant. I had teeth extracted for overcrowding so only have 1 molar and a wisdom tooth on that side of my mouth now. My dentist advised I'd need to wait for the bone to heal before having any further work. How long does that take?   Also is there a maximum time I should leave it?    Are bridges available on the NHS - my dentist implied they were but have since been led to believe probably not. How much would one cost privately?      Thanks in advance! :D      I think the tooth was past saving. I'd already had it filled twice and the area it is in I grind down alot. My dentist thought it was unlikely a root canal would have saved the tooth but was happy to do it and try. I decided on that recommendation to have it removed. I may have done the wrong thing?       How much is an implant? Do I need to wait for one ?

20090227064759AA5jUQq	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Recently (mis?)Diagnosed with Diabetes?	I recently went to see my doctor for excessive urination,excessifve thirst and tingling in my hands.He conducted a random blood glucose test and came back and said the number was "487" (!!) and concluded that I had diabetes.He started me on Metformin and Glipizide and that seemed to immediately curb all these symptoms.I went back afte 10 days and had another Glucose test and that came up as 85(!!).And I and the doctor both said WOW.But the doctor felt it best to increase my dosage of the Glipizide and asked me to continue taking both the prescriptions twice a day.I have been doing that but I have also noticed that towards the end of the day if I have been hungry for say 6-7 hours,my hands and legs start shaking and my heart starts to beat faster,almost as if I have very low sugars.I need to immediately eat something high in sugar to get back to normal.So for the past 2 days,I completely stopped my medication and am yet to see any of the symptoms come back.So my question is this...am I really diabetic or was I misdiagnosed?Is it possible that the unussually high number I had the first time was from something I ate,but that wouldnt necessarily answer why I was seeing the symptoms of urination,thirst and tingling.Should I get a second opinion from another doctor?   By the way, I am 26, and dont wanna be stuck with having to take medication the rest of my life.Hence this question.   Thanks for replying.

I have tried hydrocortisone 2% cream given my doc--which works but it still comes back after a few days.  I was just given Clomitrazole--which is an antifungal for ringworm..but I dont think its ringworm b/c it does not spread and it itches insanely.      Anyone experience this?  I don't want to keep putting different things on my face!!!

Also it felt like someone was pushing down on my chest, I could still get a full breath of air, but again it didn't feel normal.       This is how it has been since i was like 8, and only with fruits. I haven't had much fruit in a long time, except apples (Those are the only exception to what i described)      But it is also weird because i can eat like Banana Bread and stuff like that that has fruit in it, but nothing happens afterward. Only if the fruit is by itself... So would this be an allergy?         Also my dad is allergic to watermelon (but thats it), if that helps.

OR      Today, for lunch, I had an omelet with a side of strawberries and a chocolate milk shake (sweetened with Stevia)  and my BG was 170 before and 125 after...

I know there is a possibility that my wife can die of cancer, and it is something that I try to not think about, but now she is asking me these hard questions and I  have no answers.

20090304131511AAKnFLL	Health;Mental Health	Bipolar/schizophrenic boyfriend?	My boyfriend is bipolar/schizophrenic.. We have a great relationship for the most part. It's really hard sometimes, but my biggest problem is.. my boyfriend is better with our relationship when he is not on meds. He has been only on antidepressants (lexapro). Well, when we first started dating everything was perfect, we communicated well and handled fights the correct way, talking them out and solving them. Then he started taking his meds, and he would just give up and break up with me. This happened ALL the time. Now he is off his meds again because he hasn't gotten them refilled and our relationship is better then ever. He is trying a new medication, and im worried for the sake of our relationship. =/. We have been dating a little over a year, and truly love eachother, there is no doubt in my mind. Anyways, he has to take his meds obviously because he gets depressed or manic and doesn't wanna see the light of day. Although when he is with me, the majority of the time we laugh and have fun and I make him feel better when he is down. I was just wondering if this was normal, or weird in any way. I know it sounds really confusing, trust me. I didn't add much detail because I wanted to get to the point, but I was hoping maybe somebody might know what I mean?

I live in a very small house with my mom and sisters and it just seems like everytime I come back from school to a messy house, I feel depressed. It's not ALWAYS such a mess, but, when it's a mess, it's a mess and I can't stand it. I try to clean the most I can, but, sometimes I just can't do it anymore because the next day it's just back to being a huge mess and it makes me feel depressed. I mean, I try to just ignore it and stay in my room but I can't stay in my room forever. And when I go downstairs and see the mess, I just get this feeling like I want to cry. Then, I think about the basement which is FILLED with junk and it just adds to my tears.    Is there anything wrong with me or is this normal???   What can I do? Any advice?

A few weeks ago it was so bad in my right hand I couldn't write. I can feel the muscle sort of bubble up and then 'pop' and it's quite irritating, I can often see it too. Any idea what this could be and is it anything serious? (I doubt it is but I'd like some reassurance)      2) Also, for the past 2 days I have felt very ill and very faint. Last night I was putting some tables and chairs away and all of my muscles relaxed and went extremely weak and I nearly dropped whatever I was holding. I also felt as if I was going to vomit. This feeling has been very 'on-and-off' today but it's been making me feel very down as I look extremely pale through the whole day and have to stop mid-conversation as I feel like I'm going to be physically sick.      If anyone could help me understand what either of my problems are and how serious they are then that would be greatly appreciated.

Anyway, I am so freaked out that when I get them off, I might have brown marks, or my enamel has worn away leaving white marks. I drink lots of fizzy drinks, and the first time after  I had my braces tightened, I could hardly put the toothbrush on my teeth, let alone brush them properly as I would end up crying from the pain. So I have some questions.       1) If I did get brown marks, could I get my teeth bleached?   2) If I did get the white marks, would an enamel restoration toothpaste help and what would happen if this did happen.      Please answer my questions, and I know I was stupid back then with the not brushing my teeth thing. Thanks in advance (:

20090304120233AAY2iB4	Health;Mental Health	How do you think a person like me should learn to deal with my emotions....?	Please note, that I am greatly into astrology, and have been for a long time. I have done much research, and I find the following to be completely true about myself:            Your personal ruling planets are Mercury and Moon.      It is one thing expressing your emotions, but it is another swinging from emotional tree to emotional tree. There is no doubt you are a moody individual but still your warmth and direct approach in dealing with people makes you popular and liked by one and all. Try not to allow your desire for the approval of others to undermine your integrity.      You have high imagination, powerful fantasy nature and usually achieve your dreams.            The Virgo Sun/Aquarius Moon combination produces a character which, in part, is very earthbound and practical, coupled with another part which is somewhere above the horizon searching for truth, understanding and knowledge.        Given that this blend features little in the way of human emotion and passion, those who fall under its jurisdiction constantly strive to be aloof from the mundane elements of everyday life.        Periodic moods of emotionalism and romanticism notwithstanding, these individuals are inclined to be cool and self-sufficient at heart.        They can also be rather insensitive in their handling of others. These are natives who will tell others what they think as opposed to what others might want to hear, which comes with the expectancy that people will be big enough to handle it. In short, those born of this combination practice supreme objectivity. This is not to say that such natives are unsympathetic souls, rather that they are totally objective in their way of looking at things as opposed to being just a "bleeding heart."        Here, sympathy and understanding is utilized without allowing personal judgment to become overly-clouded with emotion. In romance, the intellectual connection (and perhaps romantic idealism) is more important to these subjects than the emotional and physical aspects of love.        However, they can easily become absorbed and occupied with an idea or plan. In short, these are true mental explorers who dream and scheme in an attempt to satisfy the inherent endless curiosity.        Virgo Sun/Aquarius Moon natives tend to be somewhat suspicious, critical and judicial.       Their minds may frequently be unconventional but they are usually guided by a sound analytical and intuitive sense.         SOOOOOO.      Knowing all this, how do you suggest someone like me should learn to deal eith my emotions and get to know that part of myself better?

20090304124552AAsM4kS	Health;Other - Health	Ok..Don't know what to write as of its question....I just feel sad and it had to be a long question.Sorry =(?	Sorry if its too long....Don't know from where to start actually as my case was a bit different than others. I'm a girl and always liked the way I looked and not only me but sooo many others also believed that I look cute. But again I was the one who liked my own looks most of all. I had confident, and I hated any kind of surgery. However in our country almost all the girls go for surgeries like 'nose job'. But my nose was really good and I liked it so much. to make the story short ...I dont have a nice and supportive family at all, my parents have always been terifying for me as a girl and then for my younger brother too. And I am 27 years old girl and and in our culture we have to live with parents as long as we are single. However I am planning to move abroad soon. But under a very hard situation after I feeled that I am ashamed to go out and to see the neighbours, as of the shouts of my father and his mad behaviour, with the pressure of my depressed mom (me who has always been the most happy and smiling girl) went under the surgery with having like 100% doubt. I know it has partly been my responsible to avoide making what I didnt like happen. But now I have lost my favorite looks and nobody notices the surgery but everybody just like me see the bad changes that I have gotten. Many doesnt notice my surgery but I have a very deep feeling of "missing my own looks, the nose I liked and though was not all perfect from others views but I liked it so much and changed it just for even unknowns. Feeling like having done something vain and having a deep feeling like have hurt myself and having lost a part of me :(. That said I am and have always been the one who didnt even like to put much make up and was beautiful and cute the way I was :(. Yeah this nose is somehow making me very sad each day. It has been 8 months (I know they say it takes 1 year for full recovery). But I cannot imagine much good changes in the rest 4 months actually either.   I know my own nose doesnt come back...But this has actually hurt me more than enough :( I'm somehow getting sick of this nose that I dont like even a bit of it....It just happened with me not liking to do so....I just sometimes think it has happened like a nightmare and I cannot get rid of it. How can I be happy again? any expereinces or nice and kind advices?      Looking forward for your replies....(trying to find remedies actually as it makes me so sad, for someone like me who liked everything only in their natural way :( )

20090304125237AA1k78n	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Antierior Cervical surgery 9 months ago. Still in pain?	I had cervical surgery for c-5 & c-6 about 9 months ago.  I am still in pain and get headaches. I still feel like I have the pinced nerves in both sides of my neck, they are actually worse than before.  I have a low tolerance to pain but a high tolerance to pain medications.  I been all the way up to perocet 10 mg, all different muscle relaxers. Nothing seem to be working. The problem I am having is with my doctor and his staff.  I have never seen such rudeness and patient neglect in all my life.  they left me in terrible (emergency room) pain for a week one time.  I call to either get a prescription refilled or changed. I get an attitude and a 15 minute drug addiciton lecture from the nurse. The doctors doesn't call back. you only deal with the nurses, they are the ones filling the prescriptions and getting the doctors okay. when i go in for a follow-up, the nurse does the exam and then the doctor comes in for about 2 minutes.  I tell the nurse at every visit that I am still in pain and the meds are not working.  The write it down then the doctor comes in I tell him the same thing, he looks at me and smiles (stupidly) and says I'll see you at your next appointment. I am at my wits end. I called them today, they want to put me on about my 7th round of steriods to see if that will help. DAAAAA it didn't work in the past why would they think it would work now. I just recently asked them about 3 weeks ago to try and drop me back down to Vicodin 7.5 to see how it would work, (I don't like how the percocets were making me feel, sleepy and sick) Well the Vicodin is not working and they are giving me a hard time about changing it. I don't know what to do. I am getting very upset. I even have called my primary doctor about him, but he doesn't want to touch me cause right now I am under the care of the neurosurgeon. Which by the way I feel has a GOD complex.

I was put in a cast for about a month and the doctors took it off.  i can walk around on it fine, no major limp, i can still run and such, however from time to time after long work hours or playing sports or just running my knee starts to hurt.  Its only that knee.  If i take x rays all the doctors see the chip and immediately put me in a knee brace or an immobilizer.  However it doesnt do anything and I take it off.  I have taken some pain killers for it before when it gets really bad, a few vikodens help get through the pain for the time being and eventually after sleep it feels fine until i reaggrivate it.  I do not want to go into surgery, I cant afford it, and I honestly dont want to risk what I do have going on.  I enjoy playing basketball and tennis, and dont want to have a surgery that might stop me from doing that.  Any help would be really appreciated.        Thanks for those who help.

I was so oblivious to the past that I don't dare to look back at it because I was a different person back then; there were opportunities I should have taken, chances I should have used, things I could have done to be somebody in this society.      That was years ago but even today, I still have feelings of underappreciation, sadness, and worthlessness. Even though I have plenty of friends, I don't feel like I deserve them, like I just feel completely worthless for them. I'm a shy person, and my parents always seem to blame themselves because of it, and you have no idea how much I hate that, it's as if they hate me for being so quiet...and that just brought me down even further. I used to lie quite often during earlier years, which prompt my mom to not believe me back then.

When I look back, I feel the need to kill myself because of all the time I had wasted because of my feelings. I always used to think that everyone would be better off without me, after all, I am just another human being. I don't know my purpose, I don't know why God has allowed me to suffer this way for so long. I just don't understand what's wrong with me...?      I can't stop lying to my parents about every small thing because of insecurities, it's been this way for a long time. I tell them I've been trying so hard to stop, but they lash back saying that it shouldn't BE hard. They always blame themselves because of my shyness, they expect me to be perfect...and I can't live up to their expectations. I don't feel good enough for anyone. I just can't stand being alive anymore. Please help me.

I literally couldn't move AT ALL. It hurt real bad to get up and move, and I still get a little dizzy standing.

20090304135633AAYWhQm	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	Do you think I had an allergic reaction to Vicodin?	Yesterday in the early afternoon I had my right wisdom teeth pulled out. I was awake and only given novocain to numb me up. Procedure was great, went by quickly and the rest of the day I spent drooling on myself with an ice pack on my face. I barely at anything besides a little cup of yogurt and a bowl of congee (rice soup). I took my first amoxicillin at around 4:30, then the next one around 10. Then at about 11:30 I took one vicodin 5/500. At about 12 my hands started to get really cold and tingly, I just thought it was because my heat wasn't on. Then I became extremely light headed and nauseous. By then the whole top of my head felt like cold like ice tingles. I got up and could barely feel my legs and sat on the floor in the bathroom waiting to vomit. I gagged a few times and was sure I was going to throw up the vicodin but nothing came up. I looked in the mirror and my face was ghost pale and all around my eyes were red, like they were swollen. I had never looked like that pale in my life. I almost fell asleep on the toilet a few times but woke up because I felt like I couldn't breathe or that my pulse was stopping. Is this normal for a first time using vicodin? Or am I allergic? I asked my doctor and he said its a narcotic so it's normal to have those reactions...

They gave me a shot of some steroid to help "open up my lungs" along with a breathing treatment and took xrays.  My oxygen level was 97 when I left and hadn't been that low.  I had pneumonia before, so I am very careful with these things (explaining why I went to the ER).      It feels like there is something in/beneath my throat.  This happened to me before when I used my inhaler (it irritates me sometimes).  I used it last week.      For some reason, though, when I breathe through my mouth it sounds raspy and when I try to "cough up": whatever might be in there, there seems to be nothing.      Does anyone have any ideas?  I have asthma brought on by the pneumonia from two years ago, but I have never had an 'attack'.      My xrays looked clear, no infection.. nothing weird.  I just feel so dry and raspy.

A few days ago I felt really sick throughout the day, constantly feeling nauseous and having diarrhoea, and could barely eat anything as a result (my stomach just always felt full).      Thankfully the next day I was sort of fine but now it’s been about 2 ? days and I haven’t been able to go to the loo. My appetite has also really decreased. Even though I only had weetabix this morning for instance I felt really full afterwards like I’d had a huge meal and couldn’t eat anything else for hours. Then I felt fairly hungry again by midday so had a banana sandwich for lunch and then got the same completely stuffed feeling.   This seems really strange to me, especially since I haven’t been eating anything different. I took a laxative this morning but it hasn’t made a difference.   Does this just sound like normal constipation or should I visit my doctor. I’m a bit embarrassed about it.

Also, My periods had stoped from September to February 17, which is normal for Mirena, however, when I had my period in February was when i noticed that the strings of the mirena had moved. Could this have been when it came out of place? If so, could i be fertile again? The last time I had sex was on 3/2. They say sperm can live inside you for 3-5 days.

Ok well I just started going to this weight doctor that gives me b-12 shot, b complex vitamin with other things in it, and a 30 mlg of phentermine. Well I have been doing okay with the diet. I cheat sometimes if I know that I have to have it and when I do I dont eat as much as I used to. Well I have been wanting to go back to the gym to kind of lose weight with this diet program and I was told by a couple of physician assistants that the best way to do it is to do your diet and when you work out only do cardio, treadmill, oliptical, and bike. They said by doing that you will lose your weight alot more faster because you are burning, not if you were lifting weights or doing abs because you are just building muscle and of course we all know that it weighs.

20090227071417AAD54Wr	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	I have a problem. Help?	I have a cold-like disease (runny nose, nasal congestion, NO fever (max 36.9), cough, and a scratchy throat, but no pain to it, just an irritation). I am also constipated. Also, I am VERY stressed because I fear contamination of HIV when I stepped on a rusted pin head needle. I will make a test in a few days, but also, the doctors told me the result might not be true after 12 weeks to 6 months after infection. Anyway, could this be the first symptoms of HIV? Or those are the symptoms of any other disease... or just a common cold? Thanks.

20090304134136AAsJpIf	Health;Mental Health	I'm 15. help please- self harm/suicidal!!?	okay..so before i start, i just want to ask for no negative comments, or people to say i needed to get help and all that sort of thing..because i know what i'm doing is bad and that i need help. It's just i dont know how to get it.   I've had counselling and anger management but hated both. I just couldn't talk about anything because i felt stupid.   I hate myself, and i'm rubbish at everything i touch, although my family seem to think the complete opposite.    However..this is what i'm confused about      ...   Last year i started to self harm, i was doing it a while then eventually told my mum in an arguement whilst i was upset. Really regretted telling her straight away. anyway..things moved on and i promised not to do it again. I carried on cutting my arms belly legs anywhere i couldwith scissors. Hiding it away!! Then the teacher found out and rang home and told mum and dad to come in. They were heartbroken and went crazy!! i then got given the oppurtunity to go to counselling..so i did a few months later. I hated it and mum didnt want me going and made me feel guilty about going. when i was on the waiting list for counselling, i promised again never to cut myself. i had all sharp objects removed from me, however, i then took a pencil sharpener apart and got the blade from it. i started cuttig with this, still hiding it away and ot telling anyone. Mum regualry checks my arms so i started to cut my legs.   I stopped harming all the time i was having counselling and was proud of myself, however..I cut again a few weeks ao at teh top of my legs. But it didnt feel the same. I hated it adn felt really stupid. but i'm getting urges to do it again. I've tried ice cubes/elastic bands etc and none work! since not cutting i have had regular suicidal thoughts. I dont want to feel like this anymore, but how can i tell my mum!? i want to go to the doctors, but mum thinks im just a moody teenager!! please any help would be grateful!! thank you x
20090304134914AAv8qjE	Health;Mental Health	If you had to, would you rather...?	go to a Psychiatrist or go to a Psychologist?      If you don't know the difference, I psychiatrist can prescribe medicine and a psychologist can't. A psychologist will try to fix an underlying problem and a psychiatrist is more likely to prescribe medicine that will fix your emotions, etc. They will probably still address the problems, just not as much as a psychologist.

I had two wisdom teeth pulled last Saturday and I had a lingual frenectomy done, too. The first few days was constant PAIN. But now, there is not so much pain and it seems that my tongue is healing ahead of schedule. They said I wasn't going to be able to eat solid foods or talk for a least a week. But I am already doing both. The sockets where my wisdom teeth used to be are healing nicely, too. I gargle with salt water 4x a day and I had nothing but really, really healthy foods since (no junk /processed foods, no sugar). Mostly fresh steamed vegetables, fresh fruit, beans, and some soft chicken.      But what was surprising now to my senstive stomach has become. I get a HORRIBLE stomache when I take my regular multivitamin and when I drink V8 juice. Why? Also, to all my friend's shock, I didn't take the amoxicillin antibiotic that was prescibed to me. I had way too many bad experiences with anitibiotics (yeast infections, bad stomaches, etc). I felt confident that my body is strong enough to fight or prevent any infection. Since its been 6 days since the oral surgery, do you really think I need to take these antibiotics? What do you think?

My boyfriend of 2years and the father of my son, is using prescriptions drugs ( percs and vicoden). In the past he was open about using, and sometimes I would do them with him. After time I began to realize he was developing a pattern and encouraged him to stop. When that did not work his mother and I confronted him, he said he would quit and it wouldn't be a problem.    Soon after I noticed the signs again, for example: Pin point pupils, red blotchy face, money missing, ECT. After months of arguing and accusing him he finally gave in and said he had a problem. He convinced his mother he could stop without help and she fell for it.    Recently I began to see the sings again and they have gotten worse. He has sold his X-Box and games has had Hundreds of dollars missing and has become very angry. I have tried many times to get him to admit he is using again but he insists I am wrong. He says I need to stop making assumptions. How can I help him if I cant even get him to say he is doing them. I cant just sit here while he lies all the time. whether he wants help, I need to at least get him to admit he is doing them; then I can take the next step.      PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!

20090304133548AAVBnoH	Health;Mental Health	Do I have anxiety or not?	Since July I have been having random bouts of chest tightness and/or chest pain.  My resting heart rate is around 110-120 bpm.  Sometimes I will start shaking, get sweat palms, hands and fingers turn purple, arm and leg spasms that I can't control.  I have probably been sent to the ER at least 20 times since it began in July.  Have had every test under the sun done.  Have gone into Ventricular Tachycardia 2 times, have been admitted to the hospital 3 times.  On top of it all I have lost 45 lbs.  Have had hundred of EKGs; they almost always show a Long QT wave, and twice the docs have seen PVCs.  They say that there is nothing wrong with my heart so they have been treating me for anxiety.  I never feel stressed, anxious or depressed.  Have been on 2 different anti-depressants and obviously they haven't worked.  I am pretty sure I don't have anxiety but the docs don't know what else to look for.  Can anyone help?

I feel like the only important things in my life are the search for truth, family, friends, and to love life and everyone else on Earth simply because they are fellow human beings who somehow ended up here on this planet.  Most people are trapped in their minds, and are angry, self-conscious, and are desperate for meaning. I see all this hate and pain, but i also see that humans have good deep within them reaching for enlightenment. I don't fit in much to this American culture which has an emphasis on selfishness and externalized self-appreciation, i love people, i just don't fit anywhere, i waz tired of it being such a huge struggle in my mind so i decided to stop trying to be a part of the wave and simply live in my own world of quiet solitude in my own mind. i have bipolar disorder and am wondering if it has caused my mindset to be drastically altered to this extent?

20090304142318AAmFO6W	Health;Mental Health	What kind of mental disorder do I have? OCD?	These past few weeks, I've been so anxious and feeling a whole bunch of emotions. Fear. Depression. Anger (at myself). The other day I went to the doctor's to ask my condition. He believes I don't have OCD, but he referred me to a psychiatrist for a better diagnosis. Here's my deal guys, tell me what do you think.      1. Everytime I read or listen to something a tad confusing (in grammar). I try my best to understand it, and I do. However, I get really anxious and I feel want to keep repeating it until it feels proper and right. Before I'd ritualize on one thought for like an hour. But now I realized to stop and wait until my anxiety and that particular thought is GONE. I still despise the anxious feeling! :@ And when it is actually confusing, I try my best to understand it by simplifying it into others words. However, it's like my mind has to properly understand it in the confusing words. It's makes me really fustrated and anxious as the more times I say the more confused and anxious I get.      2. If I read something that I do understand, sometimes I get fixated on it and feel like "Oh, what if I don't understand it" The same thing in the number one happens.      3. Because of all of this, I fear that I can't read a novel for pleasure or english class because of the reasons above. I honestly have mixed feelings. Fear of the anxious feeling, and anger at myself for even doing it. Also, I now have a bit of trouble falling asleep. Sometimes when I'm just about to be sleepy, I get a random rush of anxiety for reason. This is so fustrating. OMFG.

The last time we let things go to far without a condom.  The day after I was so sore, I could barley sit down, that lasted for about a week, after that I started seeing sort of a yeasty brownish color in my underwear (not sure if it is a yeast infection or something worse) Right after the unprotected sex I found a large bump inside my vagina.  It really scared me, it is still there but not as big.      Also everytime we try to have sex it is impossible because it hurts me to much.  We have tried using lube, and lots of foreplay but nothing works, it just puts me in pain. We also used a toy, thinking that it might be better than my man, because he is on the large side.      I know I need to see a doctor but I'm nervous and really am not to found of doctors.  Anyway I'm not sure if i should see the general family doctor, or an OB/GYN

A few nights ago i used like bleach cream or whatever on my face, and everything went fine with that. But throughout the night i had like a sensation that something was like pussing and stuff on my lip. When i woke up in the morning there was something of a bump. I don't know if it is a cold sore (herpes) or a pimple/zit. I haven't used any "official" medical cold sore treatment on it; just chapstick (carmex) and it is getting close to being gone about 2 days later. Anyone have any idea what it is?

I am 22 yrs old, Last nite out of pure boredom I decided to weigh myself and was shocked to see i measured out at 243 lbs.

20090304144249AAfe1VB	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Chiropractor messed up my neck, should I confront him?	Three years ago I began seeing a friend from high school that is a chiropractor, for my lower back problems.  He began a treatment plan that involved my entire spine saying that no spine problems were the result of one area of the spine.   He would do adjustments to my back, and also do rotations on my neck, which sometimes cause him to pull muscles.  I began having trouble with my neck and upper back last summer, which he said was from stress.  So, he advised that I come more often, at least once a week.  After each adjustment, I only felt good for a few hours then I would go into horrible neck and upper back spasms.  His recommendation, to come more often.  The past two weeks the spasms have been so bad, I saw a physical medicine doctor from work.  I am now getting physical therapy two times a week, and have been told that my head is so hyper flexible that it is probably from the twisting rotations during the adjustments. The therapist said my head moves abnormally, causing the spasms from my muscles trying to hold my head in alignment.  Now, I don't know what to say to him (the chiropractor).  He gets very argumentative when I try to tell him anything medical, he is against doctors except for life threatening emergencies.  I am thinking of just telling him I cannot afford it anymore rather than get into a debate with him.

She called the doctor and had him prescribe her an antibiotic. Of course she told them her allergies and they phoned her in a prescription. When I went to pick it up it was one she was allergic to.       The medication messes up her heart and she already is on propanolol for it. She calls the pharmacy. They knew she was allergic to it because it was on her file but gave it to her anyway. She called them and tried to get them to give her another medicine and they couldn't. She called both her doctors and they weren't in.       She called the pharmacy back and asked if she was going to have it billed to insurance and the pharmacist said no. To make sure of this she sent me back out to the pharmacy to insure it. I get there and they say sorry there is nothing we can do. The same pharmacist who told her she could and now its oh sorry its going to be billed to insurance your screwed.      So can they get in trouble for    1.) Giving her a medicine she is allergic to when they had it on file?   2.) Lying to her either way on insurance?

20090227073110AA9sd4W	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	What condition is Dull, achy, numb, irritated back hamstrings.?	I have been in the process for about a year and half of trying to figure this out and I'm currently working with a doctor who is stumped.  My condition is that it is painful/uncomfortable to sit down.  Basically where ever there is weight or contact with the chair my back hamstrings/glutes (mostly hamstrings) feel a dull ache , numb, irritated.  Originally I thought it was maybe a rash, but there is nothing on the on my skin to indicate that. It is kind of hard to explain but that is the best I can do.  The condition is allievated when I stand or kneel.  Basically when i have no contact with my backside.  Here are the things i have tried, 1) Astym physical therpay, 2) Reg. Phsy therapy 3) Xrays 4) Two MRI's 5) Chiropractic 6) Massage Therapy.   7) Steriodal medicine pack (Medrol?) 8) Naoproxen & Pregabalin? (one or both of these gave me a reaction) .  All of these were suggested by doctors but with minimal results.  Dr. thinks maybe a sciatica, piriformus or something like that.  The last thing we are now talking about is an steroidal injection.  I'm a pretty healthy and fit guy in my late 20's. I have an office jobs so I'm constantly siting and that is how this came on a year+ ago.  To alleviate pain i either stand or kneel at my desk. Could this be skin related? Any ideas or help?

20090227074108AA42Uib	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Pain on right side of chest?	I have a random pain on the right side of my chest.  It feels to be pretty deep inside my body, basically under my right breast (left, if you were facing me) and up my side into my armpit area.  It comes and goes, and isn't really constant and I haven't noticed anything that triggers it.  Sometimes during sex it aches when my partner thrusts (sorry to get detailed).  Anyone have any idea what this might be? It doesn't feel like a lung or anything, and it almost never occurs when I exercise.  thanks.
