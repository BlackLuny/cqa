20061127011151AAqLoRv	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Pourquoi devient-il impossible d'aborder une jeune parisienne pour lui proposer de boire un café ?	Effectivement, je constate de plus en plus fréquemment que certaines d'entre elles paraissent se sentir littéralement agressées, comme si l'on voulait les violenter... Elles fuient le jeune homme galant qui s'approche d'elles pour leur adresser la parole et leur proposer de passer un petit moment autour d'un café pour faire connaissance (café offert par la maison, au passage)...      Etant un jeune homme de bonne famille à l'éducation respectueuse, je m'interroge sur cette tendance sociologique féminine au renfermement sur soi, à l'exlusion de l'autre.      Merci pour vos réponses.

20070509190544AAGrdlj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is anyone going to watch the debate on Niteline tonight Athiests vs Christians?	Why are Kirk Cameron, a preacher, and two self-proclaimed atheists coming together in a church this weekend? Because Cameron and preacher Ray Comfort claim that they "can prove the existence of God."      They'll take on the atheists in the first "Nightline Face-Off," a debate to be moderated by "Nightline" anchor Martin Bashir.      Editor's Picks      Reject God: Take the Blasphemy Challenge      Kirk Cameron, From Sitcom Star to Evangelist   Watch the Face-Off Wednesday May 9 at 2 p.m. on ABC News Now, and on Nightline at 11:35 p.m.         Following the Way of the Master   As Mike Seaver, the oldest son in the smash hit sitcom "Growing Pains," actor Kirk Cameron could make audiences roll with laughter. But now he wants to bring them to the Lord. And he's deadly serious.      In March 2006, "Nightline" profiled the Way of the Master, a Christian ministry headed by Cameron and itinerant preacher Ray Comfort. Operating as a charitable trust, its intention is to educate and equip the church to preach the message of Christianity to nonbelievers. Cameron says he is motivated by a literal fear of hell.      "I believe the Scriptures teach that there's a literal heaven and a literal hell, just like Jesus said," he explained. "And without forgiveness of sins that, yeah, the place of punishment is called hell."      The Way of the Master has a weekly television show for which Comfort and Cameron literally hit the streets in the name of Jesus, challenging nonbelievers that their sins against God will lead directly to hell.      "On the Day of Judgment," Comfort tells one man on the streets of New York, "God will see you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart. You have sinned against God. You need his forgiveness."      On occasions, things go badly wrong and the pair are attacked by members of the public. Comfort recalled one incident, saying, "While I was preaching the Gospel a gentleman came up and he started spitting on me. And he spat quite a few times." Comfort says he simply remained calm and moved on.      Neither Comfort nor Cameron has theological degrees nor any kind of formal training. But Cameron says he's convinced his new career is vitally important.      "I have no authority. I am simply trying to be faithful to the God who saved me, who changed me and who has commissioned me to tell you and those who are watching this interview … about the Gospel of Jesus Christ and that it has the power to change people's hearts."         The Rational Response Squad   "There isn't any good reason to believe in God," so says Brian Sapient, a member of the Rational Response Squad, a group of atheists "Nightline" profiled in JanuaryWhat's wrong with God? "What's wrong with the tooth fairy?" asks Brian. "There's nothing wrong with something that most likely doesn't exist."      "Atheists are completely vilified. And it's OK," says Kelly, an atheist who works alongside Brian and also asks that her last name not be used.      Editor's Picks      Reject God: Take the Blasphemy Challenge      Kirk Cameron, From Sitcom Star to Evangelist   "It's actually OK to hate atheists," Kelly says. "We are like the last group that people overwhelmingly agree it's OK to hate, because there's an absurd caricature of atheism out there."      While their theological views differ from the Way of the Master, their approaches are similar -- brash and in-your-face. The Rational Response Squad challenges people to take the Blasphemy Challenge in which they make videos of themselves denouncing or blaspheming the Holy Spirit, and then post them on YouTube.      One of the posts is by a young-looking man named Chandler. He says, "I've come to the conclusion that alongside the fact that there is no Santa Claus and there is no Easter bunny, there is also no God. So, without further ado, my name is Chandler and I deny the existence of the Holy Spirit."      Taking risks with your own soul is one thing, but the Rational Response Squad advertises for the Blasphemy Challenge on Web sites for teens, such as Tiger Beat (tigerbeatmag.com).      "They have already been targeted," Brian says. "So hopefully, they are at a point where they are not so indoctrinated and set in their ways that they can overcome this religious superstition that has been put into their brain unfairly."      At the end of the "Nightline" segment, Brian Sapient says, "If they [the Christians] want to come to the table and present their evidence, I will present my evidence. And we will see how much of theirs is based on faith, and how much of mine is based on fact."         The Face-Off   Ray Comfort saw the piece on the Blasphemy Challenge and he immediately e-mailed "Nightline" to say that "We would like to challenge them to a public debate. … Let's hear their best evidence as to why God doesn't exist, and let the audience decide whose evidence is based on faith and whose is based on fact. We cannot only prove that God exists, but we can prove that the atheist doesn't."The two sides have agreed to debate in the first "Nightline" Face-Off. Here's what they have to say about the debate:      Perhaps you think that anyone who says that he can prove the existence of God is a dreamer. Maybe, like most people, you believe that the issue is a matter of "faith." Then we must be dreamers, because we can prove that God exists, scientifically, absolutely, without mentioning faith or even the Bible. Do you find that hard to believe? Then watch the debate. - Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron      Editor's Picks      Reject God: Take the Blasphemy Challenge      Kirk Cameron, From Sitcom Star to Evangelist   We are dedicated to responding to irrational claims -- such as the ones being put forth by Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron that they can prove the existence of God scientifically. We are here to prove that not only can they not do that, but that it cannot be done using the scientific method and the knowledge available to us today.   - The Rational Response Squad         You can watch the debate on ABC News Now on May 9 at 2 p.m., and it will also be available on the "Nightline" page at ABCNews.com.   "Nightline" will air a segment that same night at 11:35 p.m ET.

20070716175420AApQ8Qz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should Churches Remain Tax Exempt?	The recent LA counta abuse case settlement is very telling indeed. A $600+ million settlement, the lions share will be paid through the sale of 51 unused properties in the county alone. And I'm willing to bet there are quite a other properties availiable.      Churches rake in billions of dollars a year through the "business" of faith. Yes, your church is a business since your relationship with God will be just fine if you conduct it at the foot of your bed and Jesus expressed no interest in a $300 million glass cathedral anywhere in the Bible as far as I know.      Add to this the fact that many clergy ACTIVELY insinuate themselves in the secular realm by telling parishoners who to vote for or threatening to withhold Communion from those who vote for a particular candidate.       If you're essentially building a real estate and rare art empire, raking in $ AND insinuating yourself into the secular world, why SHOULDN'T you pony up your share, like any corporation?

The bible also says that " God is a spirit. They that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth" 1 spirit. 1 truth. I don't want to "get it wrong". My soul is riding on it. Also I read about the woman with issue of blood. When she touched him. Jesus asked. Who touched me? The disiples said many touched him. But Jesus felt virture flow from him. He didn't know who touched him. If Jesus was a man. How could he call her daughter the next min.

20090225152427AAlhiL6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question for Mormons regarding conversion techniques, tactics . . . (read on)?	My church also does the door-to-door thing every so often; we're Missouri Synod Lutheran, so that's kind of a rare thing for us, and I think we pretty much just go when we can get it fairly well organized.  (Actually, we get lists of who's new in the area and surrounding zip codes, so it's not really door-to-door, but I digress.)      Anyway, when we are told that the homeowner, tenant, etc. has a church home already, of any denomination, we *do* invite them to ours for a visit, but that's it.  I/we pretty much have no problem with the idea of all denominations being represented in Heaven.  On the other hand, last time I discussed with the Sisters, I was told that my baptism was invalid etc., after I informed them that we are Lutheran.  I have no problem with that being your perspective, even though I disagree.  And I really have no problem discussing with all y'all.  (In fact, one of you here on Y!A has been an invaluable sounding board.)      My point is -- why is the fact that many/most Christians are NOT Mormon a relatively big deal to y'all?  True, one follows the doctrine that one believes is the inspired Truth (or the closest thing to it, lol), and if you didn't want others to feel the same way, why follow it?  However, do you think that this may have something to do with the common perception of Mormonism as a "cult"?      I hope this has made some semblance of sense . . . thanks all for your answers!

I had a good friend who used a sperm donor and as a result had triplets.  She already had three adopted kids but wanted the experience of carrying a child and giving birth.  I found it strange that someone would use a random guys sperm, but I know people do it all the time.  What are your thoughts on this?      *Any rude comments directed to the LDS church will be reported.

First off, the big three (in decline and bolstered by the government) are experts in their particular specialty of mythology/spirituality, so I do not understand why the Christians, since the old testament gets them in soooo much trouble, should just leave that part up to the Jewish to teach and the Ishmael story (Islam) could be included during that phase.  Each could come up with their own proportion of the curriculum as long as the experts were teaching their respective areas of expertise.

She's having a serious operation next week and now we're all extremely worried and paranoid. What else could this mean??

Then she asked me whether I would allow my children to date gay people I said no.      Well anyway my teacher got involved and said people were born gay. He said you just don't wake up and choose to be gay just like you don't just wake up and choose to be black when your white or choose love something you hate. He said its genetic. I don't agree with him. How can you be born gay?       My question is are you born gay or do you choose to be gay?

I was wearing brown high heeled knee high boots that night. He started rubbing my leg, unzipped them and took them off for me. At first I blushed at little because I had on these white socks with a pink heel and toe but he just smiled, took them off and chucked them aside. We've been going out for 8 months and this is the first time hes done it. Im probably being paranoid but have others experienced anything similar with their bf's?

Can someone please see if it makes sense and make any corrections if needed?       "El padre cambia la manera en que le habla a su hijo, de la forma tu por la forma usted. Cuando el usa la forma tu, el esta sintiendo compasion para su hijo como un padre debe. Pero, el padre usa la forma usted cuando he enojado y indignado a su hijo porque el piense que su hijo es una persona mala. En estas partes del cuento, la conversacion es sobre la madre del hijo y que el padre esta ayundando el hijo solo para su madre. Yo creo que el padre hace esto porque lo muestra que el padre no tiene amor por el chico y no acepta el como su hijo."      I'm trying to say: The father changes the way that he talks to his son with from the tu form to the usted form. When he uses the tu form, he is feeling compassion for his son the way a father should. But, he uses the used form when he becomes angry and disgusted at his son because he thinks his son is a bad person. In these parts of the story, the conversation is about the mother of the son and that the father is helping his son only for his (the son's) mother. I think that the father does this to show that he doesn't have love for the boy and doesn't accept him as his son.       Thank you very much. Sorry, my Spanish sucks.

Best case,I might be a little sore and moody,with a little extra money and she gets pregnant w/out her pills:) You can email through my profile if you've got a lot of info.

Husband, Wives, and “dates” are of course welcome in addition to the grads. Cost is $70 per person, which includes buffet dinner, cash bar and reunion T-shirt and DJ playing all of our favorite songs from the good old days. Mr. Fisk and many of our other teachers—some now retired—are also being invited to attend ( free of charge). Please try to make it the reunion won’t be the same without you. You can complete the enclosed pre registration form indicating your intention to attend and your t-shirt size. We’d also like payment (or at least a $30/ person deposit) at this time.

Do you believe these laws are just and should remain, even though they are rarely enforced? If so, do you think they should be enforced? If not, do you believe they were wrong to begin with?      Should the Supreme Court step in an rule against these laws as a violation of privacy and/or free speech? If not, why?

I saw unfamiliar colors and they were so bright. Then I stop and right in front of me was a circle of white light. Then two dark figures started to emerge out of the light. The stopped and looked at me. Then everything went dark for along time and I was unaware that I was even in the world. I didn't dream about anything else that night.      What's going on? Was it just a bad dream or am being dealt with spiritually?

My girlfriend and i have been together since Feb 04 (ages 12 & 13), we've had our ups and downs (not sure where we are right now), but we've agreed we'll marry in the future and have children.

As we are still living seperate (although if i got pregnant now we would be living together before it was born), are very short on money and i am short on time to revise for A-levels let alone take care of a baby i have said no.       But the problem is that my girlfriend doesn't want to take no for an answer... how do i get her to take no for an answer without us arguing?? because otherwise i could see it breaking us up.. which i don't want because i love her and am excited for our lives together.

I Don't ask for any handouts and I am currently a full time Nursing student. I live in an apartment that i can afford until the glory days when i become an RN and can buy the house of my dreams.  i used to live in a 3 bedroom (same apartment complex) until my oldest son turned 14, so now we have been transfered to a 4 bedroom so that he can have his own room and privacy. Im happy that he has his own room, but i live in the downstairs unit and my neighbor upstairs has 6 kids. Yes you read right 6 ! I understand that there will be noise since these are apartments but these people have worked my last nerve!  They allow the kids to run in the apartment, dribble the basketballs and then when the kids are asleep the moms go at it moving furniture at all hours of the night walking hard. But the worst part is every morning they get up at 6:00 a.m. every morning and wake me and my family up. i have not rested since i moved in 5 months ago. there is never any peace in my apartment. One of the kids told my son that they make noise on purpose because i complain. I have asked them nicely to keep the noise down and banged the broom on the ceiling. i have even asked the managment several times to notify them of their excessive noise and nothing has helped. Managment asked me not to call the police and they will handle it but they have not done s**t. Does anyone have any suggestions on what else i can do? I need my peace to study. Hell i just need peace period. I pay the cost to be the boss in my house, but my neighbor is running it. HELP!!!!      P.S. the worst part is i leave the house or sit in my car sometimes just to study or get some peace and quiet.

20081114124949AAf7mxi	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How Do You Feel About This:?	WHITE GUILT IS NOW DEAD:   Look at my fellow conservatives! There they go, glumly shuffling along, depressed by the election aftermath. Not me. I'm virtually euphoric. Don't get me wrong. I'm not thrilled with America 's flirtation with neo socialism. But there's a massive silver lining in those magical clouds that lofted Barak Obama to the Presidency. For today, without a shred of intellectually legitimate opposition, I can loudly proclaim to America : The Era of White Guilt is over.       This seemingly impossible event occurred because the vast majority of white Americans didn't give a fluff about skin color, and enthusiastically pulled the voting lever for a black man. Not just any black man. A very liberal black man who spent his early career race-hustling banks, praying in a racist church for 20 years, and actively worked with America-hating domestic terrorists. Wow! Some resume! Yet they made Barak Obama their leader. Therefore, as of Nov 4th, 2008, white guilt is dead.       For over a century, the millstone of white guilt hung around our necks, retribution for slave-owning predecessors. In the 60s, American liberals began yanking that millstone while sticking a fork in the eye of black Americans, exacerbating the racial divide to extort a socialist solution. But if a black man can become President, exactly what significant barrier is left? The election of Barak Obama absolutely destroys the entire validation of liberal white guilt. The dragon is hereby slain.       So today, I'm feeling a little "uppity," if you will. From this day forward, my tolerance level for having my skin color hustled is now exactly ZERO. And it's time to clean house. No more Reverend Wright's "God Damn America ," Al Sharpton's Church of Perpetual Victimization , or Jesse Jackson's rainbow racism. Cornell West? You're a fraud. Go home. All those "black studies" programs that taught kids to hate whitey? You must now thank Whitey. And I want that on the final.       Congressional Black Caucus? Irrelevant. Maxine Waters? Shut up. ACORN? Outlawed. Black Panthers? Go home and pet your kitty. Black separatists? Find another nation that offers better dreams. Go ahead. I'm waiting.       Gangsta rappers? Start praising America . Begin with the Pledge of Allegiance. And please.no more ebonics. Speak English, and who knows where you might end up? Oh, yeah.pull up your pants. Your underwear is showing. You look stupid.       To those Eurosnots who forged entire careers hating America ? I'm still waiting for the first black French President.       And let me offer an equal opportunity whupping. I've always despised lazy white people. Now, I can talk smack about lazy black people. You're poor because you quit school, did drugs, had three kids with three different fathers, and refuse to work. So when you plop your Colt 45-swilling, Oprah watchin' butt on the couch and complain"Da Man is keepin' me down," allow me to inform you: Da Man is now black. You have no excuses.       No more quotas. No more handouts. No more stealing my money because someone's great-great-great-great grandparents suffered actual pain and misery at the hands of people I have no relation to, and personally revile.       It's time to toss that massive, obsolete race-hustle machine upon the heap of the other stupid 60s ideas. Drag it over there, by wife swapping, next to dope-smoking. Plenty of room right between free love and cop-killing. Careful.don't trip on streaking. There ya go, don't be gentle. Just dump it. Wash your hands. It's filthy.       In fact, Obama's ascension created a gargantuan irony. How can you sell class envy and American unfairness when you and your black wife went to Ivy League schools, got high-paying jobs, became millionaires, bought a mansion, and got elected President? How unfair is that??? Now, Like a delicious O'Henry tale, Obama's spread-the-wealth campaign rendered itself moot by it's own victory! America is officially a meritocracy. Obama's election has validated American conservatism!       So, listen carefully.Wham!!!       That's the sound of my foot kicking the door shut on the era of white guilt. The rites have been muttered, the carcass lowered, dirt shoveled, and tombstone erected. White guilt is dead and buried.       However, despite my glee, there's apparently one small, rabid bastion of American racism remaining. Black Americans voted 96% for Barak Obama. Hmmm. In a color-blind world, shouldn't that be 50-50? Tonight, every black person should ask forgiveness for their apparent racism and prejudice towards white people. Maybe it's time to start spreading the guilt around.

Hebrews 11: 1 tells us that Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things unseen.    So if we see the evidence, then doesn't faith become knowledge?  Does not faith by it's very nature have to be BLIND?    Thomas did not believe until he saw.      John 20: 28And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.      29Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.     To paraphrase " Blessed are those who did not require evidence to believe."    So what could be better than BLIND Faith and what does it say to all of you who require other evidence?

20090128175839AAOiOrR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians:  Is this perfect justice?	Person A is an atheist.  He goes through life being a good man.  He doesn't lie, murder, steal, cheat on his wife (in fact, he's married to only one person his entire adult life).  He's never done anything remotely "sexually immoral".  He gives to the poor and needy.  He tends to forgive slights against him, and doesn't seek revenge against those who wrong him.  All in all, aside from not believing in the Christian god, he lives a blameless life.      Person B, on the other hand, is a right ***hole.  He lies, has cheated on each of his five different wives, each time with a man.  He hasn't killed anyone, but he holds grudges and cheers when his enemies are ruined.  At the end of his life, he makes a sincere repentance.  I mean sincere.  He realizes 100% that what he did was wrong and that he need Christ to forgive him.      My questions are these:  1) What happens to person A at the end of his life (no repentance) and why?  2) What happens to person B and why?  and 3) Do you really consider each of your answers to be Just and why?

20090128174523AA9fI3i	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question for Evangelical Christians?	Hypothetically, if you did your best to live your life according to the bible and to please God to the best of your ability, how would you feel if you did not make it to heaven?      Supposedly, we can't know the mind of God, so you don't know for sure that you’re safe from hell. If he condemned you after you tried your best, would you still find him just?

20090128172413AARubaR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you pray before bedtime? What would you do if you woke up one morning and heard that millions has vanished?	It is known by most Christians that when Jesus calls His Church home that all of the born again believers will in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, put on immortality. They will receive a glorified body, like the one Christ has now. When this event occurs, which it will. Over half of the global world will be sleeping.. When those who have been asleep awake that glorious morning. The News all over the world will be on special alert for millions have just disappeared or have vanished from the earth. Paul wrote.       1 Cor. 15:51-53   Behold, I show you a mystery; We (believers in Christ) shall not all sleep (die), but we shall all (Christians) be changed, in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead (in Christ) shall be raised incorruptible, and the mortal must put on immortality (glorified).       1 Thes. 5:13-18  But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, ever as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them who also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then, we which are alive and remain shall be caught up (raptured) together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord....Wherefore comfort one another with these words...      The unbelieving shall not be caught up..After this event takes place, the world will experience a  7 years of holocaust in which the world had never experienced before in the history of the world, according to the book of Revelation, where an Antichrist (son of Satan) shall be the leader of the United Nations and cause everyone rich and poor to be marked in order to buy or sell anything. Those who receive this mark will not be able to enter the coming Kingdom of God on this earth for 1000 years. And those who reject it shall become criminals to the cause of world and global peace, jailed and sentenced, like the Jewish people were during the time of Hitler..And during this time of great tribulation, the earth will be cleansed of evil and those who love evil and are in rebellion against God, his son, Jesus, and the true believers. So. what would you do if you woke up and found out that you were left behind?

20090128161001AAdbcBh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do Christians feel the need to answer questions directed to Muslims..........?	Why do Christians feel the need to answer questions directed to Muslims just to get a chance to bash Islam and demean Muslims?      I dont Mind when a Christians gives their opinion on a topic, but the people im talking about just answer the question so they can tell everyone how much they hate Islam.       Every time I post a question, there is always a couple that say dont waste my time because Islam is a false religion that hates Jesus and blah blah blah blah blah.      Is it because they are insecure in their own religion that they feel the need to bash others? If not, why?      Personally, I have no problems with Christians, cause my best is Christian.  And I just dont like it when anybody from any religion bashes others for their own personal gain.
20090128174417AAOIUPA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Attacking David Attenborough.....mad?!?	This is quite long sorry, but it's a well written piece if you have the time.      I pulled this from www.richarddawkins.net      Reposted from:     http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan...        "Sir David Attenborough has revealed that he receives hate mail from viewers for failing to credit God in his documentaries. In an interview with this week's Radio Times about his latest documentary, on Charles Darwin and natural selection, the broadcaster said: "They tell me to burn in hell and good riddance."       Telling the magazine that he was asked why he did not give "credit" to God, Attenborough added: "They always mean beautiful things like hummingbirds. I always reply by saying that I think of a little child in east Africa with a worm burrowing through his eyeball. The worm cannot live in any other way, except by burrowing through eyeballs. I find that hard to reconcile with the notion of a divine and benevolent creator."       Attenborough went further in his opposition to creationism, saying it was "terrible" when it was taught alongside evolution as an alternative perspective. "It's like saying that two and two equals four, but if you wish to believe it, it could also be five ... Evolution is not a theory; it is a fact, every bit as much as the historical fact that William the Conqueror landed in 1066."       Attenborough, who attended the Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester in the 1930s, said he was astonished at manifestations of Christian faith.       "It never really occurred to me to believe in God - and I had nothing to rebel against, my parents told me nothing whatsoever. But I do remember looking at my headmaster delivering a sermon, a classicist, extremely clever ... and thinking, he can't really believe all that, can he? How incredible!"       In 2002, Attenborough joined an effort by clerics and scientists to oppose the inclusion of creationism in the curriculum of state-funded independent schools receiving private sponsorship, such as the Emmanuel Schools Foundation."       Sir David Attenborough is possibly the most respected natural historian and natural documentary maker in the world. He's an extremely intelligent man who has discovered and taught the world so much, opening the wonders of nature to people who would never have the chance. There is a real reason he has been knighted. He's an a true icon and is a very gentle man. By sending him hate mail theists are doing themselves more harm than good, its like kicking your grandad between the legs for disliking your boyfriend. Makes no sense to me at all.       What do you all think?
20090128163842AAf9LEA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Doesn't This Scare You?	I've pondered this for a very long time and I think everybody has that fear that we can't get rid of and that's the fear of the unknown. This could range mainly from what happens to us after death? How are we going to die? What's going to happen tommorow? I agree that if many of us could see our future, maybe this would be the most haunting because all of us might not be as prosperous as others.

In the case of an interpreted doctrine, isn't the majority always right?
20090128175046AA4ihJ4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Isn't religious faith just another form of the unconscious calculating of risks we all do every day?	Example...     When you are driving on a two lane road, you obviously don't consciously consider each and every car that passes you in the opposite direction.  While you know it is possible that at any given moment a car could swerve across the double yellow line and collide head-on, you have faith in the competence of other drivers.      But what is really taking place is a complex serious of calculated risks.  Unconsciously, your mind is weighing what you've been taught, what you've experienced, what you personally know about the consequences of breaking the law or not paying attention, and you are weighing this against the fear of crashing head-on into another car.  When all is said and done, your mind informs you that the likelihood of a car crossing over is so low, that there is no cause to release the chemicals that cause the feeling of fear, thus you are able to drive without going crazy.    HOWEVER, if you are unfortunate enough to one day be in a head-on collision, you might then have an irrational fear that every car is going to cross that line.  This may last for weeks, for months, or for the rest of your life.    Just like that, your "faith" in the competence of other drivers has been taken away.    Now isn't it possible... just possible, that your faith in a god is based on the same exact sort of mechanism in reverse... that the ideas of being on your own in the universe, that there is no point to anything, that death is actually the end, that life was just a fortunate accident, or that we are simply not evolved enough to understand concepts outside of "beginning" and "ending", is just your brain calculating the fear of accepting these ideas as true vs the more satisfying/comforting answer that there is an entity behind it all?    So ultimately, your mind would rather take the "risk" of living life with a desirable belief reinforced by hopes & fears that may turn out to be false, than living life accepting a reality that is admittedly more bleak, painful and finite?
20090128174358AAUxdYh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For Christians and Atheists. The infamous topic on Abortion. ?	I am against abortion in all aspects. We are giving the rights for women to abort but, ironically, we're not giving rights for the fetus' to live. It is murder. It is genocide; or, infanticide. I feel that it is our part to ban abortion because these fetus' and embryos' will never have the right to vote. So we have to fight for them.    Enough about my views, How about yours? To Atheists and Christians, what are your views? Is it an abomination or is it right?

20090128155249AAB23Ae	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do You Find Spiritualism In The Text Of The Bible?	I have read the Bible, not cover-to-cover, but in chunks large enough to let me feel like I wasn't just picking at tiny fragments and individual lines. I read Genesis from start to finish, Exodus from start to finish, and John, Luke, Matthew, and some other stuff. I read with an absolutely open mind, and while I pretty much knew before starting that I wasn't going to be converted, neither did I poison myself towards any of the actions or beliefs presented.      I found the experience educational (mostly because it was part of a class that I had freely chosen) but not religious. The more I think about it, the more I realize that reading the Bible was just not a spiritual experience at all, not even Genesis, not even Exodus, not even the Crucifixion.      Is reading the text of the Bible *itself,* regardless of context, supposed to be a spiritual experience?

20090128172941AA78jUv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are there more Atheists than Theists yet?	I hope so because the atheists are the rational ones, we believe in space, evolution, a cleaner planet, better technology, etc. while the theists do nothing but site their holy books and it just pisses me off! if it were up to me, there would be a worldwide belief in atheism, so that means the end of all the religions because they caused major problems here. one of if not the top contributor to problems. plus i would make a worldwide language & a worldwide government & a worldwide money system so as to make people more successful and to spread understanding across the world & unite us a race. we would become more physically & mentally healthy plus we could expand to more important things than religion. with the current state of the world we are moving forward so slowly it is sickening. why can't we just get over these differences? and go forward into a golden future for humans & our world & it's inhabitants.

20090128153654AAOtYyu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	There's a lot of anti-atheist questions, or maybe it's just me?	People claim that atheists have no reason to be moral and that it is unwise to trust them at all. This is based upon generalizations and misunderstandings about Atheists, and it’s no better than thinking of Jews as all greedy or all African Americans and Hispanic Americans as criminals.      In my personal experience, it's uncommon for Atheists to criticize or even bash religion. Most people who I know that are Atheists do live a decent and moral life as much as possible.      I don't think that anyone who is religious should not enforce his or hers ideas on others (unless someone ask of course) or go around telling everyone that they are going to burn in hell, this is not logical. I think that's why I sort of ran away from religion because I felt like I was being judge about the music I listen to, etc. I mean, I still believe in God, but I'm not a religious person.      As far as I am concerned I respect and love everyone.     Whether you follow the Easter Bunny, Jehovah , Islam, Ganesh, Christ or any other Gods, your beliefs have equal value.       Yes, I am well aware that attacks happen to religious people too. But as i'm looking through all of the Yahoo! Answers for Religion; it seems like more people are attacking Atheist people than any other group.         The anti-atheist bigotry is getting pretty old.

20090128205807AAKXTxa	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If God gave us free will, why does he spend so much time trying to sway us?  ?	People who do not act right in the Old Testament are struck down by lightning, turned into a pillar of salt, or have some other awful calamity happen to them.  Almost everyone drowned during the Great Flood because they wouldn't listen to God.  The Israelites spent 40 years lost in the desert because they had strayed from God.  God sent his only begotten son who was crucified and tortured in order to show us the error of our ways.  If God gave us free will, why does he spend some much time, energy, and effort trying to get us to act in a way that is pleasing to him?  What is the point of free will if you are going to try to manipulate the end results anyway?  And by the way, if God gave us free will, how could he 'harden Pharaoh's heart' so that the pharaoh would not let the Hebrews go?  Isn't that jacking with the pharaoh's free will?
20090128203750AArpkEe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, Please explain these verses to me?	Old Testament      Ecclesiastes 2:24 "There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour."      *****Ecclesiastes 3:19 "For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.   3:20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.   3:21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?"*****      New Testament      Luke 6:37 "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven"      Romans 1:21-22,25 "Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools...Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator..."       Romans 12:18 "If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men."      Romans 14:5 "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind."      1 Thessalonians 5:21 "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good."      1Timothy 1:4 "Never give heed to fables or endless genealogies"      Titus 1:14 "Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth."      James 1:27 "Pure religion is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."      James 2:19 "Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble."      1 Peter 4:15 "But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters."               These seem to be in contradiction with modern Christianity, so can someone please explain to me what they mean, because it seems to me that Ecc. 3:19-21 completely eliminates heaven from the picture, and is closer to Epicureanism than it is to the rest of the bible.

20090128191125AAJHdbX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	(Christians) How do you keep strong in your faith?	Where does your strong faith come from? Because there is nothing that can really prove to us he is God. I mean we can say he did many things in our lives, but that could just as well be anything else, such as any other God.            Ive been a Christian for basically my whole life but a question that keeps popping up is : If God is so loving and caring and forgiving, why does he send non-believers to Hell? A lot of them never even heard of Jesus, thats not fair.           Also, why dont Jesus prove to us that he is God, so that everyone can believe in him, maybe through a miracle that everyone witnesses.
20090128203651AAt2ye8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If Christians follow Jesus example, then why don't the majority of them publicly preach the way he did?	Jesus himself did it:   Luke 8:1 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him      He told his apostles to do it:   Luke 9:1 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.3 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.4 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.5 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them. 6 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.      He told his deciples to do it:   Matthew 28:1928:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:   20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.      Examples in the bible where Jesus followers did as he told them:   Acts5:42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.   20:20 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.      Lots more but just cited a few.       If Christians proclaim to be followers of Jesus christ and follow his example and the example of his faithful followers,  why dont the majority not preach from from city to city,house to house,and marketplaces?

20090128184357AAY4Eg5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists do you ever wonder if your disbelief destroys the joy in those who do believe?	Before I became a Christian, I was down and miserable. After I became a believer and a follower, joy and peace came into my life . Misery and problems I have to admit came in as soon as I started attending church service. Once I left the church and started focusing on what God wanted for my life, the joy and peace came back. Today I am more happier than ever. Not only being a believer, but I'm also out here putting smiles and hopes into people lives. So instead of screwing up people joy just because you don't believe in God or his word. Stop and think of what you are doing to those who do believe and are getting something positive from it.       Monday afternoon I went to a writers class. The teacher had me read one of my stories. We had a atheist in the class. The teacher and everyone gave my story compliments and all the atheist did was tear it down. The teacher said, well he did say from the start it was a spiritual book. Well that is the problem with the world today, we don't need anymore spiritual books. The teacher had me read two more stories, and both times he had something sarcastic to say. When we went to leave I told him, if you ever do that stunt like that again, I promise you, when I am done beating the crap out of you, you will be begging for a god to save your butt.       Atheist if you don't believe in God. That is fine and dandy with me.    But let me believe in what I believe in without you trying to steal my or anybody else joy. And before you say, well that isn't what Jesus would do, I'm not Jesus. If you want to be miserable, be miserable by yourself. Let me enjoy my peace and happiness.

20090128195047AA60TtL	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	True Life: I'm Addicted to Meds. How was he smoking this?	(I posted this in 'Reality Television' already but I don't think they know...)      I've been watching True Life: I'm Addicted to Meds on MTV for a couple of days now (...you know how MTV is with reruns...) and no matter how many times I see this I still don't quite understand what this one kid was doing.       He would put his pill on a flat piece of tin foil and use a lighter to burn the opposite side the pill was on. Then use a pipe (I guess) to smoke it??? But it didn't look like he was smoking. There was only inhaling taking place. And the pill was perfectly intact. It wasn't crushed or anything.      So my question is...what? And how? Does the lighter on the tin foil "melt" the pill, so he can sip it through almost like a straw? Or was he really smoking it? Was it really a pipe he was using? And what purpose does the tin foil serve?      I'm really confused by this. I've never seen anything like that before in my life and I'm surprised they never blurred any of this out. So, there has to be someone out there who has seen this episode or has some idea about what I'm talking about.

20090128210729AAsrRuf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do most athiest and religious folks think agnostics are only sitting on the fence?	Hi and don't worry it doesn't bother me about you folks who call us agnostics  in the middle of the roaders, fence sitters, indecisive folks, and many other cute little quips lol.  But lets do a bit of logical thinking here.  There is no absolute fact that god exists,  So atheist say there is no god or they believe there is no god,             There is no absolute fact that god does exist.   but most religious folks say there is a god or they believe there is a god.  Now if there is no absolute fact either way about god existing or not existing.   To me believing that the fact that there is no absolute fact about god existing or not existing  makes perfect sense,  We agnostics logically speaking according to the absence of fact either way about god,  are extremely accurate in our belief bout god.  (THERE IS NOT ABSOLUTE FACT EITHER WAY)  We agnostics understand That there are possibilities for there being or not being an existing god.  Our beliefs about this is just as strong if not stronger than atheist and religious folks beliefs about god as we do know for absolute fact there isn't enough evidence for either to be fact.  How does that sound wishy washy to you folks.   Where does it say except in the bible we have to make up our minds?   And please no quotes from the bible because if we understand that there is no absolute fact about god existing,  That makes the bible questionable also

20090128203401AAyhdIx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Would Jesus not have been an angel as described here, therefor sinless angel?	Luke 20:34-36   "And answering said unto them, The children of the World marry, and are given in marriage. But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and then resurrection from the dead neither marry, nor are they given in marriage: Neither can they die and more for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the Resurrection."      Then Jesus convinced them by letting them touch his hands and feet, as he was the same person.   Mathew 9:13   ""But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and sacrifice".   then again saying it in Mathew 12:7 "But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless."      If he was guiltless then why would he say you don't condemn the guiltless? If the Jews maintain to tell you this, why do you believe it? Doesn't this prove the plan was not to sacrifice or be killed on the cross like they say, and yet he was more like an angel that could not be harmed since he came back so many times to prove to them he was fine.

Christians, Catholics, theologians, apologists and other pseudo-intellectual miscellany? Have you immunized yourself against the devilish world of reason and logic yet and strengthened your faith by following these simple guidlines:      1. Remember! To not have to soley rely on evidence is a theistic virtue. For any fool can believe something if there is evidence for it, but it takes a real red blooded Christian to use faith.      2. Be warned my friends, for the Devil will come bearing highly plausible scientific arguments. The better they are the more logical they are, the more plausible they are, the more well reasoned they are......... then the more "devilish" they are!      3. The devil's plans are well laid so you must be armed against them. So if necessary: Avoid certain books, turn off the TV, walk out of certain lectures..... especially if they start to get at all persuasive.      Do you think you are capable for following these guidelines?      (I think your are more than capable of it. Just remember these guidelines and continue to believe in yourself and you'll be fine.... god Bless you all!)
20090128190738AAxFhZZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If god designed our universe & is so intelligent, then is he responsible for all the destruction we know of?	1. I mean look at our universe. There have been so many failed galaxies, so many imploding stars, so many failed planets and solar systems destroyed by the forces and parameters that were apparently finely tuned so as to allow life to flourish.      2. Now look at our solar system, one of less than a dozen planets, the only one that we know of that has ever been hospitable to life. The other planets are simply too hot or cold to allow basic life to evolve let alone intelligent/conscious life that can form so called relationships with their creator, whom they presume cares for them and what they do and who they sleep with.      3. Now look at out planet. The only planet in our solar system that we know for certain has life. A planet in a galaxy in the deep corner of the univers. 90% of all life forms that have ever existed on this planet of ours have become extinct and failed to flourish. The majority of the planet is entirely inhospitable to life. Life forms only exist sparsely on the surface of the earth.      4. Now look at our human evolutionary history. Modern humans have been around for 100-200 thousand years. In the early periods in Africa, humans would have lived to 25 years only, because there was no medicine, very harsh climates, warefare, famine, predators etc... Then suddenly after watching this for 98000 years, their creator decides that he shall somehow "save his creations" by impregnating a jewish woman who will give birth to his "son", who will be crucified in an ugly and sadistic bloody fashion, then rise back to heaven...... and this is supposed to all make it better.      4a. And apparently this intelligent designer chose for all of this to take place in some barbaric illiterate part of Palistine, instead of some place like China , which was already very literate and very progressive in science and technology.      *sighs* - I have two questions for you:      1. So you Christians and other believers want your god to be responsible for the reality of the universe and the world as I have described?      2. Does this look like intelligent design to you does it?

In the movies Moore uses such discourses as family and education and healthcare, which are very important to all individuals. The purpose of his movies is to persuade an audience therefore he uses the information he collected, interviews, speeches and music in order to position the audience in certain way and to prove his point.  Many believe that Michael Moore hates America; however I believe that like many other celebrities, he uses the media to demonstrate that there is much more room for improvement. The way that Moore films his movies is very original, comical and fresh, thus reaching a bigger audience and making dull issues more interesting hence more people are aware of American ‘faults’.

20090128194620AAz9AXD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians? Questions about heaven/hell?	So I'm confused... the bible says that god is like all forgiving and always forgives people and loves everyone, so why does he send people to hell?   I'm not trying to be rude (Fell free to tell me if I am) I'm just honestly curious, because it's something I've never understood.
20090128184715AASa5SE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can any of you actually see Guardian Angels?	I've always been interested in these things. It was Halloween one day when i was in 7th grade. My history teacher Told us a long story abou this son seeing guardian angels. He took the whole period telling us! My teacher is around 60 and his son is now, i believe, around 20-30 or so. He told us that when his son was around 7 he would always catch him talking by himself. So one time he asked him who he was talking to. The kid told him that with his guardian angel. My teacher "Mr. N" [not using real names] decided to forget about it thinking he would stop having that "imaginary friend". So, when his son got older like around 12, he kept on doing the same thing. So Mr. N decided to ask him again why he would talk alone. His son told him that he's lived with the guardian angel his whole life. So he forgot about it. Ignoring it. When his son turned 17 he would still talk alone with his "guardian angel" so my teacher didn't think he was lying after all. He had a long talk with him that day. His son explained to him how his angel is really nice. That it's been with him everywhere. And that he's used to it. Mr. N asked him since when he's been talking to his "guardian angel" and he told him that he doesn't remember but he said since a long time ago. His son also told him that he could see other people's guardian angels. So Mr. N decided to ask him what angels he had. And he said that some people could see more. but that he could only see 2. So Mr. N asked him how they looked and his son told him that their was an old guy that their was something wrong with him. So he asked him what and he told him that their was something wrong with his eyes. He said that he was blind from one eye. and from the other he was already going blind also. Mr. N asked him how old he looked and he said aroung 80. Then my teacher thought and remembered he had a grandpa that was blind from one eye and going blind from the other. and that he was around that age. So he got scared and asked him about the other one. He said it was a women. Around her 20's or 30's. She had long blonde hair and was tall and thin. Mr. N never knew anybody that looked like that. My teacher freaked out. His son also told him that when he goes to places he see's everybody elses guardian angels. He said that some people have the denom inside of them and that he only sees a dark black shadow besides them. Mr. N went to a proffesional that could communicate with guardian angels. The lady started talking to his angels. Later my teacher asked her how they looked and she described them exaclty how his son did. The lady also described this other person i can't remember. but the son couldn't see that guardian angel. he only saw the other Two. After, my teacher believed his son. He told us that a couple of years ago he was telling his class that exact thing he told us. and all of sudden when he was nearly finishing a girl in that class started crying. He took her outside and asked her what was wrong. the girl told her that She tought she would never find anyone that would believe her. And so she found that teacher and his son. So any of you see guardian angels? they say only kids could. But my teacher's son is old! and old enough to have an imaginary friend. So he really does talk right now still to his guardian angel. Or do you know anyone that communicates with them? Im curious about all these things. It makes me wonder. At some point i wanted to actually be able to communicate with MY guardian angel. I would really love to be able to do that.       Thanks for those who answer and God bless you.

20090128192210AAn0P67	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do people following stereotypes?	There's lot of stereotypes, rather its race, lightness or darkness of skin color within a race, countries, states, towns... etc.   Some stereotypes are good and some are not so good   For example: Race is a big issue, people stereotype that black people are ignorant, ghetto, bang loud rap music, slang users, loud, and in your face, also that blacks girls only wear weave, on the other hand better singers, better cooks, better in bed ; ) and more religions... are these stereotypes about black people true? No they aren't completely true for black people only! Not just black people or all black fit these stereotypes, but ill tell u this.. my black race have set our race up for the bad stereotypes to continuing living, by the way most of us act and represent ourselves to others. I'm black an as you can see im very intelligent but even i get bashed by my own people about the way i present myself to others. i use to get told i was a wannabe white girl "lil miss too good for the hood, you sound like a white girl..." etc. i sound like a white? what! i sound like a white girl because im being intelligent? so are you saying black people aren't intelligent? hmm think about it. i hate that my own people would belittle me for showing my intelligence. I do understand why some of my black sisters and brothers act they why they do, past black history makes us upset and angry at white people. Letting go of the past is just not an option and only a black individual would understand why.   Not only did i get bashed for showing my intelligence but i also got bashed for my skin tone, the black race discriminates against lighter skinned black ladies and even gentlemen this could be because in the slave years a darker colored black person would work outside in the heat on the fields while a lighter colored black person worked inside of the slave owners house, as a sign of higher value im guessing but anyways its sickening to me.      Moving on to other races      Whites are stereotyped for being rednecks, trailer park trash, evil, nasty...and on the other more creative and richer.. is this a true stereotype? No! its ignorance! Not all white people fit those stereotypes and not just white people fit those stereotypes its just all ignorance. Hispanics and Mexicans get stereotyped too for being more like black people, liking to use shanks.. etc. not true! Asia people do only do nails? wow      I cant say i dnt believe in stereotypes, but i can say that i dnt believe ignorant ones!         ~~*Mz.KittyKatt*~~~ ^(>'.' '.'<)   ^(......)^   .(")..(")

20090225153648AAVUQ4V	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How can I convince someone that being gay is not a choice?	So here is the story:    10 years ago, my best friends' family had to relocate to a OK due to some unfortunate events. My friend (well call him T) was devasted as he had lived all his life there and did not want to move. We were on our Junior year and we thought it would suck not to graduate together. We came up with a plan: He would stay and move in with my family. Everyone loved him. After a couple months, on a Saturday morning, we woke up with the worst hang over. He asked me if I could rub his back. ( I secretly had a crush on him. but decided I would never tell him because I thought our friendship would be over. I was a closet case and had no problems dating girls as I was a football player; So was he) I gladly agreed and rubbed his back. After a few minutes, he asked me to go lower, I did, then he asked me again. By that time, I was on his upper bud. He quickly picked up his upper body and pulled his boxers down. Needless to say, that was the beggining of a very sexually driven "friendship". It lasted 3 years, Until he moved out and got a place of his own. We were still very close friends and saw each other very frequently. We never talked about the subject, but it would happen at least 3 times a week. I mean we would go all the way. At the same time he was dating girls and did not clasify himself as being gay. Fast forward to 3 years ago, T meets this girl. He really likes her, and marries her. Although I was a bit jealous and hurt, I always knew that although we would have this frequent sexual encounters, we were never going to be in a "relationship"  I thought it was best for him and for me. One night at a party, not too long ago, we both had too much to drink. At this time now I am openly gay and was on my second date with this guy. This guy, well call David, thinks T is very hot and asks me how I felt about a threesome!?!? (First I knew this guy was a player, and two I thought, there is not a fat chance) Well , 10 drinks later, all three of us were naked in a bed. Meanwhile his "wife" is at home. Since then I have moved to another city. I still talk to him very frequently. He now belongs to this hard core church of Christians and constantly reminds me that I am heading on the "Wrong road" Since he is now married to a woman, he thinks that my sexuality is a matter of choice. I get so worked up with it that I just end up hanging up on him. Any advice?

I want to transfer to the other one that I SHOULD have chosen.   Every time something good happens, something goes wrong. It seems like God hates me, and enjoys seeing me fail. I have prayed and prayed, and nothing seems to help. I sometimes feel like killing myself, because I hate my life.   I just want to be happy in life.....I am always depressed, and I'm always in a bad mood. My grades are dropping, and I am so stressed out. I don't know what to do. Should I have councelling? I just hate my life.....please help.

He just moved in a week or 2 ago and I have been meaning to tell him but I can not get around to it. I know for sure he is not gay.  I do not plan on bringing any guys back home, cause my bed is like 1 1/2 foot from the celing.  I am thinking it would be best not to tell him, he would feel more comfortable and such. my last roommate moved out 3 days after i told him.

20090225154346AA870i8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think of someone who calls themselves a Buddhist in order to support a promiscuous lifestyle?	It would seem that there are quite a few people out there doing this today; claiming that they are Buddhist, yet sleeping with every possible person they can sleep with before they die, and in very debasing ways.  I find it hard to relate to this or understand this hedonistic lifestyle and how it represents spirituality in any way.  Are these people simply misinformed as to what Buddhism really is?  It also seems that these same people live extremely materialistic lives, and seek out monetary gain.  So, what gives?  Are they band-wagon Buddhists?

If you kill a baby people tell you that its ok because it is your choice even though 99% of people knew the effects of sex and willingly consent to it and 96% have no physical issue that could possibly harm them.   On the other hand if someone were to kill their dog they would be immediately arrested and charged with animal abuse and people look at you like you are some sort of monster.    Where is the human race going? Whats your opinion on this issue?

20090128191210AA3lQ3o	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians: How do you feel about Anne Frank having lesbian fantasies?	Wednesday, January 5,1944... Once when I was spending the night at Jacque's, I could no longer restrain my curiosity about her body, which she'd always hidden from me and which I'd never seen. I asked her whether, as proof of our friendship, we could touch each other's breasts. Jacque refused. I also had a terrible desire to kiss her, which I did. Every time I see a female nude, such as the Venus in my art history book, I go into ecstasy. Sometimes I find them so exquisite I have to struggle to hold back my tears. If only I had a girlfriend!
20090128185647AAcaGF6	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Adults only, please: The word "haters"?	Don't you dislike the word 'haters'?   I do.     It amuses me that it's mostly used by people who break laws and lead questionable lives. Those who think referring to women as 'bi7ches' is okay. Who carry guns to malls and then shoot their friends in an argument. Who wear their boxers high and the waists of their pants around their knees, and laugh at smartly-dressed folk. Girls who have unwanted kids at 16 then abuse them in public. People who go out of their way to try to upset peace. People who hate authority and heckle the ones who hold any. People who are severely racist against white people, but call whites the racists.     Now, really, aren't they the "haters" themselves? They walk around with a scowl, have no respect for anyone, and then call everyone with a sense of decency a "hater."    [I'm sure I'm going to get a load of 'hate' and be called a 'hater' for this. But really, if you answer that way, you're just proving me right.]

20090128192728AA1iMsY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religion and education?	Ok, when I was little, I was a strong believer in my religion which is Christianity. I was raised happy and whenever something went wrong in my life, I turned to god. I was happy knowing that there was a greater force at work out there...       But then came high-school... It seems numerous subjects seem to teach the theory of evolution and how there is no god. Biology is a very good one. They love to stress about DNA and genetics how it proves more to the theory of evolution. World history... Telling us how we evolved from monkeys and the big bang theory.       I know there plenty of reasoning that proves that evolution and the big bang theory are false! For one, they state in the big bang theory that (Not sure about details) but somewhere at sometime a bunch of carbon collected and BANG! The universe? Where did the carbon come from? Where did everything come from? Then a perfect planet? A planet that if it was anymore further or closer to the sun then we would die? A perfect moon that keeps our orbit and oceans from spilling over our Continents? Then it suddenly started to rain when there was no oxygen to do such? Then a little cell started to form... Yeah, i'm not buying it.          Next comes the subject of DNA and genetics. I'm currently learning about chromosomes and how life is formed. This I believe.. But it is a very complex code... Such as a computer code. It seems like a more Intelligent hand is at work, right?       I am only a highs school student and maybe I made errors on the things I mentioned but whenever I go to school and hear this stuff it criples my faith towards god. I don't want that to happen. I know I have been told not to let it get to me... But having to memorize this stuff to continue in life is kind of hard to ignore. Please, someone state more reasons on how athiests statements are truely false and how there is a greater force at work here...      Like I said, I want to believe but when i'm forced to learn this crap in school?! I'm just asking for some reinforcement, if your not going to help and critazize me then screw off! Don't even answear!

No, the thought makes reason stare.   Truth is reason, truth eternal   Tells me, I've a mother there.    (Hymn No. 139, A Mormon Hymn by Eliza R. Snow).       God = single, gods = plural.  Monotheism = 1 God, Polytheism = many gods. A "mother god" or "goddess wife" = another God besides the Lord, which is plural and polytheism.    Bruce McConkie elaborated on the LDS's polytheistic beliefs in his assessments recorded in MD pp576-577 by stating "To us, speaking in the proper infinite sense, these three [of the Godhead] are the only Gods we worship. But in addition there is an infinite number of holy personages, drawn from worlds without number, who have passed on to exaltation and are thus gods."      God is a Trinity, not a Triad. And McConkie thus confuses the definitions and concepts and equates the Godhead to a Triad by stating "only Gods we worship"  then adding the belief in the existence of other "exalted beings" or "gods" hence polytheism.       So, the LDS are polytheists, not monotheists like Christians, that is an obvious fact and aside from the issue. My question is From WHERE does the concept of God's Goddess Wife come from?   I saw no direct quote in BoM (in the copy that I own) but then again, i suppose it's akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.      So, The concept of goddess wives is seen as a honour of redemption while in the mortal state? If one is obedient to the ordinances he may be blessed with a submissive and subordinate goddess wife?   Orson Pratt's comments in conjunction to McConkies have confused me.    Is it a matter of procreation of the gods, such as in the case of Greek Mythology where the union of two gods or a god/goddess and a mortal formed god-like children OR is there another explanation?      I am asking honestly here because the notion of goddess wives is no where in Scripture, though i have found a plethora of examples in Bullfinch's Mythology and other such books on the pagan concepts of polytheism and Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Cultures.       I am not mocking, i am asking honestly because this notion confuses me, since it is not Biblical and I cannot find any source where with this notion can be backed up. It simply is not found in Scripture in any of the 41,173 verses therein. And BoM had little to no such references, which struck me as odd since it is supposed to be a literal translation of four holy plates.       Thanks If you can answer this!!  (No rude or insulting comments please!)   xoxo ?
