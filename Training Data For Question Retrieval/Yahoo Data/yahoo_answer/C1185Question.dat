20090128211507AAb2UQO	Beauty & Style;Hair	Looking for new hairstyle for thick, wavy, poofy, frizzy hair?	my hair is really thick and poofy and wavy around the bottom. I get straight perms once every summer, but they always wear off by December-ish and my hair poofs up and gets wavy again. I want to change my hairstyle now, but I'm not sure what's would look good.. I want to keep my hair long though, but is that good idea since it's really thick? it's kind of really frizzy too.. and I dunno how to solve that problem.

20090128211413AAzD7nJ	Beauty & Style;Makeup	The best drug store brand foundation?	Okay so I need a new foundation and I'm not sure what to get. I want to find a foundation that is perfect and I can rely on. I have used Cover Girl's "Clean Makeup" foundation and right now I currently use Rimmel London's "Renew and Lift" I like the Rimmel one but I don't like the pump.       I am interested in getting the Maybelline Mineral Foundation, a whipped foundation, or the Almay smart shade foundation. I think Loreal has a foundation kind of like that too. One that "blends" into your skin tone.      I am looking for an affordable, but really good foundation. I want something that lasts a while, doesn't get dry on skin. (Cause I have dry skin) and something I can rely on and stick to.      I have kind of light skin, it's dry, I don't have acne, and I have uneven skin tones.      Any advice? What's your favorite?

20090128213122AAYIBwd	Beauty & Style;Hair	ONE chunk of dry hair is driving me mad.?	My hair is naturally oily. When it gets too long, it tends to fall out easily (most likely due to wearing it in a ponytail)      I cut it short and it seemed to fix the problem. It's much easier to take care of, etc. It's about to the bottom/middle of my neck now, black, thick, and oily (I've dyed it a bunch of colors and bleached a few times over the years without major problems.)      But there's one patch of hair on the very top that's driving me nuts. It gets dried out quickly, is frizzy, and it often gets knotted or tangled in wind, after sleeping, or in the shower.      Is this anything serious?

20090128221848AA3Hxde	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Suit, not flat on the shoulders (bumps!)?	I just bought a suit at the Men's Warehouse. After the 3rd time(mostly also because they goofed up the pants...one was 1/2 longer than the other) they still haven't been able to make the shoulders straight (along the top). It's one of their top suits ($500 of the rack)    To be clear, you can run you hand along the shoulder and feel indentions( can see them too, though not as bad as you once could)    They say that it needs to settle.    Is this plausible? I've grilled them a great deal, considering grilling them some more. I feel like it's not going to become flat after wearing it if its in the lining.      THANKS!

No, It's not the kind of earring that hurts a lot, and I'm just too much of a wuss to pull it out, or any of that. It's the kind where, It turns perfectly, Like it could be easily pulled off, but the end is just stuck on it. and it will not come out.   It's the kind of earring you get when you just pierce your ears, and so it's supposed to stay on for a while, and then be twisted off, but we've messed with it so much that, it's broken.   and the stem of the earring is real gold, so cutting it is out of the question.      how can i get it out?

A friend is making me a dress for going to dance clubs, it's about mid-thigh, and purple leopard print. I have no idea what shoes would go with it. Black seems to simple and like I gave up and wore black ones. And not matching leopard shoes. Overkill ya know? I was thinking of some purple ones maybe, if they matched the fabric. I'd like heels too. Open toe. I uploaded some pics of the fabric and shoes I was trying to decide about...       http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d149/m...       ^ fabric          http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d149/m...       ^edging around bust line      Shoes I've looked at:       http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y225/cr...        http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y225/cr...        http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y225/cr...        http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y225/cr...       I don't know. Do you think purple would be okay, as long as it matched? Maybe if the shoes matched the light purple edging instead...that'd be cool.    And I want the dress to obviously be the focus, so maybe simpler shoes...or maybe metallic colors?   I really don't like the sound of black, and don't like how it looks when I picture it in my head.   What do you all think?!

20090128232054AACeHlG	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	I want to change my style, but....?	I'm kinda afraid of what people will think. I know i should care what people would think and just do what I want to but I still can't help but care. I'm a teenager (15). My style is kinda girly/casual and I like that "hardcore" or "rocker" look. So that would be a bug change. Keep it mind, I want to change for myself, not anyone else.   J.w., if someone you knew totally changed their style, what would you think? Or would you even care? Please be completely honest.   I prefer people around my age to answer this, but everyones opinion is welcomed :)   thanks!
20090128153445AANm2PQ	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Makeup questions? I have a few...?	Okay. So for years I have hated the brand N.Y.C. cause that was the first eyeliner I ever bought and it made my eyes red, watery, and itchy. I guess I was allergic to it. I haven't bought it since. However, I want to try their blush and yellow concealer stick. I have very dark circles under my eyes and it seems like they are impossible to get rid of. I currently use Cover Girl Invisible...? I think something like that... lol. And it doesn't work that good. I have to put so much on for it to make a difference and then it looks really cakey. What are good concealers for dark under eye circles? And drug store brand... not MAC or anything like that please. And are the N.Y.C. blushes any good?? Thanks!

20090128231335AAjZKWy	Beauty & Style;Hair	Asian with some blonde hairs?	I was just wondering what this could mean but I have a couple of hairs on my head that are blonde all the way up, like a honey blonde, not white or platnium, and it goes all the way up to the root. I'm Full japanese and everyone in my family has black/dark brown hair and brown eyes. I bleached the tips of my hair once before like 5 years ago but the color that came out that time was a lot redder and darker than the hairs that I am speaking about and they weren't even bleached up to the scalp either.      One of my friends says it could be because I have recessive blonde hair genes because his step brother has all different color hairs mixed in on his head and in his beardand he comes from a really mixed family with red, brown and blonde hair.  Is this true? If not, what else could it be and is it a problem?

20090129035831AAjZKlx	Beauty & Style;Hair	Will my hair get darker if I cut it short?	I'm going to get my hair cut pretty short today, and I was wondering if getting your hair cut shorter makes it appear lighter, or darker, or doesn't do anyhting at all to the color?      My hair is currently a brown with a red tint to it.
