I expect Barack Hussein Obama to either be hung on a cross or coronated the way the silly little libs are gushing all about him.  Yet your messiah complex is misplaced.  Do you really think Obama can assure you a spot in eternal life or are you just looking for more food stamps and unemployment benefits?      Someone is going to have to explain to me how the libs can give big tax rebate checks to people who don't work or file taxes.....and I am not talking about Geithner or Daschele.

My partner of almost 14 years has been pressuring me to buy titanium  "wedding" rings for each other.  They would be used if we were to get legally married, but in the meantime, we would wear them .  I'm not big on wearing jewelry such as rings and watches all of the time because they seem to get in the way when I am using a keyboard.  I work on a keyboard all day at work (If I wear a watch, I take it off).   Anyway,  on our recent vacation, I finally gave in and bought matching rings.   He was trilled, but after only two days, we were swimming in the ocean, he lost the ring and could not retrieve it.   I was angry and frustrated that he did not think to take the ring off before getting in the water, especially since he had been pressuring me to buy rings for several years.     I did make a big deal out of it, but I told him I did not want to keep my ring and I returned it.  I also said that due to the carelessness, I would not be buying another ring anytime soon.  I did not speak of the issue at all after that.   I think he was VERY hurt, but did not pursue the issue and further.  After a couple of days, I thought about it and I realized I may not have handled the issue correctly.   How should I have handled it, and more importantly, what would be the best way to resolve it?        Thanks for any advice.

20090202102457AAFRCKq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can we be letting religion tear us apaprt?	I have been raised in a Catholic church, and while we did not go to church every Sunday, I do feel like it's apart of who I am.  My fiance has gone to many churches and two weeks ago, after having not visited this particular church for over a year, he decides he wants to join.  He never had a discussion with me on how I felt about being a part of that church given it's an all black church in a very unsafe neighborhood.  I am a white/hispanic female and we already have 1 multi-racial child with two more on the way. We tried to agree to just go to different churches on Sunday's but where mine only takes an hour, his takes 7 hours on Sunday and 4+ hours on Wednesdays.  Also, I always wanted Church to be a tool to bring our family closer to God...together!  Sunday's are family days and with his current schedule, he leaves at 8:30 am and doesnt come home till 4:00pm.  I feel this is tearing our family apart, and his unwillingness to find a new church that is suitable for both of us and our family is killing me.   Any advice is gladly appreciated. Thanks

"And it shall come to pass in that day the Lord will put forth his hand a second time to recover the remnant of his people, that shall be left from Assyria and from Egypt, and from...."  This seems contradictory in that it speaks of the redemption from Babylon since he says he will recover the remnant of his people that shall be left from Assyria, the Ten Tribes didn't then return to the Second Temple?  If it speaks of future redemption why does it say, "the second time", where in respect to that of Egypt it would be the third?

20080921135650AAy7nWP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Whats wrong with Christians?	I just read a question on this forum asking "Have you ever had a face to face argument about religion?" I was disgusted by some of the answers, as many of them consisted of the statement "no I just agree to disagree". Tell me something Christians, where do you find any Biblical teaching to support your answer? All through the Bible we are taught to be of one mind. Obviously I am talking about Christians vs. Christians. Anybody who truly reads their Bible unbiasly will be of one mind with the rest of the believers. There is no room for "agree to disagree" Jesus told us how it is, he didn't say "well this is what I believe, if you don't believe it then I guess we will just have to agree to disagree". Do you see how silly that sounds? I do agree however if we are contending for our faith to a person of a different religion, then most of the time we are just wasting our time because God mauy have already caused them to be turned over to a reprobate mind and no matter what we say there is nothing that will convince them, in those situations it is best that we just go on and dust off our feet. I just want to know why Christians would give such an unbiblical answer?

20081004230516AAw8nX8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians please help:  What does this dream mean?	I've been having visions since I was 10 years old.  They've all been prophetic.  I always have nightmares about demons trying to hurt me  and stuff.  I know my visions come from God because I've had it confirmed by a Prophet.      This one vision I was standing in front of this demon (who was female) and she was like acting like an animal making these screaming animal kind of sounds (and I wasn't scared at all) and all of a sudden I punched her a couple of times and we ended up having a fight.  Then out of nowhere I picked up this massive tree log and through it at her like a javelin (lol) and it went right through her torso and she fell to the ground.  I then went to turn and leave then I noticed her moving in the corner of my eye and I stopped and turned to face her.  She stood up and pulled the log out of her body and then said, "You can't kill me demon slayer" and I thought to myself "How do I kill you then?"  and then a sword appeared in my hand and it made me feel stronger  and then I woke up.      I always have dreams like this.  Sometimes I'm running away from them because it feels like they're trying to kill me.  Even when I'm awake I sense them in people or different rooms of the house or someone elses house.  I picked it up over a city once and at a party it felt like the air was riddled with them.  I don't want to sound like I'm special or anything.  But am I like an exorcist or something?

I mean they really get satisfaction in thinking someone will burn in hell, not because they did anything wrong, but because they disagree about "god".  Seems to me like christianity is more of a psychological tool to make people feel good about themselves, and feel like people they don't like will be punished for not being... well, what they want them to be.

So....if God didn't want us to have hair under our arms and on our legs, wouldn't he have omitted it?  And by constantly shaving it off, aren't we saying we don't like it - and isn't it an insult to God to reject his "gift" of hair?      I'm picking the smallest thing as an example - but is any body or image-changing ok with God, or is it all vanity.....which he frowns on....?  e.g. plastic surgery, dyed hair, mole removals, braces, etc.      Just a random thought.

Why are they then baptized for the dead?       So does this means that the Early Christian Church and possibly Jewish faith, as the Early Christian faith was an offshoot of the Jews practiced Baptism for the Dead?       And why doesn't any other Church besides the LDS/Mormon church even consider Baptism for the Dead essential?       After all the dead were once alive, does this mean that those who never heard Christianity and heard Christ's message are forever cut off. Do you believe that God would allow that to happen? If you do, it doesn't seem fair that God, who loves all human beings would allow that to occur.

20090204150837AAMRBsF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If salvation was received in the Old Testament then why did people create a New Testament?	Their are many verses in the Old Testament such as Jeremiah 12:16, 1 Kings 8:41 and Zechariah 2:11 that mentions 'Hebrews' and 'Gentiles' receiving salvation from Yahweh. If that's the case. Why then does it take a whole "New Testament" to explain to people on how to receive salvation. When the Old Testament already explains that you can receive salvation from the Hebrews' god  "Yahweh". It seems to me that a another testament is pointless.

The other day something horrible happened to me, something came out about me from a year ago and i got in a lot of trouble for it. Something happened and i cried for a while that night, i prayed and prayed but he didnt answer. I cried for him, i called him father and he didnt answer me. In the bible it says that i am his son and that no human can ever love like him. If this is true why did he ignore me? Man, i cried my heart out. I told him that if he shows me he is real, hugs me or even just loves me i'll give my life to him. He didnt answer. I am a mess and almost took my own life. I need help but every where i turn i've been betrayed. Now even god betrays me. And please dont tell me everything happens for a reason. I have a baby sister who i love more than anything, and if i even seen her cry like that and i had all the power in the world to make her not cry...i would have helped her. so i guess that means that god is heartless.

20090204151349AA35lAq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is the best religion to "convert" to?	I have been going to a catholic school my whole life, and my family is catholic. But I don't think I believe in Jesus as the son of God anymore- my reasons are valid but I don't feel like explaining them to you. I've been looking at Judaism, but it says you should dress modestly. First thing, does that mean I have to go around all the time in ankle length skirts and long sleeve shirts? Because, I live on the gulf of mexico and it's extremely hot here. Also, I dance. And at ballet I have to wear a leotard and tights.      I can't formally convert yet. It isn't that my parents aren't open minded or anything, they just don't think I'm old enough to. Plus, my grandparents are very involved in the Catholic faith.      Ok, so in addition to the other questions, can anyone also tell me if there are any other less complex religions I could look into? All I know, at this moment, is that I believe in God.

20090204153510AAFhAal	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians - Please tell me why?	That you still believe in Jesus, even though you have been shown the historical facts about other Prophets/Gods that share great similarities.      I will give you one easy example, based on facts.      Horus  (3,000 yrs Before Christ)      Born on Dec. 25th   Born of a virgin mother named Isis Mary   Birth was accompanied by a star in the East   And upon his birth, he was adored by three kings   Teacher at 12   Baptized at 30   12 Disciples which watched him heal the sick and walk on water   Was known as many names such as: "the truth", "the light", "lamb of god" and "the good shepard"   Was betrayed by a disciple   Crucified, dead for three days, then resurrected      All before Jesus, and also found in thousands of other cultures' "Gods". There has been over 10,000 Gods presently that have shared at least 2 of those qualities listed. And those are just the ones we know of.      I don't want this to be condescending, I'm just trying to understand the reasoning behind your views.

20090204161420AAggKHx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I feel like I found god?	I am 24 years old and i was not brought up around any type of religion at all, however I have always personally believed that there is a god.  I have only really been to church about a handful of times in my life.  So, today I was praying, yes i pray, and it seemed so much different than ever before.  I felt his prescence, and I started to cry.  I feel like he is telling me to make the next move.  So,being that i am very challenged and limited in knowledge, what are some books, ideas, whatever to take that next step.  I also preffer to keep this to myself for a while until i really make my bond and figure this new journey out. Also, what are personal things you do to tighten your bond with god?
20090204161612AAMXvT4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you agree that Evolution is a theory by the Devil, of the Devil and for the Devil?	I used to regard Charles Darwin as an idiot: an amateur naturalist who failed to make it to medical school, and who assumed that the artificial selection practised by animal breeders could also be done unconsciously by Nature and account for the entire diversity and complexity of life on earth.      I'm now more certain that Darwin was under the influence of the Devil himself, who whispered honey-coated words such as "natural selection" and "descent from apes"  into his naive mind.      Evolutionists refuse to test their theory of macroevolution which is basically unfalsifiable: They said as much in the Dover Trial when Michael Behe challenged them to show how a bacterium could evolve a flagellum in the lab. There is simply no evidence for molecules-to-man evolution at all.      Has everyone come under the spell of Satan? Is the Evil One directing our research institutes and our laboratories?

20060719045545AA34ERO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Muslims - why do you consider things such as colgate toothpaste as haram?	I understand they say it contains chemicals derived from animals that may be "haram.  But the fact is that the product has undergone a total chemical transformation.  Going by that logic how can you eat anything? For example plants and trees draw their sustenance from the soil and various fertilizers are added to the soil. The fertilizers can have any origin such as animal & human excretra, the parts of animals not killed as per Islamic rituals (and even dead humans in graveyards can be fertilizer for plants) etc. Then how can you justify eating plants & fruits?  Chickens are halal but most chickens eat worms, insects & things deemed to be haram.    Please note - in the world EVERYTHING is recycled. For example your urine can end up as someone else's water & vice versa.

Scientists speculate that there are maybe a minimum of 360 intelligent civilizations out there and maybe as many as 38,000.

Does this mean that God may have had 360 sons, all with different women (or whatever "son" and "woman" means in alien terms).    Did he make them in his image too?    Does a gathering of Jesus and his brothers look like the Cantina Bar in Star Wars?  Lots of different types of aliens hanging around.

Why would some Christians still urge me (as well as anyone who has different beliefs than they) to follow their religion, Bible, and teachings?       There are many Christians who respect other people's beliefs and will not interfere- in no way am I referring to ALL Christians when I ask this.

I pray to god everynight asking for his guidance but nothing every happens.  I dont want to give up on this girl, b/c i think god is testing me to see if i will give up.  But how long should i wait? Is god testing me? What should i do?

20090204203024AAXG8uK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I have some Jewish heritage but I feel no connection to Judaism or Jewish culture, why is this?	So I have a good deal of Jewish heritage (although there are Christians in my family too) but I feel no connection to Judaism.  My grandpa was a Christian Scientist and my parents weren't religious.  Then when I turned 14 I became a Christian and then my mom became a Christian too.  My dad is nominally Jewish, but mainly it's just that he supports Israel.      But I was just reading an article about Orthodox Jews and it sounded really weird and foreign.  I've been to synagogues and even took a couple of classes at an Orthodox synagogue named Chabad and it all seemed pretty strange ... they are good people, but still it reminds me of something from Eastern Europe and the Middle East combined.  Non-religious Jews are not people I identify with either.  I'm pretty conservative and they seem to generally be left of left.  I don't come across as Jewish, I drive a truck and like country music and am really patriotic ... I also have light hair and eyes, you would guess my ancestry is Irish or something if you met me.  I am a Christian, but I'm not extremely religious either.  So what gives?

No man on earth knows if anything in the bible really happened because no man was alive to see it and tell us about it   Everything Is here is hear say, People think they have a pretty good idea but no one can be 100% sure anything is really true.   I really like lots of the bible and it sounds devine but god said ( It's our obligation to question everything ) and thats what i do.   He said many will come in my name and many will be deceved , Hes warning you! he said MANY not a few people.   So look around who are the many preaching his name, religon   They are deceving you christans have been brainwashing you for 1500 years and you cling to every word.   Thet have no say over your salvation you do, they said this to extract money from you over the last1500 years    Keep your tithing and give it to your community food bank or other local support group.   If some one tells you that you need to pay to hear the word of god grab your wallet and get out.   You cannot buy your way into heaven.

20060905173312AAOz5PW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	O escandalo da quadrangular é muito grave, vcs leram o texto da noticia?	Agência Estado      PUBLICIDADE               O Ministério Público Estadual (MPE) de Minas Gerais ofereceu denúncia à Justi?a contra 23 pessoas como o presidente nacional da Igreja do Evangelho Quadrangular do Brasil, Mário de Oliveira, outros dirigentes e vários pastores da denomina??o. Eles foram acusados formalmente de praticar crimes como apropria??o indébita, desvio, lavagem de dinheiro, estelionato, falsidade ideológica, uso de documento falso e sonega??o fiscal.      Conforme a denúncia do MPE, dirigentes da igreja em associa??o ao ex-prefeito de Contagem (MG), Ademir Lucas (também acusado), "idealizaram, planejaram, ajustaram e executaram" um "plano destinado a desviar em proveito alheio" recursos públicos do município no valor de R$ 1,12 milh?o.         Os desvios teriam ocorrido durante os anos de 2001 e 2002 por meio de dois convênios que foram firmados com a entidade "civil-assistencial" Escola de Ministério Jeová-Jiré, que, segundo o MPE, tem como presidente perpétuo o pastor Jer?nimo Onofre da Silveira, ex-secretário municipal de Defesa Social de Contagem na gest?o do ex-prefeito (2001-2004).         Conforme os promotor Mário Concei??o, a investiga??o iniciada há cerca de dois anos e meio identificou que o modus operandi da organiza??o se assemelha ao da Igreja Apostólica Renascer em Cristo, cujos fundadores tiveram os bens bloqueados pela Justi?a de S?o Paulo a partir de denúncia do Ministério Público.         O promotor disse que a acusa??o oferecida na última semana à 2a Vara Crimina da Comarca de Contagem pede o seqüestro de bens dos acusados e o ressarcimento do dano ao erário, até o limite de R$ 1,12 milh?o. O pedido está sendo analisado pelo juiz titular Guilherme Azeredo Passos.         De acordo com o promotor, os convênios eram para recupera??o de jovens viciados em drogas no prazo máximo de 15 dias, com ora??es e "terapias de duvidosa eficácia". A acusa??o diz que foram utilizadas notas para presta??o de contas de uma empresa fantasma, em nome de parentes de Jer?nimo. Segundo Concei??o, foi apurado que os recursos desviados foram usados pela organiza??o para compra de imóveis e bens - entre eles, uma lancha, carros de luxo e um apartamento em Cabo Frio (RJ).

20060729204024AAbGgRs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Por que alguns religiosos se preocupam tanto em atacar outras religi?es?	N?o sou um grande conhecedor, mas acredito que a doutrina crist? prega a tolerancia como fator determinante para que uma pessoa seja considerada um bom cristao. Entretanto o que temos visto mais e mais, s?o alguns religiosos (principalmente evangelicos) que atacam outras religioes, chamando os frequentadores destas religioes de adoradores de sata e outras coisas. Ent?o pergunto eu, por que alguns evangelicos se preocupam tanto em atacar outras religioes? Que fundamentos eles tem para for?ar a convers?o de outras pessoas para suas igrejas?       Devemos deixar claro, que n?o se trata a um ataque a qualquer religi?o, apenas quero entender o motivo de alguns frequentadores de ìgrejas de atacarem o que n?o lhe agradam, de falar mal de outras religi?es e de tentar converter os outros a sua Igreja.    Acredito que acima de tudo deve existir tolerancia.

We have been together for 2 1/2 years. We were living together and had planned on being wed in July. I found in March I was pregnant with his child. Since then, he has put me through hell. He tried to force me many times to get an abortion, and when I was past the point of that, he kicked me out of the house and denied me access to using the car. He had never ever displayed any violence or anger like that to me before..it was a big surprise that he has treated me this way. He claims his mother had a few and it was okay and that Muslims would agree with his point of view that it was not a baby (even up until 6 months!) Well, I am 7 months along now and trying to work it out with him as best I can. I just need advice. I know that it is cosidered wrong to get pregnant outside of being married. I was on birth control and did what I could..but things still happened. What is your point of view on this situation? Was he right to kick me out? Serious answers.

You have Catholics, Lutherans, Baptists, Orthodox (russian for me), Pesbetarians, Piscopalians, Escipol, Protestant, etc. They all belive in Jesus Christ, and follow what the Bible has to say. WHY CAN'T IT JUST BE CHRISTIAN?! Don't tell me, "Oh, read the Bible. You don't know what you are talking about. Find God." Or any of that crap. I am Russian Orthodox, and fine with it. I am not super religious. But why are there so many dieties, or w/e it is?

20061204143216AAoP1eH	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Question about HIV/AIDS & homosexuals?	My mother recently asked me this question:  Why are homosexuals said to be one of the #1 transmitters of AIDS?  It sounded like a good question to me.  We discussed it a little but didn't seem to come up with a satisfying answer.  I told her about a documentary I watched that speculates AIDS was derived from creating the polio vaccine from monkeys(I can't remember what exactly from the monkey they used) anyway, this caused the previously dormant virus to become active/destructive in humans.  You mainly hear how AIDS is predominately transmitted by homosexuals and IV drug users.  Please don't be too hard me but here goes....Is it so prevalent with homosexuals because they are more apt to be in the IV drug scene.  This is a serious question and not intended to stereotype, sorry if it sounds that way.

I don't really believe in God, but if I had to tell you what I think God might be, I'd say God is just the invisible workings of the universe, i.e. how all the atoms and molecules interact to make life possible. I can't really simplify it more than this.

20061209175725AAFy80k	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why are there so many myths in circulation about weed?	A lot of the anti-drug folks seem to have these misguided, wacky beliefs about the drug, for example, that it kills brain cells in the same way alcohol does or causes cancer in the same way cigarettes do.  There's also the one about causing laziness, but any reasonable individual should be able to conclude that association does not imply causation.  Have you considered the possibility that the people that enjoy weed may in fact just be lazy people?  And of course there's the ridiculous notion that it is addictive or a gateway drug?  Christ, chocolate is far more addictive than weed.  I've never known anyone not able to quit smoking weed for any length of time.  What is it that keeps these silly ideas floating out there?  I know they exist because I come across people clinging to these illogical assumptions all the time.  I'm not asking why it's not legal which it of course should be.  I know the answer to that, just ask the tobacco, alcohol, oil, clothing, and agricultural lobbies.

Se exactamente la razon por la cual es mejor conservarse hasta el matrimonio lo cuales son bastante justas, pero si uno sin querer mete la pata antes del matrimonio por lo menos con alguien con quien le tienes mucho afecto, y le pides perdon a Dios, las concecuencias serian graves como quiera?

Isn't it because alot of us "Christians" have this holier than though attitude & are very hateful & condesending to them. I'm a Christian & getting more ashamed of the people of my faith every day. Could this possibly answer your question Alexandra?
20070219135915AAGk0wi	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Does this sound like a better system?	The only way to register a complaint against a question on Yahoo Answers would be to actually post a viable response to it?      I have had two questions removed from the system for no reason other than people that want to play games.  The questions were not vulgar or derogatory in any way, but Yahoo still removed thme because someone pressed the "report" button.      So maybe Yahoo Answers should only allow people who actually posted a response decide to report a question.  At least it would narrow down my list of suspects. What do you think?
20070130132349AAYj27a	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Pro-life people would you believe...?	would you believe in abortion if you or a loved one was raped by and aids infected person and got pregant, thus bringing a aids baby into the world?   or if the doctor told you or a loved one that if you have this baby you WILL die and the baby has 50% chance of living.  would you then be so strict in your convictions.   Do you not think it is circumstantual.   I think abortion is dumb when it is just a form of birth control, but i do believe that there are times when it is justified.   how about you?   if you agree than you are not pro-life you are pro-choice.   and if you do not aggree than you are ignorant and a liar.

20070114131859AAZVnlc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	?pueden aquellos que creen en la trinidad afirmar que son monoteistas?	Casi todos los que creen en la Trinidad, afirman ser monoteístas, es decir, que adoran a un solo Dios. ?Es esto realmente así? Todo trinitario adora no solo al “Dios Padre”, adora también al “Dios Hijo” y adora al “Dios Espíritu Santo”. ?A cuántos dioses están adorando los que creen en esa doctrina?       Desde luego, llamarlos “Dioses” evidenciaría que son politeístas, y “politeísmo” es una palabra que no forma parte de la teología católica y protestante. No obstante, sí es una palabra que está siempre presente en la práctica religiosa de católicos, protestantes y ortodoxos. Por eso, los teólogos han preferido denominar “personas” y no “dioses” a los componentes de la deidad trinitaria. ?Cuánta diferencia puede existir entre ambas expresiones dentro del contexto que estamos analizando? En realidad, ninguna.

Lucas 24:39 dice "Mirad mis manos y mis pies, que yo mismo soy; palpad, y ved; porque un espíritu no tiene carne ni huesos, como veis que yo tengo." (Dijo Jesus diciendo que no es un espiritu como Dios Padre)      Deuteronomio 4:15-16 se lee "15. Guardad, pues, mucho vuestras almas; pues ninguna figura visteis el día que Jehová habló con vosotros de en medio del fuego; 16 para que no os corrompáis y hagáis para vosotros escultura, imagen de figura alguna, efigie de varón o hembra."      y el Libro de mormon contradice todo solo con este pasaje:      Doctrina y Convenios 130:22 declara: "El Padre tiene un cuerpo de carne y huesos, tangible como el del hombre; [...]"
