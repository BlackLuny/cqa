zorYTX59aa	Warner Music Group (which includes dozens of record labels and   hundreds of music artists) could not come to a mutual agreement   with YouTube about licensing fees, distribution rights and royalties.    As such, they have split ways, and now any videos with music by  WMG artists are either deleted or muted. This includes any music  by the following companies: Asylum, Atlantic, Chappell (probably  the world's biggest song publisher), Cordless, East West, Elektra,   Lava, Maverick, Nonesuch, Reprise, Rhino, Rykodisc, Sire, Word,  and of course Warner itself.|`|624f4643a1438a24354344100c89b712aa	WMG is getting mad, because users are using copyrighted music without permission. so they made youtube disable the audio in tons of videos, and even ban ibiteprettyhard from youtube.|`|2l8U8E1caa	WMG is butt hurt because of people copying the music they own the labels to and stuff like that.  They are pretty much saying that music videos or any video that has music that they own, was stolen (EVEN THOUGH WE AREN'T MAKING PROFIT) so they make youtube mute it.  Its ******* ridiculous, I made a video and EVEN SAID IT WAS THEIRS AND ALL THAT LEGAL BULL CRAP AND THEY COMPLETELY TOOK DOWN THE VIDEO!  I'm not buying anything that they own just so they go out of business, for now on, im only pirating music off bittorrent.

FI4Z0jYcaa	I don't, but I know people who do treat their partners getting in contact with ex's as "oh, you are now speaking to an ex... soon you will be getting back with them".    Each to their own, but surely if you have been with your current partner for a while, he should be seeing that you have committed to him rather than to a past.    Not only that, any experience you had with your ex has helped make you the person you are today, the person he loves!|`|AA10300538	No, it is not cheating...its called talkin to an ex, over the internet...no connection, no talks of intimacy (future or past)...so u should tell ur current dude that he should stop being such an ****! lol|`|AMjMeigMaa	I don't feel that is being unfaithful at all.  Your partner is just jealous and maybe a little afraid that innocent conversation will lead to a renewal of feelings.  You should remind your partner that its just a friendly conversation and they are the one you are in a relationship with and that they need to trust you.|`|VHClvfMzaa	I think you should consider your partners feelings...would you be cool if he was contacted by his ex via online and played "catch-up" with her?|`|AA11265535	I don't think it's unfaithful.

Word of warning, my ex did the exact same as you and i wasnt happy, end result... weeks of jealousy, specially when they 'met up'.  and so we decided to end it, things arnt good between us now, we are civil with each other but deep down i know that that was the start of things.     Please stop all contact, it will end in heartbreak for both of you.    Sure, your just friends with yor ex, you probably hate him for things he as done, but us guys dont see it like that. your our propertie (so to speak) lol   we all get jealous, and your risking yor relationship for something that you would seem is petty and none existence    Watch where your treading.    If you love n care for you bf then stop chatting with yor ex! its only going to make things worse for you.|`|4ZE8RG7Waa	i would ask him why he reacted like that?  it's not cheating but i do know lots of people who have got together with an ex through f b so he probley knows that but hey you carry on i assume your both grown adults and i would also ask him if he trusts you if not then you need good long talk about where your relationship is going...
XkDEpQ6Daa	I don't know for sure, but it sounds like you may still have a virus on your computer.  I would download some free antivirus programs and scan your computer to see if McAfee missed anything.  The only problem is that often antivirus programs won't allow any other antivirus programs to run at the same time.    Try downloading either a free antivirus program or a free trial of a big name (I know Kaspersky and Norton give free 15 day trials).  Then when your done, disconnect your internet, uninstall McAfee, and then install the new antivirus.  Disconnecting the internet at this point is just a safety precaution I like to use to protect yourself while you have no antivirus software running.  Reconnect the internet, update the virus definitions, and run a scan.  If you do this with several different free programs and you get 0 viruses, you should be clear.   Its time consuming, annoying at times, and tedious, but it worked for me once while fixing a friends computer (He had 50 viruses using one program and 15 more using another).  But he was also running a computer without antivirus for over a year.  Just be careful, because if it is a virus thats affecting your computer, you don't wanna put in any important info or passwords.  Viruses can steal that info.  In fact, if you think you used online passwords with this computer while infected, I would change all of them using a computer you know is clean.  Good luck.|`|pLbTRwNBaa	Sounds like one of the viruses corrupted something on the way out.    Do a scandisk. go to My Computer, Right click on your C: drive. Go to Properties, click the tools tab. Select Check Now in the Error-Checking box. Click both check boxes, click start. Accept the scan at start-up and reboot your computer.    If that doesn't help. If you've got your Windows CD try doing a repair install.
FqrKjtzwaa	If both of your browsers won't go to a particular web site, but they work fine with other sites, then there is likely a problem with that site, or with your ISP, or a transient Internet problem. 9 times out of 10 just wait a while and it will start working again.    (A much less likely reason would be that your computer's HOSTS file is redirecting www.wamu.com to somewhere else. If you have Windows this file will be in the folder \Windows\system32\drivers\etc and if you open it and see www.wamu.com in it, delete that line. - but the only reason that line would be in there, is either someone else added it, or possibly malware/virus added it).|`|Lnrhs46laa	I just loaded the website just fine.

HD7L65fXaa	You really mean to say:    if (bo == 13)    not    if (bo = 13)    The first is a comparison (which is boolean), the second is an assignment (not boolean but integer-valued in this case).    This is a very common mistake.

UAYzLyN4aa	No.The phone jack doesn't hae the necessary circuitry behnd it. Nor does it have enough pins.     You need to connect both the xbox and the laptop to the router.

Also any normal LAN connection now normally shorts the phone pins as protection for itself against the higher voltages of the phone line.

AA10573466	at the end of first page keep del key pressed until the second page gets removed.    hope this will help.|`|m0fU0H7jaa	Troubleshooting to get rid of second page:    --Often if you change the view style of your document and then return to the Print layout [default view], the second page will disappear. View > Web Layout, and then return to View > Print Layout    --If this does not work, the extreme yet 100% effective option would be to copy and paste your document into a .txt file and save it. When you do this, all formatting from Microsoft Word is lost. Copy the information from the .txt file that you created, and paste it into a new word document. At this point, the formatting will be lost, but the extra page will be gone. Then simply reformat your document [italics, bullets, etc.]
FbjRnvdAaa	Ok, here is how it is done.  you will need two array lists. one holds the actual words and the other the count of each word. these will be placed outside any functions and at class level.    ArrayList words = new ArrayList();  ArrayList counts = new ArrayList();    then inside the while loop of your readTranscript function do this after you got the token and stored it in temp.      if ( words.contains(temp))  {     counts.set(words.indexOf(temp), 1 + (int) counts.get(words.indexOf(temp)));  }  else  {   words.add(temp);   counts.add(1);  }    then inside your writeCounts function you simply get each value and output it like below :    for ( int i = 0; i   {  System.out.println( words.get(i) + ": " + counts.get(i));  }    don't forget to import java.util.ArrayList;
m0fU0H7jaa	It all depends on how you format it - that's up to you when you initially receive the drive. You can format and partition it any way that you want.    By default, MyBook SE HDD work on Macs, so if you're planning on streaming the data from the drive to the XBOX [perhaps using the Nullriver software, for use with movies, TV shows, etc.], then it will work. I would suggest buying an additional external hard drive if you are planning on plugging it straight to your 360, for it would be an immense hassle to constantly move from your 360 to your computer and back.    Check out Connect360 from Nullriver, where you can stream your information to the XBOX:  http://www.nullriver.com/products/connec...
1UhUEbTCaa	it depends on how much files you have on your hard drive. The more you have, the longer it takes. For me it usually takes about 30 minutes|`|TXJXcVu0aa	A full scan will scan all files top to bottom, so the time will double if not more depending on your hard drive. For a 200gb hard drive which is full of data i would say this scan could reach near the 4 hour mark.    You should do a smart scan really as windows defender just scans for spyware and the chances of spyware being located elsewhere other than the usual places windows defender usually checks are extremely slim. Unless you have friends who are the type to embed spyware in files they send you.    Tip: Do a smart scan with windows defender and a full scan with your antivirus.|`|g62ATenqaa	Depends how large your hard drive is and how much you have stored and how fragmented it is and how long it has been since you last did a scan..

Your best option would to sign up when they open their doors to the public.  I saw it open for a few hours a day from 26th to 29th Jan, a shame you missed it. Previous to this it was open for for 2 days that ended on the 21st Jan.  Open Registration days can be any day of the week, are not necessarily every month and can last hours or days.  I'd advise you to check the site EVERY day and eventually you will get there.  If you can't get an invite you will need to follow this path, good luck.

dfjIBHe3aa	Never underestimate Slackware.  I just reinstalled it on my laptop after my Gentoo distro broke completely (It's now a dual boot Linux and Linux) and while of course they WANT you to do a full install you CAN be frugal with it.    Gentoo of course provides the base system for the install -- no X windows and certainly no X Windows applications.  I generally install links period on it -- browse the web in text mode in other words -- but then not only do I have to make choices about make.conf and what I want to install packages for but I generally find myself going through a period of asking, "is that what I want?" and thinking "nahh".  My default browser is currently seamonkey but that's a pretty awesome one.  With ABIWord and databases I really don't need OpenOffice.org.  Etc.. I have a reasonably current version running on a Compaq Armada 7792DMT from the last century -- 104Mb memory, pentium-MMX processor 5GB HD.    DamnSmallLinux shows what you can do with Debian.  And you can actually install it to disk.    The problem with Debian, of course, is -- as a friend who knows more about Computers told me, he did a full install once and it took him two weeks.  The distro's CDs for such a thing form a stack as tall as the old slackware install floppies did back in the nineties -- and CDs are thinner.  But you don't have to install everything and in fact it is expected you won't.  And it is very easy to run on older hardware.    But never underestimate the power of Slackware.|`|55c1d74ea3f28f36e0572a05769f11d3aa	puppy Linux     check out the link below for more details
RyvKws7Laa	The most powerful Mac is the "Mac Pro."  It is the only form of Mac that is a tower.  It is a power house machine.  It actually runs Windows better than most IBM clones on the market (minus maybe something from Alienware).  But it won't come cheap.    But you can run Windows just fine on any of the modern Intel Macs.  Its not really that big a deal.  You probably want at least a 250GB hard drive though, just so you have some decent space to give Windows (and leave for OS X).  Minus the cheapest Macbooks, all other Mac options can provide you that (or better).    If its a USB mouse it'll work just fine on a Mac.  I use the Apple Mighty Mouse at work, but I use Logitech ones at home.  I've never had any problems.|`|OBA3Iciraa	The best thing for you is to go to the Mac store and ask.

IF you have windows go to start>control pannel>add or remove programs  then just delete your antivirus which should be on the list.      or you could get a mac and never have that problem.|`|tjl7AQrfaa	What you need to do is restore you computer to a date prior to when u accidentally installed the scam Anti virus 360. Go to the start menu>accessories>systom restore. Then you restore your computer prior to the date which you had the anti virus 360 pop up. Worked for me i cant be happier. Or you can go to this website: trusted-payment-system.com/uninstall.exe... Before you go there be sure to turn off all you firewall setting and anti virus program. If not it will block the uninstallation process good luck. Let me know how you made out.

dkpIjt5jaa	There is no best !    The rule of thumbs for security is to have a multi-layered protection approach !    So do not use more than one virus scanner on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Adware/Spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one).     You can only use one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one) but, if you have a router, you can also activate its built-in Firewall as they use different methods.      Here are my suggestions for free software you can mix and match to your liking according to the rule (I tried all personally):    Anti-Malware/Spyware/Adware scanners suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.    Virus scanners suggestions:    Don't go for AVG free, it may be free but it has hiccups like the error that made the news late last year on CNET, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose the use of their Windows system.    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall (or don't want a Firewall) then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include Email, Malware, Spyware or Adware scanners so complement by choosing from other suggestions on this page    Email scanner suggestions:    Spamdel: http://www.spamdel.com/    OR    Inbox: http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi...    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|iHT3N9n5aa	i find the following good    spybot S&D  AVG  ad-aware  kasperspy(although i havnt tried this ppl have told me its good)  avast(same as above)  malware bytes.|`|LxMP5mYhaa	http://www.avg.com|`|fizuyKBTaa	Free anti-virus applications can't remove the lateste virus.

It's one of two things. You need to clean out. Old registry keys and old temp files can slow a computer. For that you need something like Glarysoft.com Glary Utility's.  Or Ccleaner. Next' It's all the spy ware/mal ware and other bad stuff that AVG as let pass right on through without even detecting it. Sorry' You can't expect something for nothing. There is no such thing as a "best free" anti virus. If you want one that works and works right you will have to pay for it. The best paid AV right now is Kaspersky products like Defender Pro. Don't expect free AV's to do the job. I don't care what anybody says on here they will not.  AV's like AVAST' AVG' Trend Micro there a total joke. Anyone who recommends them must not have clue. They have no proactive defense. Any 15 year old kid with minor hacker skills can defeat them. Walk right into your machine undetected.|`|CmauBtVYaa	None of the free anit-virus software offers the best protection. They will not protect agains email threats, instant messaging programs, spyware, and never offer anti-rootkit protection.    If you do not wish to pay for anit-virus software then look into AVG-free edition; I personally have never had any issues with AVG. AntiVir is also getting good feedback.    These days, "viruses" are not the only concern; with more prevalent spyware, trojans, worms, ect... a good anti-spyware software is also just as important. Many security suits feature anti-spyware programs along side their anti-virus and firewall.    AVG isn't slowing your computer down. Are you able to back up all  your data and re-format / re-install your operating system? Consider this, and start from scratch.|`|IXSGaD5aaa	AVG is the best FREE software, McAfee is the best if your willing to pay
FBQZ06vraa	You can search for those manual line breaks (the left-arrows) with Find and Replace by first clicking the More button, then the Special button.    You can then replace them (and the preceding blank, for some lines) with nothing, effectively deleting the line.    Be careful, though.  A mass replacement like that often has problems to be worked out.  Work on a copy of the file, not the original.    Hope that helps.
m0fU0H7jaa	If you truly want a good macbook, go to apple.com.    Since they are still very new, there is a good chance that the only aluminum MBPs that you will be able to find are ones that have been flawed, or that have been damaged slightly.    It is worth it to simply put a dent in your wallet and buy from Apple directly. Don't forget about the 10% student discount that they give. If you order online, access this by using the pull-down menu at the very bottom right hand side of the screen on the Apple Store website.

044IeGstaa	Yes I know the answer, but you may not like it. It involves some pretty intricate Registry work. If you follow the instructions on this page, it will correct your problem.    Before you do, I would like you to try this.   Get Norton the heck off of there! This security program messes up everything it comes in contact with! Seriously!  Norton and McAfee will mess a computer up.    I know because a person spends a good chunk of money, they think that these programs should work. Or advertising, has declared them the "Saint', of anti-malware programs.  1.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware    Use the free version of MalwareBytes Anti-Malware.  2.Info on Wikipedia.org:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malwarebyte...  3.Free version download site:  http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...    Secondly  It 'sounds' like you have a version of Nero burning software.  ("Make a DVD' or "Burn' option)   If so, guess what? It's junk too!  (Sorry to be 'hitting' you with this all at once. Not trying to be a downer, and this is in NO way any reference to your choices. Made by you, or made for you when you bought the computer)    I advise removing your burner software, and using this free version of burner software. I know. Pretty much to accept from a stranger. I have had Nero 6 and Nero 7 on computers. Eventually they messed up my ability to use my burner drives.  I went to Start>All Programs>Nero>Nero Uninstall.    Then I downloaded Infra Recorder, and haven't had a problem since. Two years now!  4.Info:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infra_Recor...  5.Download sites, and more info:  6.http://infra-recorder.en.softonic.com/  7.http://infrarecorder.org/  Screenshots  8.http://infrarecorder.org/?page_id=4    Now, after deleting your burner software, and after installing this software, doesn't fix the problem, here is the Registry fix,  9.http://www.pchell.com/hardware/cd_drive_...

When you're in device manager, go to your cd/dvd drive, right click on it and select "roll back driver".  This will return it to its original driver that it shipped with, possibly fixing the problem.  Afterwards, go back into device manager, right click on the drive and select "update driver".  If you can't roll it back, try selecting "update driver" the first time.      Not sure if this will solve the problem but its worth a shot.
j3Px4JXfaa	Hi wilsonharreldoil@ymail.com,    Im Ron, a member of the Windows Outreach Team. Im here to help users with their questions.    Microsoft is currently Beta testing the next major OS, Windows 7. While no release dates are set, you can still take part in the Beta testing. Id suggest visiting the product page at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows... first, then you can decide if taking part in the Beta is right for you.    Instructions for downloading and installing the Beta are here: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...     Like I said, there arent any concrete dates for delivery of Windows 7, but taking part in the Beta would be a good way to get a sneak peek at some of the upcoming features.

Dont mess around with programs you dont know about, just stop the ones you want to not start up.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	Sounds to me like you have a virus, and it sounds like a pretty mean one.  Or malware has infested your computer.    It may be very difficult to get rid of.  What kind of protection do you have?  Hopefully Norton or Kaspersky, or some strong one like that.    So shut down the computer.  Then restart, and continually tap the F8 key.  Select SAFE MODE to strat.  When the computer starts in the safe mode, run a complete virus scan.  It will be take a while because the processor runs slower in the safe mode.    If you are lucky and have strong virus protection, it will isolate and quarantine the virus for you, or perhaps even delete it automatically.    If you are not lucky, and you're using the free stuff, then you might end up having to reformat your computer completely to get rid of the virus.
VdHKQMeXaa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|BVL85SAqaa	stuff happens. maybe you should completely wipe it and install XP again.|`|AA11542500	Usually when a system hangs like that, you have a device driver that is bad so the computer locks up trying to load the device driver.

tOCESHLYaa	It's should be ok it's part of Windows Error Report. It sends the report to Microsoft.
dkpIjt5jaa	There is no best !    The rule of thumbs for security is to have a multi-layered protection approach !    So do not use more than one virus scanner on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Adware/Spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one).     You can only use one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one) but, if you have a router, you can also activate its built-in Firewall as they use different methods.      Here are my suggestions for free software you can mix and match to your liking according to the rule (I tried all personally):    Anti-Malware/Spyware/Adware scanners suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.    Virus scanners suggestions:    Don't go for AVG free, it may be free but it has hiccups like the error that made the news late last year on CNET, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose the use of their Windows system.    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall (or don't want a Firewall) then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include Email, Malware, Spyware or Adware scanners so complement by choosing from other suggestions on this page    Email scanner suggestions:    Spamdel: http://www.spamdel.com/    OR    Inbox: http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi...    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|HOq5Urn1aa	You can protect your computer very well with free programs. The best way is to use a combination of anti virus and anti spyware programs          Anti virus and firewall pro  http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d...    or    http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  in combination with  http://www.pctools.com/firewall/    Spywareblaster  http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/spywareb...      Threatfire is an anti virus, that can be installed next to any other anti virus program on the same computer  http://www.threatfire.com/      This is a very good program, that completely runs in the background  http://www.comodo.com/boclean/boclean.ht...    Anti spyware  http://www.spywareterminator.com/  http://en.kioskea.net/telecharger/telech...  http://en.kioskea.net/telecharger/telech...        Installing these  programs, will not use any extra RAM or CPU usage.|`|8WmfpGYKaa	AVG is really popular because it's free but I prefer the norton antivirus 2008. Even though it's not free so much better. Or I would recommend kaspersky Internet security or antivirus.|`|xe1NoWUNaa	Sorry' you will not get a AV that really works and does as advertised for free. Don't expect something for nothing. The world just doesn't work that way. AV's like AVG & AVAST are a joke. Right now Kaspersky is the best you will get. 98% detection rate. 97% protection rate. You will find nothing better. Norton' Memory hog. McAfee' memory hog with not that good of a detection rate. Neither are worth the money you have to pay. Forgot to mention Norton's uninstall issues.
gPeKss3Faa	I'm fairly certain it has something to do with using a laser printer instead of an inkjet. Glossy paper is coated with something that tends to react badly to heat - i.e. in a laser printer.    You can buy glossy paper that is laser-printer specific, or  if you have a decent one, use an inkjet.|`|474f4ee43db93ea02e0f93e6d5bee0daaa	The take-up mechanism gathers and collects dust from the paper and makes your first few printouts feature burn marks across the page. You need to cover the exposed rear paper handler with something to prevent the dust from building up.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Sounds like you have the wrong sort of paper for that particular printer.|`|AA11296044	I am answering!    The first thing to check would be to ensure that you paper you are using is laser compatible.   SOme glossy coating (designed for inkjet printers) will bubble when they meet a laser fuser, this is because coating is heat sensitive (it allows the liquid ink to penetrate the resin coating).   However, when you run it through a laser printing, the coating expands due to the the excessive heat and does not contract.    That would be the first place to start.    The second thing, now that you have made sure you are using the correct paper is to adjust your paper settings.  When you go to print, click on properties than paper.  You will have different settings for heavy glossy, hopefully one for 150 gsm.  What this does is speed or slow down the page as it runs through the fuser ensuring you are not excessively heating the page.|`|rVXDaJAKaa	Is it paper designed for a laser printer? It sounds like the heat is causing the gloss layer to separate.
xe1NoWUNaa	Have you tried this?      http://www.softpedia.com/get/Antivirus/T...    You can also try the microsoft malicious soft ware removal tool. Go to start' Click run' In the box type mrt     When it opens click run. If your getting automatic updates you will have this. It comes in handy.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|fizuyKBTaa	Trojan.Brisv.A!inf has infected lots of people.  This is one of the latest infections.

UTm9gKqfaa	it sounds like you have an upgrade version of windows vista.  try to reinstall your old version of windows then install vista.|`|W4si7Z4Waa	okay, it could be one of two things.    1) you bought the UPGRADE to vista, not the full retail version, or,  2) you're trying to install vista on the old hard drive and the virus is preventing that.    if you're really unlucky, it could be both, let's hope that's not the case.  At any rate, you should buy a new hard drive to put it on anyways, but if you don't want to, then download KillDisk and completely wipe the hard drive clean of everything.

Good luck.|`|8WmfpGYKaa	what do you mean mb sign thing?it's not supposed to beat when you put in your video cards so that means your video card is working well fact that it doesn't show the screen means your connection from the monitor to the video card is bad or something like that.

dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Just google for "norton removal tools".|`|fizuyKBTaa	Antivirus 360 is a virus, so you can't uninstall it like an application.

Obviously this wasn't one of them.    Either it will load or it will not.  There is no fix.  Here is what Microsoft has to say:    Many programs designed for a computer running a 32-bit version of Windows will work on a computer running 64-bit versions of Windows without any changes. However, in some cases there might be differences in performance. If a 32-bit program uses embedded drivers, the drivers might not work in the 64-bit environment. If you have a 64-bit computer, it's best to run programs designed to run on a 64-bit computer.

(Not so expensive)    As for hosting:  I recommend and personally use:  http://www.hostmonsterplus.com  They have unlimited space and transfer.  They give you a free domain for life.  They have php and mysql if you ever use those.  You can also add as many domains (.com, .net, ...) as you like so you can have many different sites for 1 hosting price.  They also give you free $50 Google Credits for advertising your site.  It's only $5.95, it's the best cost for quality service I've found over the years, and the reason I'm still hosted with them.    If you go with them and have any trouble making your site feel free to PM me, I have a lot of experience there.    Whatever you choose, the best luck to you and your new business. Questions are the first step to progress.|`|32XqpAD0aa	As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.    To get further information take a look at: http://www.threehosts.com/build    You need a web hosting service which supports online payments like, Master Card, Visa & PayPal. It is very important that your service be uptime. It means that you can access your account whenever you want to update your web pages, and your visitors can view your website whenever they type your website address. If your hosting service is not uptime it is real hell!    If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together.

A CMS system stands for Content Management System.  A CMS contains all the tools you would need to publish a website  and is very expandable.  For example Joomla -- One of the highest rated CMS systems.  http://www.joomla.org    I personally use Joomla myself for both information sites and product driven sites.  Now as for making your site look professional you can purchase templates at varying websites for very low investment.  I do personally suggest getting a professional logo designer ($100-200) for your top graphic but the template designers do supply you with the "source" files for graphics.  Which means you can take their graphic, put it into a graphic editing program, such as Adobe Photoshop (download a free trial if needed) and edit the text to your company name.        A few example sites for Joomla templates are :  http://www.joomlart.com     http://www.rockettheme.com    http://www.joomlashack.com     There will be a learning curve to use the administration functions of Joomla but it is not that difficult and there are many free video and text tutorials on how to use manage Joomla.   The installation  of Joomla is also very easy most hosts offer fantastico in there control panel which allows a one button push install of Joomla. (and other programs)      You will also find a very strong community behind Joomla CMS which is good because you are able to find many free add on extensions which benefit your website.  Such as newsletter functions,  voice or text customer service, user forums,  and many more.  You can see lists of common components for Joomla at http://extensions.joomla.org/    Website hosting is a very competitive market so standard hosting packages are relatively low cost. For the majority of websites a basic Linux plan will suffice.    I find Linux to be much faster & cost effective then windows plans.  Unless your site is going to be specifically designed in .asp or unitizes specific functions to windows servers I don't suggest Windows hosting.      I use the plan below myself on multiple websites for the past few years and have never had any issues.    Linux plan :    Winter Special - $4.95!

Cost is always an issue, especially for start up companies. However, part of the environmental analysis that you should do when entering a market is what drives customers to your future competitors and what they do well.    Most of the time, you will find that even a local company will have at least 7/10 people who visit the store research that company at one time or another. What will your website say about you?    You should always consider what you will expect your needs to come from your website in the future. Websites are a very cheap form of not only advertising, but a way to cut costs by automating and assisting your business operations, generating leads, etc. If you divide out the costs on a per day basis, you won't find any cheaper marking/customer relationship strategy than a website.    If you are starting out, you need to find someone who will listen to your needs and be someone who can help you in each stage of your business life cycle. Not a lot of web designers are capable of doing that as the general designer is not that good at customer relations and business. That isn't their forte.    I suggest that you visit http://www.rexibit.com and use their contact form to contact the owner. The owner is a freelancer, but is well versed in the needs of a business and can help you as you start out small and not suffer repercussions from bad planning decisions due to trying to cut costs. He is also quite affordable and will work with your budget.

Java is not used at all. Java is not the same as Javascript so don't confuse them. Javascript is used for fancy effects and in the case of this form it is used to generate the booking form according to the booking time that you click. It is also badly written as it doesn't work with Firefox so there is a quarter of your customers locked out already.    What this system uses to handle the form is ASP. You can not handle forms unless you have a server side CGI such as ASP, PHP, Perl etc. You could use Java for server side scripting via servlets but finding hosting is rare and more expensive. You will need to learn a cgi so I recommend PHP.    To learn Javascript there isn't a good development system. I use Notepad++ to do the editing and Firefox with the Web Developer plug-in to do the testing and debugging.|`|AA12129353	The link you have given is not working.

I suspect they won't be taking up much space on your harddrive, so it is fine to leave them there.     You just need to get into the routine of tidying up your PC every once in a while.     There are three decent programs that I would highly recommend you to use on a regular basis:    1) CCleaner:    Download it here:    http://www.download.com/CCleaner/3000-21...    After you've successfully installed the program, open it and click the button that says "Run Cleaner". Let it remove the junk files.     2) AusLogics Disk Defragmenter.    Download it here:    http://www.download.com/Auslogics-Disk-D...    After you've successfully installed the program, run it. Under where it says "Select the disk that you want to defragment" choose: C:\ (Local, NTFS etc..). Click "Next". Let it defragment your harddrive. Be patient as it does so.    3) Glary Utilities 2.10.0.622:    Download it here:    http://www.download.com/Glary-Utilities/...    After you've installed that successfully, go to the "Modules" tab and click on "Disk Cleaner" and follow the steps. After doing that, return to the "Modules" tab and click where it says "Registry Cleaner". Follow the steps when prompted. You can also go to the "1-Click Maintenance" tab if you would prefer it.    When you've finished using these fantastic applications your PC should be flying like it's brand new. It'll get rid of a lot of unnecessary junk. Only remove actual full programs if you really must, or if your computer has nearly ground to a complete standstill.|`|HOq5Urn1aa	Here are some cleaning tools you should run.

You now can format the USB drive then put your data back .      Good luck.|`|1n31PjkFaa	try a different computer,see if it will recognize it then save it into a file,format your card reinstall it ,,,go home|`|4jR4iryfaa	Some systems are programmed to stop the USB from opening unless it is empty or formatted in the same system. This is because as pendrives carry viruses and worms, this is the only way to protect their system from getting infected.    But if other pendrives are opening in that system, then ur pendrive is definitely infected. TO get the data with infection u can do as told by the other user like open witht he windows explorer or the address bar or the RUN prompt in start menu.    But please format ur pendrive at the end of the task.    All the best

I couldn't find how much money they were asking for it so I cant exactly tell you if it's a good deal or not. In my opinion don't settle for anything less than a Core 2 Duo. The Pentium Dual will do the job but it's getting a bit obsolete. You should look at dells on their website and build one to your likes. Then go online and find the $500 off coupon codes and apply them to your final price. You will be a happy man. Or woman... sorry :D

Qm2apU5Qaa	import javax.swing.JFileChooser;    public class Example  {   public static void main(String[] args)   {    JFileChooser choose = new JFileChooser();    int returnVal = choose.showSaveDialog(null);   }  }|`|75nbESJUaa	The JFC is a heirarchy of any widget then: JComponent, Container , Component -- all the way up to Object. What makes the JDialog of any flavor become active is .requestFocusInWindow(); which is the call to JComponent's WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW. Okay, you declare .showSaveDialog(null); which is no window is the owner (declaring a dialog(null) will center on the monitor screen) but you lose the chain reaction when the parent window stops the java program, the JDialog will not stop and that will cause a memory leak and keep going like a zombie.    Swing is an animation loop that threads through all the JComponents declared. Java specifically cannot command the Terminal Window, which is part of the OS. If we could command the Terminal Window, a virus would be trivial to execute. Security would be compromised.    I think you are seeing a dead thread on the first envocation of JFileChooser and then the thread attaches to the dead thread and runs. In practical practices, I create JFileDialog if I will be needing one and immediately hide it because of the time delay Swing needs to make one. However, the factory JFileDialog is not truly easy to use. My boilerplate code uses JFileTree I made up myself to navigate the hard drives for the file(s) I want to manipulate.

GpgECd1Iaa	Well, you didn't say which web server you use - IIS or Apache, and which Perl - ActivePerl or Cygwin Perl.  That highly influences possible answer.     First off, replace backslashes by forward slashes - you're feeding the wrong command to it:    system("c:/control/....");    Second, check the exit status right after using this code taken from Perl man page for system().    if ($? == -1) {          print "failed to execute: $!\n";  }elsif ($? & 127) {      printf "child died with signal %d, %s coredump\n",             ($? & 127),  ($? & 128) ? 'with' : 'without';  } else {          printf "child exited with value %d\n", $? >> 8;  }    Check your web server's error log file - it may shed some light on the problem.     Another thing is, if your program x10com32.exe uses GUI, it simply won't work. GUI programs don't work from most Windows-based web servers, because web server runs as Windows service (before any desktop session exists) and Windows prevents services from interacting with desktop. You are limited to command-line programs in that environment.    Replace your command by something more simple - like system("echo great success > c:/tmp/test.txt");    If that works, but your program doesn't, the problem is in your program.    Good luck.|`|fbb74ff00bf5ccffec646cf3e5a7c537aa	This has to do with "quoting" and "control character sequences" in Perl.

3dc53b62c47e8fc462aa69e45e0db09baa	Hello, Do you know HTML or XHTML?    If so then you can start to learn how to do databases...    I don't recommend ASP for a scripting language instead I recommend you use PHP(it's free too). Also for a database language you will probably want to learn MySql which works perfect with PHP.    Both of these will help you build your site with accounts, However the host you are using must support the scripting and database language you choose.    You don't have to use PHP or Mysql but they are really the best in my opinion. They are also the most used so trying to get help later on will not be a problem.    You should probably by a book for each(PHP and Mysql) to learn form. Using on line tutorials will leave you hanging and then trying to find some other site to pick up where you last left.|`|2CAIBQrTaa	Do you know any programming ?  I made mine using ASP coding...  But there;'s other sites that allow you to make one easily too, try http://www.bravenet.com/webtools/passwd/

9ECwMzZXaa	To create your own Microsoft PowerPoint (2003) templates, follow these instructions:    1 - On the Standard toolbar, click New Button image.  If this or any other toolbar mentioned later in this procedure isn't visible, on the View menu, point to Toolbars, and then click the toolbar that you want to display.  2 - Switch to master view by pointing to Master on the View menu, and then clicking Slide Master.  3 - Make the changes that you want to the slide master. The slide master stores information about the design template applied, including font styles, placeholder sizes and positions, background design, and color schemes.  4 - If you want additional slides to be part of this template, click the Normal View Button image button in the lower-left of the window, and then add the slides and any text that you want on them.  5 - On the File menu, click Save As.  6 - In the File name box, type a name for your template, and then, in the Save as type box, click Design Template.  7 - Click Save.    The template is saved to the Templates folder. (This is the folder that PowerPoint uses by default when you select Design Template as the file type in the Save As dialog box.)    After you exit and restart PowerPoint, the template is available in the Slide Design task pane, in alphabetical order by file name, under Available For Use. Also, after you apply the template once, save your presentation, and restart PowerPoint, the template appears in the New Presentation task pane (File menu, New) under Recently used templates.    For the full tutorial, look under source(s):|`|hunbPOWHaa	save as template answers first question.    second = www.tutorialized.com
Bqi7jmsPaa	VSS files are used by Windows for backup purposes to restore your computer's operating system to a previous date/state.    This is a valuable feature, and there is really no reason to turn it off.  But if you insist, here are the instructions:    Navigate to Control Panel > System and Maintenance > System and in the left pane, click "System Protection".     Here you will se a list of hard drives with checkboxes by each, the checkbox indicates that System Restore is enabled for that volume.     To turn it off, just uncheck the volume where you want it disabled and confirm you want to turn off System Protection. Turning it back on is just as easy as checking the box again.

AA12000171	My guess is some program, driver or process is causing the trouble.  to rule that out...    Try booting in Safe Mode  or  type "msconfig" in the Run prompt and then select Diagnostic Startup, click OK and then restart    if the problem was fixed then run "msconfig" again, click startup tab and try unchecking any unnecessary  startup programs.  OR alternatively use Windows "System Restore" to restore your computer to a date when you did not have this problem :-)    I know its not much but I hope it will help resolve your problem|`|0qW6XjLgaa	Maby it could be a virus on you computer or take it to a computer shop and tell them the problem|`|VdHKQMeXaa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.

XlyLakYAaa	Well, your motherboard has to actually support overclocking.  Next, and this part is the most important and often lept out by n00bs: you need to test your overclock.  Too many people just increase the speed of the front side bus and if the computer actually makes it to windows they think they overclocked their computer correctly (but they haven't).  After the computer boots up: 1) you need to benchmark the system to make sure you actually did increase your performance and 2) you need to make sure your overclock is stable and not causing your CPU to fail or compute faulty results.  A free program called 3DMark is good for the former and another free program called Prime95 i good for the latter.    There are other things successful overclockers do, like increase power to the CPU (at the cost of increased heat) but a lot of that is more a skill and comes with experience.|`|nc2emLCJaa	Dont just go at it.lol    Youll have to buy a entire new computer(my dumbass though it was cool to see my computer smoke)AHAHAHAHAHAH      READ!!!!!!!!!!!!        http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/cpu/dis...

Be Drawing to much power from the power supply which is and easy fix  2. This would make any one mad but possibly if you were adding new hardware a little shock of static electricity could have blown out the processor which well that is very bad  but if you didn't add new hard ware then you could have bumped the hard drive cord out causing it not to activate.  you could also try if you have 2 hard drives disconnecting the one that DOESN'T have the file you need and seeing if that works.

If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.    If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.    As an experienced webmaster I recommend BlueHost service which Im sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements.

There are many steps that you will need to do in order to get a nice looking site that will function properly with all browsers, but these steps should get you to the point that you can start with.    1. Get web hosting (preferably a host with cpanel) a host like lunarpages.com is good and like $50 a year.   2. Buy domain from a registrar like godaddy.com  3. Configure the dns server in the registrar settings. (Your hosting company generaly gives you a step by step instruction set on how to do this or at the very least has to provide with at least two dns address's like dn1.secureserver.net and dn2.secureserver.net  4. Create a webpage using Microsoft Frontpage or use the built in templates in the cpanel addons.   5. your done visit the website.      If you plan on hosting yourself it will be a little more difficult.   1. Setup a computer using Apache or Microsoft IIS (Internet Information services) which most people do NOT like to use and it does suck. Microsoft themeselves has had to resort to using Unix hosting in the past because of overloaded Windows servers.  2. Get a dns server account like zoneedit.com or others if you isp will not add your domain to their dns server which most wont or will charge for hosting.  3. Just pay for hosting and don't go this route. (Email and dns are a pain to setup and will take weeks of going to forums trying to figure out).|`|f7nYu2zAaa	chkout http://weebly.com  its a free website making tool with easy drag-n-drop interface.  i also made 1 ovr thr.. chkit out..  http://songzz.weebly.com

To get around this, you should download an archiving program such as "7-zip" and use it to break the file into pieces smaller than the sites maximum file size.    Gigasize.com is very good as well, it allows file sizes up to 300 mb, so many video files can be uploaded whole.     When you use these sites, be sure that you write down the download link that they give you so that you can download them later, and also (if given) the delete link.
AA11296044	I have 4 printers all for different purposes.    Printer one, main feature it is portable, small and fast.  Great for carrying around with the laptop.    Printer 2, mail feature, it is a wide format.  I can print up to 13" wide by 48" long.  The printer is HUGE, so it is stationary.    Printer 3, laser printer, monochrome.  The feature is that it is a laser printer, and dirt cheap to run, great for bulk black printing.    Printer 4, very old HP office Jet.  The cartridges are dirt cheap, it has a scanner and fax.  The quality stinks however.   It is the fax machine, it is also used to do proofing and bulk color printing when quality doesn't need to be top notch.  It is also the scanner.    Generally they are all rectangles of varying colors and sizes. All have green blinking lights and all print.   Some cost more than others to run, some create a better copy, some scan, some fax and some don't print in color.  They all have varying purposes, I opted to own several printers for different purposes other than one printer with a pile of features.   This way if one feature on one of my printers craps out I only have to replace one printer, with limited features rather than looking for a wide format cheap bulk printer which scans, faxes and duplexes.    As a side note I can also run 4 print jobs at once which is a lifesaver, especially if yu need to roll print a large print on the wide format which can take 1/2 hour.|`|bxlYleZkaa	If you mean a pc printer rather than Caxton himself then a grey box with a slot in it and some very expensive ink inside.|`|rzkFHAEJaa	A feature I have on my printer is the ability to read memory cards, like those found in digital cameras.|`|pG15wDfRaa	A rectangular shaped item with curves, colors, and lights.

a5NcueNwaa	what format does it save the picture in?    open it with the same thing you saved it with, and then save it with a different format.      JPEG (.jpg) format is probably the most compatible to use if you will be uploading to different sites or sending to people.    ---new----------  If saving as jpeg, check if your picture editing software is giving it .jpeg or .jpg as the extension.  Try uploading files with each extension to your website you're using.    Perhaps the problem is your picture editing software?    Try using different pic editing software to save the pic.  try doing it in GIMP, it's free and has alot of features.  Get it from http://www.gimp.org/downloads/    By default GIMP will want to save as .xcf but you can change to jpg from picking it in a dropdown list, or simply typing the save name as "something.jpg".

c78mAitdaa	Yes it most defiantly helps...   You should also run the Disk Clean up in your Accessories.     And this product is one of the best to help make your computer run smoother although it costs. (But it is better than the inbuilt one of your computer, although i don't think it is needed):    http://www.perfectdisk.com/    :)|`|rzkFHAEJaa	Depends on what you use it for and what state it is in. Defragmenting can help if the slow down is due to fragmentation on your hard drive. More memory might help if you have a lot of memory intensive programs running concurrently. Some times the easiest thing to do, is buy a new faster computer.|`|bLuFKxQNaa	Yes it definitely helps restore the performance lost due to fragmentation. Before defragging, run a diskcleanup and chkdsk.    I would suggest you download the free 30 day trial version of Diskeeper09 and set it on automatic mode. It defrags really well even if you have less than 15% free space and also defrags the MFT.  http://www.diskeeper.com/|`|HYx3mVSgaa	yes defragment helps the computer to boost up the speed but frequent defragmentation can produce some fatal errors|`|6WDrEBHWaa	Run Defragmenter twice a month.  Run Disk Cleanup twice a month.  Don't overload your CPU.|`|lvhQeDrwaa	To make your computer fast and work well you need to :    1. Uninstall or disable unnecessary startup programs.  2. Delete unnecessary data.  3. Do a Disc Cleanup.  4. Defragment.    The first one is the most important.|`|wiJz0FYLaa	Assuming you have no hardware issues, do this:    (1) Run a FULL anti-virus scan with a good virus scanner. Get free editions of AVast or AVG8. Use the latest virus definitions file. But don't install or run more than one anti-virus at the same time.    (2) Run anti-spyware scans with Spybot S&D and malwarebytes.    (3) Ensure all Microsoft security updates are applied.    (4) Run disk cleanup to delete old temp files and other junk    (5a) Run chkdsk once to scan for file system errors. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265    (5b) Run  a thorough disk defrag. Use a good defragmenter for this, and also run a boot-time defrag to fix the MFT and page file if they are fragmented. You can check out Diskeeper 2009, which is widely acknowledged to be the best defragger around. Their website has free 30-day trial versions. http://www.diskeeper.com    (6) Disable unnecessary background processes and services that take up memory.    (7) Make sure all the hardware components have the latest and most stable drivers. Video card performance in particular is strongly dependent on drivers.     Good Luck!|`|pogaNhAeaa	yes defregmanter helps to do that  just dfragment all ur drives  go in run  type chkdsk  EVERYTHING WILL BE DONE!!|`|5e8InGK3aa	Defragmenting helps if the slow-down problems is due to the hard drive being cluttered. Getting more memory(ram) should help you alot more. Also try running a trusted registry cleaner and anti-virus/Anti-spyware program if u dont have one. Your fact that your computer is running slow could be linked to alot of variables :)
18167e6cb8bb213b37ad670e7870b7fdaa	Open it up, blow all the dust out, especially out of the cpu heat sink, pull out the bios battery for a minute then put it back in, pull out the memory cards and reseat them, then see it if you can get it to post.      If not, is it making any beeps when you power it on?  Those would an error code.  If you  have a manual or can look one up for your board, that might tell you what's wrong.     You can also try powering on with just one of the memory cards in, then the other one.  If it decides to work with one of them, the other one may be bad.     Then again maybe your power supply is bad.  If you can't test it, maybe you can find an old junk pc on craigslist or somewhere for free, that still has a power supply in it.  You could swap that out and find out.      If none of this helps, I'd suspect it's either the motherboard or the cpu.  You could take the heat sink off and reinstall it, what the heck.  Look for scorch marks.     Anyway, all this stuff you got is old and cheap, and you may be able scrape up workable replacements for all of it for next to nothing, if not free, if you look around a bit.      If it's got a pci slot, yeah you can put a pci vga card in it.|`|fE7zhp3Caa	Yes, you can install a PCI video card in this machine, provided you have a PCI slot available or easily made available.  You'll probably want to pull the AGP card in case it's got a serious hardware problem that could interfere with the boot process even when your not using it for video.    But there are a few other problems other than the video card that could be keeping you from booting.  If the system seems to be booting normally except for the lack of video, then it's probably the connection, the video cable, the video card, or the monitor.  If you don't get anything (no fans, no beep, no hard drive activity, etc. on top of no video) then it could be one or more failed components, including processor, RAM, video, motherboard, or another card like a modem or sound card.|`|b98f0d991454d2b0f5dd6a7ab438dd30aa	Ok  when you turn on your computer listen for the beeping sound. there's a code which part is not functioning.    If you are planing to upgrade your computer. you can't use the PCI e card it is a different architecture. but you can use the AGP card for your video. I advise you to buy or assemble a new one. if you have some money.|`|HYx3mVSgaa	buddy the nice & a wise thing is to assemble i.e upgrade your Pc    and in u r current system also u can add the AGP card but again u need to boost up u r RAM for the processing of that card......................the best thing is to upgrade u r whole Pc|`|5e8InGK3aa	Yes you can add a PCI video card if the port is available. I dont see a reason too tho. I would advise u to just go out a buy a cheap little computer in the local electronic store. U can always buy a little word cruncher for around 50 bucks if your tight on cash :)

If you get warned or banned, they do too.  Your best option would to sign up when they open their doors to the public.  I saw it open for a few hours a day from 26th to 29th Jan, a shame you missed it. Previous to this it was open for for 2 days that ended on the 21st Jan.  Open Registration days can be any day of the week, are not necessarily every month and can last hours or days.  I'd advise you to check the site EVERY day and eventually you will get there.

Writing good documentation takes a lot of time in itself.      I don't think that you should bother trying to give free samples to existing software companies because they probably won't even bother looking at your work;  They probably use their own engine or have licensed another one and have no time to view any others.  Besides, without any demo or fully-functional games, they have no idea how good your code is.  Work with shareware programmers first.|`|pP8Q4DWvaa	you might want to protect it first, with patents or whatever applies.

OR if its onboard.. reserve the IRQ or move it in the bios when the pc starts up.    perhaps try download newer drivers for both?    of if you've downloaded/installed something new, and noticed after that issues started happening. that might be the cause, so uninstall it.    try giving the registry a clean up also    http://www.filehippo.com/download_cclean...    issues tab..
8PXz0Hxhaa	Please be extra careful in formatting.  If you are unsure how to correctly format and reinstall the machine I would recommend taking it in to have it done.    It depends on what version of Windows you are running as well.  If it is 2000 / XP  you need to insert your windows disk and let it boot off the cd.      1.  Press enter at the first blue screen  2. Press F8 at the second blue screen  3. You should now see your instalation.  Follow the options on the screen to delete your current installation and continue "enter".  It will then give you an option to format in NTFS which will format your windows and start the reinstall process.|`|688a460b46028d2db1f3be96a472d652aa	the easy way is get a virus that will format your pc then run it.    enjoy|`|yqLFYdGYaa	You don't format your C: drive in windows you have to format in DOS, but you only have to format a new drive not a drive that has your operating system on it.

0abf52e9048e05a852e90e1316728b92aa	Well, you do have a problem. System restore is only used if your system has problems after you install something that you shouldn't have or causes problems.    How did you delete the program?  Did you simply go into Windows Explorer or My Computer and delete the folder? or did you go into Control Panel and use the Add/Remove Programs feature?    If you used Control Panel then you need the disk to re-install, if you simply deleted the folder, you may be able to go into your Recycle Bin and choose the folders and files you wish to restore to their original places.    As for the other problems you created by using restore, you will have to re-install them or maybe at least re-update them, not sure you can get them back exactly as you had them before though. By using restore you removed saved changes to the registry and other things that cannot be undone back forward again. You can try the System Restore first and see if it will let you go back forward, but I don't think it will.    Sorry.|`|HIsQEwd0aa	go in with safe mode  and then try    F8 before it totally boots|`|Xo1WbxmMaa	Please don't scream at us.  Turn of your Caps Lock.

Xo1WbxmMaa	Try a online antivirus scanner and a online anti-adware/malware/spyware scanner in safe mode with network to clean up your computer BEFORE you download anything.  To format you computer and reinstall is the last option.    Turn off system restore before you boot up in safe mode with network to clean your system restore points for viruses, spyware, adware etc.    To get in safe mode tap F8 when booting you computer.  Choose "Safe mode with network".  Go to Start  Run - type iexplore http://www.bitdefender.com/scan8/ie.html Enter(ok).  Do a full system scan. If something is found, delete it, reboot and do the same again in safe mode with network.  When that scan does not find anything you reboot again in safe mode with network.  Go to Start  Run  type iexplore http://www.ewido.net/en/ Enter(ok).  Do a full system scan. If something is found, delete it, reboot and do the same again in safe mode with network.    **NOTE: Do NOT do anything else with your computer when scanning. This because you can start virus/adware/spyware/malware manually.    When no one of these scanners are showing anything you can reboot back to normal mode.  Turn on system restore.  ------------------  You need to get one antivirus program, one firewall and some spyware/adware/malware removers if you don't have it.

ePeaTo2Taa	The RAM memory, as well as the HD space and everything else, remains exactly the same, the problem tends to be that over the years, newer software/versions that come out require greater space in HD, and they use more RAM, making your computer get slower.

XvPO7PdQaa	No download the Live CD, it will let you run Ubuntu without even touching your hard drive.  If you rather switch to Ubuntu then you can install it from the CD.  Otherwise just run Ubuntu off the CD and Windows will not be touched.    You could even download the free version of VMWare and the DesktopAppliance (free) for Ubuntu and run Ubuntu right inside Windows.|`|4AQPx75qaa	Yes you can use Ubuntu and Windows on the same machine without problems.  No, you don't have to use the Live-CD method (slow and you can't save stuff easily).  You don't need to buy Partition Magic either.  Just download the Ubuntu CD (or have one shipped for free) at www.ubuntu.com, if you downloaded it, burn the .iso to a blank CD-R.  Then you'll want to defragment your hard drive, so do Start --> Accessories --> System Tools --> Disk Defragmenter.  Then, you can shut off your PC, and when you turn it back on, immediately put the CD into the drive (if it's not already in), so that the PC will boot from the CD instead of the hard drive (You should see the Ubuntu menu).  If it doesn't boot from the CD, access your BIOS when you're at your computer's logo screen (usually pressing F1 or Delete will get you there, it should say on the logo screen "Press  for Setup" or something like that), then find the Boot priority or boot order option, and set CDROM before Hard Disk.  Then exit and save.  Now the PC will boot from the Ubuntu disk, and it will load the complete Ubuntu OS in RAM (it will be fully usable but not installed), you can test it out, and when you've decided to install, you will need to shrink your Windows partition to make room for a second, Linux partition.  Open GParted by going to System --> Administration --> Gnome Partition Editor, you'll see a window with a big bar, with colored blocks representing the different partitions on your machine.  Chances are you only have one (maybe two, if your system has a recovery partition), so select the large one (probably your Windows one), and click Resize, then drag the bar down to lower the size.  When you apply that, you should be left with some Free Space, I recommend at least 6GB free space for a basic Ubuntu install, 10GB for a normal install, and 20+ GB for those who want Beryl, games, graphics, and a lot of files.  You don't need to make a partition out of the free space though, Ubuntu's installer will ask you where to install, just select "Largest Free Space on drive /hd".  Chances are you only have one hard drive, but if you have two make sure you select the right one (usually the first one, called "hda" in Ubuntu).  Then it will format the free space, install the OS, and set up the GRUB boot menu automatically.|`|AA11896276	use Partition Magic  and partition off a section  of your C drive  for  the Ubuntu. Then you can still use windows too..If you put Ubuntu over your windows OS  you will lose  it all.|`|AA10164248	You can setup up a dual boot in which you can choose to boot into either Windows or Ubuntu. During the install process you'll be given the option to set this up. There's no need to use PartitionMagic, as Ubuntu has the built in ability to resize your existing partition.    If you're a little more advanced, you can run Windows INSIDE of Ubuntu using either VituralBox or VmWare. Here's a vid of me running Windows XP inside of Ubuntu using VirtualBox.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ecNNRHz...
t1onMveDaa	I'm guessing either you don't have an anti virus or you have one out of date because there is a big chance that what caused the folder option to disappear is a virus or some sort.

If you computer comes up clean after running your resident security products, you may want to consider running a System File Checker (SFC). This can be run in Safe Mode should you prefer. To get into Safe Mode either hold down or tap the F8 key repeatedly while the computer is starting up. To run SFC, close all applications such as Office, Messenger, Email, etc, and go to:    - Start  - Run  - Type in sfc /scannow (include the space before the " / ")    What SFC does is that it attempts to fix or replace critical operating system files. Sometimes this can be done without the installation disk, however it may prompt you for the appropriate operating system installation disk. If that is the case, then you know that you definitely have file corruption or something missing. Insert the disk if prompted. Also you should run SFC using the Administrator account.    If you have the Vista operating system, the steps are a bit different due to the UAC. See the link below.  http://vistasupport.mvps.org/system_file...    Don't surf, play games or do anything while SFC runs. After it is completed, reboot your computer.    One of the major culprits in missing or corrupt operating system files is running a registry cleaner or optimizer. They can flag important shared files for deletion or cleanup. Another cause is malware.    NOTE: Before running any registry cleaner or editing the registry, always ensure you back it up first. If the registry cleaner you are using doesn't have that function, you can do it manually. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756|`|43c521c8861cae797548146fc87ea0eaaa	Its the registry error do the following  1)Run--->regedit  2)search the following keys     HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Curren...

1a9674b432f9d77ae963ef7391d2e5edaa	If you are trying to make a data CD, then you could just try dragging and dropping the files. With two windows open, the actual drive with the blank CD, and the window with the data to transfer, this is possible. Just move each individual file over to the blank CD. It essentially copies them over. I'm not sure about all computers, but mine will write them automatically. Otherwise you would look for a "Burn to CD" or "Write files" type option. I hope this helps.|`|t5EXmcuBaa	First, check your drive. If it is compatible with DVD's and CD's, then your o.k. Second, check your disc. Can you see if it's already been used? Is it DVD-R; CD-R? or DVD-RW./CD-RW? If it's DVD-RW or CD-RW then you can use it again even if you have written on it. Because CD-R's are only one time use, you put your data on it and then it seals the disc. Next, check to see if your file size that you want to write to the disc doesn't exceed the disc limit. If you have a 10 MB disc, you can only put 10 mega-bytes worth of data on it. If the file size is too big, then the computer will reject the command.|`|rSqSxIyOaa	Check to see if your computer has a DVD burner or just a CD burner.

h4YPo90Maa	NO. Per Microsoft it will only be available for Vista.    I expect game manufacturers and gamers will pressure Microsoft to develop a DirectX 10 version for XP.    Per  http://letskilldave.com/archive/2006/10/...    For those of you still reading, and interested in the facts, here they are:  - Windows XP cannot run DirectX 10 (technically, Direct3D 10) applications because of the significant changes in the graphics API and driver model    - And while Im on it, the Xbox 360 cannot run Direct3D 10 because it lacks the Shader Model 4.0 hardware.     So, if youve read this far and STILL want Windows XP to run DirectX 10, you know the only answer:  Youll need to upgrade to Windows Vista and install a Shader Model 4.0 graphics card!|`|F9Dw68KNaa	No. Windows Vista, which has DirectX 10, includes an updated DirectX runtime based on the runtime in Windows XP SP2 (DirectX 9.0c) with changes to work with the new Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) and the new audio driver stack, and with other updates in the operating system. In addition to Direct3D 9, Windows Vista supports two new interfaces when the correct video hardware and drivers are present: Direct3D9Ex and Direct3D10.    Since these new interfaces rely on the WDDM technology, they will never be available on earlier versions of Windows. All the other changes made to DirectX technologies for Windows Vista are also specific to the new version of Windows. The name DirectX 10 is misleading in that many technologies shipping in the DirectX SDK (XACT, XINPUT, D3DX) are not encompassed by this version number. So, referring to the version number of the DirectX runtime as a whole has lost much of its meaning, even for 9.0c. The DirectX Diagnostic Tool (DXdiag.exe) on Windows Vista does report DirectX 10, but this really only refers to Direct3D 10.  download 9.0c here http://www.softwarepatch.com/windows/dir...|`|rbGdvThJaa	http://microsoft.com/directx. i believe it is still called 9c.    !~Tim~!|`|3a29cb4391a22f7f74f4a5fcd1e4224daa	Look here.|`|RR3I3SNGaa	no (at least for now), they only for vista

The root of it comes with the "Cumulative Internet Explorer 7 update" which was released on June 12th or 14th. Apparently, bad, bad, bad drivers are being installed that instantly crash your system on load. Or alternately, if you can actually boot into Vista, it will randomly BSOD on you after a few minutes.    The only solution I've found is to just completely reinstall Vista, and just never let it download and install the cumulative IE7 update. Microsoft is aware of the problem, yet they refuse to acknowledge it because it's bad press for them. I love Vista, but this is just no good.

AA11158078	Trackers is against the privacy policy.... you have no right knowing what other ppl do on their computers... your "page" is not YOUR page.... it belongs to myspace, and they will not allow users to invade the privacy of others by hosting scripts like that... thus accounts trying to use trackers are deleted...    not to mention, they don't work... and the ones that do are disabled in a matter of days... mostly because they track ppl by their ip address, and as soon as your ip changes (usually every few days), you're out of the tracker's database... and anything that doesn't track using that method is filtered by myspace, so they don't work at all....    and all those sites that offer them are full of spyware that infects your computer.... this has become a big problem lately, since now they infect your pc with codes to steal your login info for myspace without you having to fall for a fake login page...    and they try to steal your myspace login info so they can hijack your account and spam your friends in bulletins with advertisements...    the goal of a tracker site IS NOT to give you a tracker.. it's to make money.... and by visiting their site, you make them money... whether it's from spyware or spam or charging for the tracker, they get paid... they don't care if the tracker stops working the next day or if your account is deleted, because they already made their money at your expense....      if they get your login info, they have several options....    they can automatically login as you and send out bulletins to your friends advertising free ipods or viagra....    ppl seldom notice that until their friends start complaining about all the crap bulletins that have already been sent (by you)....    then they have the option to jack your page and make it look like a fake login page to steal your friends' login info... you notice that pretty quickly, but they can also change your password and lock you out, so you totally can't do anything about it except contact myspace and hope they reply within a few weeks... but by that time, it's likely that someone has reported your profile for stealing logins and you've been deleted... myspace doesn't know that it wasn't you that set up the fake login page on your profile....    and lots of ppl use the same email/password for other stuff, like banking or paypal or amazon or ebay... then you get to deal with them stealing your money or you buy them alot of presents...    these ppl aren't amateurs... they know what they're doing, and they know how to get away with it... but you don't see that because you really just wanna know who looked at your profile....|`|F9Dw68KNaa	there are myspace trackers out there... but i think it's a violation of terms with myspace if you use em|`|CrH7XotWaa	spacesnoop.com|`|643a85ede839cd385cb233f9d83957faaa	No, and there is no way you can 'unlock' that feature because it doesn't exist.

Group and then use the Files area to hold your Excel or any other file that only members of the Group can access.  Each member of your organization should Join the Yahoo!

Google also has a Group feature like Yahoo!, but even better is that Google has a feature called Documents and Spreadsheets.  Every member of your organization needs a Google account to collaborate on a document or a spreasheet.  You can setup access controls on who can edit the file versus who can only view the file.

19FQV4tXaa	For all as I know, I don't think the modems really matter. I have used over 4 modems to host many connections from 128ks to 6mbs. All of them perform the same besides reliability which is disconnection and stuff. I believe the reason they told you to upgrade your modem was to make money. The truth is, upgrading your speed just by calling isn't instant. They have to set everything up. I think you should stop renting the modem and use your old one which I think is going on. I believe that your computer is capping your speed. Windows is built in with a program that monitors and adjusts your internet speed. I suggest you go and fix it yourself with TCP Optimizer. Go here and download it.     http://www.speedguide.net/    If you want help in optimizing your speed to your 10mbs, you can post your results if it isn't satisfying after your speedtest in the forums, the people there are quick to respond and very helpful.    http://forums.speedguide.net/forumdispla...

Using DSL is quite different than using cable, you need to use a login system in order to get internet through to your Netgear router. I believe that you use the account name and your password that you signed up with in order to gain access.
76161b37bdfe1f38183813c4a0d7ed33aa	"i have limewire and i downloaded limewire pro from limewire"    I have absolutely no idea why you guys do that. I see it suggested here all the time. Don't you guys know what "open-source software" means? Someone can get the Limewire source, do whatever they want to it, and then put it up for sharing calling it "Limewire Pro"!    Maybe it screwed up your Java (at the very least), maybe it had a virus. I wish you guys would stop doing that and suggesting that! It's stupid! Then you come back here (or worse, on other forums -- or even worse yet, one of your parents go on other tech forums) and start posting questions about removing "umpteen" malware infestations.     Although you probably will get answers to the contrary, Limewire (from limewire.com) doesn't contain malware. I know it gets that reputation from inexperienced users downloading stuff through it (like the "security fixes as well") that they shouldn't.    I've never got malware from limewire, shareaza (it's better; http://www.shareaza.com/ ), or frostwire.       check your Java install, uninstall it (if you have more than one listed in Add/Remove uninstall them all) and get the most recent version.    scan for malware    good luck  _|`|t1onMveDaa	It could be something with java.

Testing cheats mode:  Press [Ctrl] + [Shift] + C during game play to display the console window. Enter boolProp testingCheatsEnabled true to activate testing cheats mode. This is a very powerful cheat that enables many new things. In Create A Sim, after enabling this code, go into debugmode by pressing [Shift] + N before making a Sim. You now have the following new things in Create A Sim: skin tones, clothing, and some other options such as viewing the skinfilenames. In the game itself, after enabling this code, hold [Shift] and left click on a Sim to have lots of options, such as changing clothes, make your Sim fat or thin, set their aspiration level, etc. This code also can spawn some interesting items, such as the tombstone of L(ife) and D(eath), and family members.   Enable the boolProp testingCheatsEnabled true code then hold [Shift] and click on a mailbox. You will have new options, such as forcing a burglar to rob, know all Sims in the neighborhood (including NPCs and special Sims), force everyone you know to be friends, force pregnancy relations, invite all neighbors over, and more.

AA11064298	It's easy to do in Excel and you can set it up to be saved in case you ever want it again..    Put today's date in cell A1 in the form 8/6/07 (if you're in USA)  Put the March date in cell A2 in the form 3/17/08  In cell A3 write     =A2-A1    and a sort-of date will appear, probably in 1900.  Click on that date and then on Format, Cell, Number, OK.  The funny date changes to the number of days: 224.  From then on you can put any two dates in  A1 and A2, and it will tell you the difference.    Then just Save this little calculation with a simple name like DaysDates or similar.    This method will take care of Leap Year days as well.  That's why it shows 224; 2008 is a Leap Year.    [Note that in UK, we tend to show dates as dd/mm/yy.]|`|t1onMveDaa	Its 223 days from now and you can use this site for that date:  http://www.timeanddate.com/counters/cust...

First and foremost, these are MY opinions and have experience several machines that had these on them,  as well as users using these product. Not to mention that I have ran each and every one of these myself  so as to not confuse those that think that I have not.  My findings in these products are useless and sometimes scare the normal user.  Also, these products are not for the normal user as normal user do not take the time to read the   manuals/docs for what they download and or buy, they just want to install and use.         Stop using the following software:  -- AVG --  -Avg has been known to report false positives, also reports "tracking cookies" as "Trojan downloaders".  This is bad practice to me, scaring the user half to death because that's all that we hear on the news  anymore is about Trojans, Worms and Virus'  -Maybe free, but be aware that this product is not the normal product that you would put on a machine.  Most if not all of your experts will tell you to leave this alone, avoid it like the plaque    -- Ad Aware SE --  -Ad Aware is a dangerous program if you do not know how to set it up, although it comes with the basic  'normal' user settings, those that go messing about will find after changing the settings, will remove  things from the Windows System and then be stuck in a bad situation.    -- Spybot Search and Destroy --  -Same as Ad Aware Se    -- Ewido --  -Made By AVG NOW, although AVG (Grisoft) bought them out or merged (which ever you avgt fanatics prefer)  this product does the same as their software (av) and scares the user (see above AVG)    -- McAfee --  -System Hog. Although this product is and has been around for decades, it still isn't that great of a   product as it eats up resources like a hungry dog.    -- Housecalls --  -Not a bad product, but installs while online and no option(s) to UNinstall it.    -- Trendmicro --  -Not a bad product, but installs while online and no option(s) to UNinstall it.    -- Panda --  -Not a bad product, but installs while online and no option(s) to UNinstall it.    -- Norton --  -System Hog. Although this product is and has been around for decades, it still isn't that great of a   product as it eats up resources like a hungry dog.  -Also this product has to use it's own UNinstaller to get rid of it, even if you take it out of Add Remove  and reboot your system, this pain in the **** software prompts the user to reinstall or it auto does it    -- eTrust --  -Now owned by CA MS used to ship this with it's Feb 2004 Security Update CD set. ( I know I have it ) and what  a load of rubbish.    -- Kaspersky --  -Maybe free, but be aware that this product is not the normal product that you would put on a machine.

Remove all firewalls and anti-virus on your computer, as more than one of them causes unwanted conflicts on your computer. Note: It is perfectly fine to have more than one anti-spyware. To remove Windows Firewall, click Start>Control Panel>Security Center>Windows Firewall>Off (not recommended) Note: Dont worry about that, these steps will relieve you of that worry. Now thats done, remove your ant-virus by clicking Start>Control Panel>Add or Remove Programs. (Wait for the list to be populated by all your programs on your computer.) Look for your anti-virus, then click remove after that follow the uninstall wizard to remove your anti-virus. Note: If you had a different firewall than Windows Firewall then just follow the way to remove your anti-virus, except look for your firewall instead of the anti-virus. (Make sure that the Windows Firewall is off also).  Security Programs:   ______________________________________...    1.) AVG Anti-Virus  -http://www.download.com/3000-2239_4-1070...    2.)

(This ensures that all or most of the programs have been properly installed on your computer). After restarting your computer twice, update every single program, this is to be done as much as possible. Now that you have updated all the programs reboot into Safe Mode (This will make a nice, deep, clean scan on your computer with your new programs)-Turn off your computer>Turn on your computer>immediately hold on F8. This brings you to the menu to go to Safe Mode. Use your arrow keys and select Safe Mode Then log in. Congratulations, you have logged into Safe Mode Now that you are in Safe Mode (Run a full scan on every program when told to.) Run a FULL SCAN on AVG anti-spyware, AVG anti-virus, and AVG anti-rootkit at the same time. After these programs have finished, delete all found infections. Now run a FULL SCAN  on A-Squared Free, AdAware 2007 Free, and Spybot Search&Destroy at the same time so nothing can slip through. Note: There is not a Full Scan option on Spybot Search&Detstroy. If these programs have found anything, simply delete whatever they have found. Finally run a FULL SCAN with Windows Defender. Its kind of hard to find out how to do a full scan on Windows Defender, so heres how. On the top you can see scan, then right next to it, is a diagonal line, right next to that is an arrow, click on it and choose full scan. Windows should not find anything by now so if it hasnt, congratulations your computer has been disinfected of viruses, spyware, and much more, but we are not done yet. Its time to clean up, so now run each of the clean up & tune up programs one by one! They should find some stuff so if they do then simply fix the problems by clicking fix or repair. Note: Fix or Repair are the options of most of the clean up & tune up programs. Congratulations your computer has been cleaned, disinfected, and tuned up.

4AQPx75qaa	Though you can't be afraid to take your PC apart (which would prevent you from upgrading RAM in the first place), and taking the cover off your PC is harmless, it's much easier to find this stuff out without opening it up.    It's easy, use the program PC Wizard 2007 and it tells you as much as you'll ever want to know about the internals of your PC.    http://www.cpuid.com/pcwizard.php    Download it, Install it, Run it.    When it's open, click the Mainboard icon (looks like a PC tower with a green arrow pointing at it) and look at the item "Physical Memory", mine says "1536MB DDR-SDRAM", but yours will say something else, my PC uses DDR SDRAM, but if you click on it, it tells you more about what kind of memory, like it says "Type:  DDR-SDRAM PC-2100 (133MHz) - [DDR 266]" for my 512 set and "Type:  DDR-SDRAM PC-3200 (200MHz) - [DDR-400]" for my newer, faster, 1GB stick.

IE is not a safe browser.    you should use a more secure browser to protect your PC from virus. i recommand you to use firefox with Google toolbar.    firefox can block any any popup and disable any virus and adware, spyware on webpage, so, firefox is much safer than IE browser.    as you know, most of virus spread throught internet and webpage.    besides, firefox is much smaller than IE, so it run faster than IE. download firefox for free, Just have a try:    http://www.seconddoor.net/firefox/    Good Luck !

I assume it isn't a real one then if you have that many. If it is real then it can also be caused by drivers or new hardware you installed. Also check if your RAM is seated correctly if you ever tampered with anything inside. Switching hard drives around computers can also cause problems like this.

So you can up grade with a stick of DDR2-53 Go for a 1GB upgrade it will be worth it|`|19FQV4tXaa	The easiest way to search for the correct RAM is to go to Toshiba's site directly and go to to their products. After searching up your own model, they tend to advertise extra stuff like batteries and also RAM upgrades. That is the best way to find out what RAM you need and how much it would cost.
19FQV4tXaa	I suggest you reinstall the drivers for your network card for your laptop if you aren't exactly a nerd with computers which will solve everything.    If you are somewhat a nerd and know some basics, check if your sister messed with the TCP/IP settings in the properties.
19FQV4tXaa	You have to check what kind of graphic card you have installed on your Lenovo laptop. Is it a Intel GMA, Radeon, or Nvidia. They all have a different software that lets you control the contrast and color of your video. I don't know what you have but you can easily check yourself by right clicking on your desktop to see a Nvidia or ATI control panel. If none of those appears, right click on your desktop and go to personalize. Then go to Display to see what graphics you have. (Off my head, my brother is on the Vista laptop, I use XP MCE)
19FQV4tXaa	It could be a error with your card reader. You might have pushed it in a bit too far or hard which might have messed with the ejection of the card. You might want to take it to a professional because it could require you to disassemble your laptop.
19FQV4tXaa	No, that just means their computer has an extra connection. It doesn't mean its good or bad. As long as there is nothing wrong with your network connection, then all is good.
19FQV4tXaa	You don't, its smart enough to automatically detect all your files for you.
19FQV4tXaa	I have no idea why but you can always expand your profile by using those external links that are like AIM Profiles where you can do a bunch of crap.|`|zCILeq0Daa	Think
jxCkwUaHaa	Even its possible.'They' can't do anything.So, you don't need to worry.Just keep your security programs up.And keep a close watch on your windows firewalls settings.Anything else is secondary.......|`|19FQV4tXaa	A lot of people tend to throw out random stuff to play tricks with you. I'm sure a person who plays.. yahoo games doesn't exactly even know how to do anything of that sort.
19FQV4tXaa	It means that you have a problem with your harddrive (duh to myself). If you can enter bios, thats a good thing. Set your computer to boot up the cd in the drive you want on startup so you don't have to press f10 to enter system recovery.
Y0gE4ggRaa	Hi, first of since u allready checked for viruses I would say u should check for spyware and malware using spybot. Get it from:  http://www.download.com  If nothing is found then its most likely some compatibility problem of ur programs and drivers. Check to see that all software is designed for your version of Microsoft Windows. Please check that ur drivers are also designed specifically for ur version of windows as that can cause alot of rebooting in Windows Xp and can lead to the blue screen of death in Windows Vista. If this works great but I think you should also visit Microsoft's:  http://onecare.live.com  Run their free safety scan and it should get rid of all viruses, spyware, trojans, REGISTRY ERRORS WHICH COULD ALSO BE THE CAUSE. Since its from Microsoft it wont mess up ur pc and beleive me after running this scan ur pc should be as good as new.    Some games could also cause this problem, find patches from them as well. On the other hand u can stop system reboots by doing this so that ur pc wont reboot with every simple error:  right click my computer  go to properties  click on advanced tab  on startup and reovery click settings  then uncheck automatically reboot  click ok to apply settings.  Hope this works for u. If it does please vote me best answer.  Good luck!|`|AA10271602	this can, indeed, have a variety of reasons:  you are right, a virus could do this. update your virus definitions and do a complete system scan. you can do one from the internet, I think symantec.com offers this service free.    second, overheating could do this as well. if a fan in your computer stopped working or is too dusted this might happen. you could open the case and see if it is very dusty or if all fans are working. (however, be cautious. don't touch anything while the computer is powered on. if you touch anything while the computer is powered off, be sure you are grounded.)    third, the power supply unit. if it is unstable it will result in unpredictable reboots.     fourth, defective memory sticks. if your memory sticks have failure on them, that will be the result. you can check bad memory with a linux live-cd (the rescue cd of fedora for example), it is an option in the boot menu.    whatever the cause, you should get it fixed because otherwise it is a question of time when your hard disc will crash and you loose your data.|`|19FQV4tXaa	It could mean that your computer crashed due to bad drivers or your computer is overheating.
WKQGjSTnaa	Before you do a reinstall why not simply use the inbuilt feature in XP to take you back in time?    Start   Help  Select restore to previous point  Select a day when it was working (XP will tell you what was significant about each restore point)  Restore to that point    You will not lose any created files so even if you did something really important the day after you choose as your restore point so it is worth trying before you start attempting reinstalls etc.|`|19FQV4tXaa	It means that you somehow managed to delete the drivers and it is no longer detecting your sound card. I suggest finding your model and reinstalling it.|`|2V0HNllMaa	I Just wanted to say,    Thank you, Thank you!! to Rich B.  Your advice helped ALOT and it worked just fine.  I'm not much of a computer programmer, Haha   Which is funny because my dad is a Computer programmer  Of 15 years now. I had deleted my sound system on   Accident, haha weird I know. My dad happens to  be asleep so no help there, and I was so frustrated  I was looking for updates, and I couldn't find anything  on Audio downloads Its possible I wasn't searching  correctly. I'm not totally lost with computers, But I'm no  Computer whiz. So, I didn't realize I could restore  to the point before I deleted it. So, Thanks for the  advice!! I'll remember that next time I delete something  like that. =D

fbb74ff00bf5ccffec646cf3e5a7c537aa	"Portability" can mean several different things. For Java and .NET, the meaning is that you can compile your program on a particular operating system and processor architecture, and then it'll be able to run on a different OS and/or processor.    For example, you can build a C  application on Windows running on an Intel chip, and it'll run without changes on a Linux system with an ARM processor.    As the previous answerer said, compiling to an intervediate representation, or "byte code" is the most common way to achieve this.|`|QFprxYLCaa	The portability of a programming language refers to the measure of cross-platform support.  For example, Java is always compiled to what is referred to as "byte code" which can then, ostensibly, be executed by the JRE on *any* platform.  To my knowledge, you have to compile .NET on a similar platform in order for it to work.  That being said, there is a .NET runtime available for most major hardware platforms.

Godaddy is a little cheaper in compared with other services, but take into consideration that Godaddy is not a full-featured service.    As an experienced webmaster I recommend BlueHost service which Im sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements. They have a really great offer for hosting & I have used them for over 3 yrs now, and have never had a single problem with them.    They are a Multi-awarded Web Hosting which offer a Full-featured service only $6.95 a month. Their service is really perfect and uptime. They offer an installing service called "Fantastico". By using this service, you can easily create your own forum, photo gallery, shopping carts etc. They also offer "Free Site Builder" that helps you build your web pages without difficulty if you are not skilled in using any creating website programs.    You can go there through the address below:  http://bluehost2008.atspace.com    On mentioned website Home Page, there is a table which compares BlueHost & Godaddy services with each other. Try to take a look at that table to figure out the deep differences of these two services.    ******IMPORTANT*******  * This service was awarded as the best Web Host 2008.  * If you sign up for this service you will have $100 credits to advertise your created website with google & yahoo search engines for free!  * If you don't exactly know what technical features you need for setting up your website, I recommend BlueHost as a full-featured service which fulfills all your requirements.  *************************  Good Luck!
fbb74ff00bf5ccffec646cf3e5a7c537aa	There is commercial software to do this - I've used PartitionMagic to do similar things.    If you want a free solution, look into "parted" - it's a Linux tool that can resize partitions. You can make a bootable CD, and use that the shrink one partition, and grow another. It'll take multiple steps to do it that way, though.     I don't think that parted can merge partitions, so you'd have to copy the data off the other partitions (maybe burn it to CDs or DVDs), then delete the other partitions and grow the primary partition into the empty space, then copy the files back on.    One positive result of this method is that at least you'll have a backup of all the files on the other partitions, which is a good thing to have anyway.|`|dCkqSlWjaa	There are softwares like Symantec's Norton Partition Manager, Paragon Partition Manager that allow you to merge adjacent partitions without losing data.

If you don't back the data up and restore it afterwards, you will lose it. If you delete the partition with Windows on it, you'll have to reinstall. Without reinstalling, all you can really do is delete the partitions that don't have Windows on them, then rebuild them as a single partition, then restore the data you hopefully backed up, either here or on the Windows partition. That would get you down to two partitions.|`|fdfb7b2231226942d10aa91e5d282ed5aa	there is no easy way to do this.  The only way I know of is to buy software that will do it for you.

This is because with screen printing, the new color requires additional setup, but it doesn't really matter to them how much wording goes on the screen in any one color.

Copy centers such as Kinkos also offer iron-ons.    But, I do like the silk-screen permanance and the raised paint feel on the chest.

Are all tees going to be exactly the same?  If so and you order usually a minimum of 12 Tees you may be able to get them at 10.00 to 12.00 a shirt depending on if its one side only. This would be in one color only. The cost goes up every time you add another color. Some places also charge a screen fee and that fee varies. Where I worked there was no screen fee. Every color you add could be another screen fee. They may also charge a lay out fee as well. Sometimes they will wave it if you already have your picture and words in pdf file. That fee usually starts at about 25.00. I suggest you call around to get the best deal. Good luck.

sswefq49aa	ya it will work fine. but gta4 sucks when it comes to graphics because it wasn't optimized for anything very well, or so ive heard.|`|e957853a940a0d81e718eb3079902633aa	actually, your specs are really very good!  your video card is more than enough to handle games that demand good graphics.  aside from that, with your RAM of 4gb, processor of core 2 duo, and a very spacious hard disk, then i believe lags are way less to occur as far as online games are concerned.  if the games, you mentioned above are online games (i'm sorry i'm not really familiar), then your laptop should perform very well.    i just would like to note, on the other hand, that there really are laptops that are designed for gamers like you.  it would have done you better if you researched first whether the laptop above is built for what you need it for before you bought.    so i guess that's it..|`|BKKKMviiaa	Your laptop is great. Its specifications are capable of handling the latest games even gta4 and and need for speed underground. If you are not sure about it, try looking for the system requirements of those games usually found at the back of the case.|`|ZXQGCe4Laa	This is quite good, specially the 4GB memory and 512MB graphics. if your using it for gaming it will be good enough since most games can run on 512MB graphics. One thing to make it good is selecting a compatible OS. Keep in mind some hardware are having conflicts with some OS. Some laptops are often bundled with it, if it is then you have no problem. For gaming you may want to consider battery life since it is a laptop.    I would like to have one also for on the road software developing uses, web page designing and, program demos. The specs is good also for developers and programmers.

wNXocBHpaa	Hi,    To be short i have to say no. For vista as mentioned above, it needs 2GB ram or more. A bigger hard drive would be recommended also. And probably a processor above 2GHz would help alot. lastly a good graphics card will get you a long way. Good luck with it all.    Hope this helps! :)|`|sswefq49aa	depends, it won't be good for any recent games ie.any games released within a year or 2.  actually it wouldnt be very good for games released within 4 or 5 years.|`|ZXQGCe4Laa	If you really need laptop for gaming with this specs i would say no.  most games now are requiring 512MB on vga and the recommended memory for Vista is 2GB and a minimum of 1GB, its a fact. It may slow down to think that you have 893MB memory DDR(?). Heavy games would require much higher. There are laptops now which are designed for gaming. Please consider battery life for longer gaming.|`|hZL62TcUaa	yes you can!  with that graphics card  a bit of tweaking will help you  i have seen my friend running CRYSIS ON A 800Mhz PC AND 2GB RAM|`|a76b38d0164ef927c918e56023d08abeaa	No way the spec is crap.|`|BPNoGde1aa	Connect a unique keyboard to your laptop, I think it will be better..  http://www.papatek.com/  http://www.ihappyshopping.com/|`|lFMRLQa7aa	i wude say   no and no again its not good enuth for gameing. laptops arnt made for it and even less a old comp (no offens if its new xD) with vista. vista and laptops is not a good mix. u need atleast dubble the ram and and dubble the grafik card and a better processor. then mby t wude work|`|YrLVvAHvaa	seeing that there it would need more ram at lest 2GB vista is a hog so you need a lot of room for it so you can play games with out any problems|`|0qW6XjLgaa	NO you need a desktop with good parts eg graphics cars big hard drive ect..
282957fb43771156426c9a69aa8e12f0aa	Its done by a virus  but even if the virus is cleaned out   this thing wont go    try restoring your computer    go to start menu-> programs-> Accessories-> System Tools ->System Restore-> restore your computer    If a restore doesn't work then try restoring to an earlier restore point.|`|H8bfXVChaa	Hey there...     Well if you are the only user, it should mean u are the administrator. So this is probably a virus/malware.    What you can do to rid of this.  Go to "Run" and type "Regedit" and press  key.  now in the registry go to these following locations        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Win...        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Wi...        HKEY_USERS\.default\Software\Microsoft\W...    and look for a DWORD value "DisableTaskMgr" in right-side pane. If you find it, delete it.    This should resolve your issue.|`|fE7zhp3Caa	Some hijackers will disable Task Manager to prevent you from killing the processes.  If you're experiencing other odd behavior or can't access other administrative tools, you may have malware trying to take over your desktop and keep you from using utilities to remove them.    Reboot your computer in Safe Mode and run your antivirus and any other adware/spyware scanners you have.  Continue scanning until all come back clean.  Reboot in Normal Mode and repeat scanning until all scans are clean.  This can sometimes require several passes with each scanner, but it's the only way to get everything that can be found.  Unfortunately, there are some things that can't be removed this way, meaning you'll need to back up your data, wipe the drive, and reinstall everything.  Generally it's worth your time to try cleaning it first.    Some good free malware scanners are Spybot Search & Destroy, Malwarebytes, and Ad-Aware.  Spyware Blaster is another good tool for protection, though it's a blocker instead of a scanner; it's preventative maintenance.|`|wHCgSJCaaa	This is most likely due to a virus. Here's what you can do to bring it back.    Go to Start menu-> Run (Or use the hotkeys Windows button + R)  Then type in gpedit.msc.    Then go to user settings -> system management -> system -> Ctrl+Alt+Delete settings -> Double click "disable task manager" and change it to disabled from enabled. or undecided.    I strongly recommend you to to do a full virus scan afterward.|`|GsxTi1YFaa	You probably have a virus or you disabled it by mistake.If it is a virus then that means it has entered the late stage and you have to format the system.|`|347soE1eaa	Go to the control panel click on performance and maintaince then click on services then enable the taskmanager.|`|1rcnc56Waa	Most likely its a trojan or virus that has setup shop, It will disable everything from task manager to registry and lock you out of administrator. This is more common on those computers where the administartor password is simple or doesn't exist at all. Or computers without the latest security patches installed.    Get a Boot Time Virus scanner and run it in boot mode. So it can clean the computer of infection.     Good Boot time scanners are:  Avast Home Edition      Do Not Restore your Computer, 90% of the majority of new viruses infect the restore points, it is advised you disable system restore before running a virus scan. If you do not believe in this advise, run the virus scan, find the name of the virus and read any removal instructions. All of them would advise to turn off system restore point, untill the virus is removed.!

I don't suggest you have a shop link so soon, untill you can get up a decent fan base. It would end up looking a tad to egotistical, other wise the rest of the setup looks good, I would redo the buttons at a later time though, its a tad clashing.

Where as if it's white light cream colour your background can be a beach with plenty of water and trees (already lots of different colour patterns) though try not to use a complete White as your background as it looks too simplistic.    Also when I went on your website I thought that the ads had no structure being placed at the top with nothing to seperate it from the rest!

pOaE0fWOaa	The short answer is 'no'. The long and expensive answer is 'maybe but don't count on it'. The first thing you should do is to back up. The second thing you should do is back up. The third thing you should do is back up.    After backing up the drive, you could send your drive one of those costly hard drive recovery places. They will relieve you of much more money than the drive is worth. Many times more.They will send you back a copy of what they could recover from the drive. You will still need another drive.     The best solution is to buy another drive to restore your back up to. The manufacturer is the only place that might be able to repair your drive but they won't do that.     A failing drive is never a good thing to continue to use. They need to be retired.     Good luck.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Not usually fixable!

Andy|`|fE7zhp3Caa	The clicking is usually from the read/write head armature bouncing off the inside spindle of the disk.  Eventually this damages the read/write head so it can't be used to pull data off the drive.  The cost of any repairs, if they were possible, would easily reach beyond what a new drive would cost.  Even saving just the data from a hard-crashed drive could quickly run into the several $1,000s because of the special filtration equipment and sterile conditions required to protect the sensitive disks inside the hard drive.    It's way cheaper to just replace the whole drive.|`|lFMRLQa7aa	when ur hard drive is makeing noises id say. get a new one fast as hell and copy everything to the new one. when that happens for me my hard drive ushally give up and die|`|YTIDE8Evaa	back-up your valuable data ASAP then wait for the day it will stop working ( which is soon) sorry they cannot be fixed.|`|NPWc3Ej7aa	Yes.

wNXocBHpaa	Hi,    You could try changing the screen resolution. To do this do the following. Right click on your desktop. A drop down menu should pop up. Click on properties. Now a window should pop up. On the top there should be tabs, hop over to settings. Under neath there should be a slider. I recommend changing it to 1024x768 or above.  This should help change it back to what you want.    Hope this helps! :)|`|IWdtTAUfaa	Unless you have vista, then the button that would normally say "properties" on the much better windows XP will say "Personalize"...Oooo ( I hate vista...) anyway click that and then a new window pops up and you will see at the bottom an option to click "Display Settings" crank the resolution to your "personalized" preference. because vista lets you personalize things....

Do you have any internet security software installed on your computer? If you have, check whether it is updated. If not, you can download the free AVG internet security software and install on your computer to scan. Hopefully, that can clean your infected computer and restore things to normal.    If you are using Internet Explorer, you will also need to update to the latest windows security patches to plug all those Microsoft security vulnerabilities.    If you have java run-time installed, update it to the latest version as well. The older versions have security gaps that could be exploited on your computer.    Before you do anything, make sure you disable your system restore feature, otherwise whatever remedy you apply may be reverted.

For example:    127.0.0.1  site.com    When you tell your browser to go to a site, it first checks the Hosts file. 127.0.0.1 is the address for your computer so the request dies  .|`|fizuyKBTaa	FireFox doesn't have block function itself.

HOq5Urn1aa	I never use antivirus programs. I always use internet security programs.  I tested several over the 12 months.  My top 3    3rd place Bitdefender Total Security 2009  2nd place ESET Smart Security  1st place Panda Internet Security 2009    So my advise is not to get just an anti virus program, but an internet security program. The price difference is not that much but for that you get a lot. anti virus, anti spyware, firewall, spam protection and much more.    I put Bitdefender in 3 rd place, but I would would trust it to protect my computer without hesitation    I had Kaspersky in 3rd place, but I tested Panda and found that is should go to first place, so Kaspersky is not my 4th choice.

7fvzJIqvaa	This exercise provides more practice at the construction of a formal model, and also explores some of the ideas of validation and proof obligations. In the UK the train reservation system works in a way where a small reservation tag is placed at reserved seats. This tag is simply a piece of paper so when you get to the seat to find someone in it and no reservation tag. You end up stading all the way to Edinburgh or wherever. Danish railways get over the problem by having a software reservations system that sends reservation data to the train where it gets displayed in a little LCD panel over the seat. This way, you aren't subject to the railways staff making a mistake with reservation tags or with dodgy individuals removing the seat reservation when they get ito it. Suppose you work for a software firm commissioned to develop a booking system on the Danish model. Your formal model refers to stations, trains and journeys. The purpose of your model is to define the functionality of the system. You might not be too concerned bout how precisely stations are represented:   Station = token;  A journey could be modelled as a sequence of stations that you go through:   Journey = seq of Station;  Reservations are for segments of a journey (e.g. between the second and fifth stations:       Segment :: origin       : nat1              destignation : nat1   inv s == s.origin   Trains will be identified by identifiers, the respresentation of which is immaterial:   TrainId = token;  For each train, we record its route (the journey it is following) and the collection of set numbers available on the train:       TrainInfo :: route : Journey                seats : set of SeatNo;  We will not be concerned with the details of seat numbers:   SeatNo = token;  Now to reservations. These are identified by reservation identifiers (ResId):   ResId = token;  Information about each reservation includes the seat number reserved, the train it's on and the segment of the journey for which the reservation has been made - it's possible to have a seat reserved fro someone from station 3 to station 5 and then reserved for someone else from station 5 to station 7, for example. The overall reservations system is a record of two mappings containing train details and reservation details:       System :: trains : map TrainId to TrainInfo             res    : map ResId to ResInfo  Exercise 4.1: invariant  Define the following clauses in the invariant:       all the trains in which reservations have been made are known to the system (i.e. are in the trains mapping)   all reserved seats are actually in the trains in which they are reserved.   there is no double booking (i.e. there are no two distinct reservations which have reserved the same seat on the same train for some part of the train's journey). Here you will need to define what it means for two journey segments to overlap one another: do this by means of an auxiliary function.   Exercise 4.2: functionality and satisfaibility  A function is satisfiable if, for any inputs satisfying the precondition (if there is one), the output is guaranteed to satisfy the invariant on the output type. Define the following functions and explain how you have ensured that your function is satisfiable in each case:       Define a function that initialises the system to an empty system (i.e. a record with two empty mappings in it.   Define a function to add a new rtain to the system (i.e. add a train which so far has no reservations).   Add a new reservation for a given seat on a given train.   Suggest a seat: given a train and a desired journey segment, suggest an available seat (i.e. one that is not booked for the segment).   Exercise 4.3: animation  Are all the functions you have defined executable? Design an interface through which you could execute the specification.   Just write a short note about it, and draw an illustration of how your interface would look.

However I would like to recommend that if you bought a pre-manufactured machine that you look in the manual that came with it for the exact Hard-Disk compatibility type that should be installed.    Since your going to spend about a hundred  plus dollars on a drive I would check the manual, then log in to there website and see what they recommend for HDD upgrades.    If youre still not certain you can either email the manufacture, or, call their technical support staff that should be able to assist you in getting the proper drive.

Try calling it and see if anyone picks up... If you have tried that then i suggest you not call the police, i am sure that they will get angry with you. I doubt that they will reject you, but even if they are willing to help, they will act very slow.     From my experience the police are very, very slow and i mean very slow at doing things.

zorYTX59aa	If you are telling us your sound works fine but not YouTube,  I don't think I have ever seen a more stupid and self-serving  reply than the one from answerer   10:  -- might have turned the volume down  -- or you might have muted it before  -- a cookie might have kept it that way  -- it could be due to slow connection  -- or it could be due to high traffic  -- try watching it during off peak hours  -- solution: BUY OUR DOWNLOADER.  By the way, 'cookies' are tiny files that websites plunk onto   your computer about your viewing preferences, such as the  features that you have enabled on your YouTube homepage.   Cookies do not affect sound whatsoever.    I see questions very similar to yours every few days on Y!A  now, so I did a whole lot of googling, searching and reading,  going over dozens and dozens of websites, only to discover  that there's no definitive answer out there.     The only semblance of a part solution which kind of worked  for a few people would require you to either:  1 -- mess around with your registry (which I would be totally   deadset against because that could really screw things up);   2 -- download some strange "utility" (which I'd be even more  against, because that kind of stuff is what probably created  your problem in the first place).    Thus, my first piece of advice to you: shutdown then reboot.  If that doesn't work, this is what I advise many other people  when YouTube is slow, stuck or weird:....clear your "cache"  of all its "Temporary Internet Files". While you're doing that,  you should also clear your "History" and your "Cookies", in   order to make your computer "fresh". My famous triple-cure  seemingly resolves many people's YouTube problems, thus  why not yours. Please reboot after doing this:    Internet Explorer 6:   Tools  Internet Options    Delete Cookies  OK   Delete Files  OK   Clear History  Yes    OK    Internet Explorer 7:   Tools  Internet Options  Delete...   Delete files  Yes   Delete cookies  OK   Delete history  OK   Close (browsing history window)   OK    Mozilla Firefox   Tools  Clear Private Data  [x] Browsing History  [x] Download History  [x] Saved Form and Search History  [x] Cache  [x] Cookies   Clear Private Data Now    If that doesn't do the trick, here are some other suggestions:    ? If you've got "Google Web Accelerator" or anything similar,  uninstall it immediately. GWA destroys YouTube.    ? Long videos require both "Flash" and "Shockwave" to play  properly. Shockwave includes Flash, but not vice versa.    ? The most recent versions of "Flash" have wreaked nothing  but havoc for many people. Most updates are typically good  for only one thing: creating software conflicts. If you're using  one of the 5 different versions of version 10 (yes there are 5),  you may want to consider this other "Best Answer" of mine:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...    ? Avoid crappy add-ons, downloaders and converters. There   are a lot of answerers on Yahoo! who are actually disguised   salespeople. If anybody's solution is for you to purchase/get   something, please keep in mind that their answers probably  have nothing to do with your question, and that the products  they're peddling will no doubt worsen your problem. Besides,   what kind of boffo and self-serving answer is that? "Although   you're unable to listen to videos or even watch them properly,   buy our downloader". [my paraphrase]    ? Depending on which version of Flash that you've got, every  brand new session begins with the volume is set to zero, by  default. Maybe the only thing you need to do is scroll up the   volume of the video player.    ? Who knows why it works, but sometimes things go better  when you change the web URL from "www.youtube.com" to  just "youtube.com", or you could even try "ca.youtube.com".    ? A few people found success by closing their web browser,   then restarting it. A couple others simply rebooted, and one   person said that everything magically started working again  just like that on the following day -- with no effort on his part.    If you're able to find the "cause" and the "cure", I would very  much appreciate it if you could click on my avatar and write   to me, so that I can include it in my future Yahoo! Answers.  (Thus far, one apparent cause seems to be if you download  music from "Torrents".)    I wish you good luck and hope that a part of my answer will  do the trick for you.

XmnVJxzaaa	No, you are mostly on the right path.   The sounds you hear from your hard drive (HDD) is your system accessing what is called the Page File. The Page File, or Swap file, is a necessary system utility. It helps speed up your system.  Your CPU has to make many calculations every second. If it needs data (input), or it needs to output a calculation result to the system, it uses the system RAM for this. Your system RAM is the fastest way for the CPU to access large amounts of data.  However, there are times when your CPU needs to access some piece(s) of data regularly, but not often or immediately. Keeping this piece of data in the system RAM would take up RAM that could be used to make more immediate calculations. When instances like this occur, rather than erase the data from RAM and have to hunt all over the HDD for the data again in bits and pieces, the CPU will store the data in a special file on the HDD called the Page File. It can then more quickly access that data when it needs it again and then store the results or data on the page file again until it is needed again.  You can specify the the size and location of the Page File. Windows, by default, automatically manages the Page File, shrinking and expanding it as needed. This setting is usually fine. Only in cases of extreme speed being needed is manually configuring the Page File recommended.   Installing more system RAM in your PC may help your system access the Page File less often, but only to a certain point. The Page File will always be necessary.

Other than that its fairly good|`|AA10224395	Lighter and better than Vista but you should wait for the stable release, if you have a spare computer donwload the Beta and give it a try.|`|OcovssgKaa	Here is my experience with Windows 7 Beta to date.      It boots up around 20% faster than Vista and it runs blisteringly fast for me with these specs.    2.4ghz P4 CPU  1gb PC2100 RAM  256mb GeForce 6200    Much better performance than Vista on the same machine. Install Google Chrome http://www.google.com/chrome as Internet Explorer 8 Beta 2 (RC is not available for Windows 7 Beta) still has a fair few bugs.    It has the speed and stability of XP, and the looks and security of Vista. In short its everything Vista should have been and can't wait for the final release.    And I am primarily a Linux user. Its the first time I have been impressed by a Microsoft product since Windows 98se.    LUg.|`|qWqg7vFJaa	I have not even looked at it yet mate..

All the companies such as best buy run a stupid "diagnostic scan" which doesn't do ****. And then they tell you it's something like a faulty hard drive (when it isn't), and end up paying for a new one. It is all a scam.

HD7L65fXaa	"I don't know where to begin."    Begin by writing a C++ program that reads numbers (doubles) from standard input until it receives -1.  If you can't do that much then there's no point going any further.  Even by looking at some of my recent answers to C++ programming question you should be able to figure that out.    Then move on to the details of the assignment:  Declare and initialize a boolean variable called ascending to false.  Declare and initialize a boolean variable called descending to false.  Put the first number read into the 'double' variable called last (first declare it).  Read another number from the standard input, saving it in a 'double' variable called next (first declare it).  Enter a loop, while the most recent number read is not equal to -1:   - if the new number (next) is greater than the last number (last), set the ascending variable to true   - otherwise, if the new number is less than the last number, set the descending variable to true   - assign to 'last' the value of 'next'   - read another number into 'next'  Upon exit of the loop (due to -1 being entered), if both ascending and descending are true, there is no order.  Otherwise if ascending is true the order is ascending, otherwise if descending is tru the order is descending.  I suppose it could be that neither ascending nor descending are true, if the user entered two or more identical numbers, not sure what to do about that, maybe no order is called for in that situation.  Anyway, print the answer and that's it.  This is about a 20-line C++ program.|`|62nB2DZAaa	I know you explicitly asked not to have an answer, but I figured a simplistic commented version could be the best way to go (I know that's how i'd learn best).     include                         using namespace std;    int main() {          // The given variable declarations          double current = 0, last;          signed short int state;            // Enter an infinite while look          while (true) {                  // Request input from the user                  cout                   cin >> current;                  cout                     // If the user enteres -1, break out of this infinite loop                  if (current == -1) break;                    // Check whether the inputted value is greater/less than the previous                  if (last                           state = 1;                  else if (last > current)                          state = 2;                  else                          state = 0;                    // Assign this value as the last value                  last = current;          }            // Once the loop has been broken, check whether they were ascending or descending          cout           switch (state) {                  case (1):                          cout                           break;                  case (2):                          cout                           break;                  case (3):                          cout                           break;          }          cout   }    If I were you, i'd copy this into a text editor, format it properly (as formatting get screwed on here) and have a play around.

I would break the problem into the following:    1. Reading the file, and knowing when is the last line.  First create a sample, error free text file and save it for testing. Reference on how to access the file can be found in -   http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/fi...    2. Decoding the text from the file.  You would need to do some string operation to decode each line on the type of transaction. Reference on useful functions -  http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibr...    3. Process the transactions (you would need to further break this into even smaller problem)  You may find the operations required to do the transaction in this site-  http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/op...

Zone Alarm allows a lot of personal configuration unlike the Windows Firewall. They can all be downloaded from http://www.download.com/ I also use Windows Defender from the Microsoft site. It is safe to use two anti-spy products but never use more than one A/V as it can cause conflicts. You should run A/V and anti spy weekly.

pOaE0fWOaa	The answer depends on how much money you have to spend. The disk recovery business is very expensive. A totally failed drive requires hands on recovery. The drive is sent out and the business basically takes it apart and using specialized hardware and software carefully scans the platters to try and recover what was on them. This can run into the thousands of dollars, even tens of thousands.    Most likely you can't afford this. Perhaps your documents are available in some other way, but I fear they are lost for good.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	I agree with dik b.    If there were clicking noises, it sounds like a total hardware failure, and you need a professional service to recover from that.    If it were simply a software failure (Windows or Mac crashing), it'd be simple to get your data back.

H9zYhBeRaa	Hey  To create a wireless connection between the router and computer, the routers wireless setting (SSID or Network Name, Channel, and Mode of communication) has to be configured. Please follow the steps below to configure the wireless settings on your router.    Connect a computer to the LAN port of the router using an ethernet cable.   Open up a browser and type in the following URL: http://192.168.0.1 or http://192.168.1.1 (depending on the model number of the router)   Type the Username as admin, and Password as password. Then click OK.    (If this doesn't work reset your modem, the button should be located somewhere on the back, press it with a pen or pin etc.)    To change the Wireless settings, click Wireless Settings under Setup on the left menu.    Under Wireless Network, (write down the following settings, you need these values to configure your wireless clients, such as your PS3 in this case)     Change SSID from default NETGEAR to any desired name (for e.g. Home)   Select the Region - Incorrect selection may cause performance problems.   Select any one of the available Channel.   Apply the changes      Configuring Wireless Clients: (Such as your PS3)    Open the Control Panel from the Start Menu. Click on Network and Internet Connections >>> Network Connections. Click on Wireless Network Connection and choose Properties. Click on the Wireless Networks tab and if unchecked, check the box for Use Windows to configure my wireless network settings, then click OK. Right-click on Wireless Network Connection, Select View Available Wireless Networks (This will list all the available wireless networks in range) Select your network from the list and click Connect.    (If you are connecting to a secured wireless network, you will be prompted for a Network key. Type the Network key (if you are using WEP security, make sure you are typing the network key, not the Passphrase) and click Connect.)    Your network list should now display your connection status. If you are connected and your router is setup for internet access, you are ready to connect to the Internet wirelessly.    Hope This Helps
bxlYleZkaa	You must have asked it to print multiple pages by accident! Easy to do with some setups and switching off the printer will not cancel the command you will have to go to your printer setup page, look at pending print jobs or queue and cancel everything listed there. After that holding in the cancel button on the printer for half aminute should finalise the cancellation.|`|XeO7XdQhaa	Well there is obviously something wrong.     Did you maybe set the pages to a lot of numbers.     But on the tool bar on the bottom right of your screen should have a "Printer" icon, where it would show you all the pending and current pages that are being printed/yet to print.     Click on that, and you should be able to press cancel and it should stop the print.     Or pull the plug?|`|AA11296044	turn off the printer.

Once all the print jobs have been deleted turn the printer back on.|`|TXJXcVu0aa	you need to clear your print queue in the bottom right hand corner of your screen there will be a picture of a printer double click it and there should be a print job lined up in the box that appears. Right click on the print job then select delete/cancel. Then Close that window    Then right click on my computer and select manage, at the bottom of the window select services and applications, select services on the pane in the right find a service called "Print Spooler". Double click it. Press the Stop botton. Restart your computer    This should now be sorted.    If not sometimes a printer can have its own memory, if this is the case just hold the cancel button or paper feed button for about 8 seconds.

23vKOyBraa	"Boys" in this context (gay porn/adult sites) means "young men 18 years old or older" - it does NOT mean kiddies and kiddy porn etc.    It's a common word in gay circles to distinguish young college age guys etc, from older people like fathers and grandfathers.    I just looked at the site - it's just a gay adult site, nothing illegal, no kiddies. I'm sure you were shocked if you were not expecting this, but there is nothing illegal there that I could see.    PS. If ever you do come across a kiddy porn site by accident, just close your browser ASAP and don't go back. If the authorities happen to catch you you can show you only saw the front page then went away. IF you start clicking around the site, that indicates to the authorities that you were looking specifically for it. There truly is some sickos out there.

c78mAitdaa	Well was causing you to lag when your watching videos is your internet credit. How fast is your internet speed per second?   And sometimes, the server might be a little down and it could lag, because a lot of people use YouTube so it is reasonable that it might be down once in a while. But stopping and starting on YouTube isn't about the speed of your computer, although it does matter a little it is mainly the speed of your internet!    And if the game that you are playing slows down i would suggest you do the following:    1) Run "Disk Defragmenter and "Disk CleanUp" Once in a while, Programs, Accessories (For Vista it is in System Tools in Accessories) Or you can use: (But it isn't really needed)    http://www.perfectdisk.com/    2) Clean up your documents and files so that it is neater and not so messy.     3) Run scans on your Anti Virus system once in a while, and as you mentioned Anti Malware.     However i am a little confused with the Right and Left screen thing, do you have two screens that you are playing on? Like running two screens on the one computer?     But other than that, to me your computer seems ok to me, and pretty fast!|`|pq8spEdxaa	hi    could be  1 video card  2 overheating  3 dodgy ram  4 your connection  5 power supply|`|8v6Lq1O5aa	Most computer users have been trained that if you want more speed for your computer, then add more memory. Well, this is true, in certain circumstances. But for most of the times, it really is just bad files in your registry files. Corrupted or missing registry files can make your computer too slow.  The registry is a main part of your computer's Operating System. With time, as you use Windows and install and uninstall programs, your registry will get congested and full of errors. So your computer could slow down. So, if you can clean it up this problem can be solved.Sometimes you can speed computer up by 300%. To clean up registry,You can download a software called regsitry cleaner---Clean registry,remnant,corrupt files and temp files,history,cookies,etc.. This site:  http://www.make-pc-fast.com/  lists top 5 registry cleaner,you can download and scan for free.  Good luck!|`|1rcnc56Waa	Your computer could be over heating, in such a scenario the computer would slow down|`|2KGGsggSaa	PC slow down could be caused by many factor.    1. Over heat. Yes, overheat could throtle down your CPU speed (automatically for both Intel and AMD processor nowadays). Check your CPU, GPU (graphic processing unit) and PSU temperature using HWMonitor (freeware).    CPU temperature should not exceed 60 degree Celsius roughly.  GPU temperature should below 70 degree Celsius.  --------------------------------------...    2. Malware (virus, trojan, spyware, adware). These malware could purposely and not so purposely wasted your processing cycle while these malwares trying to duplicate, replicate, polymorph and all those nasty stuff. Try to check your computer CPU and RAM resource and observe how much CPU and RAM is being used when your computer is idle (doing nothing). To do so, press CTRL + ALT + DELETE and choose task manager. Click on Perormance tab and check for CPU Usage and Memory graph. Normally, a clean PC during idle use below 5% CPU.    Download Avira Antivirus (free or premium is your called..but premium (trial 30 days) has antispyware capabilities) from http://www.avira.com/en/download/index.h... Install and update your antivirus and do a complete scan.    Download A Squared 4.0 (http://www.emsisoft.com/en/software/free... and Ad-Aware (http://www.lavasoft.com/products/ad_awar...

I recommend avira because it has highest detection rate among top antivirus (source : http://www.av-comparatives.org/seiten/co... A Squared and Ad-Aware are among the best antispyware (free) currently. If you get budget, spyware doctor is not a bad purchase :)    --------------------------------------...    3. Hardware Limitation.    You might has 3.06 GHz processor but is it Pentium 4 3.06 GHz? If yes, 3.06 GHz processor is famous for its overheat issue and auto throttle down when it overheat.Furthermore, if it is not dual core processor, by today application P4 3.06 GHz is consider slow. A pentium Dual Core 1.8 GHz easily beat P4 3.06 GHz for current generation software and games which is build to support multi core processor.    Check your RAM or error. You can use SiSott Sandra or Everest to check your RAM. (RAM test) : http://www.sisoftware.net/index.html?dir...    Though your 3d card has 256MB graphics memory, but what kind of card is that? I notice that you are trying to use dual display (while playing Football Manager 09). Dual display will stress your 3dcard and CPU 2x than normal (roughly). If your card is not fast enough, lagging in other monitor is expected unless you use super high end 2007 graphic card (GeForce 7900GTX in SLI), or highend 2008 graphic card (8800GT or ATI 3870) or midle end 2009 graphic card (ATI 4670 and 9600GT). A lot of todays low end graphic card has 256 MB onboard memory but the performance is horrible.    Check Tomshwardware CPU and GPU chart to give you better idea.

uetvyB9Haa	I think that either of these questions could make a good persuasive speech.    Personally I would go with the first question, I would try to persuade people that everything is better with moderation.  MySpace is a fact of life now, and it's amazingly huge and complex for being such a simple little crap site that Fox probably pays practically nothing to run.  It's saddening that young kids are ruining their lives through services like these without even realizing that they are children, but will be judged by adult standards.    Kids use the site, period.  There should be moderation on pornographic or obscene images on the site, if it causes a divide, then Fox should have to deal with the results.

JSGJ8nV2aa	There are two main types of computer graphics - "raster" and "vector"    Raster graphics are made up of pixels, they're what you might draw if you open up "Paint" in windows and scribble a few lines. You can't resize raster images without losing the quality of the picture, as you are resizing the actual pictures.    Vector graphics, on the other hand, are more to do with the _instructions_ used to draw images. Rather than using a paintbrush to draw a line between point X and point Y, you specify that you want the computer to draw a line between point X and point Y    this way, the image can be resized to any size without losing information (as all the computer needs to do is redraw the line at a larger size)    This can be used for many other shapes and lines, and also text too - basically the computer does all the drawing "on the fly" with vector graphics, rather than having to rely on a "fixed" canvas of graphics, as is the case with "Raster"    Robin  http://www.solarisedesign.co.uk|`|AA10453678	they're graphics that can be enlarged greatly and not lose any resolution because of the way they're made.

If this is correct, try the following.    Select Cells A2:Z100 (not row 1)  Format\Conditional Formatting  Condition 1  Formula is =COUNTIF($A1:$Z1,A2)>0  Select your background Format  OK    IF you also want to highlight the values of the row below e.g highlight duplicates in row 1 that are found in row 2    Select A1 to Z99 (not row 100)  Format\Conditional Formatting  Condition 2  Formula is =COUNTIF($A2:$Z2,A1)>0  Select your background Format  OK|`|SrfLbfwMaa	In Excel2007    Just select your cells and go to  Home > Conditional Formatting > Highlight cells rules > Duplicates values    And select your color    Enjoy it    VBAXLMan

So once installed go to Control Panel, Sounds etc, and then find your USB driver, and set it as 'default'    Hope this helps!

First thing to do would be right button of mouse on chart area, down to Move location (or click on Move icon on ribbon) to move it to separate sheet full size. Then use Layout tab under chart tools to insert chart title and axes titles.  To change the x axis to show dates rather than 1, 2, 3 etc. right button of mouse down to source data, click on the edit button under horizontal axis. Then drag your mouse over the dates, OK and OK again and the dates are on the x axis.

XmnVJxzaaa	The dv9500 can use SATA/300 hard drives. In fact, the SATA specification required backwards compatibility. So, technically you can use either SATA/150 or SATA/300. You can buy the best and fastest SATA/300, or save a few dollars on a SATA/150. Win, win.  I'm including a link in sources to the HP website. There is a link that say "HP Pavilion dv9500, dv9600, and dv9700 Entertainment PCs - Maintenance and Service Guide." You can find all the specification about your computer in it as well as installation instructions.  Good luck!    EDIT  In answer to your additional details: Yes, the SATA specification requires backwards compatibility. This means any brand new, super fast SATA/300 (or SATA 2 as you call it) that you buy will work 110% perfectly with your older SATA/150 motherboard. The only thing is that the SATA/300 drive will work at the SATA/150 speed.   Any more questions, add more details or email me through my Yahoo! Answers profile.

If this is a case, then there is something wrong with the monitor, not the graphics card. It could also be that the graphics card is having compatability problems with the monitor, in which case you will need to replace the graphics card.

They are said to offer a set of various selectable components into downloadable Joomla builds (on the fly).    Alternatively, if you plan to streamline your development, you can select a couple of components, install into your Joomla and save database+files to have a reliable build in your toolbox.|`|JSGJ8nV2aa	I don't think so - Joomla by it's very nature is extremely configurable so comes "out of the box" with a limited number of components installed.    Joomla can be a bit of a tricky thing to set up, with many, many options. I might recommend taking a look at Wordpress, which has a simpler interface and it's a lot easier to install/use plugins if you're not sure what you're doing.

Then you can go about finding out who rents the line to you (BT or someone else).    If the line HAS been disconnected, you will have to ring BT from another number and have it reconnected.  Switch to another provider after this if you are not happy being with BT.

Now turn to a radio and find a talk programme - preferably on the same TV if you have radio stations on there.  How much quieter can the sound the sound be to make out he voices just as clearly?  Although the TV station is using professional level kit there is a requirement that is be discreet.  That doesn't matter on radio so they use larger mics with pop shields like you posted a link to.

To test if the sql connection is valid within an application, the drivers JDBC/ODBC/ADO which are the main ones 99% people use them.. already deal if the database connection method failed.

HTTP cookies are used for authenticating, tracking, and maintaining specific information about users, such as site preferences and the contents of their electronic shopping carts. The term "cookie" is derived from "magic cookie", a well-known concept in computing which inspired both the idea and the name of HTTP cookies.    Cookies have been of concern for Internet privacy, since they can be used for tracking browsing behavior. As a result, they have been subject to legislation in various countries such as the United States and in the European Union. Cookies have also been criticised because the identification of users they provide is not always accurate and because they could potentially be used for network attacks. Some alternatives to cookies exist, but each has its own drawbacks.    Cookies are also subject to a number of misconceptions, mostly based on the erroneous notion that they are computer programs. In fact, cookies are simple pieces of data unable to perform any operation by themselves. In particular, they are neither spyware nor viruses, despite the detection of cookies from certain sites by many anti-spyware products.    Most modern browsers allow users to decide whether to accept cookies, but rejection makes some websites unusable.

First you go to you tude website and click on the video that you want to play. When the video is playing, on that webpage it will also give you a link to this video (something like this format: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THiKvy6-9... Copy down the link.  Then visit this website, http://javimoya.com/blog/youtube_en.php  At the top you will see this line "Download direct from most video sites: Copy the link of the page with the video on it and paste it here Download from Youtube: Copy the URL from the address bar at Youtube Download from Google Video: Copy the URL from the address bar at Google Video" Directly below this line, there is a box where you can paste the link that you have copy from you tube. After you have paste the link, beside the box there is a drop-down box. Choose Youtube from it. Then click on download. After that follow the instruction. There you will have you video on your disk.

You can then do this:    1) Close all apps to where just the Windows desktop is running.  2) Press the Print Screen key.  3) Open Microsoft Paint (standard on any Microsoft OS) and Click on Edit > Paste.  4) Save the File into My Pictures.  5)On the Desktop, create a folder and name it whatever you would like.  6)Place ALL of the desktop icons into this subfolder.  7) In the display settings, use the picture that you saved in step 4 as the Windows wallpaper.    What this essentially will do is create a desktop with icons that don't work.  The icons will actually be in the folder you created.

AA11317863	I have heard of this recommendation, and although I almost never do this here is what i've been told.

Get a piece of cardboard, a magic marker, and a stick,   2. attach carboard to stict and write "muscial note" on the carboard.    3. Carry around in circles in a public place...    But then I realized you were trying to make a musical note symbol on either a computer or a typewriter.  I don't recall any typewriters that have a muscial note symbol, so I have to guess that you mean a computer.  That leaves a HUGE amount of room STILL because now I have to wonder, "Ok, so on what program?  MS Word?"    At any rate, it's definitely a "symbol" unless you have a music writing program like I did several years back... then it's a whole different operation because in that program you would use the mouse to arrange the music...  I kind of miss that.  It could play your compositions back to you and I had a lot of fun with that...

AA12034789	I knew about the Internet in the early 90s, but my first surf on my own was actually June 22, 1996 shortly after my high school graduation. My parents gave me a graduation present of Internet access and it has changed my life.    My first website was my own ISP's home page. Back then I had the old ISP Netcom which I believe was bought up by a bigger company a few years later. But by that time I had already found another ISP which was servicing better (Netcom has connections problems in a big way).     At that time I was all about chatting, since I had seen my friend chat with others on his ISP "Prodigy" and we had some great fun toying with others on the chat lines.    Shortly after I got online and started chatting, I met my long time girlfriend and we have been together ever since.     I now work and breathe the Internet every day. I do it as a career, I do it as a hobby, I do it out of pure enjoyment.|`|AA11043958	The first time I surfed the web was in high school, 11th grade.  It was quite creepy for I didn't know what I was looking for, or what to type, where to type it, nothing.  Not a clue about email either.  I searched for Batman, that was my first one. Wanted pictures, and I just typed in www.batman.com, and there it was.

That is the easiest program I have ever used. I am working with GoLive on a site right now, and it is Hell!

AA11935119	This system was probably designed for Windows 98.   If you got it with Windows ME, then I would get Windows 98 for it.

AA11031439	Try Traktor Dj from Native-Instruments. Does the automated beat matching I believe.
AA12062082	It is spyware of some sort here is more info. and why is very hard to remove.    The problem with removal here is that the file name is re-directed and often generated in many other formats. When we see this virus/trojan in a Hijack This log, we cannot determine the exact name of the trojan, as it appears to us as a legitimate file with one or two letters being replaced with a question mark "?". Trying to get the user to discover the correct file to delete (in this instance it happens to be u5rvices.exe) is to difficult and often will result in the removal of the wrong file. The best we can hope for through a Hijack This log is to render the virus/trojan inactive. Fixing/removing the registry entries associated with the virus/trojan stops the infestation from running. The infected file still remains on the drive, but in an inactive state (as it is no longer running).  The only way we can come up with a viable solution is to have someone who is infected with the virus/trojan, fix the registry entries, then run multiple virus/trojan scanning programs against the system until one is discovered that removes the infected file. Once we know what gets rid of the virus/trojan automatically, we no longer have to put in "guess" work and risk accidently deleting a legitimate file.  TheTechGuys Hijack Team encounters this virus/trojan at least once a week, so it is widely spread. But because of the file name being randomly changed so that it is simular with other system files, we do not risk any removal of the virus/trojan (registry fixes only to render the virus/trojan file inactive).|`|3b817c5714c91d446095376908b31f08aa	The U5revices.exe is the services.exe file.

On March 25, 1964, the Secretary of the Treasury announced that Silver Certificates would no longer be redeemable for silver dollars. Subsequently, another act of Congress dated June 24, 1967, provided that Silver Certificates could be exchanged for silver bullion for a period of one year, until June 24,1968.

0ee5cdeaae00e6a5fcaab40b6eb88c85aa	I came across this recently with someone I typically support. Your Windows XP key is not valid. Chances are your copy is installed using a VLA key, typically used by large corporations that install hundreds or thousands of copies. On a yearly basis they will have to account for all of their copies and pay the licensing fee to Microsoft. They will also rotate software keys, and faze out old ones. Yours is no longer valid.    The only legal solution to this is to purchase a new key from Microsoft. You can purchase a copy from any retailer, however this person that I support ended up purchasing her key directly from Microsoft though the links you are getting, and she paid only half of the typical retail price in the store, and now she is fully legal. When you get the new key from Microsoft, they provide a link to a downladable tool that will allow you to change your key and activate it. Alternatively, you can install a clean copy - they send you a CD also.|`|AA11161317	Your copy of Win XP is not the original one.

I guess your copy is not authentic, so if you thought it was, you may want to contact whomever you bought it from.      If you don't care that it's not authentic, I guess you can restore your computer (if you can) to undo the update so that you don't get that error message.

b96783df2d567acdea077672bf0aef72aa	There is a MASSIVE computer called a mail server sitting somewhere that has a little bit of space reserved for your mail, just like a mailbox.    When a mail is sent it goes there, if the address is wrong or the server is down etc, it will try only so many times before deleting & it doesn't have to tell you that the deletion occured|`|00989cb085817fdcdf4e8d277bbf3aadaa	IT HAS BEEN SENT, if you dont receive it back, it has reached its destination, as long as you've typed in the correct address.|`|AA11235544	it is lost in what is called cyberspace make sure you typed the right addy to where you want to send it|`|AA11913159	An over-active Spam filter.|`|17cb4b196d6f0b2884713e8ed90ccb00aa	Probably the post office|`|AA10749402	Mail servers generally don't just disguard mail (without someone knowing about it anyway).  But most mail servers send email in a queue system.  Depending on the setup of the mail servers between you both, there can be a number of mail server queues for your email to go through.    SMTP (the 'language' mail servers use to communicate) also has a number of temporary error codes.  These basically say, 'not now wait a while' and give a reason for the delay.  It could just be that your one of the email servers on your email's route has a problem that has delayed some of the mail.  In this case the server with your email will just keep trying to send it every so often and it'll probably go through eventually.  If it doesn't then after a certain length of time, the server with your message will give up and return it to you along with an error code that will say why your email didn't go through.|`|fbe565c4ca2e9ca2bcdd825397a6ce40aa	ha!!! Email Purgatory!!    honestly, it goes to either your ISPs server, or theirs.. and if it doesn't send within a time limit set on one of the server, that server just dicards it.|`|de340208fe271f038864eef8dcf43ff6aa	you probably sent it to wrong address or something|`|d813be1f26a5eee46ec9862cf279f155aa	It floats in the ether like a cosmic feather.|`|afad69e26e3d742b9b035d7dbbbbf716aa	e-mail heaven...............or hell !!!

AA11877791	I think the "E" drive refers to a CD/DVD ROM drive. If you use the Windows Shell to burn CD/DVD's, then putting files on it will read "files ready to be written".

AA11945200	First up...... you need somewhere to host it.  If you're an absolute rookie at this, you'd be best off with either:  http://www.geocities.com (part of Yahoo)  or  http://www.angelfire.lycos.com/  or perhaps  http://infinitehosting.net/    Next, you need some software to create it with.... personally I use "Netobjects Fusion MX" which was originally advertised for nearly $200 but I got for free with my hosting package with this company: http://www.1and1.co.uk/?k_id=3794345  Check out some of the computer magazines in your local store selling such things...... in the UK at least they often have coverdisks on the front with free software (usually older but perfectly good versions of programmes)........ alternatively, try this one for size instead:  http://www.freeserifsoftware.com/softwar...    Next, you may want to consider a few bits & pieces to spice your site up a bit (remembering NOT to over do it). I find these sites the most useful for that:    Free Animated Gifs  http://www.mikesfreegifs.com/    DHTML & JavaScripts (in addition to that provided by the host) + HTML Tutorials  http://www.freewarejava.com  http://www.javascriptkit.com/  http://www.dynamicdrive.com  http://www.bignosebird.com  http://www.brainjar.com  http://www.htmlgoodies.com/    Free Flash Animated Webgames:  http://www.miniclip.com  http://www.kewlbox.com  http://www.free-web-games.com/    To get it listed in Search Engines:  http://www.submitexpress.com/  http://www.1-hit.com    Other Options to lead people into it:  http://www.webring.com (formerly part of yahoo, but now seperate entity)    Other tips.....

However, if your web site gets too much traffic, it will be temporarily turned off for a while, which is annoying.    If you want to pay a few bucks and get something more reliable and with more disk space, more bandwidth, and more features, I'd go with DreamHost (http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?71951), which is what I use for my blog. One nice thing about DreamHost for a beginner is that they support WebDAV, which is a protocol that would let you edit your web site with WYSIWYG software.    Beyond the web host, you'll want to familiarize yourself with HTML. Look in your local bookstore and pick something that looks understandable and interesting to you. If you're wanting to do advanced, dynamic things, then you could look at PHP as well, but if you want to start with the basics, HTML might keep you busy for a little while.

Apparently the picture links can determine if the address that has received the pictures is active. If you you show these pictures then something determines that this email address is active and as such the address gets a higher premium for spammers and you'll get lots more spam. Something like that anyway. You can right click and show them though. Didn't Monty Python mention something about spam?

1e740e537ed736f95f0c4a060460da7baa	Los formatos de grabacin de DVD son fundamentalmente tres: DVD-RAM, DVD-R/RW y DVD+R/RW.    El primero de ellos es el llamado DVD-RAM fue elaborado por Panasonic, Hitachi y Toshiba. Inicialmente naci con una capacidad en los DVD-RAM vrgenes de 2,6 Gb (cara simple) y de 5,2 Gb (cara doble) pero hemos llegado a los 4,7 Gb.       La guerra por el dominio del mercado de grabacin casera de DVD se concentra en estos momentos en los formatos DVD-R/RW y DVD+R/RW. La R en el nombre quiere decir que solo se puede grabar una vez, es decir, tanto en los discos DVD-R como en los DVD+R la superficie de escritura solo puede ser utilizada una vez. La RW significa que en los discos con sistema DVD-RW y DVD+RW la superficie de escritura puede ser utilizada muchas veces. La diferencia esta en que el grado de compatibilidad entre el disco grabado y los lectores de DVD es mucho mas alto con los discos DVD-R y DVD+R que con los discos RW.     Los DVD-R y DVD+R. tienen un grado de compatibilidad entre lo grabado e y los reproductores de DVD muy favorable.     Lo que se te puede poner difcil es escoger el sistema DVD-RW o DVD+RW, aqu nacen diferencias entre unas grabadoras y otras. La compatibilidad esta es menor que con el uso de los DVD-R, si el reproductor de DVD es viejo puedo ser que no reprodusca los RW. En cuanto al grado de compatibilidad de uno y de otro este es ligeramente mayor en los discos DVD+RW que en los discos DVD-RW.     La grabacin en un DVD-RW necesita de un proceso de inicializacin y de uno de finalizacin. Para empezar ha grabar en un DVD-RW es necesario formatear el disco en su totalidad, lo cual toma entre dos y tres minutos. Una vez grabado el DVD hay que "cerrarlo" para que pueda ser ledo por un reproductor de DVD, esto puede llevar mas de 30 minutos. En la grabacin de un DVD+RW no es necesario ni el proceso de inicializacin ni el de finalizacin, una grabadora DVD+RW empieza a grabar al instante y se puede visualizar la grabacin de forma inmediata.    Una nueva diferencia entre ambos sistemas es la facultad que tienen las regrabadoras DVD+RW de detener la grabacin del DVD sin producir error. Esto es imposible de realizar con una grabadora DVD-RW. Adems las grabadoras DVD+RW pueden escribir en el disco a travs de dos modos de grabacin: CAV y CLV.     Una diferencia ms entre las grabadoras DVD-RW y DVD+RW es la compatibilidad de estas ltimas con el formato Mount Rainier. Gracias a este formato podemos grabar los discos DVD como si fueran disquetes y que despus puedan ser ledos en cualquier lector de DVD gracias a un driver residente en el propio sistema operativo. .     Por ltimo las velocidades de grabacin y lectura son muy superiores en las grabadoras DVD+RW, tanto con CD como con DVD.|`|a91b54df8e0c2b0bbbb2c09c7089a897aa	son los formatos de los dvds - pioneer y la otra no me acuerdo    si tienes un quemador dvd te tienes que fijar si solo quema -, + o es |`|AA11003158	A ciencia cierta no s, supongo ha de ser algn componente interno porque algunos quemadores antiguos no te aceptan los dos formatos.|`|0bb2dd7a781e86e0dd7c249b12decff0aa	el + y el -|`|e9e4fa6810838aee6216f4b1bc2f77adaa	Un signo|`|7a304307aa39efc7b1c00fb13e0e9d48aa	el signo, no recuerdo bien pero creo que uno lo apoya sony y el otro signo otro consorcio, o algo asi....  yahoo it!

e15bbf5b4241c7e42a4cbbff94bd42f4aa	Oh where to start.    This is not meant to be offensive but the webpage design is not user friendly.      It is suppose to be for a somewhat professional purposes right?  So why are you using cheesy blue background?  It is what we call eye fuzz.  It indicates the home made feel of a webpage.     The page itself is created incorrectly and is not dynamic.  That means when you go and change one aspect you need to essentially open up the whole web page and work around all the parts you would like to keep the same.      The font for a professional webpage should be san serif or at least more cleaner than the ones you used.  The last part of the page you shout out your email.  That is like say "EMAIL ME or else"  That is very amatuer-ish.      You also repeat the email 4 times in one page.  Which shouts out desparation.  You are selling something so do it with confiedence.  One information box with all the contacts is all you need beacuse if your product is good and you are good at selling it -- then people will come and seek out the information.    Photos are good but too many photos arranged they way you did are not.  If you are including all those photos then they should all be the same size and laid out in a way that pleases the eye.  You suggest that the viewer will click the smaller thumbnail to see a bigger photo.  People don't want to spend time doing so and so you will lose their interest. Spacing and layout is key to visual appealing websites.      "Click for map..."  is like saying turn over when you write a letter to a client.  you must assume that people are new to the web,  include the map as a secondary feature when your buyer is inquiring more.  Too much detail is not always a good thing.  Newbies get confused and then will click away from you site.      That copyright disclaimer you have doesn't wash leagally.  I can stamp a C on anything I want but legal copyright laws in your country are not the same in others.  This is the WWW so if you truely believe that those are your photos then you must apply for copyright and watermark digitally your photos so they cannot be used elsehwere with out a key or password etc.      Book mark this site?  Why would I?  If I am researching your site or a potential customer I would have already called or email you if the page was inviting enough.      Again I am not trying to be mean, you asked for feedback I am telling you this is not the webpage design for the land you ar selling.     Hyperlinking incorrectly is a no no.  You have the work (link) all over the place.  You can hyperlink in better ways than that.     Smells like pyramid scheme or time share and that turns people away too.     Spend the dollars to get this designed professionally, you already spend money on the domain name so go the whole way.|`|AA11310784	It's fine, but there is a serious problem.    All the thumbnails are far to large and take forever to load.    You need to make seperate thumbnail images - don't use the main image.  Thumbnails of the size on your page should be about 4K to 6K tops, not 150K.  Even on my highpseed, the load time was very slow.|`|2a9fdb81fc874ab2743c97c02bcbbcd2aa	Get a designer to make a layout for you.

When you type the content in a word file and saves the document , it makes the first .tmp (temporary) file which contains data to the point where you have saved first. This process is continued till you close the document. Once you close it, all tmp files are destroyed automatically. But if yur machine shuts down due to some problem and when you open the document, it restores the content of the last TMP til the moment, I hope this helps you out.

First of all...    click start, go to control panel, then click "add remove programs."    you can go through that list and uninstall any programs you dont use anymore or dont want. but if you're not sure what something is, then just leave it.    also, you can disk defragment. this is easy and automated.    click start, click programs, click accessories, click system tools, click disk defragmenter. then click the button that says "defragment."    these things should help, plus use disk cleanup feature if you want too. but i dont think it really makes much of a difference.|`|389420cdf75911288bc40004e259c6a2aa	You should have it checked in the box where it says COMPRESS DRIVE TO SAVE SPACE.  But the system will react slower because the files have to be decompressed to be read.  Also, get rid of programs that you don't use.  Also use the  DISK CLEANUP, while in there search thru WINDOWS programs you have installed that you dont use, like screen savers, networking, other things you may not use.  You can always reinstall them if you need them later.    If you have a large disk drive then compressing your drive is not needed.  Only do this if you have a drive that is nearly at its max.

AA10169424	Normally these files are spilt into 14.9 MB or 49.9 MB file sizes...the reason for these two specific sizes is unknown to me...    But the reason behind splitting the files is that if one of the files got corrupted during the torrent download, the torrent client only has to redownload a small file, and not the entire 700 MB (or whatever size) all over again.    If you are speaking about website file hosting, then they split files because they are restricted with a maximum size per file...  Such sites include:  MegaUpload - http://www.megaupload.com/  PushFile.net - http://www.pushfile.net/  Dropload - http://www.dropload.com/  Turbo Upload - http://www.turboupload.com/  RapidShare - http://rapidshare.de/|`|AA10026565	You don't have to open them all.

People with 56k internet connections would be able to download small batches of a file at a time without having to tie up their phone lines or lose everything should the connection be interrupted.    The reason that .rar's are still the same today is (as earlier mentioned) ease of downloading should a file be corrupt, and because many people (believe it or not) still use dial-up : \

May be worth checking downloads.com/softwarearchives.com    Thanks.
373267de54a567ce4fdd303d84705891aa	well user interface is very important cos if users dont like the look of your software theyre not going to buy/use it. Also if the user interface is more complicated than it needs to be its going to be very hard to understand for new users, and it will take twice as lng to do a task with it. Ease of use is very important.  As for coding, if your code is bad then the program will probably run slower or there'll be lots of bugs|`|60602036369c52ec11d57643a57e080caa	Well, even if the question seems odd (I assume you are new to programming) it is a good one. The importance of code: there are multiple adverse effects that can happen if you do not write your code properly and to make the program flow without errors, the most common is that the software will "freeze" on you or the user or it will loop and go nowhere. What are known as "bugs" are created by the person writing the code, usually not voluntarily but by missing a "possibility" of what would happen if a certain condition occurs or it is not met. The user interface or GUI is almost more important because if you make it EASY to understand and for the user to navigate through it, where to enter the data and HOW (by writing code to prevent wrong or improperly formatted data), how to get help or on-screen help, make sure the user finds and sees what he/she needs readily than there is a good chance your program will be appreciated (and used) by a lot of people. The two factors you mention are usually the most important criteria for an application to sell successfully.

First off, stop using the Internet Explorer - download FireFox and never have these problems ever again.    Secondly, download a whole mess of virus and security scanning products and sweep your system clean of all the viruses and trojans roaming around your system:    Comodo Antivirus  Comodo Firewall  AVG Antivirus  XoftSpy  CounterSpy  Outpost Firewall Pro  Zone Alarm Firewall and Anti-Virus/Anti-Trojan  AdAware    Most of these programs are either available for free or have free trials available.  That should be enough to sweep and clean your computer up.    Also, if you are using Windows XP, you can run the Windows XP DVD and select "repair system" from the install menu - it will overwrite any of your system files that have been replaced with fresh versions from the DVD, revitalizing the windows installation.  You will have to re-install MS Office and any Visual Studio tools you had installed, since doing this breaks those installations - but it works wonders with getting rid of those niche viruses and trojans that just seem to never go away.

Having said that though, it is more likely to be a Yahoo Mail issue - I'm presuming you are using the new email service which is still quite buggy (but then it is still in Beta stage after all). My best advice if you can't get working with IE7 would be to download and install Firefox (the new Yahoo mails works just fine with Firefox).     Also, have you looked at other email providers? Personally I gave up on Yahoo Mail and moved to Lycos Mail instead - have not looked back since :)|`|AA12076268	I TOLD YOU NOT TO DOWNLOAD IE7!|`|d56cc537e70d255e965616e40b0fe680aa	tip Disable   ActiveX    Offensive rootkits, which are used hide malware programs and maintain an undetectable presence on an infected machine, have become the weapon of choice for virus and spyware writers and, because they often use kernel hooks to avoid detection,    some antivirus will miss key keylogger and trojans    freeware screen recording software? with spyware trojans. mailware . virus...

In some cases, there really is no way to recover without nuking the systems from orbit," Mike Danseglio, program manager in the Security Solutions group at Microsoft, said in a presentation at the InfoSec World conference

db06806c76be0ea127190455739da1b3aa	your computer shouldn't be forcing you to scramble around for internet!!! ok for your problem there are the following solutions:    1. Get the latest antivirus. you will not BELIEVE how fast virus-makers keep making newer viruses. it could be that one of the latest ones, virus, or worms, or adware have infected your computer.    2. If that does not work, boot up your computer in safe mode and then try it. The way to do that is when you first switch ur pc on, just keep pressing the F8 key again and again until a menu comes up that asks you to choose what kind of bootup you would like your pc to perform. From here, choose Safe Mode.    3. If Safe Mode worked and Normal mode does not then it should be a software problem, run a detailed scan of your whole computer using the antivirus software. BTW I RECOMMEND KASPERSKY ANTIVIRUS - it is the BEST value for money. no, scratch that, it is THE BEST. WAAAY better than Norton or McAfee or anything else. And it costs like 25 for a whole year's worth of updating and active protection. TOTALLY worth it.     4. If above steps have not worked, unfortunately you must perform a reformat of your machine. Boot up in Safe Mode and back up all your documents. Then get someone who knows what he's doing to reformat your machine.    If you want to do it yourself, there are plenty of guides on google how.    http://helpdesk.its.uiowa.edu/windows/in... is a pretty good one|`|3a29cb4391a22f7f74f4a5fcd1e4224daa	Reinstall Ur software and keep Ur "friend" away from Ur computer.|`|AA11145682	call somebody that works on computers

It's compatible across various CD recording software). It's the equivalent of a ghost image file, which means it's one single, compressed image file that your CD recording software extracts into its original files. If you're not familiar with Ghost image files think of self-extracting Winzip files except instead of .zip these are .iso and is made for CD recording software. The link below will show you how to use these files with Nero, Roxio and the built in XP utility.|`|AA10718731	i think the .iso extention is an image file|`|e3bf1ca581f606f3c47f75d3fe2cf555aa	It's a CD image file. You can burn the iso file to a CD, or emulate it using Daemon Tools.    iso files are created by Nero and other CD-writing programs.|`|AA10278356	its a CD or DVD image:  Heres what wikipedia says:  An ISO image (.iso) is an informal term for a disk image of an ISO 9660 file system. More loosely, it refers to any optical disk image, even a UDF image.    As is typical for disk images, in addition to the data files that are contained in the ISO image, it also contains all the filesystem metadata (boot code, structures, and attributes). All of this information is contained in a single file. These properties make it an attractive alternative to physical media for the distribution of software that requires this additional information as it is simple to retrieve over the Internet.    Some of the common uses include the distribution of operating systems, such as Linux or BSD systems, and LiveCDs.    Most CD/DVD authoring utilities can deal with ISO images: Producing them either by copying the data from existing media or generating new ones from existing files, or using them to create a copy on physical media.    Most operating systems (including Mac OS, Mac OS X, BSD, Linux, and Windows with Microsoft Virtual CD-ROM panel) allow these images to be mounted as if they were physical disks, making them somewhat useful as a universal archive format.    Console emulators, such as ePSXe, and many other emulators that read from CD/DVD, are able to run ISO/BIN (and other similar formats) instead of running directly from the CD drive. Better performance is achieved by running an ISO since there is no waiting for the drive to be ready and the hard drive I/O speed is many times faster than the CD/DVD drive.    A copy of CD contents, stored as an .iso file, is made this way: the ripper searches for the sectors of the CD that have been used, say 251,000 for instance (there are 330,000 sectors on a 74 min CD and 360,000 sectors on an 80 min CD). Each sector is copied to the .ISO file, one by one. For CDs each sector is 2048 bytes, the .ISO file should then be of size 251,000 x 2048 = 514,408,000 bytes.
