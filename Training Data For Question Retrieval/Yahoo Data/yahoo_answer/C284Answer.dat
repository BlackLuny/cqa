If not,you should sit right next to him on the bench and say that if he's not gonna wear his gloves and helmet while playing,YOU wont while he's playing,either.

zBo1ldWdaa	in my own experience, eMule is a good program.<br>  and also, try googling the song that you're looking for with PLUS "4shared" . <br>  so for example, just put the name in the Google "xxx (the name of the song & artist) + 4shared" <br>  I recently find almost ANY song with this method. 4shared is just very kick-***, in my personal opinion!<br>  now I think it's even much better than any sharing-programs like eMule, Limewire, etc.<br>  even I can find many 'rare' songs such as video-game, anime music just by googling those songs "+ 4shared" .<br>  try it!|`|x4xaqrpCaa	Verned.com is awesome also

klhFMdCgaa	it's a reference to some kung fu movie, implying that you are the student and they are the teacher.|`|mqV9TOv0aa	<a href="http://www.ask.com/bar?q=%22Grasshopper%22+Kung+Fu&page=1&qsrc=2417&zoom=Learn+%3CKW%3EKung+Fu%3C%2FKW%3E+Online%7C%3CKW%3EKung+Fu%3C%2FKW%3E+Styles%7CShaolin+%3CKW%3EKung+Fu%3C%2FKW%3E+Techniques&ab=3&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWCyJRXvPNRo" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com/bar?q=%22Grasshopper%...</a><br>  <br>  In an old movie the Blind Master Po was asked a question from his favorite student Kwai Chang Caine. The question, "Master (Old Man), how is it you are blind and yet you see?" and a part of the answer, "How is it you can see (Young Man, how is it that you do not), but do not?". Open up your other senses, like listen to the life around you... the sounds of the running brook, the birds, and the Grasshopper at your feet... from that point on Caine was also known as Grasshopper to his Blind old Master Po.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ask.com/bar?q=%22Grasshopper%22+Kung+Fu&page=1&qsrc=2417&zoom=Learn+%3CKW%3EKung+Fu%3C%2FKW%3E+Online%7C%3CKW%3EKung+Fu%3C%2FKW%3E+Styles%7CShaolin+%3CKW%3EKung+Fu%3C%2FKW%3E+Techniques&ab=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FKwai_Chang_Caine" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com/bar?q=%22Grasshopper%...</a><br>  One of his first instructors was the blind master named Po. Po considered Caine his favorite pupil and behaved more like an elderly grandfather. Caine was given the nickname "Grasshopper" by Master Po. The reference was from an exchange where the still ignorant young Caine asked the old blind master how he could function without seeing. Po then described the room in detail, including a grasshopper at Caine's feet. Incredulous, Caine asked Po, "Old man - how is it that you hear these things?". Po's reply was, "Young man, how is it that you do not?". From that point on, Po affectionately called Caine "Grasshopper".<br>  <br>  <br>  The same term has been used to mean a Martial Arts Student for the last 35+ years due to this. some in this NEW AGE have turned it into a left handed insult as one who needs to learn what should have been taught.<br>  <br>  ME!<br>  <br>  Kung Fu (TV series) ~From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>  Kung Fu (1972-1975) is an American television series which starred David Carradine. It was created by Ed Spielman, directed and produced by Jerry Thorpe, and developed by Herman Miller (who was also a writer for, and co-producer of, the series). David Chow (and later Kam Yuen) was the technical and kung fu advisor. A full length feature TV movie preceded the series.<br>  <br>  Kung Fu follows the adventures of a Shaolin monk, Kwai Chang Caine [虔官昌 Qián Guānchāng] (portrayed by David Carradine as an adult, Keith Carradine as a teenager and Radames Pera as a young boy) who travels through the American Old West armed only with his skill in martial arts, as he seeks his half-brother, Danny Caine.<br>  <br>  Keye Luke (as the blind Master Po) and Philip Ahn (as Master Kan) were also members of the regular cast.<br>  <br>  Overall series plot summary<br>  In the late 19th century, Kwai Chang Caine (David Carradine) is the orphaned son of an American man and a Chinese woman. He has been raised in the Shaolin monastery, and trained by the monks to be a Shaolin master.<br>  <br>   <br>  Master Po (left) and Kwai Chang Caine (right) in a flashback from the episode "Dark Angel", written by Herman MillerIn the pilot episode, Caine’s mentor and elder, Master Po, is murdered by the Chinese emperor's nephew, and Caine retaliates by killing the nephew. In order to avoid execution for the nephew's killing, Caine flees from China to western America, where he seeks to find his half-brother, Danny Caine.<br>  <br>  Although it is his intention to find Danny while avoiding notice, Caine's training as a priest has instilled in him a sense of social responsibility, forcing him to repeatedly come out into the open to fight for justice. After each such encounter, he is compelled to leave to stay ahead of the emperor's assassins.<br>  <br>  The frequent use of flashbacks is used to recall specific lessons during Caine's childhood training in the monastery by his teachers, the blind Master Po (Keye Luke) and Master Kan (Philip Ahn). Part of the appeal of the series was undoubtedly the emphasis laid, via the flashbacks, on the mental and spiritual power that Caine had gained from his rigorous training.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In these flashbacks, Master Po calls his young student "Grasshopper" to remind him of how much he still had to learn.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<br>  <br>  During the concluding four episodes of the third and final season, "Barbary House", "Flight to Orion", "The Brothers Caine", and "Full Circle", Caine not only finds his brother Danny, but also his nephew Zeke and two cousins, Joseph and Ezekial.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|80II1Wv1aa	son, student, young one, trainee, protege... basically you call someone grasshopper when they are supposed to be learning from you. It's from an AWESOME TV show called Kung Fu, in which the student had the nickname "Grasshopper".<br>  And it IS from KUNG FU originally, not The Karate Kid. Kung Fu came about 10 years before The Karate Kid.<br>  By the way... Shawn Michaels RULES!|`|EOTH56DWaa	From the movie Kung Fu. It was the nickname the Sensei had for his young student Cain.

QZzQdh43aa	A Sagittarius Ascendant endows you with the type of flexible personality that works well for you. Because of your need for independence and freedom, you tend to find yourself in changing circumstances and different environments. Such changes of course require a certain amount of adaptability. With a Sagittarian ascendant, you are inclined to put marriage off until later in life (or skip it altogether) unless you find an understanding partner who does not attempt to be possessive or confine you. Once such an acceptable marriage arrangement is made however, the Archer adapts and makes a stable, loyal spouse. <br>  <br>  You are full of energetic enthusiasm, but this enthusiasm is not always accompanied by unflagging physical energy. You tend, in fact, to be lazy unless highly motivated to perform. It is often difficult to engage in boring routine exercise and, despite an innate restlessness and propensity for rushing around in a myriad of activities, you are quite capable of being unwilling (or unable) to keep yourself in good physical shape. Nevertheless, though often rash and hasty, your passions are sincere and inspirational. <br>  <br>  Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter, planet of inspiration, wisdom, good fortune, and abundance. You are inclined to be spiritually or philosophically oriented, talkative, intellectually curious and, at times, perhaps a bit too impressed with status and wealth. Although usually surrounded by a sense of limitless abundance, your natural exuberance and generosity can also generate the urge to throw your money around. Like those with your opposite sign Gemini rising, you can demonstrate a wide range of orientations and abilities: from being a great teacher, writer, scholar or researcher, all the way down to the flimflam of con artistry and the intellectual emptiness of copying the originality and talent of others. <br>  <br>  You are usually very honest, though it is also true that your too-candid remarks can sometimes be misinterpreted as rudeness. Negative influences associated with Sagittarius rising stimulate a tendency for self-indulgence, which makes you pompous, grossly overweight, dependent on drugs or alcohol, or too opinionated and cynical. On the positive side, Sagittarius gives a love of drama and the theatre, good food and drink, dancing, sports, animals, and, as a rule, you'll never miss an opportunity to travel. You are likely to be involved with publishing, education, religion, art, or music, either as a profession or hobby.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	<a href="http://www.elbertwade.com/page106.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.elbertwade.com/page106.html</a>

zBo1ldWdaa	based from my own experiences with bands & bandmates, usually the simplest thing you can do, yet also work quite well is just to be straight-forward: hold a small 'serious' meeting (well doesn't have to be very 'formal' by wearing ties like in corporate/business-setting though) , and just normally voice out ur opinion that indeed, you know they're all talented individuals (as you've witnessed yourself), but band is band, and they all need to 'tune down' a bit, or otherwise, there'll be no end-line to everything, and it'll end up as both of you just wasting time without any productive measures.<br>  In this life, the most important thing (or skill) that people must need to learn is to work and get-along with other people (teamworks), and also respect each other, and humbleness.<br>  with these 3 things, usually guaranteed, the band will have long periods of surviving, even through hard, difficult times.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Every worship team I've seen has a designated lead.. usually the lead vocalist. They dictate the mood, the tempo, and the overall feel of the service, and everyone takes their cues from them.<br>  <br>  It comes to this - a band is not a democracy, not if you want it to be successful. So someone needs to step up and be the one who is in control over things like dynamics... some simple hand gestures (a 1 for quiet, 2 for medium, 3 for loud, for instance, or a pointed finger plus a 1 if a particular instrument needs to be quieter, that kind of thing).<br>  <br>  Direction is important, but it needs to be one of those "one cook" kind of situations, y'know?<br>  <br>  People won't necessarily put themselves in check or play well with others unless they're told to.<br>  <br>  That's a good place to start, I think. <br>  <br>  Saul

zyxJFuFAaa	I agree. You have to let children know that people come in all shapes and sizes...so that they don't stare in situations like that.<br>  Stupid people. Teach your children for god's sake.|`|JltE5LIHaa	I totally agree with you there. Parents should teach their children that not everyone in this world is "perfect", and the not so perfect people can still be as loving, warm, caring, intelligent and funny as the so called "perfect" people. I so hope the BBC keep her on otherwise there will be one hell of an embarrassing mess again. And I do realise that not everyone in this world of ours is perfect.|`|doLyOac0aa	What about the one eyed Prime Minister who's scaring the country? lol|`|3d6119cf4a9df27c12f9843ac9018153aa	I remember the cackling witch in Pogle's Wood (early 1960's) - so scary she was dropped by the BBC! Butthere are actually people like that in real life ... a formative influence.|`|QidW9DRfaa	What an absolute hunk of crud!<br>  <br>  I was dismayed to read this story, so the lady has one arm, big whoop! There must be toddler disabled children looking at her thinking that she looks the same as them! Did any of these imbeciles think of that?<br>  <br>  My sister has a 2 yr old devotee of Cbeebies and she has asked her about her 'Little Arm' and my sister has told her that she was born like that but no different than you or I. She was over it in a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  For the parents claming their children are 'scared' by a presenter with one arm, sheeesh! Yeah, great, a generation of children growing up that will cry and go into shock when they see someone considered physically imperfect so the prejudice goes on ad infinitum.<br>  <br>  These pathetic so called parents should be highly ashamed. HIGHLY ashamed|`|K6rZmVmAaa	That's awful, I think it's great they have a presenter with a physical disability. My daughter is two and she asked bout her arm and I explained and that was the last I heard. Parents should be educating their children about these things to try and stop them being bullies or teasing people.|`|zon13nY2aa	These parents need a slap! They obviously don't know anyone disabled or they wouldn't say such disgusting things!<br>  <br>  Children should learn that everyone is different, and people come in all different shapes and sizes.<br>  <br>  I personally think it's great she has got such a successful career - she's a good role model!|`|A68od1sbaa	i think it is completely wrong for parents to complain.<br>  these parents disgust me. when my child is born i want to bring him/her up to accept people no matter what their disabilty. and i think this programme is a good start at teaching children that just because people have disabilities, does not mean they are not worthy of respect and a normal life.<br>  these parents who complain are not setting a good example at all and maybe next time their children see someone with this kind of disability they will be grossed out, but only because their parents were grossed out.<br>  Parents need to think twice about their actions
gp7qmHsMaa	On all of the shows Simon is a judge on (American Idol, The X Factor, and Britain's Got Talent), he is the most honest and the one who gives the harshest criticism to contestants (unless he is their mentor). Sometimes he can get a little carried away with the insults but he is a good person. Remember, he is a music executive and his job is to find the person whom he thinks will have the most success as a musician. This is probably why he acts the way he does.|`|xAy78hLNaa	Yea, he's awesome and very hot.|`|C7FtRe69aa	He is the only one giving honest answers.|`|Ziex8GCJaa	I love him he's great!|`|sDAPzDhVaa	Sometimes because he's so cruel and not always he's right.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Yes.He is honest. He tells you like it is. And he pulls no punches.|`|GEHoBC03aa	He's so funny.|`|rHrr7zmVaa	No because he only favors marketable contestants, not talent (sorry, but it's the truth) , he is old fashioned (very old fashioned), gets mad easily, insults people (which sometimes is not even necessary) and well, plain stupid (for picking lousy contestants due to sympathy).|`|y5FfKGAsaa	He can be very blunt, but he usually speaks the truth. (x<br>  <br>  If I had to pick, sure! Yes. I like Simon.

He had unfair advantages before he started and he and his partner are so smug.  For me the person who should win is the one who has never been on the ice before but has made the most progress by trying hard.  For me that is either Donal or Roxy.|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	Donal's my fave and he has improved more than anyone else but i don't think he'll win    : )<br>  I like Zoe, she's lovely to watch and a good skater -  but i think Jessica is the most natural and graceful - these are my 3 faves - so if any of them  win  i'll be happy....|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	Ray all the way !!|`|bXMhfrJxaa	I want Zoe to win because she is a brilliant skater and not smug at all.<br>  <br>  I don't want Ray to win because he is so smug and sure of himself.<br>  <br>  I don't want Donal to win because he isn't up to the standard of most of the other contestants, but he is my second favourite to win.<br>  <br>  I don't want Roxanne to win because she is so annoying and bland.<br>  <br>  I don't want Colleen to win because she is annoying and not a very good skater.<br>  <br>  I don't want Zoe to win because she is so uninteresting I always seem to forget about her. Take this answer, for example, I was just thinking of contestants and I have put her last because I didn't remember her!|`|T2C6hqaAaa	While I admit Ray's a good skater, he's smug with it and it would be too predictable if he won.

Batman may be cool because he's just a regular guy but he's also an uber rich millionaire. You'll have better chance getting bitten by a radioactive spider, and becoming a super hero than you would becoming as rich as Batman is supposed to be, which is like Bill Gates rich times ten. Spider-Man, ironically, is much more realistic as he is always broke and generally a really nice guy.

x4p5eMq0aa	I think they added in that scene so that the audience can start to get that feeling that Harry and Ginny are going  to get together. idk I would prefer if they showed more of what happened in the book too.<br>  <br>  I thought it was dumb whenever the previous movie, the Death Eaters and the Order were flying around...without brooms.|`|946d1d58cab0a4183184ea286020da64aa	I absolutely agree with you.  I hate when they add scenes and take out important scenes from the books.  I would also like to see more dialogue.  <br>  <br>  What I heard is that they are not doing the funeral scene, I don't know if it is true or not.  I read in on mugglenet.  I am hoping its not true.|`|uBkvqcY6aa	I agree that the movies generally sucked.  I watched the first 2 and the lack of character development and amount of information and scenes that were dropped just made the movie not work for me.  So I swore them off.  I'll probably watch Deathly Hallows just because I loved the book and let's face it there will be no more HP after the final movie..|`|IR7e44yDaa	They can if it stays true to the story...but I don;t know if that is the case.<br>  Anyway I am a fan of the books but not so much of the movies, I find that the script and some characters are very weak.

6Au5FIYWaa	To see what sign is most dominant in your chart, you need to take into account all the planets, the aspects they make to one another, and the houses they fall in.<br>  <br>  You will have a great Venus influence with Sun in Libra and Moon in Taurus, and as a result you must be careful not to indulge your Scorpio Venus's possessive and obsessive nature too much. Try to strike a balance.Either way, you will be very romantic and probably quite sexual, just from knowing those signs. As I said though, other factors need to be taken into account to get a truly accurate description of your chart.

2UhSaxnGaa	3 Doors Down puts on an AMAZING show. <br>  I went to see them in the summer last year when they were touring with Sick Puppies, Staind and Finger Eleven!<br>  They are flashy, and keep the audience alive.

SQmHjyBKaa	I learned how to play guitar in about 9 months, but it takes alot of practice and patience. I still play at least 2 hours a day. I also taught myself|`|lgMshdofaa	I learned how to play acoustic guitar in a year so yes! In that year, I learned all the basics on guitar and theory.|`|Sr7iiZOgaa	I took guitar class in school and it's very easy to learn. It doesn't take ages. You just have to practice everyday.|`|0fe6DWocaa	It's one of those things that just depends on the person...<br>  You may be musically inclined, you may not. <br>  After a year though you should be fairly stable in your instrument.<br>  Also it depends on if you're teaching yourself or learning from a professional. Professional is faster, but sometimes less effective depending on your teaching techniqes.<br>  <br>  I have taught myself guitar and piano. It took a year for guitar to really learn the basics. For piano I just started teaching myself a month ago, and I already have most of the basics. It really just depends on the person. It could take you a week to catch on, or it could take you 5 years. It just depends.|`|VZ14JElBaa	Yes, its possible to learn an instrument in a year, but it requires lots of practice|`|Ig09IRfHaa	my brother learned how to play Violin in 3 months and ONLY through watching people playing it!!!!!!!!!<br>  he actually learned it by himself!

They're both sexy in their own way. But, if I had to choose between the two, it would be Rob. He's real, and Edward isn't. Edward is too perfect which makes it boring and not interesting, and Rob is not perfect, which makes him perfect, because flaws are interesting.|`|GTja6ouWaa	Neither.|`|And9dyrwaa	may be robert becoz he got his fame from the first film.<br>  oh that's too fast.|`|Bgm0pUqraa	Robert Pattinson<br>  I like his personality better. Hes so real and awkward and modest and sweet (from what i can tell, i dont actually know him) but he takes the time to talk to his fans and he seems really genuine, he has his flaws which makes him real unlike edward who is supposed to be the perfect man. To me rob is much more desirable. I read twilight over 2 years ago and I still love it but I'm over the obsession. I am sick of hearing all the little kids screaming about how hot Edward Cullen is.|`|JlwDnHTOaa	you don't even know Robert.<br>  so how could you know if you like him or not.<br>  Edward is character.<br>  not a real person.<br>  people seem to be forgetting that this is reality.<br>  <br>  i love twilight and everything about it.<br>  but its not real.|`|jIzlBCzxaa	theyre both the same person. except edward cullen is the character. thats all.|`|hIGCHF6naa	they are tha same person but i prefer edward cullen...<br>  cuz hes so cute and i luv vampires!!!!!<br>  (edward cullen is a vampire at the movie twillight,he is played by robert patinson)|`|XAjCXViuaa	I say Edward Cullen, because I know that he is only a made up character but he is so mysterious in many ways lol!|`|ZmikGFTEaa	Edward Cullen!|`|YeBbtDW3aa	They are both annoying, and need A) A Tan B)To go away, never to be heard from again.

aihogb26aa	EDIT: Well, the question is kind of a SPOILER so this answer is also...<br>  <br>  None of it has aired yet, so we're all just hearing rumors so far ( although they all seem to be saying the same thing). The best explanation I've heard is from  <a href="http://www.realitysteve.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.realitysteve.com</a><br>  Apparently, Jason proposes to Melissa on the last show and we see Molly going home brokenhearted. However, the rumor is that Jason continued to date Molly behind Melissa's back ( Molly was apparently flown out to see Jason several times and ther show's producers knew all about it). On the After the final rose reunion show, Jason supposedly dumps Melissa on camera ( and Melissa is reportedly totally shocked) and then reveals that he chooses Molly instead. There is then ANOTHER reunion show, where Jason supposedly proposes to Molly. The controversy is that this whole scenario was reportedly set up early on in the season to create drama and tension and that Jason was in on it the whole time (but not Molly and Melissa). I guess that all we can do is just wait and see if these rumors are true.|`|OMYd6p3gaa	I am so upset he didnt pick Jill!!! I was sooo shocked!! I have no idea who he picked yet. But I thought tonight was the women tell all, so they all go in the room and complain and whine to Jason as to why they get didnt get picked. Also, they give updates on past bachelors!!!

But I'm still gonna go see the new Star Trek, it looks much better than Clone Wars. If its good enough I'm probably gonna turn into a Trekkie!
UoDtGtiLaa	i tend to fuss over my glasses slipping from my nose, but it's because my glasses are old and they DO slip off my nose, so you'll usually see me with one finger pushing my glasses up like every 5 mins<br>  <br>  i'm getting new glasses soon though  <br>  :D|`|Qxir7i58aa	I usually grit my teeth or start pacing about.

T3X7Aci4aa	Havoc - "Hidden Files" - It's on my iPod, but I haven't listened to it yet<br>  Esoteric (no 7L) - " "Serve Or Suffer" - Weak attempt at an instrumental album. The production isn't bad, but without Eso rhyming over it, it's boring. He tried throwing in voice samples to add some continuity, but they don't add much value. You only need to listen to 15 seconds of each song to get the point. <br>  K'Naan - "Troubadour" - If you like him it's probably a great album. I just think he's OK, so I think the album is OK.<br>  B-Real - "Smoke and Mirrors" - It's on my iPod, but I haven't listened to it yet<br>  P.O.S. - "Never Better"  - Very Good. What you would expect, without being too predictable.<br>  Zion I - "The Takeover" - Best album of the list. Good if you just want something you can groove to or if you want something meaningful.<br>  Exile - "Radio" - I think he got a little too into his concept for the album, and it took away from the quality of some of the tracks. Good album, but it could have been a lot better.<br>  <br>  Bonus - Nobody ever calls me, so I don't think my phone is ringing even when it is.|`|t74KHpcsaa	K'Naan-Troubadour...i just copped that this weekend.

He is an excellent actor, but I wouldn't call him great, plus I think Ben Stiller whores himself out to films that he has a lot to do with other than just acting in them, so I don't think that counts.  Typically he works with a lot of the same people.  Joaquin has just about gone of the deep end and since he has put himself in the middle of the public eye with his new image, he is going to have many jokes thrown at him.  Does anyone other than George W. Bush or Dick Cheney deserve such insulting humor?  No too many more, and I don't think Joaquin deserves it, but it's coming to him.  He'll have to deal with it.|`|aBzRV8EXaa	ben was mad funny, i laugh so much tears come out my eyes.<br>  i don't know whats going on with Joaquin Phoenix he do good movies like the gladiator, if britney spears can make a comeback Joaquin Phoenix gonna make a enormous one|`|721304c80de56710adba6c3a8fdc5f7daa	Yawn!<br>  <br>  He was funny as hell.|`|JARr5NLGaa	He is a comedian.

Ns5miQQmaa	The movies you describe as the best of the year seem more suited to the Golden Globes, which are less serious.  America is growing, Slumdog Millionaire is a story that more and more people can relate to.  I do agree best original score shouldve gone to Danny Elfman for the 'Milk' theme though.  I thought the whole of Slumdog was a great inspiration, with actors who genuinely understood and performed well with the scale of cinema they were presented with|`|AA11110732	The only thing that bothered me was that Peter Gabriel didn't get to sing his song from WALL-E because he wanted more time and yet Beyonce got more stage time and she wasn't even nominated for anything.<br>  <br>  Maybe if they got rid of that tribute to musicals, Peter Gabriel could have sang instead.|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	Changeling may have been too upsetting? <br>  Slumdog is uplifting in a "down" economy?|`|3XMOrE4Haa	I liked the Academy Awards<br>  Hugh Jackman was amazing, especially with his numbers.<br>  I think the Academy Awards is getting more and more broad with movies. So, they are accepting movies in different languages. <br>  As for me, I don't think that's a bad idea.<br>  Entertainment should be able to reach across to people from all over, kinda like what Penelope Cruz said in her acceptence speech.|`|zovrJ0yXaa	the oscars are always disappointing. but slumdog was an excellent film. it just wasnt as good as the dark knight or wall-e|`|LIaNBM3iaa	I thought it was a pretty entertaining show. Hugh Jackman was a good host that didn't go over the top and was highly entertaining. As far as the nominated films are concerned:"Slumdog Millionaire" is a good movie, but didn't impress me that much and wasn't the best film of the year. Milk deserved that award because it was inspirational, had a great story and Sean Penn gave an excellent performance. What I didn't like about the show is that they didn't include any film clips when the nominations were presented. During the in memoriam tribute, the camera was moving to every angle and made it difficult to focus on the actor being shown on the screen. But overall, it was a good show!|`|vRe9z4graa	i was dissapointed in  a few areas ,<br>  butt , as you did , i really did think hugh jackman did a great job , & was funny . & i also did like the award they gave to heath ledger . <br>  that was nice , but besides that . the dreesessss were ugly . like mileys & penelope cruzz . & it seeemed extremly long & boring , && i have to admittt slumdog , was a good movie , butt it won so many awardss . ugh ,. every time it was in a catorgory , it won . there was so many other great movies this year , like , the dark night ;] && taken , iron mannn , & comedys . like ^^^ forgeting sarah marshall & the heartbrake kid , & tropic thunderr , EVERYTHING , was SULMDOG .

If my kids ate a mudpie, I'd have to take them to the hospital and have their stomachs pumped.|`|UjG8FqLUaa	EWW GR0SS, I THINK AB0UT H0W L0NG THAT DIRT HAS BEEN AR0UND AND WHAT`S IN IT.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	nope never even made one|`|JY5MW1Qgaa	Americans eat at least 1 pound of dirt per year according to a study I read a few years ago. That doesn't mean we sit down to the dinner table with a knife, fork and a plate full of dirt. It means that there is a certain level of dust, dirt, or other resin in the stuff that we eat.<br>  <br>  Anyway, no big deal to eat dirt, just don't make a habit out of it|`|92804107a22baf2062283186dbfd02abaa	I have sampled a mudpie. And I lived! Dirt isn't so bad. It's important, without dirt we wouldn't have trees and trees contribute to breathing.|`|Q8yTJWTXaa	i've never sampled a mud pie<br>  i wouldnt eat it it might have some bad germs but mud is supposed to be really good for your skin though|`|HYPMGkj9aa	Agreed. It'll wash out (hopefully) so I don't mind getting dirty at all.<br>  <br>  But I'd never eat a mud pie! :D|`|P8qwYZDraa	haha lol<br>  <br>  EDIT: i don't reccommend eating it! lol but if you do don't eat alot cuz you will def get sick|`|Zgs4RncIaa	Ewww no that's how you get pin worms!|`|6Uohf1h1aa	you eat some first
6NZeItMAaa	I personally only look at my sun sign, I think this is the most important about our character.<br>  <br>  Regarding Leo:<br>  <br>  The people born under this sign are kind-hearted, generous, sympathetic, and magnetic. They make good nurses when in full sympathy with the patient. They are emotional, very intuitive, and are generally able by means of this power to escape the consequences of their actions. Leo people are fine conversationalists, excelling in repartee, and are the best of story-tellers. They always make a point, and always see the point.<br>  <br>  When the true individuality of Leo holds sway, these people have a noble ideal, with a loyal love, confident, pure, and abundant. Having minds of the practical, philosophical, and spiritual combined—a triunity—they radiate a lu-minous substance, which makes them a most powerful people for good, with a marked ability to inspire others.<br>  <br>  Under such conditions they have the most remarkable power in moulding public opinion, and in swaying great audiences. In fact, the truly awakened Leo men and women are invincible if they will learn the pathway of silence.<br>  <br>  Leo people have a great love for their own, and will not yield to advice or dicta-tion in the management of their children. Leo women who have been looked upon as angels in the neighborhood will some-times show an astonishing ferocity if their children are hurt or reproved. A fault found with them, a complaint made by a teacher or a friend, will arouse these mothers to the highest pitch of passionate excitement.<br>  <br>   The natural intuition of these people is very great, and this talent is sometimes so con-stantly exercised that it leads to deep-seated aversion and prejudice. They have been right in their estimates of people six times out of ten, therefore they must be right ten times out of ten. Argu-ment is of no use under such conditions. In fact, it is well to let the Leo person enjoy his opinions without interference. The balance of happiness for the rest of the family is usually to be found in that method.<br>  <br>  Those born under this sign are in some respects near of kin to those who come under the head  of the same triplicity.<br>  <br>  They would rather plan than work, and they are by no means fond of details. They are sometimes very lazy, and, like the cat, are fond of basking in the sun and dozing in the chimney corner. They are fond of all creature and home comforts. The men usually know where the best markets are to be found, and have a real genius in catering for the table. The women have the same talent in selecting, and among them are found our most in-spirational cooks.

HRx2sjBhaa	I thought he saved the Academy Awards! Each year they seem to get more boring and I keep telling myself I won't watch the whole thing but usually do hoping it will get better. This year I was actually able to look forward to the show. I was still disappointed in most of the categories but I thought Hugh did a terrific job! He's incredibly talented, very classy and not to mention handsome! I loved the dance numbers! Absoultly brilliant! I loved at the end of the first song in which he sings that he's Wolverine. Strangely enough I am obsessed with musicals AND comic book adaptions so this was a dream come true to hear him sing that.|`|bda465ikaa	I honestly did not even realize he was a song and dance man.

Are you really at that much of a loss for questions?<br>  <br>  Any comments?|`|0LSLXwWVaa	Well, you are getting the points for answering the question, whats the big deal about giving them a star?<br>  You know, maybe it pisses someone off that you use dollar signs instead of the letter "s".<br>  Or that you didn't use spell check?<br>  But since you didn't ask for it, I'll give you a star. <br>  Not that I'd wanna piss you off or anything......|`|Sh13k42qaa	What pi$$es me off is poor grammar, sloppy spelling and people who do not follow their own advice. <br>  (For example, those who say that we should be colorblind, yet always introduce themselves as a "person of color")|`|lfamfJhUaa	yeah. all anybody ever wants anymore is recognition for menial things like that.

The only difference is that the Fish easily shows what he feels, but the Scorpion does not. He will always maintain an outer fa?ade of strength and perseverance, while on the inside, he is brimming with emotions. Because of their similarities, both the individual effortlessly understand each other and find it very easy to compromise on certain issues too. They share an intense relationship, which has all the intimacy they so much desire. <br>  <br>  A Piscean is non-judgmental, he accepts people just as they are, while a Scorpio is very opinionated. Somehow in the love match, instead of clashing, these different traits seem to complementing each other. The understanding attitude of the former also acts like a healing balm to the latter. The Scorpion can teach the Fish to be more assertive and also help him realize his dreams. Both the sun signs seem to be balancing each other beautifully and can indeed, have great levels of compatibility. <br>  <br>  Scorpio Man and Pisces Woman<br>  A Pisces woman and a Scorpio man will be almost instantly drawn to each other. They will share a sizzling chemistry and an amazing understanding. The form they form will be both, intimate as well as emotional. Theirs is a relationship in which neither has to explain his feelings. He understands her feelings even before she utters a single word and vice-versa. This zodiac match will give them the security they want. It will be full of love, passion, loyalty, devotedness and faithfulness. Only the possessiveness needs to be controlled a little. <br>  <br>  Scorpio Woman and Pisces Man<br>  There will be a natural as well as a mutual attraction between a Pisces man and a Scorpio woman. They will fulfill each other emotionally and complement each other perfectly. Both of them have deep feelings towards each other and will find their love fully reciprocated. She will help him realize his dreams and he will provide her with security, without even being asked to. His wistful and dreamy nature will allure her and he will yearn for her true love and passionate ways. Both of them will find the perfect match in one another.

8Mi15cTtaa	HELL YES!<br>  <br>  Sean Penn should have kept politics out of the Oscars. His comments were insulting. I will never go to a Sean Penn movie!!!|`|AA10811674	No, I doubt it. I didn't see Milk or the Wrestler. But I know from other films that Penn is an excellent actor. As one of the other posters said it was more of a stretch for him to play his part that it was for Mickey Rouke to play his character.|`|qJ9o3iQnaa	Well it may be true.  There are members of the academy that vote some may have voted penn as a statement.  But unless they fess up we'll never know for sure.  However I do think that Sean Penn was excellent in this film and with the academy it is a bit of a tradition that if you are nominated for an award and you played a real person (based on a true story), then you'll win.  I have yet to see the wrestler, I'm actually going on Wednesday to see it.  I've heard Mickey Rourke is great in it, and part of me wanted to see him win it even though I haven't seen the movie because of what he's been through.|`|qksvRJIyaa	You know I do since you answered my question quite rudely. Rourke did a better job. Did you even see either movie or are you just going by who you like? I'm really not a Rourke fan, but he was just simply better in his role. Frank Langella (Frost/Nixon) was better than Penn also. I really can't think of a reason why in the hell Penn won unless it was b/c of the Prop 8 crap. "See? We here in California like the gays! We had Milk win a couple of awards, so get off our back now!"|`|zHmZkMStaa	I don't think that's true at all.  Sean won for excellent acting.  (A straight man playing a gay man?  Not easy.)  O'Rourke didn't win because it's perceived that the role wasn't much of a stretch for him - in that he is very much like that wrestler character in real life.|`|1b91ce32a95b13a1e9f83fdedfcea4f9aa	No. But the right wing kooks have to have something besides Obama to keep them angry.|`|AA11124473	No. The character in Milk was a harder one to play. Also, as another answerer said, Rourke was similar in many ways to his character, so it wasn't as difficult for him to embody the role; I even heard a long interview with the director in which he pointed out the similarities between Rourke and the character.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that Rourke did a bad job, but Penn was better.|`|721304c80de56710adba6c3a8fdc5f7daa	No. He immersed himself into the role and delivered a great performance.<br>  <br>  If there was anything ulterior in the decision, my guess would be that they were more afraid of Mickey being an idiot and embarrassing himself and others.|`|9KZK9rdnaa	Mickey Rourke should've won because he really is a true actor but since Hollywood is run by gays nowadays. What can you expect, it's manipulated big time and it's not the same as it once was.

u8hsZ7claa	1. He is necessary just like Al Sharpton<br>  2. I just heard from her and she is good (She could be my heroine if she'd try harder) <br>  3. neither I'm a Monster guy<br>  4. neither and I would have to say Jimmy Jam would produce circles around them both<br>  5. No, not at all|`|6YnP3S0Uaa	1.  I like "Hip Hop Lives", but I only heard it cuz it was on NBA Live, so I hadn't really gotten into his music.<br>  2. I have no idea<br>  3.I don't drink energy drinks...they are not good for you.<br>  4. P. Diddy (no contest)<br>  5.Common is one of my favorite artists, so I am a little biased...so I hope his fanbase will grow with whatever his next album will be.|`|HL8W9yU6aa	1. I still like KRS...<br>  2. IDK, she reminds me of an old girlfreind of mine.<br>  3. neither<br>  4. JD<br>  5. Common can do way better, Finding Forever was an ill album... Something along the lines of FF or BE would be gladly welcomed.|`|l72FO4eMaa	1. Yes & Yes<br>  2. I don't know, I don't tend to keep track on people, especially ones I don't know in real life<br>  3. Red Bull all mutha!*@#ing day!<br>  4. JD<br>  5. I haven't listened to it yet actually|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Love him.  When I start to get that taste, I simply press stop.<br>  <br>  IDK maybe at work?<br>  <br>  Red Bull and Vodka<br>  <br>  Meh  <br>  <br>  I liked the album.  I especially liked that fact that you could still hear the Hip Hop influence.  With Kanye, you couldn't even hear hip hop anymore.|`|gUYcVXMTaa	1. Do you like KRS-One? Has he begun to leave a bad taste lately for you as he has for me?<br>  I like KRS He is just him and that is what I like most.  He dont fit into that reg. mold you would expect!<br>  <br>  2. Where is New Moon Daughter? She's my heroine.<br>  I dont know but thats my girl I hope she is doing okay!<br>  <br>  3. Which do you prefer...Red Bull or Rockstar?<br>  Pass on them both I am a tea drinker!!<br>  <br>  4. Who is a better producer....Jermaine Dupri or P. Diddy?<br>  Tough one but Diddy found Biggie so Ima have to go with his gay self.  Did you hear about him taking xzibt to a gay club!!  Xzibt got so mad and left!  He said once he saw dudes kissing in the corner he had to bounce LOL!<br>  <br>  5. If Common comes out with another album like Universal Mind Control, will his fanbase wane?<br>  Yes they will.  But like I said before that is what happens when you let the Neptunes produce your entire album!|`|bribxhsdaa	1. I think he's ****ing amazing. I think If I rapped, I'd spit in a similar mould. Like KRS-One meets Black Thought meets MF DOOM meets Common. (I choose to ignore his wack continuous releases...)<br>  <br>  2. I dunno mate. On the Moon?<br>  <br>  3. Neither. <br>  <br>  4. Meh...Probably Diddy.<br>  <br>  5. No. If they did, That would be super ironic. Ideally, Common fans should be just about intelligent enough to understand that if Common did nothing but conscious music, He'd be a one trick pony. (I like it too.)|`|mZOt8oURaa	Yes.No he's been doing it for 20+years<br>  I have no idea?<br>  Red bull-The realest energy drink there is but that green monster energy drink(bad mutha)it came in a green can knocked me off my toes.<br>  P.Diddy-King of the remixes\<br>  Yes-His best album was "Be"|`|KoNHUcNUaa	1. Yeah<br>  2. I dunno<br>  3. Red Bull<br>  4. P Diddy (ready to die)<br>  5. Yup but he won't come with another UMC , that was just a one time experimentation|`|DDmFQU7raa	1. Do you like KRS-One? Has he begun to leave a bad taste lately for you as he has for me?<br>  I was never a fan of his. I've always had a bad taste from him.<br>  <br>  2. Where is New Moon Daughter? She's my heroine.<br>  LOL. She asked a couple of questions the other day.<br>  <br>  3. Which do you prefer...Red Bull or Rockstar?<br>  Rockstar's the shiznits.<br>  <br>  4. Who is a better producer....Jermaine Dupri or P. Diddy?<br>  I believe the race is tighter than most people think. They both produce good party tracks. I like J.D. by a hair.<br>  <br>  5. If Common comes out with another album like Universal Mind Control, will his fanbase wane? I personally like that album...<br>  I doubt it. I don't think UMC is as out there as 808's was.

S4W7FojCaa	I'm only 18...I used to babysit this kid and he was crazy! He was only four. He kept saying things like 'I'm gonna kill you' and then he'd go get something sharp! I always take it from him...but once he locked me out of the house because I had to go get that dog inside...it was freezing and he left me out there until his parents came home! He was a little pervert too...what does that kid watch that makes him think he can grab at a girl?!? I stopped watching him after that day....I was afraid of that little boy. <br>  <br>  He was insane..his older sister told me once that they had some kittens and the kid took one and tried to drown it (she saved the cat) and he tried to feed another one to their dog (which is a huge, friendly dog) but luckily the dog was friendly.|`|YW1DXceqaa	"daddy are you santa all the time?"|`|GqDaGHUBaa	Your baby is ugly|`|toLCaFc9aa	"I hate you"|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	"I love you mommy, but, but, I, I dddoon't ov u ooll da time..only when u give me cookies".|`|ZkDjl5I8aa	A kid and her dad was having an argument, and the kid just went, 'STOP IT DADDY!!

HP1pToMOaa	It's the Magdalin Sisters. The Magdalin homes were founded by the Catholic Church and girls were sent there for the most stupid of reasons like just looking at boys. They were finally closed down in the 1960s/70s, after a huge outcry. Some women had been there for all of their lives.<br>  Google it - there have been many books written on the subject.|`|6I1LFlSIaa	Its called the Magdalene sister. I've seen that movie many times. The girls that get sent there are mistreated. They have been sent there because they have sinned...

Here in Salt Lake City there is a Catholic church I sometimes attend called The Cathedral of the Madeleine.  So you might want to google with a different spelling of Madeline.  Also, I heard of this movie and believe it is set in Ireland and may have been made by an Irish company.  I would be interested in seeing this movie...sounds interesting.

RDoVxcgmaa	I'm gonna leave the "influence" part alone,if it moves ya,it moves ya..sometimes the best stuff is found on your own and not what everyone else says" you gotta listen to"..check it all out !!<br>  <br>  Personal Experience (in no particular order)<br>  1) Make the music you like !! Remember there are no rules,have fun and experiment with everything.HAVE FUN !!<br>  2) Talk to EVERYONE and anyone about your band or upcoming gig.If someone takes the time to ask ya something,take the time to answer.Word of mouth is still a top advertiser for bands !!<br>   3) When/ If you play out DON'T PISS OFF THE SOUND MAN/WOMAN !! Even if you bring your own sound guy,nobody knows that room or board like the house sound guy...buy him/her drinks and treat them as royalty.You'll be glad.<br>  4) Be on time for evrey little thing.Practice,auditions,band meetings ect. This will become very important when booking gigs.Nobody wants to book a band that's unreliable or forever late. <br>  5) Blaze your own trail !! Take your influences and use them to help shape what you're going for musically.Everyone lifts something from their influences,the trick is to use it for knowledge and to make your own "style" from it.<br>  6) Don't ever give up !! Let the negative ones say what they will,as long as you get off on what you're doing,at this point that's what it's all about no?<br>  7) Don't rule anything out before actually giving it a chance.That golden note,or tone maybe missed or a crucial piece of info can slip by you,just because it's not your "normal" thing.It may open a whole new world musically for ya !!<br>  8) PLAY ANYWHERE that will have you. Backyard parties,weddings, ect. There is no substitue for experience !!<br>      Hope this helps ya,or at least gives you something to think about that you might not have otherwise. I wish someone had told me some of these tid bits,but I found out some of them the hard way !! Good luck !!|`|RVAPQg6Waa	Read this from your Uncle Steve...<br>  <a href="http://www.negativland.com/albini.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.negativland.com/albini.html</a><br>  <br>  Oh and keep your day job ;-)|`|c06dc4d1e227f35f0b67179987536394aa	Stand out from everyone else in your city's scene.<br>  <br>  Be NICE.

f8580fb10a70074a6148e666b97f9cdaaa	I disagree, Beethoven's Fifth is my best favorite classical work, and of course not just for the very famous beginning, but overall with all its movements, it is a totally incomparable work.<br>  The first movement contains really unbelievable deep and dramatic effects, especially in its ending part.<br>  It was the first idea in a symphony for merging the final movement with the previous one.<br>  The Scherzo ends with a very strange and obscure theme, leading to the extremely exhilarating finale, such contrast has not ever been done in any of other Beethoven symphonies, and perhaps of any other symphony in the history of music.<br>  I know some people's opinions that because of Beethoven's music being much famous, played and listened everywhere, that it is not affecting them anymore,  I would say this symphony is among very unique works, that could be listened always with its same amazing effects.|`|aSTmFCiBaa	its a great piece,but a lot of bombast,sturm und drang,,,,mass in c is much a better work,,,,,,,,so spracht herr bach,,herr ludwik,deine werke fur das kirch es ist ganz wunderbar,,,,,,,liszt composed les preludes based on this,,he was better at opera paraphrases,and of course the hungarian rhapsodies,musically,the mass in c is more advanced than even the ninth,certainly the fifth|`|xcPzZvsraa	Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  Do I hear you correct?<br>  The "5th is quite plain except for the first movement,which is okay".<br>  What!<br>  How inexplicably insulting.<br>  The 1st movement is more than ok.<br>  First off we have the attention arresting dramatic opening which was like nothing which had been heard before.<br>  You just have to listen to Mahler's fifth to see how indelibly this opening had affected all subsequent composers.<br>  The further development in this movement where Beethoven typically takes the opening theme and breaks it down almost to nothing is simply wonderful.<br>  <br>  The 2nd movement's opening theme on violas and cellos is one of his most beautiful melodies.I've always especially loved this movement.<br>  Then we have the piannissimo and rather mysterious opening of the third movement.<br>  Beethoven throughout masterfully builds an air of suspense which culminates in a great crescendo leading into the triumphant final movement in which Beethoven unleashes all the power of the orchestra at his disposal.<br>  Incidentally I believe this was the first use of Trombones in a symphony.<br>  Beethoven also was the first to write finales to symphonies like this.<br>  Programmatic I think in one way.<br>  That is in the sense of them being the culmination of all that went before them,the termination of an entire work and this is one shining example.<br>  <br>  Anyway bottom line the 5th is a masterpiece of symphonic writing so as such it would be impossible to over rate it.<br>  Good call by Malcolm as well as regards Carlos Kleiber to really get the adrenaline going.|`|rNqF4gIVaa	It is, in its entirety, a masterpiece. At the time it was written it was revolutionary. The fact that you are comparing it with other Beethoven symphonies speaks volumes. There are few others that can stand "shoulder to shoulder" with the fifth. After the violence of the first movement, the second movement is somewhat of a refuge, although it still contains a number of declamations to let you know the conflict is not over and despite this it does not completely resolve the tension created by the opening allegro con brio. However, you can sense triumph is within reach.<br>  More uncertainty is introduced in the third movement, but in the final movement there is no doubt of the outcome of the conflict... the opening fanfare proclaiming the end of conflict and the joyous celebration that follows.<br>  I am not big on trying to rank works such as this... the opening movement of the fifth is the most famous piece of music ever written. It is justifiably praised and when you hear Carlos Kleiber's superlative version with the Vienna Phil, the excitement is bearly containable.|`|CrAwmz65aa	The above respondents have said a lot, but there is one important point that they missed, and that is that the first movement is based on germ motifs.  It is much more difficult to compose an entire movement based on germ motifs than to compose one based on two nice, long, flowing melodies.  I know because I have tried.  That is what the development section is usually reserved for, and the development section is the hardest section to compose.  By spending the entire movement on this sort of thing, Beethoven undertook a task which was three times as difficult.<br>  <br>  Bach shows similar expertise in the first movements of his E major and a minor violin concerti.  Janacek shows similar expertise in the first movement of his Sinfonietta.<br>  <br>  So that's three composers in music history which I know of who are up to such a task: Bach, Beethoven, and Janacek.|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	I think the Fifth Symphony has suffered from a desperate amount of over-exposure (like the 'Moonlight' Sonata, which I can hardly bear to listen to anymore). I think the Fifth Symphony is a great and important work but that hearing it (or hearing/seeing it referred to in superficial terms) too much has diluted its revolutionary status a great deal.<br>  <br>  If you put the Fifth Symphony into historic context (1808 - Haydn was still alive!), it helps one realise what a groundbreaking and dramatic wortk it is. No-one had ever merged two movements in the way Beethoven did with that transition from the hushed 'da capo' of the Scherzo (revolutionary in itself) into the blazing majesty of the Finale (complete with piccolo, contrabassoon and trombones transported from the opera house into a symphony for the first time). In so many ways it is a remarkable work. Don't underestimate it simply because of the 'da-da-da DUM!' brigade.|`|10mOHSZTaa	It's a brilliant piece of work, which has been flogged, hung, drawn, quartered, burnt at the stake, and turned in to cat food. Sort of like Bach's Air on the G String, Spring from The Four Seasons, Mozart's 40th symphony, Mozart's Turkish Rondo, the Moonlight Sonata, the Hallelujah chorus from Messiah, and Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. You can only hear those things played as someone's ringtone so many times, and hear them turned in to MIDIs for games or as techno remixes or little excerpts every time someone wants to look smart.<br>  <br>  At the time, Beethoven was radical and revolutionary. Compare a Beethoven symphony to the works of Haydn, his teacher. You have to learn the right context to evaluate music in.<br>  <br>  For example. Baroque music is emotionally and instrumentally extravagant, complex, and occasionally overwrought. Most people I've said this to haven't been able to hear that. Why? Because they're looking at it from the wrong perspective. Prior to the Baroque, music was either vocal work for churches or your standard folk tunes. You had voices, maybe a viola da gamba or two and possibly some kind of flute. Music was supposed to make you calm and want to pray. There was no strong beat. Then the Baroque era kicks off, and you have the biggest development of all: abstract instrumental music. That in itself is actually very extravagant and ego-based. There's tons of ornamentation, huge choruses, etc. But people don't hear that because they're used to guitar solos left and right. That's part of the Baroque legacy. Bach, for example, was a skilled composer who used just about every musical technique under the sun, and really helped bring the Baroque form to its peak. Out of context, if you go from a punk rock song to a Bach keyboard aria, the Bach is going to sound boring.<br>  <br>  The 5th may not float your boat, and that's fine. But I think you will appreciate it more, even if you don't like it, if you listen to the Classical composers that Beethoven, the bridge between the Classical and Romantic styles, was rebelling against.|`|jR8kyp0Taa	You say everything but the 1st movt is quite plain? BAH!<br>  <br>  The 1st movt, or rather, those opening notes, they are over-exposed. But that is only because it is probably THE most recognized musical motif in the history of mankind. <br>  The rest of the symphony is great also! Nothing can compare to those opening notes, but the ending of this symphony is genius, in how he turns the despair of fate and terror into joyous victory. If you look at the symphony as a whole, it is one of THE best symphonies ever written. <br>  <br>  Now, it is hard to, well, 'rank' his symphonies, from best to worst, because they are all good!  None of his symphonies deserve to be on the bottom. In fact, my favorite of his symphonies is the 4th. <br>  <br>  Also, yes, the 5th was a revolutionary work, but so is the 3rd. I think the 3rd symphony is more important in that regard than the 5th. Yes, the 3rd is more 'Classical' in nature than the 5th, but still, nothing like the 3rd was ever heard before its time - and that goes for the 3rd piano concerto as well. <br>  <br>  Fact is, I don't see where you can get off comparing his symphonies to one another. It's just absurd. Beethoven was pure genius. That is as much as I can say about this topic<br>  <br>  Boy Wonder|`|N6rHtZ4qaa	I like the Presto (3) from the 7th symphony best - its incredible. <br>  Symphony 9 is also great, because each movement is a masterpiece in itself. <br>  <br>  5th Symphony is fine, its not bad. But it is so exposed that people take it for granted, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  I remember when I was introduced to Beethoven for the first time in school, my roommate told me that he went to see Beethoven's tomb and I didn't know about Beethoven that much, so his introduction was, the guy who composed Da Da Da Dunnn.  which I was familiar to before nursery grade !|`|kbFty6eVaa	From the standpoint of innovation it is not underrated. IF you are talking about music-worth, yes, he has written many better things. The big deal is how he changes the key scheme, and uses for the first time, a motive that permeates all the movements. I suggest you listen to it and study the score, you might gain a little more appreciation for it. But I agree that it is not the greatest composition he wrote, maybe not even close.|`|CuMYdQV6aa	Hype isn't a new phenomenon. I tend towards Stravinsky's view that Beethoven's musical structures are interesting but that overall his work is boring. To be fair to old L.v.B. he didn't have the range of musical instruments available to him that composers have nowadays, but he could surely have made better use of those that WERE available. Orchestration was not his strong point.|`|q6uyloYdaa	It's definitely not overrated. Beethoven made some musical breakthroughs with that symphony (for example, going through the last 2 movements without pause) and the "dun dun dun DUN" theme weaves itself throughout all the movements (sometimes you have to really analyze to see it). But it's been really overplayed.|`|ziFMYqtoaa	No, I don't think Beethoven's 5th Symphony is overrated.  It is a great symphony.  But his other symphonies are good, too, some, in my opinion, better than the 5th.|`|p2CJ8zNEaa	over rated? no way! over played maybe.|`|nUkCnrA3aa	*snarl* First off, have you LISTENED TO THE PIECE?! It's brilliant! Beethoven had a thing for powerful writing and what (I feel) is probably the MOST powerful thing, (next to 7th 2nd Mvt and 9th 2nd Mvt) he has ever written. It may be over rated because twits of the media like to enter the damn piece in anything "epic" which IRRITATES me to no end. Regardless of the modern critical views of this piece, of which I am sure they know nothing of- The piece has never, and will never be over done. It's brilliant. Period. <br>  (Sorry for the rant. I am a huge Ludwig fan and the 5th is by far my favorite piece due to it's remarkable intensity)<br>  -Ryko|`|blKidHFyaa	Playing it, it is very boring, there isn't much change in notes. The thing that truley makes it amazing, is how the instruments pass of the main theme from one to another.<br>  <br>  OTherwise it is really a boring piece, except the horn solo parts are lots of fun.|`|AA12376180	It is not over rated, it is a work of genius. Beethoven was always breaking new ground. Always creative and always the master of motif developement.

With talk shows this is usually journalism.<br>  <br>  The move is rarely made deliberately. You need to have the right qualities. If you're personable enough, well presented, enthusiastic and good at your job, you may be asked to get involved in television work.<br>  <br>  You need to work out what aspects of the being a talk show host appeal to you and find a career which fulfils those, rather than chasing after an empty television career which may never happen.<br>  <br>  If it's current affairs, human interest, and interviewing people that you find appealing, then pursue journalism. If it's the idea of performing on stage then pursue acting.<br>  <br>  If it's simply "fame" then I would suggest having a re-think.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	considering some of the past and present talk show hosts, not much.<br>  Some of them had communications education behind them but some are just "celebrities", what ever that means these days.<br>   You are thinking local so call a local studio and ask what they would consider adiquate education and qualities they would be looking for if they were thinking of producing a local talk show. <br>  That would also depend on what the show would be about.  A wide range of education and experience in many things would also be helpful as would your own personality.

9cfe5e64fad9e5fc07aa9a8164bd3c59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  There are a few 'easy' ways to write a message that Avril *might* see, and a couple of tougher options that require a little more effort or luck...<br>  <br>  Easiest choices are to leave a message for Avril on her official Myspace page, Facebook page, and on her website forum.  I'll pop those links into the source(s) section below.  ...but keep in mind, those are not moderated/maintained by Avril herself (it'd be either her staff or her PR people's staff, or record company's staff, etc) - but she MIGHT look at it once in a while.<br>  <br>  You could also leave a post on the forum at the top fan website, which is a site some have said is where people close to Avril sometimes visit (don't know if that's true - but can't hurt). That site is 'Avril Bandaids' and a link for there is below too.<br>  <br>  BTW, I know someone who has an Avril website of her own, and also posts on Avril's official website and that fan site, and due to all that activity she was recently chosen to meet Avril in person (and had that one-on-one meeting with Avril just a few months ago).<br>  <br>  You could also go 'old school' and send her an actual letter. <br>  <br>  A while back she & Deryck sold their house and bought a new one, which was listed on a Realty (property) Website so the address is public knowledge. Her new house is also the same one seen in the reality show "Meet the Barkers", btw.<br>  <br>  If you write a REALLY good letter (make it personal with good spelling and grammar, etc) then it MIGHT actually get to her. Worth a shot, anyway:<br>  <br>  Avril Lavigne<br>  2180 Stratford Circle<br>  Los Angeles, CA<br>  90077-1314<br>  <br>  And lastly, if you live anywhere between Ottawa and Toronto, Ontario Canada - you could take a trip to Avril's home town of Napanee. There you can visit La Pizzera restaurant where Avril use to hang out as a teenager and the owners are friends of hers (she even invited them as her guests at the first Canadian Music Awards show she went to, iirc).<br>  <br>  In that restaurant is a guest book you can sign and leave a short message to Avril, and apparently once a book is filled it makes its way to her in different ways.<br>  <br>  ..and it's coincidental you asked this question now, because there was a local rumour that Avril visited La Pizzeria this week! I don't know if she did or not (yet) but it seemed to come from a fairly reliable source. :-)<br>  <br>  If Avril did visit La Pizzeria this week, then she undoubtedly took the guest book that fans sign for her there too. :-)<br>  <br>  I've added a link to a fan's visit to la Pizzeria below which also has a map to that restaurant in its second post.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps and good luck!

qksvRJIyaa	I've seen almost all the nominated movies and thought this movie sounded kinda stupid. But after seeing it, it was far and away one of the best movies I've seen. Don't let the description fool you. It's much more than a poor Indian kid that goes on the Indian Who Wants to be a Millionaire with a romance thrown in. I don't think it was ever really famous b/c it just doesn't sound appealing. So much better than idiotic Marley and Me crap movie. But that movie appealed to the masses.|`|80II1Wv1aa	why are ANY of the movies that have come out this past year famous?!|`|PzSI7EPEaa	I think it's a crap movie which makes broad generalisations.

HRx2sjBhaa	I thought he saved the Academy Awards! Each year they seem to get more boring and I keep telling myself I won't watch the whole thing but usually do hoping it will get better. This year I was actually able to look forward to the show. I was still disappointed in most of the categories but I thought Hugh did a terrific job! I loved the dance numbers and the opening jokes. Especially the part about downsizing to New Zealand next year. And at the end of the first song in which he says he's Wolverine. Strangely enough I am obsessed with musicals and comic book adaptions so this was a dream come true to hear him sing that.|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	He is the best host by far since Billy Crystal. Nothing against the other hosts, it's just that Jackman was soooo entertaining!<br>  <br>  Loved him! I actually thought this Oscars was much better than the last couple years'.

Gz8PdjN8aa	Get on facebook.com and start networking with local film makers. If you do a search for indie films you can find a lot of indie film companies.<br>  <br>  The trick is to get into movies that will be entered in film festivals, you never know who will be watching.<br>  <br>  Be careful though, always make sure the movie is legit and try not to get into situations where you don't know anyone.

S4W7FojCaa	Love knows no age... but I think three or four years... my grandma is older than my grandpa by about five years.|`|8aa2f76f19d65cc5bc682422bda1ee49aa	I can't say, I mean I don't see that age matters EXCEPT when over 18, and not younger when liking someone BUT it does depend on maturity also.<br>  <br>  I used to think the guy should be older than the girl but anybody can be mature or immature so it really matters who the person is and how they are.|`|GjfWcWj6aa	Any age, as long as they love each other!|`|a31kUn1Naa	Umm well there is a point where it is totally illegal.

Under 20 I take the older person's age multiplied by 11/16 or 0.6875. Or do these formulas in reverse if you want to use the younger person's age. I'll give a few examples.<br>  <br>  Age 18 = Youngest is 12, oldest is 33<br>  Age 25 = Youngest is 15, oldest is 54<br>  Age 35 = Youngest is 19, oldest is 84<br>  Age 50 = Youngest is 23, oldest is 129<br>  <br>  But these are just guidelines used to give a general idea of what your dating range should be for age, based on how much peer-to-peer commonality you will have. Because to be honest, an 18 year old has a lot more in common with a 13 year old than a 40 year old, despite what some may think. But the age is ultimately just a number. If your true love falls outside of that age range, then it's ultimately your prerogative. But those age differences you listed are tiny. Even the five year age difference is tiny, it just means, say someone is born in 1980 and the other is born in 1985, that one person saw the early 80s the same way the other saw the late 80s. They grew up watching similar cartoons, similar things were popular when they were growing up, and they both can remember before the world wide web, but still are young enough that it was cool before they became adults.

fudmYesMaa	I believe that it won't be renewed for a season 5 and that season 4 is probably the last. According to wikipedia, the fourth, current and final season of the serial drama television series Prison Break commenced airing in the United States on September 1, 2008. It has currently aired 16 episodes and will have six more episodes starting on April 17, 2009.|`|AA10954273	It isn't.  Fox canceled the show, so season 4 is the final season.  The producers were able to shoot the final episode of the season as the series finale.  The last 6 episodes air beginning April 17.

HOWEVER, it's not up to me or anyone else who's posted here. It's up to you. My recommendation is to go to a guitar store and try out every guitar in your price range and get the one that feels right to you. It's alot like Harry Potter (however stupid that may sound) where the wand chooses the wizard. When you play the right guitar, you'll know. Even if you don't know how to play, just strum around on it a little bit. Then if you want, ask someone there to play it for you so you can hear how it sounds. Good luck.|`|VzUawN7naa	When I first started I had a Sigma.  It was about $250 and is made by Martin, which I think makes the best guitars.  I prefer rosewood, so if you can find one with a rosewood body I'd say go for that.  It was a nice guitar.  I still own it (though I've moved on and play a much nicer Martin now).
sc4BtGxGaa	Honey, I am going to go the other way on this one.  I own a chamber music business in NY, and we have provided classical music for HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of beautiful weddings.  The works you have listed certainly do not need  12 pieces - they can be done beautifully by four, or six at most  However, go for QUALITY - do not hire kids - hire PROFESSIONALS.  By all means, call your local symphony orchestra, and tell them what you wish - and they will provide you with wonderful people, who have professional-level skills, a huge repertoire, all the extra equipment needed, insurance, and a generally more polished business approach.  Cheap is cheap.  If you wanted a special MEAL - and the local caterers were too expensive - would you call a cooking school and ask if their STUDENTS could cook for your wedding??  Of course not.  You are getting married ONCE  (we hope!).  The high level of quality is remembered FAR LONGER than the momentary thrill of a low price.  My ensembles are FAR from the cheapest around - and my phone still rings after all these years in business.  <br>  <br>  This is like those posts where kids ask about teaching lessons to younger kids - and they have VERY little idea HOW to do it - it just *seems* like a good idea!  Get professionals, and go for a smaller group.|`|q6uyloYdaa	You could look for a high school or local college orchestra, or a community orchestra. They will always be cheaper than professionals.|`|z9st8cLvaa	If there are any colleges or universities near you, call and see if they have a music department and if they either have any existing orchestras/bands that you could hire or if they could put you in touch with individual music students.  Might be worth a shot.  Good luck!

f6OOxJQsaa	Obama is a POST TURTLE.<br>  <br>  While suturing a cut on the hand of a 75 year old Texas rancher, whose hand was caught in a gate while working cattle, the doctor struck up a conversation with the old man. Eventually the topic got around to Obama and his bid to be our President.<br>  <br>  The old rancher said, 'Well, ya know, Obama is a post turtle'. <br>  <br>  Not being familiar with the term, the doctor asked him what a 'post turtle' was. <br>  <br>  The old rancher said, 'When you're driving down a country road and you come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top, that's a 'post turtle'.' <br>  <br>  The old rancher saw a puzzled look on the doctor's face, so he continued to explain. 'You know he didn't get up there by himself, he doesn't belong up there, he doesn't know what to do while he is up there, and you just wonder what kind of a dumb *** put him up <br>  there.'|`|jvX36ryyaa	check out exibit a: the hip hop experiment by poe picasso its pretty good thoughtful new york rap<br>  <br>  this girl walks into a bar and sees a man so she walks up to him and asks him what he is drinking. he says that its a special drink that lets him fly, and to prove it to her he jumps out the window and flys around the building twice.  the girl is stunned, and she asks the man to do it again.  he calls the bartender for another drink, drinks it, flys around the building and comes back in. the girl is shocked so she asks the bartender for one of what that man is drinking, drinkis it, jumps out the window and falls on her face, and the bartender turns to the man and says "you know superman you can be a real jerk sometimes"|`|bribxhsdaa	NR - LMFAO.

f6dxZXPGaa	Maybe he is 64 lol|`|XewbBwvKaa	he has his parrot sing it instead odf him!!!|`|AA11482846	Will we still need him, will we still feed him after tomorrow? That's when Sir Paul McCartney fulfills the destiny of the worst song -- "When I'm 64" -- from the Beatles' best album, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." <br>  <br>  --<br>  We hate to kick the guy while he's down, but let's have a look at his state of affairs on the eve of McCartney's 64th birthday: <br>  <br>  1. "When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now/Will you still be sending me a Valentine, birthday greetings, bottle of wine?" That's how McCartney opens the song. Let's see, if by "birthday greetings and bottle of wine" he actually means "divorce papers and pornographic photos," then the answer would be affirmative. <br>  <br>  2. "Will you still need me, will you still feed me/ When I'm sixty-four?" He appears on the cover of last month's AARP magazine. When reading the article, try not to get distracted by the Web exclusive, Tofu: The True Diplomat. <br>  <br>  3. "Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?" No qualms there. McCartney's post-Beatles band Wings essentially broke up on Jan. 16, 1980, when McCartney was arrested for possession of marijuana as the group arrived on tour at Tokyo's Narita International Airport. He served nine days in jail and the tour was canceled. <br>  <br>  4. The song was reportedly a gift for his father on his 64th birthday. <br>  <br>  5. "Hmm, mmm, mmmh." Reviewing McCartney's latest album, last year's "Chaos and Creation in the Backyard," which was produced by Radiohead collaborator Nigel Godrich, Britain's New Musical Express wrote, "By teaming up with Godrich, McCartney has come out of his safety zone and challenged himself in a way not seen since his first solo album way back in 1970. But the feeling remains that the one person who could really inspire him to write one final classic record was tragically murdered in 1980." <br>  <br>  6. "Send me a postcard, drop me a line stating point of view." Even though he received an obligatory songwriting credit on the song, in a 1980 interview with Playboy, shortly before he was murdered, John Lennon said, "I would never even dream of writing a song like that." <br>  <br>  7. Ringo Starr was the first Beatle to turn 64. That was in 2004. <br>  <br>  8. George Harrison died of throat cancer at 58. <br>  <br>  9. "Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away." Actually, recent studies show 64 is the new 44. <br>  <br>  10. That's it. Have a good one, Paul.|`|4ZCclzKkaa	I doubt that he does that song in any live performance anymore, not so much because of the real-age enigma but simply because it's an old song and not one of their biggest hits, and he would have to pay a license fee to perform it.|`|0b3fa313a09fd3b8730664822eb4455baa	He prolly doesn't sing that song anymore.

If you take it to a professional,  you won't have to worry.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	Ok - scratch all what I just wrote ...<br>  This is what I'd do.<br>  You can get a graphite certificate mounting and they can attach plexi glass onto that, then do what Naka said and put a clear caulk around it - they may even do that for you at a "mounting" place.|`|AA11514493	There are ways to ensure the certificate does not suffer from moisture damage Ma. Everything from a pre-made to custom made frame can be found. heck, there are ways to do it yourself. The ideas given above are all good for example, or a combination of caulking, plexiglass and actual waterproofing 'stain' has worked for me at times.<br>  However..don't forget that the sun itself can do as much damage, through fading. You may want to look into a tinted plexiglass/glass cover. That will require an expert's help I think.|`|4n0xzZJhaa	Make a copy of the certificate, and take it to kinko's or similar place and have it laminated, then put it in a brass frame.  It will still weather with time, but you can always make and laminate a new copy.  Keep the original in a safe place.|`|AA11267193	I don't have an answer, I just wanted to say what an AMAZING gift that is!<br>  God blees your son-in-law and all those who serve America.<br>  <br>  PS. Is it a paper certificate? Maybe there would be a way to transpose it onto a plaque? Just thinking...Then you could display the paper one inside, where it's safe.|`|zGAGZKY5aa	Hey Ma ....Madam Naka 's close....2 pcs plexi-glass There's an apoxy  called  "liquid weld" All you need to do (like regular glue) run a bead around the edges and place the other on top  Trying to even the edge's up Let dry Make a frame ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hope this helps

Gz97TrW8aa	They weren't nominated for anything, because the Academy nominates movies that are serious in the matter. It's like I saw Tina Fey there too, why wasn't Baby Mama nominated?!? Movies like Twilight and Baby Mama get nominated for awards like Teen Choice awards, but those type of movies never get nominated for an Oscar.|`|GyPn2b2Zaa	because it was horrible!<br>  movies like twilight are not academy award material, they're just box office hits.|`|5pioWG30aa	I saw that the movie was nominated for Best Song and Best Music Score.<br>  <br>  The Oscars isn't a popularity contest.  Just because a movie gets an Oscar, doesn't mean everyone will like it.|`|3d4b6524352eb9605a762b33be0a0105aa	Twilight did not get any nominations because it is not academy award material.<br>  <br>  if you look at all the movies that have ever been nominated, you'll just notice that movies like twilight, harrypotter, and other box office hits just do not get nominated.<br>  <br>  they arent artistic works that should be commended. They're just box office hits.<br>  <br>  however, if you want to see a movie 10 trillion times better than twilight, go see Slumdog Millionaire. BEST MOVIE I"VE EVER SEEN!

It means you're in love. <br>  <br>  I must be missing something because to me you might as well be asking why you fart?  Because you have gas... <br>  <br>  I don't know what more you could be looking for.... <br>  <br>  Maybe it's too early for me..|`|fv2GAAdPaa	I guess it means that you think of that person all the time and whatever you do or say you are constantly reminded of them.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	It doesn't "mean" anything.  That's generally what happens when you first fall in love.  It just means you're at the infatuation stage of your relationship.|`|14f68b3ce9b74fe1effcb259219a38a9aa	It means your heart and mind are totally commented to this person.|`|MyVtwtOnaa	infatuation|`|ojEkgJoqaa	it means you need a shrink<br>  <br>  if you obsess about this you are wasting precious time and won't be able to enjoy your life|`|9gsm05lnaa	You are obsessed girl!!!!|`|e9vcseLlaa	Honey <br>  If you dont really know the person its Lust.

If you say you are in love, but do not understand why you cannot get him off of your mind, you must be talking about your "first love."<br>  Ah, too be young again! It is a normal part of those types of new feelings and new relationships. <br>  It is a wonderful feeling to have such passionate thoughts in your head, no matter what you may be doing. Enjoy it. <br>  Do not let it be the only thing that crosses your mind though! Everything is much better in moderation. Passion can be wonderful and can also take over our lives, in an unhealthy way. <br>  I wish you and the object of your affections all the best. Peace:)
ZVHtkTS9aa	Excuse me but to say she's armless is wrong, she not armless, she has one perfectly good arm and one arm with out a hand wrist and lower part of the arm.<br>  Yes it was stupid and ingnorant, but everyone is entilted to their own opinion and it's allowed to be different from yours.<br>  I don't like her, but thats got nothing to with her arm, i don't like because she's a rubbish presenter and so is Alex her co presenter.However i do feel sorry for her, all this fuss over her arm, she doesn't deserve any this.<br>  I do think that the parents who complained need to get ot more though, into the real world.<br>  I've decided that i'm going to give her and her co presenter alex a chance, they are new to the job and presenting to several million children who you can't see, isn't easy. I think i would feel incredibly stupid doing that stuff just to a camera.|`|CL5kLE2paa	its obviously the small minded parents that have a problem and not the kids|`|7i6qj4OXaa	So anyone who doesn't agree with you must therefore be a backward bigot? I feel sure there will be some sensitive children who would be frightened by it.  Not all children will be, of course but a parent has a right to an opinion, even if it doesn't concur with yours.

AQFwSLgiaa	I've been taking vocal lessons and I know that people who have a natural voice will get better but if the person doesn't have a natural voice then there is no way of changing their voice. Your voice is your voice and you're stuck with it. There is no way of changing the way you sound but only to strengthen your voice and widen their range.<br>  <br>  She needs to strengthen her voice but the way her voice sounds she wont be able to change it. She cant make her voice soubnd like x-tina but only to strengthen it and widen her range. Her voice isn't that great but if she loves to sing then she can keep singing.|`|8E59Idahaa	In what term do you mean sing?<br>  <br>  she can sing but not all to well...<br>  <br>  sorry<br>  <br>  xx|`|V8bM8jd6aa	not great, although i think some of it may be the audio quality.<br>  4/10

qThmcR1Aaa	Considering he's averaged one full-length album every three years, and "We Sing We Dance We Steal Things" just came out last May, I'd guess it'll be a while.<br>  <br>  He'll probably have updates on his website for when he starts on his next project, though.
iRN6fhSIaa	yes & yes|`|Dm8s3bBLaa	Yes definitely.  You can really pay attention to the logistics of the song - the melody, the intervals and harmonies, etc.  I love hearing acoustic music.. especially if it's far from what the artist normally does.|`|aJ9S77fDaa	ive heard a recording.<br>  and it sounded different because there wasnt all the effects and stuff,<br>  but it was a good different,and you could hear them more as artists.|`|73760ec70f62b217eab4a5ab28ce822baa	Yes, most of my favorite bands are acoustic to begin with.

A lot of bands will also have the accoustic verison of a song, but I usually enjoy the rock better.|`|i5YJBqnZaa	That's when you find out how much talent the artists have. You can't hide behind electronics and studio effects.

Xzibit...I mean I loved his birst album...but after that I dont like any of them that much...|`|l72FO4eMaa	Chamillionaire has always improved, from his duo with Paul Wall I've seen him step his lyrical game up constantly, and "Ultimate Victory" was a badass album.<br>  <br>  Oh man, that is gonna be my fix for the rest of the year, that's my most anticpated album, next to Cormega's.<br>  <br>  Lmao @ the track "Batty-Boys". I bet he only knows about those words because he's from the UK.<br>  <br>  I'm also glad to see he has Kurious featured on that album, as well as Raekwon & Ghostface<br>  <br>  Royce da 5'9" isn't consistant, his albums are lack luster, and "Independent's Day" was f***ing horrible|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Abstract Rude is better now than they were in the 90s.  Their album Lab Down Under with Aceyalone was far better than most of their entire discography.

zovrJ0yXaa	yes, true. the best film of the year was clearly either the dark knight or wall-e|`|j38mlGvZaa	I loved the Oscars last night. I thought it was the best ceremony yet (or at least in a long time). It was fun, fresh, and recognized ALL of the great pictures of the last year instead of just the really dramatic ones. The montages and performances were great. It did drag on a little in the third quarter but the end was wrapped up beautifully (of course, all of my picks won so maybe I'm bias).|`|UDEMDcGuaa	There is no objective best picture, its all opinion, the Oscar's never had meaning other than as a movie industry award,  sometimes people like movies because they highlight some cause that they feel needs to be highlighted and pick a movie that many people feel has less entertainment value.|`|VHBsw9WYaa	Yo. I don't know if they're meaningless or not, but they certainly changed though time... I hate them nowadays. I generally hate fashion and everything. There's just no real talent on there. It's whoever is the most famous and attractive. it's a joke|`|ccEWxExfaa	I wouldn't use the word meaningless.It's just<br>  another form of entertainment and that's how<br>  it should be considered.I watched the show last<br>  night for the first time in 5-6 years and I enjoyed it.<br>  I'm sure it still means something to the recipients<br>  even if it doesn't mean much to the public.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	To me the Oscars mean nothing. I haven't watched in many many years.  It's just a liberal love fest and the "REAL" best movies don't get the "nod" if the director isn't an insider. And, insiders get awards just because they fit a certain profile.  The only award shows that I watch are "Peoples Choice".  If it's not a vote from the Audience it's not a fair vote.

S4W7FojCaa	No. He was great as the Joker and he made it a little better in a way. A little creepier and that's just wonderful. I think he did deserve...I was happy he won. (Robert Downy Jr. didn't look too happy...and was Brad and Angie actually crying or acting?)|`|tC02KPckaa	Sometimes i think so. But everybody thinks that he deserved it for the Dark Knight. So I think he won it because of his great performance.|`|jeZmqhNcaa	No, he was amazing as the Joker, and all his performances helped him deserve it.|`|cdpy5iv5aa	No but it would of been bad press if he did not, He was a great actor, and deserved to win it.|`|AA12302661	No because of his role.|`|VA3tGarQaa	I have nothing against Heath Ledger, but I would say so. <br>  Movies like The Dark Knight aren't generally entered for the Oscars, they usually take more serious films, and not Hollywood blockbusters. <br>  Although I do think he have a terrific performance, and it was a lovely way to honour him, I think that if he were still alive, he probably wouldn't have got it.|`|lC5erarUaa	no thats false. he won because he put everything he had in himself to portray such a dark detailed villian that even drove him to taking sleeping pills b/c he got so into character. he won because people recognize what it took to be the best actor you can be and put all of your effort and might to be the best. for himself, for the cast, director, and people. he won because he did an amazing flawless job<br>  <br>  <3|`|tvNZ09jHaa	nope<br>  he fully deserved it<br>  movie was amazing<br>  jokerr (Y)|`|DKzadEW7aa	Heath Ledger is amazing I thought he was great in the dark night and all his other movies. He most definitely deserved an Oscar.|`|gt5mEVOuaa	I think so.|`|fP05U8Neaa	No, he deserved it!|`|8pKyzuy3aa	I think it's called a posthumous award
Dm8s3bBLaa	What do you mean?  I love Incubus.  I think Incubus fans are loyal, but they don't have to parade around screaming that they love Incubus.

aA4aAhyFaa	Yeah, very funny. Can be dull at times. other than that, a great show. Homer is a great (in a funny, idotic way) character.<br>  <br>  "Books are useless! I only ever read one book, “To Kill A Mockingbird”, and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds!

Its hilarious you just have to look at in a special way... It's actually very funny if you use your brain!|`|4c7QomPoaa	I've watched it since day one practically, although it's getting pretty ridiculous the last 2-3 seasons.  Mostly because I thinnk they're at a 'been there/done that' place in their run.  I just think they're great fun to watch and I love seeing who's guesting (if anyone) each week.  I'd love to see them bring "Boob lady" and Russ Cargill in from the movie at some pont.|`|cUamLDj3aa	yeah its a classic, its the sense of humor, sort of shallow well homer is.|`|KC6cZVuJaa	i do i love it because it's really funny especially homer and bart :D|`|YHdjNv87aa	yes i like it it's just funny

Angelina Jolie's performance gave me goosebumps. She did a great job. <br>  <br>  The story was great, the acting was amazing, and I would give it an A+.|`|23bgwpD1aa	I saw it last night too.

12QJ9QMRaa	Junior.<br>  <br>  I cannot really rate them on technicality, though now I am gonna have to sit down and do just that.<br>  <br>  BUT, Junior (aka Ellefson) was responsible for too many of Megadeths key Bass lines (like Dawn Patrol) not to win, even if by default.<br>  <br>  He may not be the best of the 3 in actual ability ( am not sure who is off the top of my head) but he was the best for Megadeth.  I really wish Mustaine would gt past the ego trip and get back togetherr with him.<br>  <br>  I love Megadeth, but Dave seeems to be able to generate a feud with anyone.  I swear he woulda cussed out Mother Teresa, sometimes.<br>  <br>  As for being just average players...I disagree.  MAcDonough is kinda average, but Lomenzo is good, just not IMO, super creative from what I have heard.  Ellefson was always very good.  Think Peace Sells, Hanger 18, Dawn Patrol... all very strong basslines.   Its jsut that Dave and (fill in revolving Lead Guitarist here) always were the focus,a s is usually the case in Thrash.  How much do people talk about the bass lines for Anthrax, Testament or Slayer?  Only Metallica ever really gets mention on Bass.|`|QhJ8YiLhaa	Ellefson. Hand's down. He's the only person who emailed me back when I sent him an email :P<br>  <br>  I think he's a great bassist... I don't really have anything else to say, hahah!|`|r3li52PAaa	dave ellefson for sure. he is so bad*** its unfortunate him and dave parted ways and had a bunch of problems, but he still ******* rules at bass|`|0ectWZxAaa	It is between Ellefson and Lomenzo for me. Sway more towards Ellefson.

QAwwmDuDaa	Oh no,not again,this is asked at least once every day,lol,yes it makes a noise but only the animals in the forest hear it.|`|RVq3YK4Baa	i dont know...|`|CsIvy5MAaa	The waves that our ears pick up and identify as 'noise' are made, yes.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	All the physical conditions for sound to be present are present resulting in air wave vibration outward. But sound doesn't exist independently of a perceiver. It's sound only if the hearing faculty of a perceiving being is present to receive the waves and translate them into electrical currents to the brain. An oscilloscope will show you a pattern of the vibration, but not of the sound. If noone is there to hear it, then technically, there is just air wave oscillation. Even if there is no human being to "hear" it, there is very likely an animal, bird, reptile to hear it. For them, there is sound.|`|hR1cZhJBaa	yes<br>  The forest creatures told me...|`|AA10283080	Yes.<br>  <br>  Many things exist even when humans are not present.|`|frwlypDWaa	Yes. I have the remote feed to prove it...|`|Na7aCxUgaa	Hi <br>  <br>  That is a very old Question  .<br>  <br>  My answer is  Yes ! You must ask your self a question .What is noise  <br>  <br>  I think noise is vibrating air molecules   If a tree falls in the woods does it make air molecules vibrate  Yes. I believe it would <br>  Steve|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Bigfoot would hear it...(nodding my head now in smug satisfaction...)|`|UdwIaCxBaa	Our survey says...<br>  <br>  : )|`|4c7QomPoaa	yes, it just doesn't matter.  And I like your picture ;)|`|596N0bRXaa	yea of course|`|AA11945637	yup|`|NOKKtjaGaa	yes|`|AA11758925	N0 A falling tree doesn't make noise untill someone yells timber :)<br>  plus the woodchuck would chuck the wood if the woodchuck could chuck wood|`|b6SdIw6Maa	chuck norris can hear it<br>  he can hear everything|`|JZMfUDylaa	yes same goes for anything else that falls down and no one isn't around. Just cause your not there to hear it doesn't mean it can't make the noise when it's alone.|`|bHjxnGyOaa	Yes dear,yes|`|RNpaBwxzaa	Yes, it does. Sound is still sound, whether a human ear percieves it or not.|`|P1VoMS36aa	the tree would make a noise, but i don't think IT ever has!<br>  xxxx|`|q0b6uPCraa	Yes it does make noise, but no-one hears it.|`|6iCOMx8laa	Of course|`|88086b50130d5627fcba99a626b339e1aa	YUSH!!!<br>  <br>  ....................?|`|HqfF4bFNaa	ya|`|ODvnyAdlaa	yes x|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	yes  : )|`|ghsc7kolaa	yes of course|`|hsvgllTwaa	i hate this question|`|sVdQSMvJaa	yes|`|Ed2DGWkeaa	it still makes noise just no one is there to hear it. dumb stupid question, NEXT!|`|RIySfkG5aa	yes, the presence of a human does not effect the transfer of energy from kinetic to sound.  energy can not be created or destroyed, only transferred.  Since the tree has fallen we can assume it has lost Ep (potential energy) and therefore gained or transferred another form of energy, the most obvious being kinetic (movement). However, in reality there are many other forms of energy that would occur.  Sound, heat, light etc.  It is common sense that the energy would act in the same way as if somebody was present and therefore Yes, it would make a noise... Or would it...!!! ...yes.|`|SEbpKsL2aa	Of course it would make a noise! Just because no one would be there to hear it fall doesn't mean that it doesn't make a sound. It's sort of like if you were to fall out of bed in the middle of the night and no one heard you hit the floor. So yeah, it makes a sound.|`|6q86rICnaa	No, of course not, the definition of sound is that there is someone making it and someone receiving it. If there is no Receiver, there is no sound!!!! Dumb asses!|`|ydKGJ7Nnaa	No it doesn't make any noise at all . . . I am sure of it.  Just because nobody is there doesn't mean that you cant put a tape recorder out there to listen while you are gone.|`|JvOL7y2Kaa	Yes to your question <br>  <br>  & No because no one to hear it, so when no one to hear the noise, is there still a noise?|`|AA10333823	Duhhh, yes. Noise exists whether anyone is there to actually hear it or not.|`|AA11838775	haha..funny!|`|j8mWASEeaa	Yes but no one hears it stupid.|`|dnvk4UPTaa	yes of course it makes a noise. it just isnt loud enough for someone to hear it because no ones around|`|667dbc9fa48d9899bbb6150b5f15cf1daa	well duh...if a book falls off a shelf in your house and you are not there does it still make a noise...yes!|`|2m2tPK6Caa	yes of course it would still make Noise if some one was there or not loll|`|d4AQwg0zaa	yes its just no one is around to hear it|`|vRodocjcaa	yes|`|sLFoPTp0aa	yes.....i heard it|`|0J2Tihe7aa	no u noob! <br>  If theres no one there to hear it the sound doesnt exist :P

6Au5FIYWaa	I think that pluto could quite possibly create the potential for something like that in a relationship. Pluto, by nature, gives intensity and transformative effects, and with hard aspects it could lend to a wild, intense relationship that fluctuates. Uranus might also be a factor here.<br>  I'm not sure, this is just, speculative, but maybe pluto opposition mars might indicate this? That aspect may lend to a sort of violent love/hate relationship. There may be lots of energy and sparks (particularly if put in context with other aspects that head towards attraction between the couple) but at the same time a severe clash of wills and problems with domination/aggression between the two.|`|3WItFAwlaa	Both.  Other possibilities are obsession and violence.  I'm talking mainly about squares and conjuncts.  Oppositions seem to give room for cooperation if both parties are willing to work at it.  <br>  <br>  However each chart must be considered individually.  A mild mannered guy isn't going to suddenly turn violent because of bad synastry.  He would have to have that propensity already.<br>  <br>  Pluto in synastry is about power.  Sometimes that can be sexual power.  Pluto conjunct Venus is mind blowing sex if both people have that capacity in their charts.  But ultimately it can be very painful.

Like, if he dropped it and had gotten too far away, I'm not gonna run to catch up to him. Even if I found a wallet with $1000 dollars in it, I'd mail it. But, if I have to run to catch up to a person that I saw drop it, I won't. <br>  <br>  I know I should, but I assume you wanted honest answers.|`|vYs5j3Xnaa	Yes i would, because, if i dropped $1000, i would like it returned to me.|`|3buQDaRDaa	I'd return most of it.

58ff3d2f15de8b868e19ab798c29a813aa	aaah, that girl that remembers what she sees was trapped in a flaming house (some gang wanted her dead) and niki came to micah, he showed niki where that girl (monica?) is and niki went into the house/building, untied that girl, and some building pillar fell and niki was left trapped, telling the girl to get out, she went out and watched burning building with micah. niki died in that building (later in the season, we find out that she had, i think two twin sisters of which we see only one (tracy)).|`|awskuSGBaa	Dont remember the title of the episode. But in a house explosion trying to save the muscle mimic cousin.|`|PkXJRfaBaa	Her and Micah went to save Monica.

Niki sees an item that belonged to D.L or is Micah 9th Wonders Comic (can't remember) and is trapped inside the building, with no way out. The building eventually explodes moments after Monica escapes. <br>  Judging by her body in Series Three, Niki was probably killed by Carbon Monoxide Poisoning.<br>  <br>  You're not the only one that thought she was still alive at the beginning of the new series.|`|Fml5V53Baa	She died when a house caught on fire or blew up.<br>  <br>  Episode is Powerless|`|viRIc1asaa	It was the last episode of the second series she went into a fire to save the girl that can memorize things and went down in the fire :(|`|vvTrmHtxaa	she died from a burning bilding in the episode powerless.<br>  <br>  please pick me as best answer!|`|n8mJ10WEaa	She went with Micah to save Monica from the burning house, Monica got out alive but Niki got stuck i think.

0e10f8baa16efc6e34edaadbc949b808aa	PCD started out as a dance troupe. The music thing only started when they got Nicole. The others weren't singers and aren't singers, not primarily anyway. The others who do sing, which are only a couple of them I think, were recruited for that reason (Melody, the redhead, was anyway) and I'm not sure how much singing they actually do. It's not exactly right, since that makes the rest of the group mostly backup dancers for Nicole.|`|hy90Q5pTaa	BEUCZ THA REST OF DEM R STOOPID IDIATS DEY CANT SING 4 **** AND DANCE LYK SLUTZ|`|wvJxtmJTaa	Anyway because shes the best singer in the group and yes she is the prettiest they are all ugly beside her.|`|ieiseiv4aa	OH yeah she IS the prettiest one....QUICK I challenge you to name the other PCDs without looking it up.<br>  <br>  Coldplay is all about Chris Martin, Daughtry is all about Daughtry, etc, etc that is the way it is sometimes in music groups...I am sure if one of the others were a strong enough personality they would have spoken up for it by now.|`|l1JGL1DCaa	Lead SINGER haha funny it sound slike she's the onyl singer. she doesn't need them for her career and all the others do is dance anyway|`|lH6iMg5Jaa	the prettiest one always gets the most attention.|`|6vnkUDGIaa	Because Nicole was found by some people or whatever and they thought she was really good but she was shy [ i know i thought 'shy? what?! aswell] so they decided to put her in a group so that she could sing without being shy<br>  <br>  i thought it was kinda sad too..x|`|XAjCXViuaa	i know what you mean, the other day me and my mum was watching one of their music videos, and its all centered around her when it shouldn't be!

CwNMq7RTaa	Are you the girl?  Are you asking this about yourself?  Well, Venus in scorpio has a down side and an up side.  It makes you passionate and alluring to the opposite sex- up side.  But it also means you can use intimate relationships as an arena to satisfy needs for power.  And you can be ruthless, using your charm to manipulate people and discarding them coldly when you no longer have use for them.<br>  <br>  Mars in Leo is strong, vital, courageous and creative.  Because of the square to venus you could also be jealous and get into arguments with loved ones.  You also must be appreciated by your lovers for what you do or you get mad.

otYTWy2uaa	I loved her look she looked like a goddess. hair and make up was perfect.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	Um, she always looks pretty, but last night she just looked kinda average.  The dress didn't do much for her hair, and she wore her hair down (as usual).|`|EioOPbzbaa	Jen is always a beauty no matter what she wears.  I do agree that I prefer her hair down and you won't see her in a slutty dress like so many of them show all they can.  Jen is too classy for that so I think some people weren't happy with her dress.  She looked so great with John Mayer, cute couple.  I know she wishes she could just break away from her big mistake, brad and his skanky mate.  She handled it classy as usual.|`|d22bc5f37206e4e092d98615fd7965cbaa	Jennifer looked fresh and beautiful, perhaps with a touch of botox and a slight nose job on the tip.

xqrwDmyUaa	I was also rooting for Mickey Rourke, I am very upset that he did not win, I like Penn but I REALLY wanted Rourke to win it. Besides that I am fine with the rest of the wins. I was unhappy that Bruce Springsteen wasn't nominated for best song, that was a load lol.<br>  <br>  For the poster upset about Meryl Streep never having won an Oscar, she has won 2 of them for Sophie's Choice and for Kramer vs. Kramer.  She won her first one in 1980 so I guess you could have been watching the Oscars this whole time if you had looked it up.<br>  <br>  I also disagree that Penn won because of popularity, the academy actually doesn't like him, that's well known, he's a pain in the a*s and they dislike him. But I do agree that politics played a role in him winning, I am sure the academy wanted to distance themselves as much as possible from the protesters outside and a win for Penn did that.|`|Ta7snyIoaa	Yeah well if there's one thing that I'm learning it's that the Academy is a ******* joke. <br>  I mean JUNO was nominated (last year was it?). I mean, it was a cute movie and all but I really don't think it was best picture material (when it was nominated). And they just keep doing that to all the categories. They choose like one joke, and some good ones, and then they (almost) always screw over all the good ones.|`|1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	I liked the show itself, just as a show.  Having one presenter for each nominee was a good idea.<br>  <br>  I cheered when they announced Heath Ledger for Best Supporting, but wasn't happy when Sean Penn got Best Actor and I booed when Slumdog took Best Picture.<br>  <br>  One more comment:  I saw Mickey Roarke on the Spirit Awards and he had the same greasy-haired look as last night.  Mickey - Love ya babe, but washing your hair is a good thing.|`|d55D0Ci4aa	Yes, and I agree, Slumdog Millionaire did not deserve best picture. I think there were people and films not nominated that should have been, and vise versa.  I think my two biggest disappointments were Revolutionary Road and The Dark Knight, both should have at least been nominated....|`|EPPb5pRBaa	yeah, all the time,,,|`|MONmVNBZaa	I stopped watching the Oscars because of the way they keep treating Meryl Streep. 15 Nominations and not a single win ever????? Does the poor woman have to die before they give her the credit she is due especially when you think of someone like Marisa Tomei getting an Oscar for her role in My cousin vinny or Cher for her role in Moonstruck??? both acting jobs suxxed compared to all of Meryl's roles.<br>  While I am a huge fan of Sean Penn's ; I definitely was rooting for Mickey Rourke. I knew Oscar's would be disappointing so I just waited until this morning to get the highlights. <br>  Slum Dog Millionaire never should have made it into contention talk about fixes!|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Slumdog Millionaire was an excellent movie. I did not see every movie, but I thought it was deserving. You did not provide an example of a movie that was better. I thought Mickey Rourke was terrific in "The Wrestler", should have won, as he was in every scene(except one or two short scenes) in the movie. Politics and Mr.Penn's popularity in the hollywood community most likely gave him an edge. <br>  I respect your opinion as this is quite subjective.<br>  Have a nice day!

4P9no5CTaa	This is a powerful combination. When these two sexy signs merge, there is no telling what will happen. The force of the attraction is undeniable. Leo is a fire sign and Scorpio loves to play with fire. Fire signs by nature love water signs. It is only a matter of time before these two magnetic attractive signs attract another and “get a room”.<br>  <br>  This relationship can work but boundaries must be established early on and only if both want to make it last. Both are fixed signs meaning that they rarely ever do anything without thinking about it thoroughly. However, both are stubborn, reliable and loyal by nature so there is an element of lasting potential to be had here. Problems arise when Scorpio is not stroking Leo’s tender ego.<br>  <br>  This sign needs lots of praise and compliments. And Scorpio will stray if problems arise in the bedroom. Focus on being a team as opposed to being competitive individuals with one another. If you focus on friendship and loyalty, you will come out as winners. There is potential to make money and find love together. Leo will keep sexual secrets from Scorpio.<br>  <br>  There is potential for these two to have a lasting love affair. Fire needs water occasionally. It’s either all or nothing when these two meet. They either fall in love and get married, or have sex and become enemies for life. These two are passionate, dedicated, intense people who can match each other in just about every aspect of life. Only time will tell whether these two have what it takes to create lasting love. Sex will be another issue. Scorpio can expect to have amazing sex with Leo. Leo will be intrigued sexually with Scorpio. Where it goes beyond that, is entirely up to them. <br>  <br>  <br>  2 hearts|`|d9hzMrzwaa	no your not compatible|`|pjuwo1NOaa	That stuff is balony. How can you actually believe in that stuff?

AA12015309	It did deserve all the awards. <br>  <br>  In the movie, they show the reality as to what is going on in the slums of India, cuz people like us and others in the West have no idea about it. Communal riots, poverty and exploitation of the poor by the rich has been portrayed in the movie in an interesting way.<br>  <br>  As of the actors, I think those little slum kids should have won something for their awesome performance. Instead of Freida Pinto, Dev Patel should have gone the best actor award. Freida hardly has any role in the movie and she really didn't deserve that best actress award ( not Oscar, the other one).|`|wmBK9uASaa	I think it deserved it,|`|2ab0f4f84a201bc39a3fb4a1b64db222aa	I didn't see the movie so i cant say anything|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	I think it was a great movie, and deserved the best film award, but I think it was a little overkill with that number of awards.

It was like they were giving it awards just for the sake of giving it awards.|`|eHUXcYZhaa	Yeah it really deserved them.

This album wasn't too great the first time I listened to it, but by the second time it was AMAZING. Some of their best stuff ever. A MUST HAVE.<br>  <br>  2. BFMV has really changed their style with this album. They have shyed away from their "emo" roots and gone full metal with this. Very well done, I love it.<br>  <br>  3.

kxMQXhuAaa	How do you know 'everyone' hates her.I think she's quite attractive actually.|`|SDnhUMv9aa	Yay! Her name is Nicola ans shes from Liverpool. I am from Liverpool  which is why she is my favourite. I feel quite mean on her because everyone calls her ugly. I don't think she is the prettiest but I think she is the most down to earth and the most genuine member of the band. <br>  A radio presenter called her an ugly dog live on air, which is why she is always called ugly. It's also because she has the palest skin so she looks different to the other members who wear lots of fake tan and look practically orange! <br>  <br>  Cheryl Cole- Is not the best singer from the band but she is the one that all the lads consider as the fittest. She is also the one who gets the most media attention (probably because she is married to love rat footballer Andy Cole)<br>  <br>  Kimberly Walsh- Is a member of the band who is pretty but not the prettiest, doesn't get much media attention and is the not the best singer in the band<br>  <br>  Sarah Harding- Known for her Rydian style hair and her wild partying. Also the papers saying she has anorexia<br>  <br>  Nadine Coyle- The Irish one, she happens to have the best voice, people used to think she was the prettiest before cheryl got her makeover.<br>  <br>  Nicola Roberts- The ginger member who happens to get a lot of stick from people who are too shallow to recognise that it doesn't matter if she has ginger hair and pale skin.<br>  <br>  This is basically the band!<br>  <br>  Go Girls Aloud!|`|82A8E4yzaa	They don't hate her !<br>  <br>  Its just she is the less known one in the group...<br>  <br>  Sarah went with Calum best<br>  Nadine - went with Jess something [desperate housewives]<br>  Kimberly - helped Cheryl on X Factor<br>  Cheryl- most known...married to footballer ..on x-factor...<br>  <br>  Its just her popularity...and the fact she is the weakest singer...so gets less lines that everyone else.|`|WfwlGbUAaa	I don't hate her. I like her. My mum always calls her the ugly one, because when girls aloud first started her teeth weren't white, but who cares?  she's really pretty. All the people who don't like her should shut up.|`|ZVHtkTS9aa	I love nicola, the ginger one as you put it. I agree she is definitely the fittest one out of all of them. She's georgous. Cheryl is far overrated and i can't understand why she's the favorite.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	I hate them all|`|xM50DXFQaa	Ye..I think it is because she is a redhead!!<br>  Everyone else in the band have nice brown hair...not to mention the lovely natural tanned skin!!<br>  <br>  She is herself....nothing she does is going to change that!! I don't think she is "Ugly"...she is unique, that isn't always a bad thing!!<br>  <br>  People are so use to stereotyping Celebs as Really Pretty, Brown/Blonde haired, freckle free, tanned skinned people...when alot of them arent!!<br>  <br>  I no what it is like to be bullied for how you look...as i have red hair and pale skin!!  8-)<br>  <br>  xxx|`|XAjCXViuaa	I don't know why everyone hates her, but I personally like her because she's different from the rest of them and what i've seen of them, nicola (the ginger girl one) is the nicest of them all!|`|AA11346983	because she looks different to the rest of them, they all have blonde/brown hair and tanned skin. personally i think nicola is the prettiest, but there you go.|`|o67glGo1aa	i dont, i think theyre all fabulous.<br>  nicola was always my fave during popstars the rivals<br>  some people just cant handle the fact that she has talent and they clearly dont.|`|BdA59Tr0aa	To be honest cheryl needs to close her mouth when she smiles.<br>  <br>  Nicola is the underrated member.|`|5RnzztXnaa	i like nicola she is cool and funny they are all grate i cant wait to see them at the o2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|AFNN6wBeaa	she looks so wishy washy pale. nothing to do with her being ginger.

UwZcFLRpaa	It definitely should have been Rourke he was amazing and Sean penn is good dont get me wrong but Mickey should have won it was his year|`|Zyl2wBnPaa	I saw both movies and I loved them both. It's really a toss up on who should have won. Both were excellent performances. Both actors were also bad boys of Hollywood. Sean Penn was snubbed for years and Rourke's reputation precedes him. I think making the Wrestler for Mickey was like therapy because a lot of it mirrored his real life. Penn's character was so unlike him and so complex that even though I loved both roles equally I would have edged toward Penn to win.|`|kqba2sAIaa	I've seen both Sean Penn and Mickey Rourke's movies and of the two I believe Mickey Rourke to be the more deserving of an Oscar, I also believe that the only reason Rourke didn't win an Oscar is because he is supposed to be involved in WWE's Wrestlemania 25 and the Academy frowns on the wrestling industry.|`|P9S5wlLyaa	I've seen neither, but I'm glad Penn won, and loved his speech.<br>  <br>  I don't know what makes this one different, but I'm getting very tired of all these wrestling/boxing movies. It's just not something that interests me, and it seems to dominate the Oscars lately.|`|uzfdgFSxaa	YES, YES, YES!  he did a fantastic job in The Wrestler.  Sean Penn plays the same character in every movie.   Ranting and screaming does not mean you can act.  I believe Mickey Rourke did his own stunts and injuries.  He was robbed.|`|2Ys6pUg9aa	I am glad that Sean Penn won. He was great in Milk. He is an awesome actor and deserved to win and his acceptance speech rocked!!!|`|d9eea47718ed8a9865d223c4f93433f5aa	Absolutely. After all of his career screw-ups, he's finally getting back on track.|`|fudmYesMaa	Yes, the emotion he brought to the role was astounding|`|EUKvgJvAaa	Mickey Rourke was great in "The Wrestler", he seemed so real and he made me see feel for his character|`|I1w0HfQbaa	Rourke should have won the Oscar. They are both good actors but Rourke's own story is just as fascinating as the wrestler he portrays in the movie. Fizzling apart in the 1980 despite having everything going for him and making bad choices in his career and then turning his movie career with The Wrestler is a great story unto itself. I think he did not win because of the disrespect we in America show toward the pseudo-sport that is professional wrestling. The Oscar award committee might have felt it right to nominate him but it is a mighty ragged pill to swallow to give him an award about pro-wrestling.|`|B43x5RF8aa	Yes. He was robbed because he played the part of a professional wrestler.|`|j38mlGvZaa	I have seen both and I think Sean Penn deserved it because the role was so unlike his real life. He really stretched himself to portray that character and he did a brilliant job at it at that. Mickey Rourke did a great job too but it didn't compare in terms of talent to Sean Penn. I'm not saying one is more talented than the other but this year Sean definitely deserved it.|`|qksvRJIyaa	YES! I really fell in love with his down and out wrestler. I really cared for his charactor and that rarely happens to me. Or Langella in Frost/Nixon was really good. In fact I wanted Rourke to win but thought Langella would be the one to get it. Penn is a great actor but didn't have the chops against the other two.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Yeah, I was hoping that Rourke would have won. He was so full of promise in the 80's, and he just self-destructed. I can't say whether one performance was better than the other. I love Sean Penn but the choice seemed a little politically correct to me.|`|QrghfsIUaa	Yes he should have. Hollywood gave Penn the award based on the politics of his movie.

wCdILHl6aa	I think the show Sunday was as "edgy" as the Oscars are going to get! Talk about a change...I was very pleasantly surprised while watching the show. I think that Hugh was one of the best hosts the Oscars has seen. He is as classy as they come, AND born for the stage. You can tell he is a natural performer, and a great entertainer. The Oscars is a black tie event, not as upbeat and outrageous as the MTV Awards, that's for sure...I think Heath winning his Oscar was a tribute enough to his work...There *was* a video tribute to all actors, directors, producers, etc. that have passed in 2008. Heath was not the only talented actor to have died in the past year, and to single just him out for a full "Heath" tribute wouldn't be right, not for the Oscars at least. Also, I'm pretty sure most at the Oscars saw Dark Knight (Robert Downey Jr. even watched it, and enjoyed it, but joked in an interview that it was too complicated and he didn't understand it, and Iron Man was better!)...Also, (and of course everyone is entitled to their own opinion), but Hugh Jackman is one of the best actors out there! He can do it all: sing, dance, AND act! He is so much more than just Wolverine in X-Men (I don't understand why everyone always brings that up, like an insult or something, he's *just* "Wolverine") He has kept that franchise going, he does a great job playing the character AND with still almost 3 months until it's release in May, X-Men Origins (his own Wolverine movie) is one of the most highly anticipated films of this year! I don't believe if any other actor had played that role they would have their own spinoff film! Watch Hugh's works, and see how talented he is, I can't force you, but I saw him live in The Boy From Oz when it was on Broadway and I can vouche for his talent. Period. He was an excellent choice to host the Oscars and I hope he does again! He does great hosting the Tony's, he was a perfect pick and proved it Sunday.|`|9osOF1rfaa	They didn't need a video tribute to heath the oscar was his tribute, and that is still a sensitive subject, with his family in the audience it might have not set right, besides he was not the only person in hollywood to die, that might have seen unfair. As for jackman's job as host, where have you been, he is know for during a musical number as host for various award shows, and he was good at it, you have got to be the only person who thinks he sucked. As for being edgy, it's an award show, a night for celebrating films, what kind of edge do you want to see. And all of the members of the academy see all of the films nominated (films are sent to them) before they voted, yes his death had a say in his win, but he was good in it.

kuxVB76maa	Stop being a pessimist! Are you from the east coast? Crank Dat and Stanky Legg isn't regular Hip hop it's called Snap Music. So I wouldn't say it's Gangsta Rap like The Game and Club Rap like Flo Rida and 50 Cent. There's different styles in every genre including Hip hop. Take a chill pill.

6Au5FIYWaa	I don't believe virgo men are necessarily effeminate. My dad is one, and I wouldn't call him effeminate overall. <br>  However, in some ways he could be said to be effeminate - often if virgo men indulge the side of them that is hospitable, that takes care of others when they're sick, that cleans and tidies and cooks, that pays meticulate attention to their dress, they may be regarded as effeminate. There are many virgo men and virgo-influenced men who may be regarded as effeminate in this respect, even if not overall, because this hospitable and critical nature can encourage them to act in ways that are considered 'feminine' by society. These qualities may be seen less and less as 'feminine', however, as times are changing and social roles for men and women are adapting.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	2 of my son are Virgo . and they are real MEN|`|FDt7cC8haa	I am a Virgo....And the furthest thing from being effeminate....

VD4NQMLLaa	I would buy some of the Syd Field books . He specialize on screenwriting books. He also have workshops on the subject. Go to www.simplyscripts.com. They have free screenplays. It will help you to see how movie scripts looks like. A software called Final Draft is also available if you plan to write a script.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6mVpfmR6aa	I have some questions regarding this, also, for I have written a script.  It sounds like you are in the beginning stage.  You might want to review a few dozen scripts before you finish writing it.  Definitely, do not let anything stay in the script unless you have read it about 20 times and think that after 20 readings this is the best you can write it.  Someone told me years ago, the best writing is rewritten.|`|Xkas9BG2aa	Maybe contacting a screenplay writer would be helpful because who better to answer questions then one who has done it.  Not too long ago, I saw and heard the screenplay writer for the movie Rain Man, Barry Morrow, who won the oscar for his screenplay writer.  Because it was a 20th anniv. celebration of the movie and focused on the Real Rain Man which the movie was based...Kim Peak of Salt Lake City...he didn't really talk much of about the screenwriting process.  But Barry Morrow seems like a very down-to-earth, not spoiled by Hollywood kind of guy...so if you can get a hold of him, I think you can get a lot of good pointers.  Good Luck.|`|jjkNGC97aa	lol you don't need to buy huge books, read long scripts or contact a pro! all you need is your clear vision and microsoft word!<br>  <br>  oki the font used is COURIER NEW. and the first page usually has on it:<br>  <br>  TITLE<br>  WRITTEN BY<br>  DATE<br>  DRAFT 1<br>  <br>  in the middle of the page.<br>  <br>  <br>  now before every scene you have a line which is in bold, caps and underlined. it should look like this:<br>  <br>  1. EXT. TOWN. DAY. MORNING<br>  <br>  the number is the scene number, ext is for exterior if the scene is outside, or if its inside you write INT. then you write the place. if it's day or night. and the time, which shouldn't be specific but rather just evening, afternoon, morning and so on. if in the next scene its the same day then write:<br>  <br>  2. INT. LISA'S HOUSE. SAME DAY. EVENING.<br>  <br>  or whatever you want. get the idea though?<br>  <br>  then whenever you have a character, the name is always in caps and bold. the first time the char is introduced, you should write what they are wearing, what they look like and a sentence or two about their personality but don't make it into an epic bio.<br>  <br>  when there's a dialogue, again middle of page. char's name in bold and caps and then skip a line and write in brackets (whispering) or (angry) or any other directions if needed, then next line, you write what they're saying.<br>  <br>  here's an example of a screenplay (the kite runner)<br>  <a href="http://img.slate.com/media/1/123125/2137821/2156517/2175056/2176958/kite-runner-screenplay-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.slate.com/media/1/123125/2137...</a><br>  <br>  ok here are some *rules*:<br>  <br>  always write in the present tense<br>  never add camera directions. thats for the director to decide upon. it is usually better if you're the one who's going to direct it coz you have a clear idea of what you want!<br>  <br>  good luck. email me if you need any more help!|`|z0GqpcvPaa	Good attempt, just have a try. goodluck :)

4P9no5CTaa	kinda. i have dated a virgo and we had plenty of problems, but we seem to get over them. we are good friends now. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  These two mutable signs can produce power, money and a lifetime friendship. Many relationships take place fast when these intellectual signs hook up. There is physical attraction and plenty of stimulating conversation. Virgo is someone who will stick with Gemini through good times and bad. This is something both need to feel secure. This is a highly rewarding combination that promises fun and games and a major sexual attraction. Ruled by Mercury, planet of communication, these two have much in common and conversation will never get boring although the sex might. Virgo is a keeper and Gemini needs to make sure they don’t let sexy Virgo get away. If Virgo stalls for time, Gemini should run away fast before it’s too late. <br>  <br>  3 hearts|`|B7WIZdglaa	it depends on your planets.

1c635f446d91828fc99f4dc9a1a95a3baa	Hooks can be instrunmental parts or lyrics in a song that sounds "catchy."  Think of it as the part of a song that hooks the person or "sells" the song or album:<br>  <br>  let me find a few good examples:<br>  <br>  Katy Perry - "Hot n' Cold"<br>  A real simple song, but the hook is when song and lyrics builds up to and breaks out into the chorus:  The chorus is very catchy because of all the rhyming and it all just fits together like two notes or chords that are in harmony.  The rest of the song, just isn't nearly as impressive as the chorus.<br>  <br>  In the song, "Stan," by Eminem, he could have been singing about anything because it didn't really matter as most people were interested in the chorus.  Most people recognize the the simple baseline, acoustic style guitar playing, and simple drum track with Dido singing chorus in the background.<br>  <br>  "Paper Planes" - MIA, perhaps an excellent example of a hook/gimmick is the sound of a bullet chambered in a gun and fired repeatedly in this song.  Many people think this is some kind of gang banger song, but it is only a sound effect used to put more emphasis on the message, but it helps it sell to radio stations and in the music stores.<br>  <br>  A riff example:  When Linkin Park released the song "Faint," all it really needed was nonsensical lyrics and that infamous hard guitar riff.  Of course the song starts of great and the only other good parts of the song are when the heavy riff is used, everything else is forgettable, but it sells.<br>  <br>  Another riff example:  Bubba Sparxx - "Deliverance," first off,  Bubba Sparxx did not seem like a very talented lyricist and it perhaps showed in that they had to overcompensate with excellent production of the music.  In this song deliverance, there is a very distinct acoustic guitar riff that pained me to hear wasted on such a song.  The riff can be heard through out the song with a pretty cool drum track to accompany it.  The quiet parts (no lyrics) part of the song sound great.  And it is that is what I believe sold it on music video channels and the radio, for the time it was around.<br>  <br>  "Billie Jean" - Michael Jackson, the synth riff along with the simple bassline and the real simple drum track was all you really needed with any other nonsensical lyrics that just happened to fit in.  The hook line - "Billie Jean, not my lover...." was an excellent choral fit.|`|FpGT7DlOaa	A hook is more or less a riff, its just a specific kind.<br>  Its like the main riff, think about it---Thriller by Michael Jackson, that whole intro could be called its hook. Riff is just more of a general term for any sequence of notes with a rhythm. Hook = catchy = you remember it and identify that song with that part of the song.|`|0b3fa313a09fd3b8730664822eb4455baa	Hooks in songs are something that is catchy and stands out from the rest of the lyrics. It's something that you find yourself singing and remembering a lot. I think that Underoath is a great band for this. (e.g. "Reinventing Your Exit") they say, This is the way I would have done things, Up against the wall, You've got me up against your wall" I think in that song is one of their best "hooks". They have a lot in that song. Also hooks may be repeated..<br>  <br>  Riffs are different. I think that is more relating to a certain guitar riff that's played. Like an intro, or solo or just whatever the guitarist plays.

cYtPfXkJaa	I have no idea - scary stuff. Afterwards she said "I saw it. My advice to you; find a safe place with locks and bad dogs and never ever turn out the light". <br>  <br>  Not sure we'll ever find out what it was, which is probably a good thing. I thought that it might have something to do with how murderers are treated in the afterlife, but Mitchell seemed keen that she not share it with George either, so perhaps not. Must have been bigger and scarier than that!<br>  <br>  Great show though, last nights episode was fantastic! x|`|mIMt7ytnaa	I don't know and I'm pretty sure no one else does - it really is a secret!

If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that.

Good Luck!|`|eta0c25yaa	No. Im 5'8, so it would be weird.|`|yte0BzXKaa	I'm 14 and i'm 5''8<br>  You are really short, but if i suppose your i lovely person and good looking then no decent girl has a reason to not give you a chance!<br>  <br>  I have dated plenty of guys shorter than me, a problem has never appeared.|`|klhFMdCgaa	depends...how much shorter? more than a couple of inches and you may want to invest in man-heels.|`|VAfyKWmUaa	I have when I was a teen. I normally like tall guys, but it's all about the way I guy treats you, personality, etc. Women and men have a tendency to find all kinds of flaws in a person. By doing that you will definitely end up being single for a very long time. lol|`|EEBofYFhaa	nope|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	yes|`|lawMUua3aa	yes|`|K5XDXRK7aa	If the guy is really nice, yes. But you are really a bit too short for your age, you should do more exercise because you can still grow taller until your are 21/22.

oVxr5B3Eaa	I don't remember, I think I just figured it out for myself, but I was pretty young. I was like 8 the only time I had the talk, and it was because my mom found my barbie and ken naked in their bed together.

EyAAFfaMaa	Angelina always looks great. Kate Winslet also had a gorgeous dress. Anne Hathaway's shiny dress was adorable. One of my favorites was Natalie Portman, she looked so pretty! Amy Adams had a nice dress but it sort of blended with the carpet. What's the woman form Benjamin Button named? She was nominated for best supporting actress and I can't remember her name! Gah. Anyway, her dress was pretty too. Amanda Seyfried's dress was cute too. Sarah Jessica Parker's dress was nice, but she looked horrible as always. <br>  <br>  I'm not really a fan of Vanessa Anne Hudgens' dress, it had some weird white thing on the front. Miley Cyrus' dress was HORRIBLE, one of the worst. She looked like a freaking marsh mellow, she doesn't even belong there. "Hopefully I'll be here getting something for it [Hannah Montana Movie] next year" That girl is seriously delusional if she thinks the Hannah Montana Movie will get an Oscar, or that she'll ever get Best Actress without years of training with top professionals - even then, they can't work miracles. Whoopi was also horrible-oh geez. I don't even want to know why she was wearing that. Sophia and Tilda as well. & Frieda last-name-I-don't-know had a weird dress. Beyonce's dress sucked too. Wasn't too impressed with Jessica Biel either. I didn't like Nicole Kidman's dress too much, but she looked stunning. Tina Fey looked awesome! & Jen Aniston was pretty too. Penelope Cruz's vintage antique dress was gorgeous, which is appropriate because so is she. <br>  <br>  Emile Hirsh, and Robert Pattinson looked great. Zac Efron was alright, not digging his hair too much though. Brad Pitt looked nice, duh. Well, most of the guys looked good, except for Mickey. I know his dog just died... but seriously, can he not clean up better than that? Ben Stiller's beard thing freaked me out a bit... that shouldn't be on stage with Natalie Portman.|`|XAjCXViuaa	I haven't seen all the dresses that everyone wore, but I looked at Miley Cryus's dress, and me and my friend said that it looked like she was wearing a fish! <br>  <br>  No offence to her or to any Miley fans!|`|iJbslaQNaa	WORST-- MILEY CYRUS, PARIS HILTON, Freida pinto (she is horrid)<br>  best-- KATE, JOLIE!!|`|RFR8KWdTaa	u do !!|`|Br7tNGbGaa	Natalie Portman was my favorite - I think she was overlooked. <br>  I thought Angelina's dress was blah - but the emerald earrings were fabulous<br>  My other favs were Alicia Keys, Kate Winslett, Anne Hathaway & Marisa Tomei (she looked way too skinny though)<br>  I was NOT a fan of the wedding cake dresses - i.e. Penelope Cruz, SJP & Miley Cyrus et al, but that seemed to be a theme for some reason!|`|NqcnAnC1aa	Angelina Jolie, Alicia Keys, and Kate Winslet looked gorgeous.  Anne Hathaway was okay...and Miley Cyrus had a beautiful dress. Amy Adams looked pretty, but I didn't really like the big necklace.<br>  As for worst dressed, probably Sophia Loren, Tilda Swinton or Whoppi Goldberg.  I also thought Beyonce's dress was kinda ugly.  Zac Efron wasn't up to par either...his hair and suit were dumb. Oh, and Jessica Biel looked okay but I didn't like the big ugly bow on her dress.|`|otYTWy2uaa	Best dressed for me was Alicia Keys, Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston<br>  Worst dress Penelope Cruz and Beyonca

Take Gloria and Catherine with you!|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Lol.. i agree. I wish it could of been stopped.|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	I think Esther, deep down, knows it's not real. But she feels she has no other options, even with the money. She's, presently and in the past, had a penchant for falling for the wrong men. She's turned a blind eye in order to have a 'real' love story. Chloe's father abandoned her, so she jumps when this man proposes to her. Getting married in a hospital was dumb, but she doesn't want this man to get away. And since Esther has very little education if any, she wants her husband to have some level of intelligence.|`|df7eb800ff0d3d2aec218aae79b6f9cfaa	I think it is very sad. She just wants to be loved so badly that she throws caution to the wind and goes for it. We all know what a horrible mistake that she is making and it looks like she will be hurt again. Poor girl!|`|EzZk2pyNaa	Esther is stupid.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	she is a hard up old bat, last time she married she had Chloe and got Mrs C. husband Rex killed by her man Tiny, she is one of the dumbest  people in soap history.

6kBAj12gaa	given your age I would say Confessions of a Shopaholic but in reality The curious Case of Ben Button is a very very very good movie!|`|j38mlGvZaa	It all depends on what you're in the mood for. Comparing those two movies is like comparing apples to oranges. <br>  <br>  Obviously Button is a better film but if you just want to have a fun girls night then go for Shopaholic.<br>  <br>  They're both good but I would spend my money of Button first.|`|qksvRJIyaa	If you've seen "Forrest Gump" then you've seen "Ben Buttons" plus it's a damn long movie. Go see something fun like "Confessions"|`|goe3y4FPaa	TRUST ME.. BENJAMIN BUTTON.. AND ITS LONGER TOO.. WORTH THE MONEY|`|EWeuwIe4aa	Well the case of Benjamin Button is really good, but I don't know why they gave the story an adaptation. They modernized the story into a more recent look, when the book is more of a Victorian period, or a 19 century look. But its still a great movie, and a great story.|`|4Rbo3JrQaa	If your looking to see a piece of art then def. see Ben Button. If you just want a kitchy flick that would be just as good if you wait until DVD see Confessions. Ben Button was outstanding.

euZRbiA2aa	Got fed up with them when they released all them singles in early 90s think it was one every month.<br>  BQ manic street preachers.|`|AA11518803	My 1,000th answer..better make it a good one...no pressure...umm...<br>  <br>  Any band that names an album after George Best is alright with me, unless they are a band that really sucks that is, which The Wedding Present definitely does not. I only a have a handful of their songs on mixed tapes here and there, and I've always liked the songs, but never bothered to dig any deeper than that. So, I'm glad you posted these.<br>  <br>  I really dig their sound...somewhere between Wire and New Order, though they don't ape either band's sound. So I say "aye". <br>  <br>  BQ: This one is a tough one for me, and my answer is likely to be a boring one. Radiohead and Blur are among my favs, but there are so many I haven't listened to, or listened to enough, and probably a few I'm forgetting all about at the moment, as I have a nasty headache. Excuses. excuses...|`|0cc7b69ea6b5f359aa006de2a67d9086aa	Hi Huevo, <br>  <br>  I like the Wedding Present alot.  I don't own any of their albums but they have always been featured on some Brit music shows I listen to on college radio.  They have been around for along time and deserve to be mentioned.  Its has crossed my mind to post them before to give them some exposure.  I guess great minds think alike.  It's  interesting that they have made music in various styles over their tenure including some odd sounding folk music they made at one point.  <br>  <br>  Kudos, Huevo for another below the radar band you've suggested!!!<br>  <br>  BQ: Other than the required anwer of Radiohead, I will say the Manic Street Preachers...|`|3e6758fcfd02678034cc2b0ff260959eaa	hey Huevo... i wasn't mad on the first one... but the other two were cool! I'd never heard of these and i lived in Leeds for 6 years! i must have had a faulty radar or something ;) cheers!|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Hi Huevo.<br>  It was pretty good. Something didn't entirely click with me, but you know when you just know that it's about weird little hang-ups that are specific to you. Anyways. There were a lot of components that hit really nice with me (particularly in the second clip). <br>  <br>  Thanks man. How are things going? Happy Monday.<br>  <br>  ba: probably Blur<br>  <br>  *************<br>  Hey Huevo.<br>  Man, that sounds rough. I hate that too, you adjust just in time to adjust back. Hang in there.|`|AA12301664	hi huevo<br>  <br>  an excellent choice!<br>  a band i never particularly followed, although i have a couple of albums and saw them live once upon a time, and certainly worth a mention, if not for their undoubted influence, then their longevity.|`|AA11710920	I'm digging it Huevo. First track sorta had a sleepy Velvet Underground drone to it which is good, but the second track is the one that did the most for me. Good stuff :) Hope you get back to a normal schedule soon.  <br>  <br>  BA: favorite is RAdiohead, others include Charlatans UK, Blur, Lush, Stereophonics, James ... and Morissey, who for some weird reason, keeps making records|`|dFacbjIZaa	Howdy Huevo, never heard them before, but not bad at all, thank You.<br>  <br>  BA: Probably Coldplay

RNpaBwxzaa	It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you, that meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had a lot of chances of turning back only they didn't. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.<br>  What are we holding on to, Sam?<br>  That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.

DMnFAL8Faa	SMOOTH....... Although crunchy has its perks, smooth is more versatile and can be used in more wonderfully delicious ways, Cakes, Ice Creams, Candies, Cookies, etc..... It's no contest, ...P.S. It's not the jar peanut butter that's infected with Salmonella, but packaged products made with peanut butter. Best of Luck|`|lFyMYKuOaa	NOT tainted would be good enough<br>  :)~|`|MY68dYfaaa	crunchy peanut butter|`|RTHn0k0Taa	crunchy|`|JmqbavUaaa	Crunchy on celery and smooth on Oreo cookies. :)|`|DEGClROKaa	As a kid I loved crunchy.

Good too, since most is contaminated with salmonella here in the US.

UlME0etLaa	No I wouldn't. Here are my reasons.<br>  1. I don't speak well in front of crowds. Especially with thousands of people in the crowd. No thank you.<br>  2) I doubt, I'd be able to do the work, properly. I would doubt myself, and might give up,...<br>  3) I'd be scared that people would harm me, if they didn't like my opinions or my tactics.<br>  4) I would have to do alot of work to really make a difference.<br>  5) I'd be the most stressed person out there! yes?|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	Not really, too much stress. Although, I hope that someday, America has a GREAT President who will defend the Constitution, instead of a Socialist!|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	No.  I am a very honest person.  I could never become that convincing a liar.|`|w4X6Y7tIaa	No....That's a stressful job with way too much responsibility.|`|AA11634944	No, my dad is a state representative and no matter what he does people will always find a reason to bash him. I don't think I could handle all the criticism and negative feedback people would give me. The public never realizes that it's impossible for a political leader to please everybody. They are generally bias and refuse to see the views from the opposing side of the argument.<br>  <br>  Besides people should vote for a candidate because of what he stands for and not solely his political party. When my father switched parties his district went all crazy saying he was a liar and such; as if his ideas weren't democratic to begin with. They had no problem voting for his democratic views when he was a registered republican but since he changed his party suddenly his ideas were wrong; his wrongful death bill instantly never mattered. F Kansas.<br>  <br>  Ok I'm done ranting. I just hate how people treat politics. It's a pet peeve.|`|3ZeV9HUCaa	Yes of course ...!! I would love to be the president because i have been grown up in kind of circumstances where i got too much attached with my country and its development ...!! Me and my friends always talk about new ideas and policies our country should have ... and plus i feel that i have a Leader Quality in me ....!!|`|qpjorXRnaa	Um, no. Too much stress associated with it. And you are judged by someone no matter what choice you make. Like you cannot ever make the right choice even when you do!|`|JmqbavUaaa	No. I'm a people pleaser. I don't like not being able to please everyone. Plus I hate politics...|`|pPr4gWXyaa	no thanx its just to much responsiblity for me.|`|G1VsV0wWaa	Would I get to sleep with starlets?|`|MY68dYfaaa	and get shot!!!!! i dont think so!|`|Up6ANLQeaa	Yes!

I laughed all night thinking about it.|`|6kBAj12gaa	That was so funny I was rolling on the floor! If you thought that was funny check out what SNL did last week on their weekend update...they mocked him too and that was freakin hilarious too!! I bet you can find it on youtube or soemthing....look it up you will really like it|`|EyAAFfaMaa	Yeah, it was hilarious but his beard was kind of freaking me out. <br>  <br>  <br>  But yeah, I loved when he just sort of wandered off. :]|`|2NUKtY7Naa	i thought it was hilarious he did so good.

aVmATVtvaa	I definitely remember last year's Oscars, and Heath Ledger was on the "In Memoriam" tribute. The way it works is they list everyone in order, starting with dates after the previous Academy Awards, and show everyone who died up until the date of this year's Academy Awards.  Heath died January 22, 2008, and the Oscars were held February 24, 2008. I remember he was the last person on the montage.|`|SvEt3d8Gaa	ya,,may be|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	I agree|`|69ckxAIYaa	OMG i was watching that 2 and noticed cuz i was waiting to see him... mabye they did something for him at the last oscars if he passed last year but Im pretty sure it was not long ago... no they didnt do anything for him earlier although he did win best supporting actor!! and his family went up and talked for him ( it was sad) and alot of pple in teh audiance were crying|`|AA10175631	Ledger died January 22, 2008 so he was probably acknowledged during last year's Oscars. I can't remember, so I'm not 100% sure. I sincerely doubt they simply forgot to include him though. By the way, I was shocked to find that both Michael Crichton and Stan Winston died! What a great loss.|`|WchfVMsPaa	Heath Ledger passed away before the Oscar ceremony last year and I believe he was included in the memorandum last year.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	I think it's because he was a contender for an award, plus he won. I don't think they wanted to give him anymore credit than that or something. Maybe she knew something we didn't....

4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	Yes, I was pretty sure they'd win more than one award. Hollywood loves this type of film... It's definitely not a musical. There is a dance number at the end, though - during the final credits. You'll like it.

Can't wait to see Brock again because evidently he will have to come so they can have a DNA test that proves who she is.|`|bn8OZrYSaa	i agree....they need to move on...like c'mon let her get her life back already....what are they waiting for..its getting old.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	I agree and  if any one noticed the woman holding Mrs. C. is Annie Wilkes and Esther married Roger Wilkes, so is she Rodgers real wife or sister, and they need to wrap this story up  quickly.|`|LO3BMobRaa	Yeah it's getting rather pointless.|`|fa4c831f08b161bce2611f5ba6f16824aa	you think???|`|uKXgg9heaa	Yes I hate it let's move on already! What happened with the DNA test?|`|J3yUXKiyaa	If there's on thing that soap opera writers are notoriously bad at, it would be humour.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, when they have a typically serious character do something out of character, it can be funny.  <br>  <br>  However, when they try really hard to be funny, like with Katherine's kidnappers, it almost always just comes across as pathetically ridiculous. <br>  <br>  Another case in point - the whole Susan thing from Days of Our Lives...poor Eileen Davidson got dragged into a ridiculous storyline that would not end.  Ugh.|`|AA10207942	Yes they've dragged this storyline too long now.I think they need to come to a conclusion,let Katherine get her memory and life back and move on.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	Esther and Kay reunite on Friday.

NrkWd4Aoaa	You are a fantastic and inspiring teacher. I love you with all my heart and you have done so much for me; I will always be grateful that I was fortunate enough to have been your student.  <br>  <br>  Here's the thing:  I played at a competitionand some of the comments I got from the judge were fresh and this is something that I need to grow as a musician . I believe in my heart that it is time for a change so I can learn from new perspectives.<br>  <br>  Thank you so much for everything you have taught me.<br>  <br>  A gift and a thank you note would be appropriate.|`|AA12376180	Honesty is always the best policy. That way there is no problem at a later time when she hears about you playing elsewhere under a new teachers name.<br>  <br>  There may be some hurt feelings, but if everything is explained up front honestly, there cannot be any feelings of deceit.<br>  <br>  Nothing is forever, and you teacher should understand that.|`|ziFMYqtoaa	Yes, there may be some hurt feelings, but it's better than lying and having the truth coming out later.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	This is an excellent, albiet, not an easy question.  This is the sort of question that keeps me coming back to Y!A.<br>  <br>  The most important thing that I ever learned in studying music is to understand exactly what you are capable of.  If you are intimately familiar with your limits and abilities, life will become so much easier for you and those with whom you work.  Your teacher, since they are still performing, seems to be enough of a student of music that they should not blind to talent.  I for instance know that I could make a fair amount of money if were to go into singing for a living, but I could never be a Bryn Terfel.<br>  <br>  What I'm saying is that if your teacher is worth her salt as a musician, then she shouldn't be very insulted.  Music is a very competitive business, and it's not too difficult to compare oneself with other musicians.  We all have varying abilities, and thanks to the rigors of studying music, admitting that a student of a particular skill level may be ready for a new teacher should not be too difficult. Both for my clarinet students and piano students, (neither of which are a primary instrument for me, granted) I have, at times, actually recommended that they look into studying with someone else once they reach a particular level.  I do this because I was directly affected, while growing up, by sticking with my piano teacher for too long, when it should have been obvious to me that I was no longer learning anything.<br>  <br>  So I think that you should just tell her that you would really like a change of perspective.  A fresh start, if you will.  I do think that she will understand better than you might think.
UY3zl9dFaa	I know most people on here don't seem to like her, but I think she's cute too. And once they give her a makeover she'll be pretty. Yes, she is too Spinelli-like and I hope they tone her down a little. She does seem too young to be an FBI agent, but if her cyber-skills are that great, then maybe. If Spinelli is old enough to work for the mob... And, does Robin look old enough to be a doctor? Anyway, I think she's amusing.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I don't know, one "geek" is enough and Spinelli hold that place in my heart. Plus, I think Winifred being like Spinelli is just a big act.|`|M1ymLE9Paa	She's adorable, as a person.  As a character...I love Spinelli but it seems to me like they just want Winnie to be a girl version of him and that seems kind of boring to me.  Spinelli is special b/c he's one of a kind.  I'd like Winifred a lot better if they weren't trying to make her so much like Spinelli.  One Spinelli on the show is all we need (and I was really glad when Maxie told Winifred that she had no right to call her Maximista).|`|AA12315431	I don't like that they make her talk like Spinelli. That show does not need a female version of him. If she is going to be competition for Maxie, that's one thing but to make her talk like Spinelli is like implying he is not unique anymore.|`|fIWwLRIMaa	she does seem like a twelve year old with those braids.|`|hFVPEkWjaa	lol yeah|`|tgVGE2Umaa	No I don't like Winifred, she is a weak character and looks like she is about 12. Really how can anyone take her seriously as an "FBI agent" I mean really. Standing next to Jason Morgan she looks like a baby.|`|70C6O24Paa	i f'n hate her i mean she tried to threaten maxie right off the bat turns out shes the fbi agent tryn to take down spinelli she used him like maxie said i hate her|`|hqA9rzE5aa	I'm not really a Winifred fan but I LOVE Spinelli! I don't know what it is I can only handle one computer geek and that is Spinelli.|`|6efb881973246debd62243c5b0b3f7d6aa	A totally useless character.  I doubt someone her age would work as an FBI agent in real life anyway.|`|AA11261694	i think winifred is very annoying to|`|AA11657825	I hear you, I can't stand her, I feel they just have her on to bug Maxie.
NGNeT3rYaa	Yes, he is sweet and loyal to a fault.I want to smack the crap out of Sonny everytime he talks trash to him. Word on the GH fan site is that Maxie and Spinelli are the next big couple.|`|AA12315431	I love him as well. The world needs more Spinelli's. Real ones of course. I honestly don't know if Maxie has romantic feelings for him or not. Maybe some people are right and she is just afraid to admit it because she thinks she will blow it down the road. Here's a thought: don't blow it. I love when people act like their own actions are out of their control.|`|M1ymLE9Paa	I love Spinelli!  =)  I keep hoping that they will put Maxie and Spinelli together as a couple.  But, if they don't, I hope they always remain BFF.  Their scenes together have been part of my favorite moments on GH the past year or so.|`|AA11261694	i love spinelli and he is definatly a sweetheart i love him and maxie together to|`|fIWwLRIMaa	spinelli is so sweet, he couldn't hurt a fly. i wish maxie would just admitt how she feels, i just think she is afraid because she doesn't want to lose him as a friend.|`|tgVGE2Umaa	Yes Spinelli is a sweetheart. But when it comes to making decisions, he has no common sense. Haha. Don't get me wrong he is a genius and he's one of my favorite characters, but he makes such bad spur of the moment nonsense decisions. I hope when the Maxie and Spinelli storyline comes to a head that they are a super couple :)|`|m2ew9kBtaa	Spinelli has been one of the very most wonderful characters that they ever cast on GH, he is so sweet and is always trying to help someone and when it is the people he is close to, then he gives 110%, even if he isn't close he will help you out.<br>  He is a sweety!!|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	The sweetest, but very gullible..........|`|52C0HULyaa	yes she is|`|UY3zl9dFaa	Spinelli is great- not your average soap character, quirky, intelligent, kind and loyal. Maxie is afraid that she'll be... well, Maxie and end up doing something stupid and hurt him. She knows how great he is and doesn't feel worthy of him.

tsq5P9pzaa	I have seen Wall-E many times. The story is just so good. That would have to be why its such a favorite. Here's a bunch of reviews to prove my point.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.viewpoints.com/Wall-E-reviews" rel="nofollow">http://www.viewpoints.com/Wall-E-reviews</a>|`|AA10175631	I'm curious as to why you're hesitant about watching it. Why don't you think it looks good? I'm curious because it seems that a fair amount of people seem to have the same sentiment before watching it. At any rate, Wall-E is a great movie. On par with all the other great films that Pixar has released throughout the years. As to what makes it so good, here's a brief list:<br>  <br>  Beautiful special effects<br>  Endearing main character<br>  Great sound effects & soundtrack<br>  Creative story<br>  Heartwarming romance<br>  Plenty of funny moments<br>  Even the end credits are great. Please watch it.

Other winning categories for the movie included best adapted screenplay, best cinematography and best score.<br>  <br>  The film is the rags-to-riches story of an orphan from the Mumbai slums who wins the Indian version of Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?<br>  <br>  Kate Winslet kept her composure - just. She had raised eyebrows for her gushing acceptance speech at the Golden Globes last month. This time she was breathless but managed to stave off the tears as she accepted the gong.<br>  <br>  Winslet, 33, told the audience that she had actually first prepared an acceptance speech when she was just eight-years-old. "I'd be lying if I said I hadn't made a version of this speech. I think I was probably eight years old and staring into a mirror," she said.<br>  <br>  With her director husband, Sam Mendes, looking on, she went on to offer a stream of breathy tributes including ones to her children and Stephen Daldry, the director of the film The Reader for which she had been nominated.<br>  <br>  Heath Ledger became only the second performer to be awarded an Oscar posthumously. He won the best supporting actor award for his part in Batman movie The Dark Knight. Penelope Cruz was named best supporting actress for her role in Vicky Cristina Barcelona.<br>  <br>  Sean Penn's best actor award for his portrayal of gay rights activist Harvey Milk was probably the surprise of the night, and he was clearly taken aback. "You commie, homo-loving sons of guns," Penn said as he received the prize. "I did not expect this and I want it to be very clear that I do know how hard I make it to appreciate me often."<br>  <br>  Competition was stiff in the category, with Penn up against Mickey Rourke for The Wrestler, Frank Langella in Frost/Nixon, Brad Pitt for Benjamin Button and Richard Jenkins for The Visitor.<br>  <br>  <br>  Email Story   Share Story <br>  <br>  <br>  Delicious<br>   <br>  Digg<br>   <br>  Facebook<br>   <br>  Stumbleupon<br>   <br>  Reddit<br>   <br>  Newsvine<br>  <br>  <br>   Print Story

FfxmE9Toaa	Eh, best wishes to all music lovers, but Cajun and Zydeco music are from s.w. Louisiana and are not of New Orleans culture. We're referring to that special niche of music known as "New Orleans Music" here, though Beausoleil cut a great second-line beat song on Bayou Boogie titled "Maman Rosin Boudreaux". Sonny Landreth does a beautifully understated slide guitar solo.<br>  <br>  "Go To The Mardis Gras" Professor Longhair<br>  <br>  "Big Chief" Professor Longhair<br>  <br>  "Brother John" Wild Tchoupitoulas (with Meters backing)<br>  <br>  "Mardi Gras Mambo" Hawkettes (a high school band with Art Neville)<br>  <br>  "Iko Iko" Dr. John or The Dixie Cups - the lyrics are Mardi Gras Indian related: "My spy boy and your spy boy, settin' on the bayou/ My spy boy tol' your spy boy I'mo set yo' tail on fiyo/ Talk about hey now/ hey now/ Iko iko a nay, Jockamo fee no ah nah nay, Jockamo fee nah nay!"<br>  <br>  "Hey Pocky Way" The Meters|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	Iko Iko<br>  <br>  Don't know if it's a "mardi gras" song, but it has that New Orleans "feel".... also don't know who it's "by"... have heard lots of versions.<br>  <br>  Here's a fave from the Belle Stars<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1voj6H8CHY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1voj6H8C...</a><br>  <br>  Mardi gras wasn't really on my radar this year.... but now it is! <br>  Tipitina ~ Professior Longhair<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBSN7WOPkQ0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBSN7WOPk...</a>|`|geq6iU0Oaa	A couple of my favorites are Mardi Gras Mambo-the Hawkettes cover, and Al Johnson's "Carnival Time"<br>  <br>  Runner up is a song I heard around the corner from Boubon Street during the last moments of Mardi Gras. I don't know if this is the title, but the theme was "Ain't No Place to Pee At Mardi Gras"-No truer words were ever sung!|`|3uI0JAAwaa	Dr. John is pretty much the only music I want to jam on mardi grass.  <br>  "My Grandma and your grandma are sittin by da fire"|`|JVPwpwYlaa	Mardis Gras Mambo<br>  They all axed for you<br>  2nd line<br>  <br>  Just to name a few.|`|AA11518803	Most of the ones I know are the popular ones...Tipitia, Big Chief, Iko Iko, Hey Pocky Way, Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Hey Now Baby..<br>  <br>  Professor Longhair is a legend. I like his take on "Junco Partner".<br>  <br>  Dr. John's "Let the Good Times Roll" is a great Mardi Gras song.<br>  <br>  I think the Meters are fantastic, either on their own or backing Lee Dorsey. I dig their version of "Hey Pocky Way" as far as Mardi Gras music goes.

I fear you may have been affected by the numerous parodies that have poked fun at the movie since its release. I suggest you smoke a j and watch it again. It'll change your life, man. :)

dCbIHBpGaa	I can see the point of maybe having as many nominees as there is quality in a category in a year and maybe having 7 nominated films in a great year and maybe 3 or 4 in a poor year. Having said that though, if they extended the number of nominees beyond 5 at any time the prestige of being "oscar nominated" would fall and maybe the whole thing would be devalued.

sK4S86piaa	I can't clearly find your description of the movie though there's some close movies that kristen stewart was in..i may be wrong but i'm trying hard to help.<br>  Speak - Kristen plays Melinda Sordino, a high school freshman who becomes silent after being raped by an upperclassman. (it's far from your description but there were scenes that came close - i guess..lol)<br>  Here's the movie trailer of speak <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSCzahFXMrs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSCzahFXM...</a><br>  In The Land Of Women - After being dumped by his girlfriend, Los Angeles resident Carter Webb (Adam Brody) travels to Michigan to take care of his sick grandmother. Webb immediately begins to bond with his grandmother's neighbors, housewife Sarah Hardwicke (Meg Ryan) and her elder teenage daughter, Lucy (Kristen Stewart). The relationships he builds with these two and his grandmother leads him to look differently upon his own life and the future ahead of him.<br>  the trailer - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHU1cw7asjc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHU1cw7as...</a><br>  Fierce People - <br>  Trapped in his mother's Lower East Side apartment, sixteen-year-old Finn (Anton Yelchin) wants nothing more than to escape New York and spend the summer in South America studying the Iskanani Indians, or "Fierce People," with the anthropologist father he's never met. But Finn's dreams are shattered when he is arrested in a desperate effort to help his drug-dependent mother, Liz (Diane Lane), who scrapes by working as a masseuse. Determined to get their lives back on track, Liz moves the two of them into a guesthouse on the vast country estate of her ex-client, the aging aristocratic billionaire, Ogden C. Osbourne (Donald Sutherland). In Osbourne's close world of privilege and power, Finn and Liz encounter a tribe fiercer and more mysterious than anything they might find in the South American jungle: the super rich. While Liz battles her substance abuse and struggles to win back her son's love and trust, Finn falls in love with Osbourne's beautiful granddaughter, Maya (Kristen Stewart), befriends her charismatic older brother, Bryce (Chris Evans), and even wins the favor of Osbourne himself. But when a shocking act of rape shatters Finn's ascension within the Osbourne clan, the golden promises of this lush world quickly sour. And both Finn and Liz, caught in a harrowing struggle for their dignity, discover that membership always comes at a price.<br>  trailer - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuUFkNVmE_Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuUFkNVmE...</a><br>  If that doesn't help, try kristen's wikipedia, there's ALL of her movies here..<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Stewart#Filmography" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Ste...</a><br>  Or maybe you were mistaken with some other actress besides kristen..cos i know her movies well..=)|`|rJsgZ9jgaa	This site has info about movies, actors and actresses, etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com</a><br>  <br>  So search Kristen Stewarts name on IMDb, and good luck.

6979bf0ecfe9ee379c6d4efa120ff381aa	What was special ? nothing .It is just another example of Hollywood ramming a movie down our throats. I'm only surprised it did not get all 10 it was nominated for . I don't watch the Oscars anymore I just check the results online . There are hardly any surprises.I knew that this Bollywood bilk was already the winner . The Academy has become nothing but a bunch of nuts.

Go figure.|`|QZCMnZeKaa	clueless i guess the pusies in hollywood want to tell the muslims that they like them and that so they wont hurt them or blow them up by giving a retarded movie about indians 8 yes 8 oscars and best ones to that matter<br>  <br>  the movie that i was going for highly was benjamin button which was truly a great masterpiece has only won 2 Oscars <br>  <br>  and how did those faqgots milk win WTf its about homosexuals that retard gave a speech about dick sucking on the oscars WTF is wrong nowadays seriously like come on <br>  <br>  NOW THE REASON IS ITS ALL FAqqOTS AND LOWLIFE PUSIES THAT RATE THE OSCARS THAT IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE ANSWER|`|lR6TISEXaa	oh come on, it was a great movie. a story about a boy that really loved a girl and overcame a lot to become rich and famous.|`|8pUaspXyaa	I found it pretty good :D It wasn't the best but it was good.|`|O3l33DVJaa	I am still scratching my bald head on how this happened

Yeah, at first I wasn't going to watch it, by one of my friends came to my dorm last night and he got me hooked on it.<br>  <br>  Yeah, throughout the whole show, we were like "who the heck is this Larry character?" or "Oh Lord...she's calling Larry again!"<br>  <br>  He's definitely shady, and I'm kinda sorry she got eliminated. I think they have something going on, but I do not think that Caviar is transgendered. No homo, but she's a very attractive Russian/black girl.|`|FLRklaMcaa	Caviar just angers me when she talks. Its like she doesnt open her mouth, just moves her lips. The guy on the phone is so creepy, I really was about to ask the same exact question.

He says mean things ("turn on these bitches") but says them like theyre nothin...like he wants her to be on this show jus to play games. He's definitely a creeper.

8Mi15cTtaa	anyone should have won over Sean Penn!<br>  <br>  Sean Penn should have kept politics out of the Oscars. His comments were insulting. I will never go to a Sean Penn movie!!!|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	Too bad you weren't voting then.<br>  I disagree with your comment about Sean Penn. It was one of the best performances I had ever seen. I didn't see Mickey's so I can't comment.|`|721304c80de56710adba6c3a8fdc5f7daa	Look at the answers on the last 10 similar questions posted in the last 20 minutes.<br>  <br>  Yawn. Penn won; he was better; Rourke is a freak that played a freak. the role wasn't a stretch for him. Have him play a gay guy and I might believe he would be deserving.|`|t82AcQT1aa	Would Penn have won if he portrayed a "straight" politician? No. How many people have actually seen his movie? Very damn few, yet he wins?|`|tC02KPckaa	I think that Mickey Rourke should have won. I've seen Milk. It was a good film, but i think Rourke should have gotten the Oscar.|`|7ntSRsZLaa	Sean Penn deserved it...he did such a good job.<br>  Mickey Rourke did a great job too.. he won a golden globe though..<br>  so I think it's pretty equal..|`|GJfrPGGbaa	I definitely think Rourke should have won. I think you have to be a true wrestling fan of past or present in order to understand how Rourke transformed. Just because he is an old washed up druggy, like his character, doesnt mean that is the only thing that made his performance good. He was amazing in the ring and was very emotional out of it. Sean Penn's performance was great but I think because of the daring attempts of being a Gay man and the academy's lack of interest in respect for wrestlers caused Penn to win the award. All in all, Rourke was better if not much better.|`|EcjFbkouaa	He should have won. He was the 90 minute plus movie and did the movie himself. Sean Penn just had to imitate a guy after watching archival footage. Kind of like Forrest whitaker in Last King Of Scotland. It is easier to imitate somebody than to become a character. Write the dialogue yourself and train for 7 months. Sean Penn kissed  a guy. Big ******* deal. What about all the gay guys that kiss straight girls in movies. Mickey should have won. He did not play himself. He does not even like wrestling. Watch Rumblefish and Diner. It is all politics. just like slumdog millionare winning best picture. Mickey won the BAFTA AND the Spirit award. Sean Penn had to rep mickey in his speech because he was that much better than sean and he knows it.

sc4BtGxGaa	You can download Finale NOTEPAD for ten bucks. You can enter you piece by clicking and dragging the notes, or using the numberpad.  This starter-level c version of Finale will NOT allow you to do this with a MIDI-connected keyboard - but others *up the food chain* will.<br>  <br>  If you choose to use another notation program, then you can get a keyboard for VERY little money - it does not matter how good the sound or action are, since you will be using it ONLY for note-entry.  If, however you intend to actually PLAY it, the get one that will serve both functions.  Sitting right here in my studio right now I have connected (I own several more) a nice Roland, and M-Audio 88  (both used for classical music gigs) , and little controller keyboard - 49 notes - no sounds at all - that I use for note entry, since it is small and I can throw it up on the desk, and leave the the big keyboards where they are.  There are musical things i will spend HUGE bucks on - but this stuff did not run me much at all.  I use Finale ( the full program) and Sibelius almost every day in my work - and I got educational discounts on them, too - but they were still probably beyond what you wish to spend now.  <br>  <br>  Start writing things down NOW.  Even if you are not sure where you want to go with them, they will be saved.  My Dad was a fine commercial artist, and took a sketch pad with him ALWAYS. He said that you never know what is going to walk in front of you.  <br>  <br>  We all start someplace - you can start TODAY.|`|qswrz268aa	Get a notation software... Its so much easier than writing by hand. You can also hook some of them up to an electric piano (if that's your instrument) and play away, while the software records it and puts it onto the sheet music for you.<br>  <br>  Its rather pricey though...<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ziFMYqtoaa	Do you have a friend that knows music?

But I just read about it and I find it interesting that it says she becomes a guide for  7 people . In 1969, there was a TV movie called Seven in Darkness. It was about a plane crash, where most of the passengers were blind.The seven blind survivors of the crash have to find their way out of the wilderness and rescue themselves. It would probably seem a bit cheesy now, but I remember watching it on reruns as a kid and kind of enjoying the adventure of it.  Seems like they may have borrowed a few of the most basic elements of this script, then created a very different film and called it Blindness|`|QmOmbprOaa	blindness it`s an old movie.

People in South America get offended when people from the United States of America are referred to as "Americans."  Are not Canadians a part of the the North American Continent?  Are Venezuelans not American (being from South America.)<br>  <br>  People get offended over the silliest things.  So they call you "English." Who cares?|`|VA3tGarQaa	Nah, it doesn't bother me. You can't expect Americans to know these things. Everyone else, yeah, but that's too advanced for an average American.|`|npzN9t5daa	I'm English but I know what you mean!<br>  <br>  It's like when American's talk about a British accent! There is no British accent! It's Scottish, Irish, Welsh or English!<br>  <br>  I guess it's just cos England has London and the Queen and stuff. It's kinda stupind when you think about the fact that America's huge and British people don't just refer to New York or whatever as America.|`|XPaLYdobaa	most American dont know theres a country outside A merica,no kidding,i saw this youtube site and they were asking Americans questions about the world,they were asked what iS THE CURRENCY IN BRITAIN,AND THEY THOUGH IT WAS THE DOLLAR,THE LIST WENT ON AND ON.|`|f0CR2CpCaa	americans are the most ignorant people on the planet<br>  who gives a fook what they do|`|6nVDPBVsaa	Yeah i kinda do - England isn't the only Country in this place.

Same as Ireland = Ireland. <br>  <br>  If you go around saying you are British then they naturally won't think you are Scottish.|`|YX8IUaRFaa	go masturbate, sounds like your building up stress which can affect your emotions on small issues such as this. Stress is said to be caused by a build up of semen in the testicles. assuming your a male lol|`|AA11451795	I think Yahoo! Answers is global.<br>  <br>  Britain is not made up of different continents.  Let's get that straight.<br>  <br>  The UK includes Northern Ireland.  Not Britain.<br>  Great Britain is the island which includes Scotland and Wales.<br>  Britain, as I understand, is the imperial name for England.<br>  <br>  The UK will never be a proper country because a lot of ppl, including me, don't support the "union".<br>  <br>  This is just my opinion - I don't mean to sound uptight about it all, but I'm on the opposin side.<br>  I cringe when people refer to Northern Ireland as part of Britain.  So much so that I find myself wonderin what they teach in England and the Protestant schools here.  The British Empire was achieved unlawfully, immorally, through force and oppression.  Not all English supported this so they were victims too.<br>  Again, I apologise.
ObeBvtzgaa	Well pedals aren't "required". Picks are needed for electric guitar for the most part. An amplifier and guitar cable also.<br>  If you're going to get pedals, good ones to start with in my opinion:<br>  BOSS Distortion DS-1 (or if you plan to play almost all metal the BOSS ML-2 Metal Core pedal sounds really cool.)<br>  Dunlop Crybaby (wah pedal)<br>  And don't forget a tuner, very important. That should be the main things unless I accidentally left off something obvious lol.<br>  A 15-Watt amp should do the job for a while.|`|AA12239514	Well depending on what type of music you want to play it varies.<br>  <br>  For like all types I would recomend a Zoom G2 pedal (thats what i have anyway) and its like a multi effects pedal that covers all styles so its perfect for me, you could also do with a range of different material pics like brass metal plastic (give different sounds) and you might wanna look at getting things like a capo for certain songs or ever a blues slider if thats what your into. If i were you i'd concentrate more on playing first, cos pedals and effects only make you sound good, they cant make you PLAY better though.|`|9IVYh3Cjaa	definitely a tuner, one that can plug into the guitar.<br>  <br>  distortion pedals are nice, too.<br>  <br>  and if you haven't got any lessons, take some. they help more than you would think.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	nothing.<br>  <br>  some that you might want, and why you dont need them:<br>  pick- no you can finger pick<br>  amp/cables- no you can play an accoustic<br>  strap- no you can sit while playing<br>  pedals- no you can play it clean<br>  tuner- no you can tune by ear

AA11398236	You're right on asking why she didn't leave the first time.<br>  But I'll tell you why........Most women are afraid that if they leave, they have no place to go or they feel like if they leave, the guy will come after them. You can read a lot of it in true crime books, especially by author Ann Rule<br>  <br>  Right now I'm reading a book by Ann Rule where the character was murdered by her ex, possibly. He had a temper since he was a teen and carried it throught with his two other marriages and have had the crap beat out of them.<br>  <br>  And some guys have the "if you leave me" attitude or give the women guilty look or something like that.<br>  <br>  So I hope I've answered your question correctly|`|4c7QomPoaa	I don't really know much about this, don't know these two other than the news reports.

4x2KMVbBaa	This isn't IMDB or Wikipedia:<br>  <br>  Will Smith plays an IRS agent named Ben Thomas. Or at least you think he does. Ben goes door to door—and hospital to hospital—auditing people at the oddest times and in the oddest ways. He asks probing, personal questions no IRS agent has any business asking. He pokes around people's backyards—and hospital rooms—without invitations. He demands to know if they are "good" enough to deserve preferential treatment from the official tax collection agency of the U.S.A. <br>  <br>  So by the power not exactly vested in Ben by the Internal Revenue Service, he grants reprieves and "changes the circumstances"—one way or another—of pretty much everyone he meets. <br>  <br>  But Ben doesn't stop at financial rewards for good behavior. He's begun to give bigger gifts, too. Gifts that involve him seeking out the sick and infirm, then arranging for certain of his organs to be made available to them as a transplant. He donates bone marrow. He offers up a lung. And a kidney. <br>  <br>  And now we're back to Emily, a woman who has a malfunctioning heart. Ben falls for Emily in the process of auditing her, and he starts to think more and more about her heart—the one she has and the one she needs.<br>  He cares much more for others than he does for himself. He gravitates to the needy like a dog to dinnertime. And speaking of dogs, Ben takes care of Emily's Great Dane when she gets sicker and has to be hospitalized. <br>  <br>  Ben finds a family that's desperate for a change of scenery, and sets out to fulfill their every dream. The family is headed by a single mom who is being abused by her boyfriend. She's so afraid of him she won't call the cops, but she just might up and move away if she had the wherewithal to do so. Ben sacrificially provides that wherewithal, giving her his house, a car and money to start over. <br>  <br>  All he wants from her in return is her promise to "live life abundantly." (Something he can't seem to manage for himself.) <br>  <br>  Ben often tells those who are close to him that he loves them. He fixes things for Emily, and he weeds her yard. <br>  <br>  Life and death and personal sacrifice are all tied tightly into spiritual ideas. But Seven Pounds keeps the core of these concepts at arm's length. At best—and that doesn't mean it's good—we see statues of the Virgin Mary and the baby Jesus in a Catholic hospital. As the story starts, Ben intones, "In seven days, God created the world. In seven seconds, I shattered mine." <br>  <br>  Ben commits suicide by dumping a box jellyfish into the bathtub with him. It stings him repeatedly as he howls and writhes. <br>    <br>  Totally committed to his "plan" and thus unconcerned with the "niceties" of life, Ben disregards such things as pet regulations at a motel. His "auditing" questions are sometimes downright rude, and he often makes other people feel very uncomfortable. Personal space and boundaries don't much matter to him, and as a result he comes off as a creepy stalker more often than not. <br>    <br>  This is a movie about a man who decides that life is not worth living anymore. His decision is made out of both guilt and grief—his wife died during a car accident he carelessly caused. Philanthropically wishing to help others as he makes his exit, he arranges for his vital organs to be transplanted into "worthy" people.|`|1f1723a276a7a216646a15bc2761f1b8aa	Hi there.<br>  It has Will Smith "acting" in it.

1wNsBNmxaa	There are actually many explanations as to what happened exactly between Paris and Nicole, but no official explanation has been offered by Paris or Nicole, so for now, this is what we believe happened.<br>  <br>  Actually, Paris has given us many hints, but most of them have been ignored by the media because it just doesn't fit their picture of her. One thing is clear though, Nicole has never given us any good hint about their feud. All she has said is that she just doesn't want to talk about it and that there was no chance for them to be friends again. Of course, that statement turned out wrong when they reconciled in Fall 2006 after Paris phoned her and asked her if she wanted to film together for Simple Life 5. The producers wanted Paris and Nicole to go on an island as campers, but neither Paris, nor Nicole wanted to go there alone, so that's how they reconciled.<br>  Ok, So What Made Them Hate Each Other?<br>  <br>  Paris has mentioned that there were a lot of things that the media made up about this feud, and that many of the things they have said and quoted her are completely false. She doesn't know to what extend they over-exaggerated, but she and Nicole just couldn't believe everything they were reading.<br>  <br>  Paris Hilton and Nicole RichieIn 2003, Paris and Nicole found worldwide fame with the premiere of the Simple Life. Everything was going well back then, and both seemed to be very popular. But then, according to Paris, Nicole got a bit jealous of Paris because she was the one who was getting the most attention, and no one cared about Nicole as Paris says "When I brought her on my show [Simple Life], she just got very jealous and turned on me for no reason. I think she just can't sand being around me because I get all the attention and people really don't care about her". This is likely to be true because Nicole has never been as popular as Paris. You can search on Google and you'll notice that Paris gets many more hits by far. Paris also felt betrayed because she brought her up on "[her] show," and made her famous, and now, she envies her. This message is also present in one of Paris' songs titled "Jealousy" which is clearly aimed at Nicole "I was always happy / When I was watching you become a star / But you were only happy / When the world was openin' up the scars." She actually wrote that song when they were breaking up.<br>  <br>  There is another famous claim that Nicole got jealous of Paris hosting Saturday Night Live, so one night she gathered all her friends and played the sex tape of Paris instead of her SNL episode, but Nicole has denied this. This rumour is likely to be false because it is made up by the media. When reporters asked about it to Paris, she said that she also heard that rumour, but didn't know whether or not it is true.<br>  <br>  <br>  зомби~~?|`|AA10458195	They are both spoiled brats.|`|BdA59Tr0aa	Isn't it that Nicole showed her all her friends the nasty video paris made and paris went mad?|`|Eo8gZ3FEaa	Paris got jealous that nicole lost weight and looked better than her with a better style!|`|Vge3KBaMaa	they fell out years ago over something silly , but are the best of friends again now and have been for a while.|`|ZSlaNKEkaa	Nicole grew up and Paris is still a retard.

DEGClROKaa	Yup. I have. My hubby is living proof!! ^_^|`|mF0L5jMNaa	No.  I think you can develop a relationship without meeting another person ... people used to do this all the time with letters while they were apart.  But unless you or someone you trust has met this person, you HAVE to be wary until you see them, where they live, where they work and a paycheck stub!|`|0j9rvsXAaa	I think you can but only if you talk to them on the phone instead of <br>  e-mailing them. It makes you feel much closer to them.|`|tGrkiIxxaa	No..... you can't because you have to be able to be with them to see if you can stand them...|`|IH00JKvAaa	No, I can't. I have to meet the person, and have long talk and meetings with him until my heart can probably beat for him!|`|1dMpQwsCaa	I guess!|`|npzN9t5daa	Maybe|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Absolutely you can.  I met my husband online when I wasn't even looking for a date.  I said to my cousin, "I'm going to marry that man."  And we are married with two children.|`|PpWosZsIaa	Yes|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	It's possible and people fall in love often. But they need to be careful, because it doesn't mean that they're in love with the actual person on the other end. They generally fall in love with their image or fantasy of the other person. Until you meet a person live and spend time with them in different situations, you can't say you know the person enough to truly love him or her. If you're online only, you'll at best learn a few things about the person (from the person) and you'll fill in the rest with your needs and imagination. A real time relationship will help you find out just how on-base or off-base you are.|`|AA10471659	Yes you can, there are marriages of people that met on YA, and some serious like by others.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	If you can, it's a horrible idea.|`|lwJF5DhHaa	yeah i found my bf online but he lives<br>  2 hours away from me|`|dprURFLxaa	Yes, I'm sure you can fall in love with an idea of a person's personality. It'll never be 100% accurate until you actually meet that person and get to know them outside of the internet but I'm sure it is possible just like it is anywhere...there are a lot of people here.|`|ewDKMeJkaa	i think yeah<br>  <br>  if u get to talk to them enough, see what they look like in pics, or preferably webcam, then yeah its possible<br>  <br>  not the easiest of relationships but i think it can be done|`|UlME0etLaa	I definitely think you can. I won't say more...keep it at that. But yes, definitely.|`|BJkfY3g4aa	Yes, it's possible.|`|HwfYEQUOaa	Sure, it happens all the time.|`|q9BItD25aa	My friend met a 300lb guy with one eye...does that answer the question..........|`|UIzaamJ7aa	No.|`|QlrXTEh0aa	yea
f551e387a3e6f01af266f4af899c09e9aa	Well my opinion is that his performance was awesome and it was oscar worthy.  Now comes the politics...he probably would not have won because of his age.  The academy would have taken the position that "he is young talented actor and will have many other chances to win another one."  Based on that probably the oscar would have gone to Robert Downy Jr because Hollywood loves a comeback story.  Downy has the comeback story of the year and it now on top of the world after being at the very bottom just a few years ago.  So to summarize, did Heath Ledge's performance merit an Oscar?  Yes, but he had not not passed away he would not have won, which would have been wrong.|`|J0c86UV1aa	it's always hard to say when the person has died before they are praised, hollywood seems to love their drama and heartfelt moments whether they are genuine or not.<br>  would nirvana have got as big as they did had not kurt died? would ne1 have known who courtney love was?<br>  u do have to ask yourself these questions.<br>  <br>  personally i think he did an amazing job in 'the dark knight', you can see that he had matured greatly as an actor and i think he really suprised everyone, it was his big breakthrough role.<br>  <br>  whether he deserved an oscar...i don't think we'd really know unless he was alive today|`|d55D0Ci4aa	Yes, I think he would have. His performance in The Dark Knight was amazing!  He was sooo good, it was hard to believe he wasn't really the joker!!  His performance was not a good performance, it was a phenomenal performance!!|`|p2L4AB5Laa	ya... his acting was amazing both ways.|`|i09pUyE4aa	i thought he was really good in the Dark Knight.<br>  in my opinion of course.<br>  but i also thought some of his older movies were pretty good, like Candy, so that also, obviously, effects my decision.<br>  <br>  so i do think he deserved the Oscar, because he was really good.<br>  but his death probably did have an impact and make it a secure, prominent choice for him to win.<br>  <br>  all this in my opinion of course.<br>  <br>  but the Tupac reference, i don't like tupac, so death doesn't really change my perception of the acting/singing/rapping.whatever talent.|`|HIek5iv2aa	He pulled off the role like a psychotic madman, no one will top his performance, Heath ledger is now forever the Joker.<br>  <br>  He was a good actor, Oscar caliber? Maybe. Remember the Dark Knight is still a superhero movie, that fact got overshadowed since Heath did such a great job, then died. But its not like D.K got a lot of nods, Heath is the favourite.... but with the Oscars.... the fav's dont always win.|`|PdrcYZAqaa	His performance was amazing, but he wouldn't have won.  Maybe nominated, but not won.|`|w7IP7cLDaa	abso-freaking-lutly!<br>  he was amazing in that movie.<br>  im not actually a fan of his, however, his characterization was abosulty amazing! he totally captured the joker better than ever before|`|P9wO6eRAaa	no it was good...but if he were alive he would not have won...b4 the movie came out people were already saying he would win|`|11ae9274d6ac42557a3111e69db42b49aa	Probably not.|`|n55igpCUaa	IMO yes. He was AWESOME in that movie.|`|qAL0CZIiaa	This year he would have. His category wasn't extremely competitive and he was very good in his role.

433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Ok.. What have i done in 12 years? fought a nasty cancer battle i almost didn't win, lived abroad temporarily, got involved with a violent partner for a while, took a series of temporary jobs, trained for and became a nurse, met my current husband, married him, amazingly managed to get pregnant a couple of times - Considering the amount of chemo therapy drugs that were floating around my body its a wonder i was still able to - miscarried them, now pregnant again. These ones appear to be sticking, and are in no hurry to come out. Not necessarily great when your almost 36 weeks into a twin pregnancy.. A lot has been squeezed into 12 years, and i didn't realise it was that much until i thought about it!|`|4472d6c8b8a41746c6129264601312c7aa	I'm almost there, it's been 9 years now.

One turns to the other and says: "You know last week I discovered that if you jump from the top of this building- by the time you fall to the 10th floor, the winds around the building are so intense that they carry you around the building and back into the window." The bartender just shakes his head in disapproval while wiping the bar.<br>  <br>  The 2nd Man says: "What are you a nut? There is no way in heck that could happen."<br>  <br>  1st Man: "No, it's true let me prove it to you." So he gets up from the bar, jumps over the balcony, and careens to the street below. When he passes the 10th floor, the high wind whips him around the building and back into the 10th floor window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar.<br>  <br>  The 2nd Man tells him: "You know I saw that with my own eyes, but that must have been a one time fluke."<br>  <br>  1st Man: "No, I'll prove it again" and again he jumps and hurtles toward the street where the 10th floor wind gently carries him around the building and into the window. Once upstairs he urges his fellow drinker to try it.<br>  <br>  2nd Man: "Well what the heck, it works, I'll try it." So he jumps over the balcony, plunges downward, passes the 11th, 10th, 9th, 8th floors and hits the sidewalk with a 'splat.'<br>  <br>  Back upstairs the Bartender turns to the other drinker:<br>  <br>  "You know, Superman, you're a real jerk when you're drunk."|`|Du1FrX3naa	a mexican goes to a vending machine for a soda, the soda cost $1.10, he puts in $1.00, the machine says "dime", so he whispers coca cola por favor<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  <br>  why has this winter been so cold? a slave owner once said, it'll be a cold day in hell when a black guys becomes president|`|hKqOQQ4uaa	how do you kill a blue elephant? a blue elephant gun. how do you kill a pink elephant? you plugg its nose till it turns blue and then shoot it with the blue elephant gun.|`|BosXJUoFaa	what do michael jackson and macdonalds have in common?<br>  <br>  they both stick their meat in 8 year old buns|`|GWBorz3Taa	your mom|`|P5skKG9oaa	roses r red<br>  watches r gold<br>  get on ur knees<br>  and do wat ru told

Some of the best stuff I have ever heard.  He's been going at it since like way early 90s and you don't hear much about him.  And when he came out with A Book with Mumbles doin all the beats it was fire.  And recognized as such deep underground but never got proper publicity.  All Aceyalone needs to blow up is the right notoriety.|`|T3X7Aci4aa	I think he has one of the 5 best discographies in the history of hip hop. It's unfortunate that he never broke into the mainstream. <br>  <br>  I'm not really liking the experimental turn he's taken  in the past couple years, but he's earned the right to try new things. I'm still looking forward to Aceyalone and The Lonely Ones, but my expectations aren't as high as they used to be.

Nhje1U06aa	Honestly I think it was given to him because of his death. His role was great as the joker,but not the best for the year.  I was crying during the acceptance speech from his parents and sis- So moving matilda will watch it when she is older and be proud of her Daddy!  did you seee the audience it was very emotional. <br>  for his parents and others it validated his life as an actor|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	If he hadn't killed himself, he never would have won. Jack Nicholson was a much better Joker, and will always be a much better actor.<br>  Dbear294, who gave him his meds?  HE DID!!! He took too much medication, on his own! It was an accident, BUT he is responsible! You weren't there either, so don't be a hypocrit!|`|AA10628838	Yes it is. He was a very promising actor. You could see all the tearful reactions from fellow actors when his family took the stage. Even after a year he is sadly missed. He took the movie away from Batman.|`|gEkLQWF4aa	Absolutely!! Did you see the movie? He was unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. I don't think they were biased at all, just because he died. He would have received that award even if he was still alive. It's a shame he's gone. He was a great contributor to the art of film.|`|4c7QomPoaa	My biggest concern is that it's always going to be a question "did he only get it because he died?"  Personally, yes, I think he did.  He was a marvelous actor and his portrayal of the Joker was incredible.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	I think so, I thought his performance was fantastic, believable, and scary.|`|qwvijKexaa	he deserves it man, the best joker actor i have seen...so far|`|EyAAFfaMaa	Well, to me he will always be justified in anything because he was and always will be my favorite actor. He was amazing in the Dark Knight, and it did deserve the recognition. However, yes I do believe the other nominees were also spectacular. It's just, in my opinion, Heath was better than all of them. It wasn't his best performance though, I've seen him in better roles, but it was nothing shy of stunning. He really did a great job, and I think he would have gotten the Oscar if he were alive too. Keep in mind, the Oscars are not fan-voted and many times the favorite doesn't win. It's actor's awards, and it is voted by the academy in some weird way (the supporting/lead thing is really weird). So, yeah. He deserved it, and yes I did cry when the guy announced his nomination, and again when he won, and again when his family was talking. He's amazing<3 <br>  <br>  & HE DID NOT KILL HIMSELF. Geez, this is to the person who so rudely said so: you weren't there and you don't know what happened. All we can go on is the police report which stated 'accidental overdose' and many of his friends' who have repeatedly said he would never leave his daughter like that.|`|Gz97TrW8aa	Are you kidding me?!?! Of course, Heath Ledger winning best supporting actor was justified. Have you seen the Dark Knight!?!?  Heath was amazing in his role as the Joker, and he did NOT just get the Oscar because he passed away. He won the Oscar because he was an amazing actor.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I saw the movie and think his work deserved the reward. <br>  <br>  However I did not see many of the other nominated movies for best supporting actor.|`|2NUKtY7Naa	He was brilliant in Batman.  Everyone was touched by the strength that heiths family had to get in front of all those people and thank them for the award that Heith should have gotten.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Yes definitely, his performance as the joker in the dark knight was legendary and he deserves to be awarded for it.|`|lC5erarUaa	He deserves it in every way. He's amazing.|`|M71hN9OBaa	absolutely. he was amazing!

bribxhsdaa	Latino History has been obscured a lot by the eurocentrism in public education as well as it generally not being talked about as much as Black History.<br>   <br>  Black history is book marked under Slavery and nothing else..<br>  I'm not comparing Latino suffering to Black suffering (I don't really believe in the comparison of suffering) But some of the stuff Latinos/Hispanics have been through is pretty messed up. <br>  <br>  I.e. Some of the atrocities by european spaniards in places like Cuba, and Puerto Rico. As well the cover up's of murders of Mexican immigrants along the border between the US and Mexico.|`|mZpCdihsaa	Are you kidding?<br>  Tell me you're kidding.|`|9wUrbqT3aa	I would say Blacks, do to the fact that Latino community still has there historical culture & idenity.  They can find out about there roots and have a history to be proud off.   <br>  <br>  I can not compare the physical suffering in the sense of torture, cuz it is bad all the way around, and some historical stories have not been told or documented in some regions<br>  <br>  While Blacks on the other hand, get told "...your people come from Africa"  Africa is a contentitent and the largest one at that.  So many countries, so many cultures....  Lations can attempt to uplift and build there native land & be proud of aspects of there history before the struggle.  While Blacks are forced to act as if there history starts from a kidnapping and a boat ride|`|d5169433fecfef522e3f23edcf9769d8aa	Well I think it'd also be useful to ask if there was really a 'black' identity that transcends cultures.

fYzytDScaa	It started to die when tupac died in my opinion, could you imagine how disappointed he would be with his genre. One "man" will be the death of it....Soulja boy.<br>  Lil wayne still sounds like he is 11|`|vyr2oBhtaa	My personal opinion is that the minute the first rapper from the south got air time Hip Hop was doomed lol. Honestly I think the next thing has to come out. I mean look at rock, the minute a certain genre or style sells out a new style or genre comes out to rebel against the previous one. This needs to happen with Hip Hop but it doesnt. Hip Hop is just the new pop in other words Lil Wayne and Soulja man replaced Britney Spears and NSync.|`|QNvBY1Wgaa	Modern maistream rap is all about selling ****. Be it jordans, alcohol or the rap lifestyle in general.

dpSTgytfaa	i dont know why people hated that movie, I have read everyone of his books and while it was a little twisted on story line, it was mostly what was said and done in the books.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for your question,<br>  <br>  As there are 4 more books after Hitchhiker's, I would love to see them all done, But sadely sequels usualy are only done if the first one did well in box office, and i dont believe it did.<br>  <br>  So i do hope there is a sequel would love to see Resturaunt At the end of the Universe done, and Especially So long and thanks for all the fish and see how they do the finale with God's final Message.<br>  <br>  By the way if you never read it, this is a funny final message:<br>  <br>  We apologize for the Inconvenience.|`|4IC78le4aa	God, I hope not

ebee988c7e88e57112c395fec80ac354aa	Its is possible.  The novel Q&A upon which the film was based sold well in the UK and received critical acclaim it was also successfully adapted for radio on BBC radio 4.  It is therefore not altogether surprising that the impetus to make the film derived from the UK.  When looking for funding the producers approached leading Bollywood film makers who were not interested citing the nature of the film as "un - Bollywood."  US distribute rs were initially unwilling to release the film.  <br>  <br>  The combination of great imaginative story and film craft coupled with director Danny Boyle's established reputation were able to overcome these obstacles and achieve richly deserved success.<br>  <br>  With the above points in mind it may have been possible for this success to have been achieved by and all Indian production had they shown the inclination.  There is no lack of film making talent in India but they have rarely made the effort to court western audiences.  Despite this I feel that this is still as much an Indian success as British and will hopefully herald further cooperation.  I would love to see an adaptation of the novel Shantram also set in Mumbui (not sure of spelling)|`|oZE510pGaa	if it had been produced or directed by an idian then i think it wouldnt of been relaesed to cinemas, even with danny boyle directing it was going to go straight to dvd. so with a foreigner it would of been a dvd movie|`|AA11927138	No because they would have not shown the slums in such bad light as the Indian government is trying to show itself as a developed country. For example the crazy idiots spent millions in the space program instead of helping their own people|`|eiSaaLxUaa	probabaly, its a good film.|`|zXHNSohTaa	I would like to think that yes, it would still have won. Danny Boyle, although not Indian, is himself an independent filmmaker outside of the big Hollywood system.|`|bltgAc9Maa	If SM was directed by an Indian director, it would become a musical movie just like any other typical Bollywood movies. There would be plenty of singing and silly dancing in it.|`|1f1723a276a7a216646a15bc2761f1b8aa	Hi there.<br>  Yes, it would - the Yanks are rewarding quality, respect to them for that.<br>  India doesn't produce big films like Slumdog. There is no way Bollywood would ever make such a gritty film, it deals in a highly stylised group of genres heavily censored and restricted in what they allow. While India does have small independent producers trying to make genuine films, they couldn't have produced Slumdog.<br>  Cheers, Steve.|`|0MZTh034aa	No.Oscar nominations require both publicity and talent.<br>  Amir's TZP couldn't get nominated as he was busy with Ghajini.<br>  He didn't publicise TZP .|`|7h5wxsL7aa	Guess not , but it would have won Bollywoods top honours.  Well done to Danny Boyle true honest gent and not a spoilt snob like most of the hollywood so called stars.|`|ttT7W77gaa	your right-its all hype

AhW8bAtaaa	Produced in part by Mike Vernon, who worked on The Legendary Christine Perfect Album, this is an entertaining and concise package of ten songs performed by the late Freddie King and a slew of guests. Opening with Gonzalez Chandler's "Pack It Up," featuring the Gonzalez Horn Section, the youthful legend was only 40 years of age when he cut this career LP two years before his death. Though no songs went up the charts like his Top Five hit in 1961, "Hide Away," Burglar is one of those gems that journeymen can put together in their sleep. Tom Dowd produced "Sugar Sweet" at Criteria Studios in Miami, FL, featuring Jamie Oldaker on drums, Carl Radle on bass, and guitarists Eric Clapton and George Terry, which, of course, makes this album highly collectable in the Clapton circles. The sound doesn't deviate much from the rest of the disc's Mike Vernon production work; it is pure Freddy King, like on the final track, E. King's "Come On (Let the Good Times Roll)," where his guitar bursts through the horns and party atmosphere, creating a fusion of the pure blues found on "Sugar Sweet" and the rock that fans of Grand Funk grooved to when he opened for that group and was immortalized in their 1973 number one hit "We're an American Band" a year after this record's release. Sylistically, Freddie King is from the same school as Buddy Guy, two men instrumental in bringing this art form to a mass audience. King stretches those sounds with great fervor on the Hayes/Porter number "I Had a Dream," containing the strength Mark Farner said the blues artist displayed in concert, which could snap a guitar neck. The voice of Freddie King is what drives J.J. Cale's "I Got the Same Old Blues," the horns and the guitar battling between verses and uniting to ooze under the guitarist's vocal expression. Rhythm guitarist Bob Tench, producer Mike Vernon, bassist DeLisle Harper, drummer Steve Ferrone, and pianist Roy Davies all co-write "Texas Flyer" with Freddie King, a prime example of the modern blues this artist was developing. With Brian Auger and Pete Wingfield contributing to the title track, Jerry Ragovoy's "She's a Burglar," this project stands as a solid representation of an important musician which is as enjoyable as it is historic. ~ Joe Viglione, All Music Guide<br>  <br>  Burglar<br>  Freddie King - Burglar<br>  <br>  Burglar Track Listing<br>  Credits of Burglar<br>      * Chris Mercer<br>      * Sax (Tenor), Horn Arrangements<br>      * Jamie Oldaker<br>      * Drums<br>      * Carl Radle<br>      * Bass<br>      * Dick Sims<br>      * Organ, Keyboards<br>      * Bob Tench<br>      * Guitar<br>      * George Terry<br>      * Guitar<br>      * Donnie Vie<br>      * Vocals, Vocals (Background)<br>      * Pete Wingfield<br>      * Piano, Clavinet, Keyboards, Piano (Electric)<br>      * Roger Dopson<br>      * Liner Notes<br>      * Bob Defrin<br>      * Art Direction<br>      * Slick Lawson<br>      * Photography<br>      * Peter Palombi<br>      * Illustrations, Cover Illustration<br>      * Mick Eves<br>      * Sax (Tenor)<br>      * Mike Vernon<br>      * Percussion, Producer, Drums, Remastering, Remixing<br>      * Brian Auger<br>      * Organ<br>      * P.P.

Ns5miQQmaa	Push.  the action is not graphic, the story is understandable and the actors do their jobs well.  Valkyrie would be okay for the history buff, but you'd spend alot of time explaining historical details otherwise.  also the language used in Valkyrie is more graphic (use F-word once, S-word a plenty).  Ive seen both films. Push, no question|`|9wQmi5P4aa	I Work in a Cinema and would recommend PUSH.

za9b8cHKaa	I really respect the way Isla Fisher shook off the ex-soap star tag and reinvented herself as a Hollywood actress. However, I do agree with you that her voice is rather irritating.

d4Uz4FqZaa	The movie will be released in 2010. But, I think the movie itself won't be released in 2010. As we know, there's a little development about the movie itself. We only know that Avi Arad who made Spiderman, Ghost Rider, Iron Man, etc will be the producer and Don Payne who wrote Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer will be the screenwriter. Then, there's a rumor that Jimmy Jax Pinchak and Calum Worthy will act as Gazzy and Iggy, but the rumor disappeared. Well, I think the movie itself will need a long time for the production. As we know, the casts themselves haven't been chosen. So, I think that it won't be in 2010. But still, I really wish the movie to be released quickly because I love Maximum Ride so much.|`|bOOsPq8Xaa	In January 2007 it was announced that a film would be created based on the Maximum Ride series. The producer will be Avi Arad, one of the producers of Spider-Man, X-Men and other Marvel movies.

On August 7, 2008, it was announced that Columbia Pictures bought the screen rights to the franchise, and that Don Payne would write the screenplay. The release date of the movie is 2010|`|9kYbFuJgaa	2010<br>  <br>  An exact date for its release hasn't been announced yet.

Keeping the attack to herself, Mary Ann runs away, seeking to lose herself in Manhattan by renting a seedy flat and taking a job in a dime store. Overwhelmed by people's hostility and her own despair, Mary Ann tries to jump off the Manhattan Bridge, only to be stopped by Mike, a garage mechanic who takes her back to his modest basement apartment nearby. At first appreciative of Mike's kindness, Mary Ann becomes terrified when he refuses to let her leave. Is Mike really Mary Ann's rescuer - or is he another rapist? She ends up faling in love with Mike and stays with him, against even her mother's good advice.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If the movie is Hindi, then the responder above me is probably correct. Here's what IMDb had to say about the movie called Raja Ki Ayegi Baraat (1997). "A pretty schoolteacher named Mala (Rani Mukherjee) becomes the victim of the unwanted advances of an evil man named Raja (Shadab Khan). When she rejects him, he rapes her. The teacher then takes him to court but to her horror the judge compels her to marry the rapist as part of the punishment. She does so and the rest of the film is about how she wins him and his equally evil family over by her goodness and innocence."

Txg9UpBOaa	youtube thats were i learned most of the stuff i neo ......... just type in guitar lessons|`|xwIcuEaXaa	I still think the best way to learn is from a teacher, but the best internet source I've found is a guy on youtube by the name of Justin Sandercoe. He really knows what he's talking about. I reccommend him very much. He's got all of his lessons on his website, and he usually has 6 or 7 vidoes all pertaining to one thing on his site. He's very thorough.
31CUQuKNaa	first your new boy Friend should not have any say in the matter. this is between u and your x. and most divorce,s are nasty but after time we all get over that and remember why each other was in love at one point. talk to your x and ask him tell him what u think u should do and why and let him tell u why he needs your help at this point in his life. your new bf dose not have any ties with him so he dont care and is prob a little jelouse of your x. this is between u and the x thats all.

H2qEN27daa	I guess I'm just repeating the other answers, but they blinded him in order to be a more profitable singer/beggar on the streets. They heated up a spoon and then according to Salim (the kid's bro) they 'took his eyes out'. The rag I believe was like chloroform to knock him out while they blinded him.|`|VJ2aG6znaa	In his ear?  They blinded him.  Blind beggars earn more because people feel sorry for them.  He was the blind kid later on that told them where to find the girl.|`|4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	That old man used a heated spoon to remove the child's eye.|`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	I believe they blinded him. Apparently he had more value as a beggar on the streets as a blind child. There were some very disturbing moments in that film.
upTcPaAyaa	Here's my recommendations!<br>  <br>  *movies with twist ending<br>  <br>  -Saw, the first one is really good (horror)<br>  -Derailed, with Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston, pretty entertaining (thriller)<br>  -Scream, slasher movie, you'll  keep guessing who's the real killer throughout the movie (horror)<br>  -Butterfly Effect, time travelling movie starring Ashton Kutcher (thriller)<br>  <br>  <br>  *my other recommendations,<br>  -There's Something About Marry<br>  -Notting Hill<br>  -Closer<br>  -Wanted<br>  -Live Free or Die Hard<br>  -Bourne Ultimatum<br>  -Love Actually<br>  -Hills Have Eyes (remake)<br>  -Dawn of the Dead (remake)<br>  -the Ruins<br>  -Forgetting Sarah Marshall|`|Anmy2yehaa	I think you should watch Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Its kind of interesting.|`|SvEt3d8Gaa	SLUM DOG MILLIONAIRE|`|4x2KMVbBaa	The Butterfly Effect|`|ORbsQ8jtaa	Shake Rattle and Roll by Viva films ,i think its suspense|`|LDfXMfyYaa	i watched "righteous kill" today wicked movie|`|SZZkfVzbaa	Road Kill was really good. [I think it's called ''Joy Ride'' in America and Britain]. That's a Thriller.<br>  <br>  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was really good. Don't get the old ones; they're really disappointing. The one from 2003 [with Jessica Biel] is the best version!<br>  <br>  Hostel 1 and 2 were really good, but they have a lot of Nudity and such. They're still great though :)<br>  These are definitely Horrors!<br>  <br>  Wrong Turn was good, but WACK. That's a Horror.<br>  <br>  The Butterfly Effect is one of my favourite movies EVER. It's got Ashton Kutcher in it, and starts off with him when he's younger and he's messing around with his friends putting Firecrackers in Letterboxes. It all goes terribly wrong [i'm not telling you how, you have to watch it yourself!] and he gets very Traumatized, ending up in Therapy. He has kept journals ever since the accident and can 'Time Travel' to that particular time by reading them. Depending on where he is, different scenarios occur such as him 'waking up to discover that he doesn't have arms, for example! It has many twists throughout the whole movie, and also an unpredictable ending. This is a Thriller. <br>  <br>  I also liked Panic Room. It has Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart in it [Kristen plays Bella in Twilight]. I think she was 14 in Panic Room.<br>  <br>  The Saw movies are VERY good, but you have to watch the very first one to understand the next one, and so on. They aren't the type of movie you can watch with lots of people talking; you have to listen to everything carefully to understand the whole thing. All the Saw movies have very big Twists :)<br>  <br>  HAVE FUN :)|`|FoF1651raa	recently:<br>  -slum dog millionaire<br>  -twilight<br>  -yes!man<br>  -pink panther 2<br>  -saw 5<br>  <br>  <br>  future:<br>  -friday the thirteenth<br>  -transformers:revenge of the fallen<br>  -x-man origins:wolverine<br>  -the A team<br>  -harry potter and the half blood prince <br>  <br>  <br>  past:<br>  -far from heaven(2002)<br>  -the station agent(2003)<br>  -shrek 2(2004)<br>  -spiderman 2(2004)<br>  -Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith(2005)<br>  -harry potter and the goblit of fire(2005)<br>  -pirates of the carribean dead man's chest(2006)<br>  -the exorcist(unknown)|`|UdICTUnaaa	the curious case of benjamin button<br>  slumdog millionaires<br>  w.<br>  half baked is always a good watch<br>  hostle and hostle 2<br>  joyride 1 and 2|`|e9bv4ijlaa	Righteous kill Robert de Niro & Al Pacino good movie with a twist<br>  I didn't copy the person above.|`|US33hgbJaa	A great thriller by a great director is The Panic Room.

jROpVbrhaa	Yes i do believe in love.Its only us who makes it complicated.Valentines for me is everyday.I only give my heart to the man i love so dearly.(my husband)|`|e1d902a1e3f67c79f0006f242202774daa	yes.<br>  <br>  valentine's day is a day where you show your appreciation to someone you love (it can be any other day, but the vibe of valentine's day is quite inspiring and romantic at the same time).<br>  <br>  valentine's day also marks the day where you can give cute random stuff to your crush and not be labeled as stalker :D|`|RqevddVvaa	I have loved many people in my life. It is a feeling that belongs to each of us and no one can ever steal it from us. We get to keep it for as long as we want.

It doesn't even have a religious meaning (I mean in the orthodox religion we do celebrate the saint but that's about it).....I've only ever celebrated it with like only a romantic dinner with my boyfriend (ex-boyfriend actually) but nothing more.|`|70d867ec0ce9c05d098a7efb66f7d809aa	Love is a very hurt-full game, once you  love someone with all your heart and are ready to sacrifice everything for them.  They can lead you on, but they don't really love you, then one-day they just leave u without a goodbye and never want to know you  ever again.<br>  Love is very heart-breaking and if anyone loves someone please be care-full, as u only love once and let it be with someone that deserves your devotion.<br>  Valentines day is just a day that card factories have made up, for money....|`|wdBtjILRaa	Yes I believe in love .love is the most beautiful thing in the world Valentine days means that show ur love & feeling 4 those person whose u love most<br>  It is not necessary that it would be your boyfriend it can be ur parents & family members also|`|90faa4cd94ef7f4fc6117ba415c52a62aa	yeh , i guess most of the ppl do .<br>  good try to get most of the stars n thumbs , bt , do u belive in love and knw the meaning of it n valentines day ?|`|lmVkN0VVaa	hey angel -x- <br>  sure, you see it everywhere! i love love lol, i don't really celebrate Valentine's day, but its nice to see people who do! :) <br>  <br>  have a nice monday! :)|`|QMqAac1Yaa	Yes, I believe in love but I don't believe in Valentine's Day because everyday is the day of the lovers.|`|NRqlZYZfaa	Yes:)|`|or5cHjHDaa	i believe in love|`|fcHN7Mrcaa	No.|`|9LvLGfb1aa	no<br>  for me it is like....<br>  just a time pass.......<br>  like ...........<br>  just a waste of time..........|`|kGCd8ioRaa	yes|`|wz8gx3gaaa	Yes.|`|RoBmEehMaa	yes i do i have 2 kids and a wife|`|14f68b3ce9b74fe1effcb259219a38a9aa	More than anything else in this world.|`|uJskRjP7aa	Yes i do :)|`|TuGkVqwraa	Yes Dear.

c4GykfVkaa	yeah i know what you mean, that's why i don't watch oscars any more. they always choose by political or by some other reasons and they never judge how good the movie really is.

I AM UGLY and it doesn't bother me in the least.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	in this day and age, anything is considered offensive, whether it really is or not.<br>  <br>  so i imagine, it could work in reverse too.|`|iddMxOroaa	To the person saying the insult to you it is still an insult, to you it is not, simple.|`|rMmVuHEhaa	Insult is an insult but everything is about how you perceived it. But to me no one get away with an insult...they will get what they deserve one way or another..|`|B9Jfs2YTaa	Yeah
AA10954702	Its because in today's world, that's the cool thing. Its like the in 70's bell bottom jeans were sweet.. but unlike bell bottom jeans, I don't see this dying anytime soon.

Not you eXoTiC.|`|jUEoujN2aa	idk maybe because black people are the best at flaunting (stuntin). and maybe that's what people like to do. i like wearing black clothes like baggy stuff but i don't talk black.|`|V2c0dAtwaa	ew... that's borderline racist.. haha

IkWcwsj8aa	FACESPACE|`|iTa38Xkdaa	Myspace for me<br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  Its just a question of which site you prefer, I prefer myspace because it has unlimited photo uploads. I use myspace for people i've met from the internet, and random people. I use facebook for everyone I know in real life.<br>  <br>  :D|`|czAbrzcUaa	Myspace is definitely better! Facebook seems a bit stalkerish.|`|tgbO359Aaa	myspace, that's just my opinion tho|`|pRpgbuqiaa	Myspace and Facebook are not very similar. Myspace is a website to make more-or-less random friends who have similar interests. It is a site for interaction in a structured way, but structured differently than Facebook. Myspace has chat rooms and message boards and groups where people who generally don't know each other have conversation. A lot of Myspace users are music fans and add all of their favorite musicians / bands as friends. Some people try to acquire as many Myspace friends as possible, and people with more than 15,000 friends actually get invited to "Myspace Pimp" parties.<br>  <br>  Facebook is strictly for talking to people you know in the real world. Facebook's policy is that you aren't supposed to add people you don't know. This keeps your network free of random people. Facebook is one of the best sites ever made, it's easy to chat with people. When you set up a Facebook account, in a few weeks your network might consist of every friend you've had in your life. I talk to people I haven't seen in 20 years on FB. It's a nice service.|`|emUJYL0caa	i had a myspace and deleted it because i was tired of getting added by creepy guys i didn't know, i have a facebook and use it a lot as a lot of my friends live across the country. myspace i think is more for teenagers whereas facebook is aimed at the 18+ group. i think i read somewhere that you have to be over 16 to have a facebook but there's no age minimum for myspace... creepy as anyone can hide behind a glittery profile but on facebook your friends know who you are.|`|RAiBtbMLaa	i love myspace.. and i agree.. facebook is so lame. like no layout, no song.. wtf? and omg.. i'm sooo addicted to myspace. i swear i'm on like.. 24/7. :]|`|eVsbtvi9aa	FACEBOOK|`|8tGAE1Nmaa	I go to facebook and yes i have myspace and dont like it as well as facebook is...|`|ODvnyAdlaa	myspace, facebook is so confusing it makes me crosse eyed x|`|CpNVSJpmaa	myspace , but the pub is much better than both ;)|`|lEjYhwxkaa	none|`|IxOP4qbYaa	FACEBOOK|`|upr4aUwCaa	MySpace is better.|`|vQVAZM66aa	Myspace is full of pervs..<br>   I prefer Facebook. :]|`|FxwTtM8Faa	NEITHER!!!<br>  if id have to choose. id be facebook|`|eeKlogL4aa	Yahoo|`|6aawDPkSaa	well i have myspace cause my frends have it|`|ZDOfXBd2aa	Myspace.<br>  <br>  Facebook is boring and confusing.|`|UlME0etLaa	Facebook.

I really hope he loses to Pein and almost loses his life.<br>  <br>  Pein (the bodies being controlled)? They come back to life and take Naruto back to the base.<br>  <br>  Nagato? What I think is going to happen... is that the author's going to spend three or more chapters of him doing nothing but talking and explaining about this or that, complete with flashbacks. But I really hope it doesn't drag on for that long.<br>  <br>  Konan? I think she'll probably be by Nagato's side and protect him.<br>  <br>  Sasuke? He'll come and save Naruto when he finally snaps out of his craze. :) Either that or he and Madara plan out the ultimate war and start killing everyone...<br>  <br>  Madara? He still does not show us what he really looks like... At least not for another fifty chapters or something. :( <br>  <br>  Kabuto? I don't know about him... Maybe he'll pop out in the future chapters and add a big plot twist.<br>  <br>  Tsunade? I think she's been alive for too long. So she might die... or at least take a long time to recover.<br>  <br>  Kisame? What did happen to him? <br>  <br>  anyone else? Kakashi. A part of me is happy that he's dead(?) [well it's a big shock with the character death and all that] and another is sad. But if he comes back alive... I'll be very disappointed because most characters tend to stay dead unless he becomes a zombie... Doubt it.|`|o6xKlv1Maa	sORRY IM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS ANIME'<br>  ......... peace!!|`|VKRmIj6Gaa	Yo Taizen-sama!!!<br>  Naruto?>>I am not sure...

He might be another one who dies... if so I will be very angry! he is pretty cool and doesn't get enough credit...<br>  <br>  Tsunade?>>I get the feeling she is probably not going to die after all but it depends on what Sasuke and madara have up their sleeves... either way Naruto will become hokage!!!! >=D<br>  <br>  Kisame?>>I think Kisame will finally be killed!!! >=D<br>  <br>  anyone else?<br>  >>everyone will die!!!! >=D JK JK JK! lol <br>  <br>  See ya later bro!<br>  <br>  R.I.P Kakashi sensei|`|AA10153769	naruto- idk but i hope he gets captured<br>  that way things get interesting<br>  <br>  pein- i hope they all die!!! well they kinda did except for the one that replels<br>  <br>  nagato- i hope we learn more about him and why he's in that state<br>  <br>  konan- don't really care<br>  <br>  sasuke- i wonder what he's doing right now<br>  i want to see his reaction to what has happened in Konohagakure<br>  <br>  madara- i don't think he'll show yet but maybe (so confused lol)<br>  <br>  kabuto- die die die!!!! he'll probably play an important role later, but i don't expect anything important to happen in the near future<br>  <br>  tsuande- heal the wounded??<br>  <br>  kisame- i would probably want to see his reaction too<br>  <br>  anyone else- dance<br>  <br>  cant' wait for the next chapter!!! ^_~<br>  <br>  huggz

aymBTRlyaa	I agree with you.|`|c0XomxxEaa	I think pisces are very submissive - male pisces tend to be anyway, from experience.. I think aries can be quite kinky when it comes to that stuff.. and swing bth ways, as im an aries. Tauruses tend to be in quite lets say "strange" relationships.. were there quite abusive of there partner but happy in doing it.. ina good way.. especially the couple taurus and gemini which ive seen ALOT. Ive actually never come across a scorpio closely.. but definetely would like to now!!!
D7JZPxDzaa	no i don't think that he deserved it. <br>  <br>  he did a good job but i don't think it was worth an oscar and the only reason they gave him it is because he is dead. Personally, I would have liked to have seen josh brolin or robert downey jr win because i felt that they deserved it. But regardless of what people think, heath ledger got the award because he died and i think its a shame that someone can win an oscar for being a drug addict.|`|WMln6cShaa	I am thrilled that he got the Oscar, he absolutely deserved it.  As for the next movie.. no one else could possibly do justice to the Joker after his breathtaking performance, so I think they will kill him of and just tell the audience about it, not show it.|`|3yNvJ30jaa	Im soo glad he won. I cried though...He really deserved it. they cant kill him off....if they decide to make another movie they will prolly just use diff. villians and not even have joker. I dont relly mind what they do. Chris Nolan will think of something.. <3<br>  <br>  <br>  R.I.P Heath we love you!!!!!|`|akcGfgdcaa	I don't think they're going to use the Joker character in the next movie, I don't think there would be much point in doing it so soon after Heath Ledger's performance which would be hard to compete with. <br>  <br>  But yeah I am real glad that Heath won the Oscar, I felt it was much deserved.|`|1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	I cheered when they announced his name.<br>  <br>  Out of respect for Ledger, they ought to retire the character.|`|Sx5HDgtpaa	I didn't know that but now I really happy he won the award.  He deserved it.|`|JmHBplRIaa	Oh, I was delighted! He was so deserving of the award, despite all the buzz going about that he only got it out of sympathy because he was dead. I mean, did you see who he was up against? There wasn't much competition. People should just focus on the fact that Heath was a truly amazing actor who starred in many great films. He will be sorely missed by me and, I'm sure, many others.<br>  <br>  As for the next Batman film, I heard a rumour that the shooting team have enough footage of him to get a cameo in the next film. Perhaps in one of the cells in Arkham or something. I'd love it if they brought the asylum onto the big screen (was it mentioned in Batman Begins? I can't remember) as it was a pretty important building in the comics. Maybe it could be part of the plot? Like, they've just built it and all the loons are going in and then one escapes and causes havoc, forcing Batman to come back or something. I dunno, I don't write screen-plays.<br>  <br>  The main villain is supposedly going to be the Riddler or Catwoman so I wouldn't worry about them recasting the Joker. That would be absurd.|`|eLaU52zLaa	He totally deserved it! If he were still alive, I bet the Oscars would have had a better show going on because he would have really made the crowd more excited. He said in one of his last interviews that it was probably the most fun he ever had in the movie business.|`|DjoyUTf3aa	I'm so glad that Heath Ledger got the award, it was very much deserved.<br>  <br>  I don't think they will have The Joker in the next film...the character got caught/whatever, so I don't think there was much more of a story about him anyway.|`|vLmgRAvNaa	Yes I am glad, I thought Eddie Murphy was going to play the Riddler|`|XAjCXViuaa	Yes, i was glad that he won it!<br>  He deserves it <br>  <br>  :)

Sometimes they get drunk and have their friends over until four in the morning. But they're out of the country a lot, so they don't bother me.|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	No, he's not noisy.

I also hear their dog's tail wagging on the kitchen floor and it sounds like someone banging on the floor all the time.|`|VU97XJzfaa	They are noisy and I'm beginning to think it is simply because they are inconsiderate clods.  The apartment manager has even spoken to them a few times and they still blast their music at 1 and 2:00 in the morning.  They know that my wall is right next to the one where they have their stereo, but does that stop them? NO!  And not only that, their cats are pains in the a$$ too. They're a family full of stupid humans and stupid pets.|`|W56Wz7qkaa	no my neighbours are really quiet it is me mr funky  bunny who is the noisy neighbour on my street.|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	They aren't noisy, thank goodness.|`|AA11634944	Because they are a fleet of hambeasts who enjoy pissing me off.|`|ZLI6K9Qmaa	Yes, she loves to scream and slam doors.

I don't remember where I got it. So please excuse me for not giving credit where credit is due.  <br>  <br>  "There are a lot of postings (with Y!A acknowledgement) about users having difficulty in displaying 360 pics as avatars. I always post explaining how I overcome my "glitches" in that regards but have had little practical feedback (not sure posters are understanding the words coming out of my keyboard) so am posting a thread about it. Not saying all or any other's problems are the same as mine but surely some are. This is for those that it helps.<br>  <br>  #1) Go to "My Profile" - (your Answers profile page)<br>  #2) Click on "Edit My Info"<br>  #3) Click on "Use my Yahoo! 360 Photo"<br>  #4) Click on "Preview" - then click "OK"<br>  #5) Click on the "My 360 profile" link <br>  #6) Click on "My Page" <br>  #7) Click on "Edit Personal Photos" above your 360 pic <br>  <br>  #8a) IF the pic you want to use is NOT listed, click on "Browse". Choose a pic to download - click "Open" (the pic will still not show but the url will) - click on "Save" - then go to #9 below. <br>  (My 360 profile page will only save three pics, although it says four - you will have to remove a photo if 3 are showing - "glitch #1)) -<br>  <br>  #8b) IF the pic you want IS showing click on "Set as primary" - then "Save" - then go back to your Answers profile page - if pic not showing hit refresh - you should now be done).<br>  <br>  #9) Click on "Edit Personal Photos" (yes, again - "glitch" #2)<br>  #10) Check "Set as primary" for desired pic - click on "Save"<br>  #11) Return to your Answers profile page, if pic not showing hit refresh - you should be done<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: In 8a when I said that after clicking "Open" (to download chosen pic) the pic will not show after downloading - THAT maybe should be called "glitch" #2. This is related to having to click on "Save" and then re-enter by clicking on "Edit My Personal Photos" again so I'm not sure which is the actual "glitch" - that the pic doesn't show after downloading or that you have to re-enter the "edit" function again to see the pic and set as "primary".

FXwm8rSBaa	I loved Slumdog Millionare. Especially because it gave input to all of us how these people are living in India, with barely any money, shelter, food but still they have hearts worth even more than gold. They always share a sense of brother/sisterhood no matter what to people they have met yesterday or 20 years ago. It is true, that there are many in the slums who aren't like that, but deep inside the heart of it, there may as well be another unbelievable story inside about the slums. They struggle so much in life, pickpocketing and living with gangsters and have to face so many tradgedies in life. I also loved that Danny Boyle incorporated the traditional Bollywood story line: Eternal Love, a lot more maturely than most garbage Bollywood Movies that indian directors produce. I reccomend Slumdog Millionare to all. You just need to be openminded to be able to watch and love it. Give it a try if you haven't because it was more than worth it for me. =)|`|PqI2iqSSaa	i saw it and it was very good. Im a 15 year old kid who likes comedy and not drama but i was surprised. And it wasn't depressing at all, it actually made me happy. Some parts are sad but otherwise it was great. go see it definetly and you will like it. Best movie I saw inawhile besides Gran Torino|`|7pDn7WoTaa	i have seen it, it was good. it wasn't as good as many thought it was, but i will agree that it is worth seeing. <br>  the actors are new faces and they are pretty talented. even though Dev doesn't have a legit indian accent. lol it will do. it was a low budget movie! <br>  but i am really happy it won 8 oscars! <br>  esp the music it's fabulous!!! a.r. rahman is amazing!|`|fZR2Biihaa	Saw it. It's amazing really touching|`|vz543ABMaa	never heard of it....just like all the other movies at the Oscars.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	I saw it a while ago.  It won the Toronto Film Festival prize so I seeked it out.  It was my favorite movie of 2008 so I can't argue the Oscars it won.  I haven't seen every movie from 2008 (like Milk or Changeling), but I'm fairly sure it was the best one, because I've seen a lot of them.|`|jlrb0ZXoaa	it was good. not as great as most say, but definitely good. somewhat unbelievable story though.|`|GWv92NUhaa	Well I've seen it. And I absolutely loved it! I thought it was amazing. Not like many other movies out there. It won 8 Oscars the other night, and it deserved them. I think its clever how the main characters life is being told through a game show (Who wants to be a millionaire) its just, overall, a really great movie.|`|BJIo6twUaa	I never heard of it until recently. So i did look into what its about, it didnt appeal to me. So you can add me to the side of the people that havent seen it.|`|H2qEN27daa	I saw it yesterday and I did like it. It had a really good story with good characters. It definitely deserved to win all the awards it's been racking up!|`|k9NapIsdaa	I saw it and hated it. It was rather very depressing.

If you get drunk, you start to do things you normally wouldn't, even if your not a christian, a lot of people regret what they do on a night out.<br>  So if your drunk, then i can kind of agree with your question, but that really only applies if you believe in god and the devil|`|44eKDvkhaa	It's only evil if you get one of those drinks where the little fruits are impaled on the little swords.

It is the work of the devil.|`|ZxOGKZOkaa	If you read the Book of Mormon, it will have All the answers for you, at least so I'm told.  I refuse to touch the thing.

Its their life and their choice. Like you said, all man are equal and they are like any other man or woman.

Those who believe it's wrong because of god should just consider themselves lucky not to be in that situation and mind their own business. Who are they to judge somebody when they will never know what it's like to be discriminated against for being a certain way?<br>  <br>  The name is Amemememe by the way...<br>  <br>  "i think they are trying to destroy a very religious and beautiful thing. marriage is one hundred percent religious, because it was created by religion. if you are gay, you obviously are not religious, because no religion says that being gay is okay. they should not have the right to get married. it is disgusting. the only thing that homosexuality brings to the world is diseases and low morals. im fine with someone being gay, just don't push your," we want to get married crap on me". you can be gay, just don't bug the straight people about it."<br>  <br>  I think you are sick. Sick because you wish to control other people's lives. Did you realize it is possible to have a non-religious marriage?!? I have several gay friends and a majority of them believe in god, because after all if there was one he created them gay, right? Not everyone follows your religion anyways so stop pushing YOUR views onto everybody. Every man and woman is created equal and we all are entitled to do WHAT WE WANT with our lives.

No, the church doesn't have 2 recognize it, but the church  does not legislate law.<br>  <br>  btw... those who state marriage as a religious event don't seem 2 recognize that their "God" and their "Bible" r not the only philosophies on the planet. Also, a justice of the peace at the county building or even a captain out at sea can perform the ceremony, and have it recognize. wtf|`|5pj25lL4aa	exactly. even though im christian ,and they look down on gays, i still support others' lifestyles. if they choose to get married then let them<br>  <br>  it's all a PERSONAL choice. people cannot hold back our free will. <br>  <br>  and with the whole thing about that the declaration of independence saying that "all men [and women] are created equal, i completely agree. no one should be held back from their feelings or beliefs. it's all written in the constitution and all of the other important documents of our history|`|tGmwqtr5aa	no.

eT6SsCaraa	I'm a Sagittarius Rising, and I didn't know what their traits are so I did a little research...<br>  <br>  Sagittarius Rising<br>  The Sagittarian Ascendant is very leggy, with long flexible arms and mobile faces. The attitude is one of enthusiasm and optimism, with an outgoing approach that is hard to resist. The Sagittarian Ascendant likes to meet people from all walks of life and bounds into conversations without a second thought. This will be modified by planets in the First House and by the position of jupiter, the ruler of Sagittarius, in the natal chart.<br>  Usually , the body is well proportioned, high forehead, blue or bluish-grey eyes. Their eyes are liquidy, and convey much expression. Straight nose or very little bent, complexion is fresh and fair, Also, they are ususally tall and the body is wiry. They have an athletic face and a body with rounded shoulders and strong upper legs (Sagittarius - the centaur rules the liver, hips, thighs, pelvis and the femur).<br>  <br>  Hmm..  I have to say I guess it is partly true, one of my eyes are blue/greyish, and I have a high forehead and strong upper legs. My eyes are very emotional.. my shoulders are rounded... and my nose is pretty straight except for a tiny bend near the end. However, I tend to get breakouts...>.< And I'm short, not so wiry. I wouldn't say I have an athletic face or body really. At all. No long arms or legs.<br>  <br>  It says it is influenced by my Jupiter, which happens to be... Virgo<br>  Virgo Rising<br>  With Virgo rising, the presentation is neat and precise, with no flamboyant clothes or loud gestures. The features may be unremarkable, the attitude fussy and perfectionist, but once past the barrier of reserve, there will be a delightful earthy sense of humor. This will be modified by any planets in the First House and by the position of Mercury, the ruler of Virgo, in the birth chart<br>  Virgo rising inclines to medium to below-average height; the body can be quite "delicate" and/or it can be compact. For some of you, the limbs may be disproportionately longer than the trunk of the body. The head normally is roundish, rather short, but usually well proportioned.<br>  The hair may be rather coarse, brown to black in color. The body could have an abundance of hair. Eyebrows may be fine, thin, and shaped well. The skin may have a very good texture and tend to be light in its pigmentation. Teeth tend to be average in size, well spaced, and usually of generally good quality. The voice is normally rather soft; however, it can sound a bit flat and somewhat lacking in coloration. Overall, it is the general neatness and cleanliness typical to Virgo which really catches the eye.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say my presentation is neat or precise.. I am a perfectionist though, when it comes to some things. I hate flamboyant clothes and loud gestures, so that fits. I am below average height.. and have light skin.. I am petite and delicate.. I can't say the rest really fits.<br>  <br>  I was curious and took a look at my moon sign, Libra... <br>  Libra<br>  The appearance is attractive and refined. There is a tendency to dress well but not too flamboyantly. The manner will be charming, with the air of a diplomat or mediator. There will usually be another person present as Libra does not like to be alone. This will be modified by planets in the First House, and by the position of Venus, the ruler of Libra, in the chart.<br>  <br>  I think I'll say that doesn't describe me at all. <br>  <br>  So, onto my sun sign, Pisces...<br>  The Pisces will have a dreamy, vague, faraway look. But the attitude will be one of great compassion and kindness until they lose faith in someone. Then they can become very "cold fish". Pisces rules the feet, and there is usually something noticeable, such as very small feet, or very tender feet that have difficulty finding comfortable shoes. This will be modified by planets in the First House or by the position of Neptune, the ruler of Pisces, in the natal chart.<br>  As can be expected, this is a very romantic and enchanted placement - often accompanied by a love of the glamorous. Pisces rising are rarely tall - they also tend to carry water on the body in a pear shape fashion. This shape is often repeated in specific areas of the body, such as the head - a narrow forehead widens to give a wideness below the eyeline. The frame tends to be relatively small and well proportioned. Some may appear flat down their back, but they will display a certain broadness. Arms and legs are usually short; hands may be small and 'artistic.' This ascendant often gives the individual large, dreamy eyes and long, thick lashes. The mouth and lips may be soft and sensitive; the nose small and well-formed. The feet may be unusual in some way. Pisces rising are often talkative characters and with emotion too.<br>  <br>  Besides the talkative part.. I have to say that's practically right on the mark. ^_^ Small, artistic hands.. my feet are small too, and my my second to last toe is shorter than my pinky toe. That's how I carry my weight unfortunately, although I'm not fat. My face is shaped differently though.. Everything else is right. :)|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	I have Gemini Rising.<br>  <br>  Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Pluto Trine my Ascendant and Neptune is in Opposition to my Ascendant.<br>  <br>  Yep, I pretty much look like a Gemini Rising. Tall, slender, long arms and legs, and swan neck. It makes me sound like l look like a flamingo but it really all fits together pretty well lol.|`|B7WIZdglaa	Well i wont really answer this because you know what I am and what I look like, lol. But I will say that you look sort of like a Virgo! Small, soft, feminine features. I would think you were an aquarius with a virgo rising.  Very pretty though :)|`|eVt0qkT8aa	I have an Virgo ascendant and I'm quite tall (6"4) and look skinner than I am. I'm pretty much a big guy D: .|`|369vsqhgaa	I have a Taurus rising. I also have:<br>  Saturn,Uranus and Neptune trine my ascendant.<br>  Venus as well as Jupiter conjuncts my ascendant.<br>  I have Pluto opposite my ascendant.<br>  I have Venus in my first house.<br>  <br>  I am 5'5 inches tall.I have an oval shaped face,bright eyes.My nose has a rounded tip.I won't say that i am bony but my natural structure should be as my brothers as well as my parents have a thin structure.I am 110 pounds however,i still need to lose fat off my hips, thighs and stomach.I also have a small bust.I am not the typical Taurus rising<br>  Bye.
5l2kTANaaa	I also have a Leo moon and I used, as a kid to tend to overeat but more to comfort myself ( comfort food !). I was getting a wee bit chubby alright and of course having a Sagittarian Sun :-)<br>  Poor Gemini ascendant did not come to the rescue !!! :-(<br>  <br>  So as a teen, I went on a starvation diet for 3 months ( I do not recommend it but that is me...when I angry with myself !) and was absolutely size sub zero. I liked my new look but..hard to maintain but I gained huge confidence that is for sure ( hey Leo moons need that !).<br>  <br>  Since, I have absolutely no taste or craving for junk food, chocolate, pies , cakes etc. Actually eating a cake is kind of a torture : I just do not like them at all. Too heavy.<br>  <br>  I eat when am feeling hungry really. I do not eat out habit. I do not seek food for comfort ( substitute : cigarettes...I know ..I know).<br>  <br>  Apart from that I can eat anything although am not that fond of meat. <br>  I really really really love seafood and really like veg believe it or not !<br>  <br>  Am not sure if I eat that healthily because I never eat carbos ( rice, pasta, bread : do not like it) nor fruits ( do not like it) apart from bananas.<br>  <br>  So I supplement with vitamins...and having a venus in the 6th house..I sure have investigated, bought books etc about nutrition lol !!<br>  <br>  Am an adventurous eater .....I would try anything once. Even fried bugs if I could for the hell of it. And the experience. I have tried plenty of food which would repulse many people but when I think about it : heck if some people in some part of the world eat it..why not ?<br>  <br>  And god I love spices !!! and salt...(bad I know).<br>  <br>  Frankly I do not eat very much. My stomach cannot stand that much anyway ( it shrinks when you get used to small meals). One meal a day is enough for me...Tuna, sardines etc with extra hot sauce..Yummy !<br>  <br>  Have to admit that vanity plays a part also. I do not want to be fat. ( Leo moon again).<br>  <br>  Heck..the moon is about nurturing others and yourself too.......and venus could dictate your tastes also. Scorpio Venus : seafood ?|`|369vsqhgaa	I am a Pisces moon.I like chicken,bread(whole wheat),i also LOVE chocolate, ice-cream and cheesecake.I like hot dogs, pasta and potatoes as well.I like spicy foods.I basically like any kind of chicken.It can be baked, fried, curried,barbecue or stewed.I don't really like fish.I love shrimp though.I don't eat any other sea food and don't eat beef,pork lamb or any other meats except for chicken and the occasional duck.<br>  I have gotten hungry now!!!|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I'm not gonna get into paragraphs here, but I'm a Taurus with a ? Virgo moon ? and a Leo rising.<br>  <br>  I love food and everything about it. I find comfort in it a lot of the time, but I don't let many people know just how much I adore it.<br>  <br>  I try not to just sit and pig the hell out, but on occasion, it just happens.<br>  <br>  I tend to only eat food when it's good. I try not to touch anything that's not very tasty at all. But will try lots of different things once.<br>  <br>  I don't touch octopus (tried it once when I was young, and let's just say ? YUCK ?), I don't do pig's feet and I don't touch liver or anything like that.<br>  <br>  I eat pretty much anything else and I do like eating healthy things like grapes and cereal but I don't get around to it much. I eat fast food way too much, mainly lately.<br>  <br>  I also like Hot Pockets. Try the Lean Pockets hon. They are good too, but they are less fat and less calories. My favorite is probably Ham and Cheddar. I also love fried chicken, Lasagna ? (probably my favorite dish ever), pizza, spaghetti, chicken wraps, ham or cheeseburgers, chicken salads, baked chicken, pizza rolls, pizza bagels, bagels, shrimp and cocktail sauce ?....lots of stuff.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on for hours, and I actually made paragraphs unlike I said I would. ^-^|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	I have a Virgo Moon and I'm not big into sea food and I think steak is overrated. I love junk food and candy although lately I've completely cut back on both. When it comes to meat, my favorite is anything that's sweet and spicy. I pour salt on my food without tasting it first lol. That's a horrible habit that comes from my Dad's side of the family. I have a severe sweet tooth so not being able to eat any sugary is driving me crazy but it's something that I have to do for the moment. If I could, right now I would be eating some kind of cake, Krispy Kreme donuts (the best), or some Giant Chewy Nerds. Let me stop talking about them before I drive myself crazy lol.|`|C5i0kmtJaa	I have a libra moon.  I try to eat healthy but of course I have my days when I just need that kind of food.  Im not a big sweets eater however I do love chips.  All kinds of chips.  I don't care for salads unless it comes from texas rode house.  I don't care for meat.  I do like chicken in that italian sauce though.  Im not a big veggie person.  I love fruit and eat it all the time.  Mainly plumbs.  I love cheese and I like fried anything.  I love hot pockets too but I switched it to lean pockets to make it a little more healthier:)|`|20b4pc5Raa	my moon is in scorpio and i like spicy, and sweet and sour when it comes to food.<br>  to sweets, i like chocolate the sweetest it can get (i hate dark chocolate) and soft, syrupy sweets, i don't know how to explain this.<br>  <br>  i usually eat unhealthy and tend to let myself go when it comes to quantity (i'm not overweight though, fortunately, for now, lol); i don't care about the price of foods, as long as i like the taste.<br>  <br>  i don't usually eat meat as in beef, chicken etc, but i love delicatessen; of course this still makes me no vegetarian, xD .<br>  and i don't like fish in general, but i love sushi.<br>  <br>  and i'm planning to be a chef! xD<br>  <br>  (i have cancer rising, aries sun, taurus venus, if this makes any difference.)|`|eT6SsCaraa	I'm a libra moon... I love all fruits, especially strawberries and blueberries and kiwi. ^_^ Also apples, oranges, and lemons. <br>  <br>  I like veggies.. carrots, peas, green beans, sweet potato, potato, corn, broccoli, spinach, lettuce.. They're pretty good.<br>  <br>  Not a big red meat or mixed meat fan.. hotdogs, sausage, bologna, and meatloaf make me feel sick. Ham is good, not a fan of beef.<br>  <br>  I also love fish, shrimp and lobster, all good. ^_^ Poultry and eggs are good too. Not a big fan of nuts.<br>  <br>  Dairy is okay.. I love yogurt and ice cream though. :)<br>  <br>  Love pasta. :DD<br>  <br>  My favorite flavors are sweet, and sour.. hate bitter. Spicy is good, as long as it isn't too hot.<br>  <br>  I'm not a very adventurous eater, but I will eat food I'm offered as long as it is properly cooked, if it's needed. I don't like exotic foods like eel or slugs or calamari or sushi... <br>  <br>  I don't like paying for expensive food, there are so much more important things than food. I eat to live, I don't live to eat. I prefer to eat at seafood or Asian food restaurants.<br>  <br>  I tend to eat healthy, and here are my most favorite foods:<br>  Corn and fish chowder, spinach lasagna rolls, fish fillets. <br>  For unhealthy desserts.. I love chocolate, mil and white chocolate, and angel food cake and strawberry shortcake and fruit smoothies. :D|`|cVVvHNXSaa	I am a Virgo Moon<br>  <br>  I'm not a fan of eating big meals. While I was growing up I was accustomed to eating smaller sizes meals but during my high school period I was going through a very stressful period so I wasn't aware of most of junk I was putting into my system at the time. I mean I didn't really give a damn about anything eating wise at the time so I was eating mainly a lot of fast food. <br>  <br>  Now its a different story. I'm a Lacto ovo vegetarian (eggs and dairy) but I rarely eat eggs. I have a kid (toddler) and I do allow him to eat meat and whatever because he growing. So anyways I weigh about 90-91ish lbs and the funny thing is I don't even try to watch my figure or anything. If its anything my boyfriend want me to eat lots of junk to put on some pounds.<br>  <br>  So I love anything chocolate, ice cream, anything salad without meat, I love chinese, italian, indian etc. as long as its vegetarian meals.     <br>  <br>  Capricorn Sun, Aries Asc.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Gemini moon and, for a 'plus-size' person, I am an extremely picky eater.  Here's what I don't like:<br>  <br>  Raisins, any dried fruit, rare meat, pork, lima beans, baked potatoes, mashed/boiled potatoes, duck, fried eggs, eggs sunny side up, boiled eggs, anything mushy (yogurt, oatmeal, mashed potatoes, etc.)...<br>  <br>  I love Thai Food and Mexican food (Mexican food doesn't 'affect' me as it does most people).  My other favorite cuisines are West Indian, Soul Food, Italian, Chinese, Japanese (though I could do without the raw fish), and Indian.

Keep your clothes on! :)<br>  Plus I personally think that if your brought up right there won't be a problem with the skank issue. Cause if your parents taught you that's not good you most likely won't do it. I bet your sister will be just fine.<br>  I do agree with you though. If you want to be famous i think you should be on your best behavior all the time.

xWqKKp0Naa	Do not make me choose , lol.<br>  I too have them all & could not pick a fave .<br>  Neil Diamond has an amazing voice & has endured for years .<br>  BeeGees were the ultimate group & had the voices of angels . they could do harmonies better than anyone & a sad loss was when the 2 brothers died . I am including Andy too as he was  great on his own . <br>   Happy Monday .      D :)|`|oWlQ5lH9aa	Great question!  At first I was gonna say Neil Diamond, but then I went and looked them up on Wikipedia.  Both have had stellar careers spanning decades.  Neil I think has the upper hand in the songwriting (in my opinion), but the Bee Gees were pretty amazing vocally.  What struck me in Wiki was how many artists have remade, sampled, and performed the Gibbs songs...so I think I'll have to go with the Bee Gees.  They were my Mom's favorite, too!|`|6db82c1b800fa3265fb33558203952ddaa	Neil Diamond...Definitely Neil Diamond|`|e35080c0de8e48c6b1cd707eb28a4829aa	Personaly Neil Diamond but I'm a Johnny Cash fan so I guess that has some say in the matter.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	neil diamond- one of the great songwriters in rock history.|`|brFVpD1Qaa	Ill say this again, whichever is worth more so i can sell it on ebay|`|0b3fa313a09fd3b8730664822eb4455baa	Bee Gees|`|URO3gDXcaa	bee gees.|`|7Q1Zsub6aa	Bee Gees.<br>  <br>  Their career spawned many super-hits in the disco era, and they also had a more legitimate career before disco as well.

DooqYRfAaa	Journey!  "Don't Stop Believing", because "Faithfully" with "Open Arms," Journey is as classic as Mustangs.|`|Xqr8JsdFaa	I think you have to tip the hat to Journey on this one.  Journey has had more hits and must have songs than Survivor have had. I LOVE Survivor, but feel like you could just pick up "Vital Signs" by them and have pretty much the best of the band.  Such a great album and definitely a classic in the AOR genre.<br>  Journey on the other hand, have had multiple songs over many albums that all are considered classics.  Journey is the answer to this one, but that takes nothing away from Survivor, who very wrongly are pigeon-holed by the success of "Eye Of The Tiger"|`|3L4citcnaa	Journey, no question. Survivor didn't really make it big before their main guy got polyps and couldn't sing. I mean, come on. Journey has had HOW MANY hits compared to Survivor? Even non-rock fans have heard of Journey, and have likely heard some of their songs.|`|lILfQh6xaa	Journey by far. The record sales and long lasting speaks for itself. the lead singer for survivor is the guy that does the Bud light salutes commercials.|`|dFacbjIZaa	Journey<br>  <br>  But My idea of their "definitive collection" and most other People's idea of it are two quite different things.|`|FDt7cC8haa	Journey.....<br>  <br>  By far many more hits....|`|FnrAw2SQaa	JOURNEY!|`|MwSaCettaa	Journey<br>  <br>  ???|`|ME4XWNmRaa	Journey,and i already own all of their music!|`|sC09VfIsaa	I think journey is better but i love "eye of the tiger"|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Journey by far.<br>  <br>  C-ya<br>  <br>  RW
OhkY8n7Yaa	Not so difficult to get on,but difficult to get off !!!|`|4fjMMkLmaa	These are the only times someone can get on my bad side, I'm pretty easy going.<br>  Hmm... Well if someone wants to get on my bad side I would think they would have to steal something from me and I knew they took it, they make fun of me for no reason, make lots of really loud noises, cheat at games, hurt animals (especially young ones). I'm sure there's more but I can't think of anymore.<br>  Now if someone steals something I'll eventually get over it (if they're my friends), if they make fun of me I probably stay on my bad side for quite awhile (unless it's my friends then I don't care since we all make fun of each other constantly), loud noises I'll get over eventually, same as cheating at games (although I probably won't play with them again), and if someone intentionally hurts animals, then I will never get over it, they will forever stay on my bad side.|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	easy if they are relative strangers<br>  hard if they are good friends or family....I m willing to take a lot more for people I love :  )|`|70OHpjySaa	It's very hard for people to get on my bad side but once they're there, they're doomed.|`|720106f8fa9586128d276437bf2e0e18aa	if right in the morning, very easy, other times not so much<br>  <br>  if its my family, not so easy to get off the bad side, others get off a little more easily|`|napgiSmXaa	Hello Mixed 19 & a Proud Virgin<br>  <br>         Not so easy.  Although having said that, I can flick from good to bad quicker than, turning a light on.

napgiSmXaa	Hello again Mixed 19 &a Proud Virgin<br>  <br>            Your quite right but let's not shout about it.  Could it be that the good don't require every one to acknowledge their presence, but would rather have the companionship of those select few who are worthy of their friendship.<br>            Perhaps it's because the bad are trying to compensate for their inability to conform to normal decent behaviour.<br>            Yes It's annoying and I once thought that those people who were defined as BAD were the very ones who got on in life, was I wrong, was I ever.   Instead I've now discovered that all their misdemeanours are being recorded and they will have to answer For their transgressions|`|GCuGDMZraa	i have!<br>  Its esp. true in schools and unis.. <br>  I fall into the quiet category.. and I prefer being overlooked sometimes haha<br>  <br>  but seriously, for the majority of my teen years ( im 19) i spent half the time wanting to bust out the heavy eyeliner , cigarettes, leather pants and just general "bad" stuff.

VAfyKWmUaa	I didn't think it was funny at all. I think it was sad for Chris to stoop to the level of even hitting a woman, regardless of what she may have did or said. I've lost all respect for him. If she takes him back then she's stupid as hell. From the look of her face, he really did her over.<br>  He only hurt his reputation in the music industry.|`|ALEp1jD3aa	I don't get it....lol (;<br>  but I don't really think the whole Chris and Rihanna situation is funny.

2hMhANqDaa	a candy bar when i was 5. I was with my mom at the grocery store and i went into a closed check out aisle where they had candy and put a milkyway in my waistband. I did it super quick and my mom didn't even know i stole it. Until we got home. I was eating it in my closet and my mom caught me as i was chewing the last bite lol|`|fce67c6faf9b1d4b041b262e35a15d36aa	Was in Asda with my hubby and picked out a table and chairs for the garden told to pick it up at the customer services desk on the way out ..while i went on with the shopping hubby went and got the furniture in the car and i paid for the shopping and they forgot to put the furniture thru the till OOPS wasn't until i got home that we realised.. i thought he paid for it and he thought i paid for it Xxx|`|u2EUom6daa	when i was a kid i stole some sweets from the local shop and no i didn't get caught<br>  <br>  i remember when my mam worked in a shop and i stole some toffee i felt so guilty i went back into the shop and put the toffee back lol|`|7VxWCGd4aa	no but i got my purse stolen at a mall, it had my camera and all my pictures from homecoming that i didnt down load to my computer, my atm card. the only think that i had with me was my money and my phone. and my purse was a dooney and burk. i miss it!|`|O1a4lnW9aa	I conveniently "forgot" to bring back this awesome touch pad calculator back to school that my teacher had lent me in grade six.|`|9TQrtSoiaa	yeah and i got away with it|`|4m6vetjNaa	ive stolen a lot in the past. useless junk. wish i could give it all back now. iv changed.|`|64cUxJn1aa	yes I've stolen many times and after I got the second time I learned my lesson.

aSoCKVJ3aa	morning|`|8ivnzNi5aa	That depends upon the job, and what the rest of your life is like.  Right now, I 'd take any shift I could get offered.|`|IizPFrELaa	Def. the night shift!<br>  <br>  Babies seem to want to be born more from 11-7am|`|fMEypXDYaa	Once worked one that was 24 hours long, 11am to 11am, it was called 5th shift, managed to hang with it for a year and then had to quit, only had one day off. Was a QC tech in a plastic's company that made medical stuff and had to check stuff once a hour.|`|cdpy5iv5aa	I was working 11am - 9pm that was a pretty bad shift to have, I really had no life.|`|YW1DXceqaa	11-7|`|nFakIvgoaa	I wouldn't like 3-11 or 11-7.  I like working days and being off at night.|`|t1VthewCaa	Definitely the afternoon because that's when everyone is off work and wants to come to your job and give you hell!

D4XWrwuaaa	Maybe you should take him out for some beers so he can better see your point of view!<br>  <br>  Also, if he is unwilling to go out for some drinks, then you should try getting drunk again and going over to his house to explain. He might understand Drunk Revenginator better than Sober Revenginator.<br>  <br>  If he still doesn't get it, maybe Drunk Revenginator will better understand the neighbor's point of view and feel more like helping out with the clean-up.  I am sure Drunk Revenginator is a whizz with a chainsaw!|`|Zgs4RncIaa	My question to him would be "Dude if i'm irresponsible enough to get drunk and cut down your tree, what makes you think I would be responsible enough to pay for the damages?"<br>  <br>  Then hand him a beer and you can both get drunk!|`|9IvcV7tiaa	Bring him a big bowl of guacamole, and if that doesn't cool his jets, take him to Judge Judy.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	Are you serious? I'll answer as if you are, but I suspect this is a joke...<br>  <br>  Of course you're responsible for it. You're responsible for getting drunk, aren't you?  If you're stupid enough to get so drunk that you can't control your actions, then that's your problem, not his. <br>  Let's look at this another way. Suppose you drink too much, drive and then have and accident and KILL someone. Would you say, "oops. It's not my fault" If so, then you are of the lowest moral character I can imagine.<br>  Who do you think SHOULD be responsible? Him?  If he sues you, which is a good bet he might (or your parents if you're under age) try using the excuse "I was too drunk so it's not my fault" in court and see where that gets you ;)|`|f4c5f36a540069fbe952ea342c721c74aa	When I was a kid, our neighbor kept talking about demolishing his porch and building a new one.  It really did need torn down...but he was a big procrastinator.  (But a very nice man).  One night my dad came home drunk, drove his Jeep into the neighbors yard, hooked a tow chain from the Jeep to the porch and put 'er in drive.  The entire porch was pulled off the house.  I can still remember the family opening the kitchen door and looking at their missing porch...with this WFT-look on their faces.  My dad simply said, "there you go....we will get started on that new porch this week."  My dad indeed did help him build his new porch but I honestly believe had my dad not yanked the porch off the house the project would have never been started to this day.  The neighbors daughter and I were good friends and have remained good friends to this day...and every once in a while we reminisce about that day. We are both approaching our 50's and this all probably happened when we were around 7  years old.<br>  <br>  So my advice...go to a tree nursery and buy the neighbor a nice avocado tree and then, on the way home stop at the beer distributor and buy a case of beer.  Get a couple lawn chairs and shovels and your neighbor.  Share a laugh and some beers, plant the tree...clean up the mess and all will be for good memories.  <br>  <br>  Good neighbors are to be treasured.|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	For the same reason you don't think you are accountable for your own behavior and are using the excuse of being drunk. The Supreme Court ruled that if you are responsible enough to pick up a drink then you are liable for anything you do under the influence of the drink.<br>  MAN UP AND PAY FOR YOUR IDIOCY.|`|4YnoykD2aa	People are so effin touchy about their landscaping. Offer to make him a lot of guacamole.|`|tqfkHiEQaa	I "LOL'd"|`|XaFYUMRSaa	You should get life in the slammer for that..........|`|3FFAIMpLaa	Tell him I did it.  That should take the heat off of you and I really don't care how your neighbor feels about me.|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	the guy has no humor =)|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	peas in a drunken pod|`|hFVPEkWjaa	lol this make me remember the video 'so what'  by pink lol|`|DA5ZbYjlaa	Offer to plant an avocado seed in his yard, and tell him that if he promises to water it and look after it, before he knows it he'll have another tree, even better than the first one.<br>  <br>  Just don't cut THAT one down...|`|Ef83kV3Qaa	What a jerk! I would totally understand if you did that to my tree. But for him to come to all upset and saying stupid things like "wanting you to pay" and not being drunk at the time, well there is no excuse for that. <br>  <br>  I think he owes YOU an apology.|`|AA12359663	Here's a thought:<br>  Adults are suppose to act responsibly. (This includes their consumption of alcohol.)<br>  <br>  Why don't you try sobriety?<br>  It would probably make your neighbor relations go alot smoother.<br>  <br>  Good luck with that.|`|AA10299265	He's probably a Republican and expects you to be accountable for your actions... regardless of excuses.|`|kaaP8y2oaa	avocado tree? do you know how much one avocado cost? drunk or not you have to supply him a life time of them...see if you'll ever get drunk again..blah|`|gjENahMSaa	tell him to look on the bright side; you won't be stealing any more avocados from his tree and claiming they were windfalls.|`|wXyoo8mNaa	Sorry,but u are responsible regardless if u were drunk or not just go clean up your mess and be done with it .The neighbor can get the law involved and you'll lose.|`|YW74O9aNaa	Well, people should be responsible enough NOT to drink so much that they don't know what they do when drunk.|`|zRUHryuraa	I totally agree<br>  <br>  its not as if you planned it, it just kind of happened<br>  <br>  some people just don't get it, do they?|`|Og9oTXA1aa	Hmmm, is he sure it was you, after all you were drunk it could have been anyone! Ask for proof.|`|lfamfJhUaa	you cut down his tree!!!! you need to take responsibility for your actions|`|HCL7FpTqaa	Does this mean I don't have to count all the people I had secks with when I was drunk?  Excellent!  <br>  <br>  Um....did you remind him that avocados are evil?|`|hgyiS7Glaa	guacamole is good with lime & garlic ,and some beer mixed in|`|HDqPQbxtaa	youre a d!ck|`|x2rmsjIXaa	some ppl just don't get it.|`|IR7e44yDaa	But you are responsible for drinking, hence you should be responsible for your actions while drinking or who else will take responsibility?<br>  You should know how much you are able to drink without losing total sense and you should not pass that limit....besides you should drink in moderation and not get so overly drunk in the 1st place. <br>  <br>  I'll give you an example, if a drunk driver gets into an accident he held responsible for the damage. I don;t know where your from and what the law is there but I'm from Canada.<br>  <br>  What you're saying is that is a drunk driver or drunk person gets into an accident in which the drunk ends up taking someone's life, he should not be held responsible because he wasn't in his senses???<br>  That makes no sense, killing cannot be justified like this, that person shouldn't be drinking if he becomes this senseless in the first place.<br>  I know this is an extreme example in your context but this is what happens so....you should repair the damage.|`|WnnJ4YVnaa	there is probably the simple fact that you ARE responsible for the things you do while your drunk, don't drink so much to the point you can't control your actions. for god sakes are you really that stupid? you cut down a tree in HIS backyard and being drunk is not an excuse. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE MORON. I hope he makes you pay the cost and I hope its expensive.|`|WXduJP08aa	you are response able for doing it you just say "and i cut down his tree" look you ***** go get a life i bet that you sit aroung the house all day thinking about how you wish you could get layed and if people arnt responceable for what they do when there drunk why is it illeage to drink and drive asshole go **** your mom and go some where|`|0lwGsRNqaa	Well I think it's because of the law. When you kill someone drunk or drive drunk they still charge you even though you were drunk. So i guess he is taking a lesson from the cops.|`|CDZC4BFhaa	A tree is a living thing isn't it and all living things die eventually.<br>  You should make that point with him.<br>  <br>  I say hold a wake...it's the least you can do.|`|3Les3n24aa	Being sober is highly overrated.|`|hz7Ek1HKaa	LuLu is just upset cuz she was poaching avocados of this guy. Now she's SOOL!!|`|6fAsMB76aa	how old are you??? your such an idiot i would sue your *** and make you buy me a new tree!|`|dO4xX4Hvaa	Just because you were wasted does not free you of all responsibility. If you caused havoc regardless of if you were drunk or not you better believe you are liable to pay the damages.|`|mI2iwx7naa	some people never stop complaiing, it's obviosly<br>  not your fault cuz you were rat azzed at the time,<br>  give the jerk a kick in the goolies if he tries to pull a fast one like that again, some people have no manners :)
AA10680087	I would say it is, but it is nice to share it with Women|`|AA10329469	Yes, in more ways than one but there has to be a tacit approval of the women affected (if they are).|`|24d30303d7dfdc03b1d6d393f19ad4bcaa	No...in fact its our world. Not any gender's world. Women have same rights as a man do.|`|pDptioSNaa	Yes.

aihogb26aa	I agree completely! I think Quest and Beat Freaks are by far the best crews this season (Fly Khicks do not deserve to even be in the top 3...they've been in the bottom two 4 weeks in a row, but the judges keep saving them...not right). I would be happy either way, but I am really pulling for Beat Freaks. They would be the first all-female crew to win and they are real b-girls and hip hop dancers. Most other female crews (like Fly Khicks) are dance team-style dancers and I really do not like how Fly Khicks have used their skin and sexuality to get this far. Beat Freaks have just used their talent!!|`|tG5PSmwAaa	I want Quest Crew to win though :D<br>  <br>  but like they said...Beat Freaks are awesome too <br>  <br>  I don't like Fly Khicks! just because Strikers got lost doesn't mean that they should be eliminated .. it was their first time!|`|99KvT4P6aa	QUEST cReW FAnNN=]<br>  hope they win<br>  <br>  but i still like  BF..theyre pretty cooll<br>  <br>  DISLIKE FLy khicks...ppl say they use their sexual appearance to make it far
oUihfXgVaa	global warming|`|AA10152422	Yes, I would like to end poverty. The second one kind of goes w/ MLK--no hate. <br>  <br>  Health care for all; well, sure that sounds good. But, I'd rather have a way for people to earn it. I don't think any ideas suggested so far have been good ideas. <br>  <br>  Human rights for all youth; umm...not so sure about rights. I don't believe much in listening to youth in making major decisions. (And I'm a teenager myself; I know how I think compared to mature adults. I would be concerned if too much power was given to my peers.) <br>  <br>  Stop abusive parents. This is one difficult part to deal with since children don't usually know if they're being abused or not. If you grow up being beaten every time you say you believe something different than your parents, you usually will think that this is your fault.<br>  <br>  No more wars--definitely. But they are unavoidable at this point. And I'm not for sitting back and letting others attack us. The best defense is a good offense. Though, it does sadden me everytime another relative or childhood friend of mine goes over there. And it's hard to think about, but with so many people I know over there, there's a chance someone is going to come back hurt. Or might not come back at all.|`|GtalVPNjaa	how I would love to see a revolution of the common man/woman to rise up and eradicate poverty, starvation and conflict. <br>  <br>  Just think how for years our governments have told us they can't afford to feed the starving of the world and yet now... we see them finding trillions of dollars to bail out the greedy fraudulent bankers, brokers and fund managers who have brought about the complete collapse of capitalism.|`|VpWyDdGraa	I would like for the world to show more love for and towards one another and have respect toward God and to get our country back as Washington ,Jefferson and many other who fought for the world morals and standards.

a4c35cf43da917875724077282d70183aa	It was proven a rumor. Someone I know contacted someone and asked and it's just a really horible rumor. The site that it first appeared on has 99.9% of their information wrong anyway. The site that had it up is like the best place to find fake things anyway. So no worries.<br>  <br>  IT'S ALL FAKE! Tom= Herpes free,|`|CJcPqo2Vaa	Oh I heard this story many of times and I think it's a lie! I heard this was by a person who makes up many rumors about people just to get money.

SBFs2Cheaa	hahahaha no. they think they look hot so they show their body off|`|2de6d27f995f7095941c3a8ab7ce880caa	No woman is asking for it by dressing sexy.<br>  Do your homework on the mind of a rapist.<br>  It's not what a woman wears.<br>  Are you aware of how many elderly woman get raped?<br>  Some are in their 80's.<br>  Take care.|`|EOTH56DWaa	I'm not gonna complain. I just hope they keep doing it.|`|9gRikg8Kaa	because they like being in the spotlight, even if it means dressing like a hoochie mama|`|lBz87vxwaa	Not all "beautiful" women dress that way.

Do I agree with the way some women dress? No. Most dress that way for attention not because they want to be groped by a pervert.|`|frwlypDWaa	Hookers get paid for sex, they do it willingly, and they dress to attract attention.. Rape victims don't do any of those things. Bad analogy, dude...

gDxjINbQaa	I guess it started in the Renaissance with the setting of religious practices to music that were done in smaller pieces. Considering Renaissance counterpoint's stricture, i don't think they stopped anything in the middle to make comments, so they started writing music in movemnts.|`|xcPzZvsraa	I imagine the other responder is correct.<br>  For example the Ordinary of the Mass has six sections and it was through liturgical works like these whereby music developed into secular forms like the symphony.<br>  Movements in music are the grammatical equivalent of separation into chapters.<br>  They immediately allow for a different tempo<br>  and afford the composer opportunity to explore some new side path to the overall musical argument to which they will eventually return.<br>  Without them complex and often lengthy works would be less structured and would be infinitely more harder to compose just like if you were writing a book devoid of any chapters or divisions.|`|BeSZ4nXraa	The use of movements wasn't to break up a long piece,but more to make a shorter piece longer by having many pieces seen as one.  Renaissance music is very short because there is no inherent structure.  I think the mass is a decent idea as precedent, but I think movements in a symphony has more precedence in something like a French dance suite, which was a group of dances for courtly pleasure :)

iBH7NTl3aa	Will you be as brave as her, if you find yourself in the same situation! she is inspirational to me!|`|wmBK9uASaa	I agree,thinking how Roy Castle`s fight with cancer was coupled with his relentless campaigns for awareness and charity bashes her concerns are all very self centred,I`m also thinking of the brave lady who died last year from breast cancer who ran and cycled her way to many charitable donations,all selflessly done,shame is I can`t even recall that womans name,and that is a disgrace|`|C8Djjxqkaa	She is unintelligent, uneducated and vulgar, and she knows it. Tweed is unlikely to make much of himself. At least hers sons may be able to contribute something valuable to society.|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	I don't know. Is there ever too much money to provide for 2 young boys future? Children don't come cheaply, and they're only 4 and 5. She wants them to have everything she didn't have as a child, which i think is fair enough. She cant do much else.. If i was in her shoes and i was dying, i would make damn sure that i raised as much money as possible, the best way i knew how, to secure my babies future. And i'd stick 2 fingers up at anyone who criticised me.. Never judge a person until you've walked a mile in their shoes my great gran has always drummed into me. Jade is in a way exploiting the media for her own ends, which is smart considering the exploitation they do of others. She's also raised awareness of cervical cancer which is always a good thing, because it is a silent killer.. Remember if you don't like it, you do have other channels to choose from, and you can always turn the page.. But i don't think too many people would do otherwise if it came down to securing their children's future after their death.. She has the means to do it because of her status. We're not in the public eye so we don't have the same means. Doesn't make it wrong.|`|yM7YPmzSaa	Her desire to make money will benefit her sons and that it a good thing....however lets hope they become productive members of society and not the spitting image of their mother!!<br>  <br>  I do question though, in her last dying days how much of her precious sons she is actually seeing...seems she was more interested in getting a bit of nookie with her new hubby rather than spending more time with her sons!!|`|AfbjU9Guaa	Her LIFE is wearing thin, WE'VE got the rest of our lives to worry about all that! Stop being so ignorant.<br>  It's her job as a mother to keep her sons safe and happy for the rest of their lives.. unfortunately she won't live that long, so why do you think she's going through all this trouble?<br>  <br>  Sure she's taking advantage of a privelege... but surely wouldn't you if it was to look after your family?|`|tTksfeufaa	me too.<br>  die in dignity in private.<br>  why waste your last few days on publicity?<br>  spend time alone with your family|`|xiYcUd1Yaa	I think you have to remember the way her sons have been brought up so far- they've always had a big house, expensive clothes etc. Clearly its far more than most kids get in a lifetime & loads more than what my kids have but hey, they will lose their mother, why not make the rest of their lives as good as possible & without any money stress in the future. <br>  I am a mother of 3 & can honestly say if i had weeks left i would do whatever it took to get money in the bank for my wee ones.<br>  Its her life/wedding/death, its up to her how she lives it really. xx|`|OpVysSzQaa	at least she's the one exploiting herself and its benefitting her family, it could've been the tabloids exploiting them and raking in the cash for their own profits. I don't see anything wrong with what she's doing, its not her fault people are forking over the money. at least she's honest about it|`|4dZu7yxAaa	She got a million for her wedding. That's 50,000 a year for the next 20 years for her sons. Surely that is enough to provide for them.|`|CjeWL03Taa	She's the mother & it's up to her to decide what's best for her & her family besides keeping herself occupied with thinking of her sons is probably giving her something to focus on other then her death!.|`|AA11436843	if it was me, for my daughter.... I would do exactly the same.<br>  <br>  who the hell do you think you are to be able to tell what they would need to live on and what is 'far more'?|`|BEqAhXBlaa	Agreed|`|v8Q9bs8jaa	it is didturbing,but if she can secure her sons' futures than i see nothing wrong with it.....<br>  <br>  i doubt she's making billions...so.....|`|ocD7VFtWaa	Everything she has done since being in the spotlight has been disturbing and vulgar. The last months of her life will naturaly be along the same lines. I think the whole circus of her fame has been pretty unsavoury, but then if you think about it, people have got a great deal of entertainment out of her misfortune and various **** ups. <br>  She has been the victim of a public that switches from loving her as being vulgar and ignorant to hating her for being vulgar and ignorant to loving her for being vulgar and ignorant and now they love her because she's rich and she's going to die.<br>  I think if she wants to make a bit of money out of the mess she's found herself, fair enough.<br>  I mean, if you were her kids and you grow up and 1. your mum's dead.<br>  2. Everyone knows you for being the kids of someone who was famous for making a tit of herself and being vulgar and ignorant 3. you have no money to your name because your mother frittered it all away on her toyboy...<br>  I think it's fair enough that at the least she cashes in now, leaves them with a bit of cold hard comfort when she's gone.<br>  I think it's sad, Jade Goody is just someone picked by producers to be an extreme example of the general public and built up and brought crashing down... and she rose to the every occasion, putting her foot in it big time.|`|Ke9cILe6aa	Disturbing and vulgar, there are two words that sum-up everything about this creature known as Jade Goody!|`|oQL9eDNAaa	I agree. I mean i get that she's doing it for her kids but like you said, she's making far too much.

I was crying because i was so happy. The cat and the dog would always chase each other around the house.<br>  Another one is where i was traveling by car from Labrador to Quebec and we had to go on a boat to get cross a river. I was terrified, i had a little yellow rain coat on and i was frantically running around trying to find a way off. My dad had his camera put and was saying "Lets get some crying shots" and was laughing. He showed me the video for the first time ever last year.<br>  One more thing is few years when i was about 8 me and my friends found this little tree house in the woods, and we said we would make it our own. He fixed it up a bit and then it was finished. About a week after we where finished a bunch of guys came and said it was there's and we of course didn't care. They left and didn't come back. Instead an old man called out "HEY! Get OFF MY PROPERTY!!" we all ran away. when we looked back we say those guys run after us with sticks and where yelling "VICTORY!!"  we where so scared at the time. but now we just laugh at that.<br>  <br>  All the thing i listed i remember clearly.

Pxh93GHcaa	There was no doubt about his capabilities. He was a Raw talent when he started in music industry and this raw talent have matured now over the years. But I would also like to comment on the fact that he has done so much of great work in past that he should have got this award earlier. But then there is term called Lobbing. None of the Indian actor or movies got the Oscar but this certainly does not mean they do not deserve one. This applies to A R also. His past work was great enough to give him oscar but this is unfortunate the way these oscar process works.  Personally I did not enjoy his work in Slum Dog Millionaire much. I am very happy that he bed an ward for this but he has done far better work this before. Lagaan and Taal I consider his best work (Sorry not aware much about his work in south India) and I also believed that he should got this ward for them. But then those movie was made by Indians so it will not have much chance at Oscars.|`|4itwJS0Faa	<a href="http://spicyinfo.8bit.at" rel="nofollow">http://spicyinfo.8bit.at</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

S9bEtVCSaa	A lot of child actors actually sue their parents for their earnings. They also get emancipated. It's sad because the parents got them into the acting biz in the first place, then they milk them for all they're worth. Look at what happened to Macully Culkin (sp) and Gary Coleman.<br>  It's sad and I think they need to re-examine these laws because kids are being exploited.<br>  <br>  **Never watched Slumdog Millionaire|`|YW74O9aNaa	Where did you read that? send me a link if possible.<br>  Yeh its sad if they havn't paid the kids , its not fair even if the kid is not poor. <br>  And come to think of it, all advertises / commercials/ movies with kids in them are another form of child labor aren't they? <br>  But no one cares as long as the kids enjoy it, get famous and earn money :)|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	I agree with you, but remember, this movie was produced by a British film company and filmed entirely in India. I don't know what India's laws are concerning child labor, but I bet they are either not very protective of the children, or don't exist at all.|`|7769bb12a9339d6add718a4ad2b9363caa	yeah, they should set up something for him at a bank.|`|J9AvKefwaa	thats show biz!|`|kGkUG0fKaa	yes I have heard that. Sad to say, Hollywood is bullies, they knew what they were doing, the sad part is the kids didn't know what they were doing and now since the media has wind of it hollywood has to give away some of their milllions made....this isn't the first person to get ripped off and not the last. I hope he gets his fair share!|`|WyNOAZb9aa	Maybe the kid isnt gay and is getting discriminated against?<br>  <br>  Everyone who is not Gay is a HATER if you ask people like Sean Penn and that sort of Hollywood ilk.|`|JWkd3wTXaa	I agree...I our world today it just seems as if you can see the line between the upclass and the lower much clearer now, but that still doesnt give the upper shame from taking advantage of the other 85%...its a shame.

KpO4UtElaa	the carbonation of the fizzy drink might help your stomach. i also reccommend gatorade. drink plenty of water too. also, try eating something easy on your stomach like toast or oatmeal or a banana or rice. just get some rest. sleeping will help you recover faster. or if you aren't tired, read or watch tv. thats what i do when i'm sick.|`|bITTzzcVaa	I would not advise you to drink anything with high sugar because it will only make you feel worse.<br>  <br>  Drink gatorade, it has electrolytes that help you get better faster. Drink juices such as apple or oranje juice.<br>  <br>  If you are bored, watch some old movies that you havent seen since you were a kid. I always watch old disney movies or classic movies like "Breakfast Club".<br>  <br>  Make sure you are in comfy clothes. Pajamas are best! If you have the chills, make sure you have socks on. Just be lazy and watch TV. You are sick after all!<br>  <br>  Feel Better!!!!

But, I would still work if I won the lottery or came into an inheritance. I wouldn't have the job I have now but I would still be doing something. <br>  <br>  Not to mention, $1200 per month is only $650 biweekly and that wouldn't be enough to live off of in my city. When my husband and I were living in a 2br/2bth apartment last year, our rent was $1350. So, if I were to get $1200 from Obama, I'd still have to work to make up the difference.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Its working in some city's and has be for years!|`|lkPYYLiKaa	yes because the usn has me for 8 years on contract|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I'm retired right now, on less money than that.|`|ebQ4vuUnaa	I would stay at home, because I love my children and hope/think they need my influence.<br>  <br>  No I wouldnt be lazy though.

EHtFxGxMaa	Several things.<br>  <br>  1. Nothing is built right. It is an older house so, a lot of it was put together before modern building codes.<br>  <br>  2. Not enough yard space.<br>  <br>  3. I'd like to sell it and move on, it is the house my wife died in, so I'd like to put that behind me. But with the economy the way it is, I just suck it up. Luckily my g/f understands and is very supportive.|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	I love my home, but i don't like about it is it's size. It's basically too big. It has 5 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, and too many other rooms. Cleaning it from top to bottom takes days, and the garden is too big. Considering there's only 2 of us there most of the time, (except now as my inlaws, and my mum are staying over for a while to help us out when bubbas are born) 2 well behaved tidy dogs and soon to be 2 babies, i think it's too excessive. I think we'd be just as happy in a nice little 3 bedroomed house, with a little less rooms and a smaller garden but my husband is not so keen on the idea. He says the only time we're moving house is to buy something bigger not smaller..|`|iE5c23bsaa	So my family was moving from out-of-state and a relative (who was already over here) got us a house. So we came down to the new state and saw this total dump. The roof leaks and makes the popcorn on the ceiling fall down. The toilets leak and run up the water bill. There are holes in all of the doors. All of the mirrors are cracked. There is no insulation so it's the same temp. inside as outside. Not all of the bedrooms have vents so their rooms will be 30 degrees like outside when everyone else is warm and toasty. There are rats or possums or something in the attic and when they walk around popcorn falls from the ceiling and you can totally hear them...|`|3y96DmJdaa	The house is small and but there is alot of lands oh and when you turn the water of it makes loads of noise|`|6pEevKn6aa	my noisy neighbors dog who barks all night.....any suggestions on how to get him to be quiet????|`|bHQpwVlXaa	The sinking foundation ....

Y4v2tm3Naa	As a future teacher I believe the law is good in intent yet bad in implimentation.  There are alot of "students" that are hurting funding to normally good school districts because of the requirements of at grade/age level testing.  The other major flaw is that it requires all students to be tought as though they are going on to higher education.  The vast majority of students are not going to collage and even if they did our university system isn't able to handle that many students.<br>  <br>  For example, A student I'm aware of is tied into a wheel chair, on oxygen, has no reaction to any kind of stimulus yet the student is required to complete and pass at grade/age level tests this student was 20 at the time I met them.  Exactly how do you teach successfully a student that is unable to even indicate they are aware of you when you talk, touch or manipulate them, yet this kind of student is cutting into the 1% that is allowed to not pass the at grade level tests, and eating into a huge amount of a school systems budget  due to the large amount of additional care they need.  <br>  <br>  Other students that suffer from mental retardation may never reach an at grade level cognitive development and should be tought skills that will help them with life/job skills that will help them to earn a living in the future.<br>  <br>  The major flaw with the legisation is that it indircetly punishes school districts that have exceptional Special Ed programs because parents of special needs students tend to seek opertunities if possible to get their child into the best program available to them increasing the special needs population % in the school district.  <br>  <br>  Another flaw is the way it affects the coriculum because it's ends up entirely focusing on passing the gate tests.  So depending on what area are being focused on in a given year other areas begin to suffer.   <br>  <br>  Looking at the students present in the classroom I would venture to say the average student knows significantly less then a like aged student knew when I was going though school.  Also because the tests are so narrowly focused students lose alot of bredth to their education.|`|AA11622768	I think it leaves a lot children behind.

November 20, 1986) (bass guitar/backup vocals/synthesizer) – and their first cousin Matthew Followill (b. September 10, 1984) (lead guitar/backup vocals). They are all known by their middle names. The band's sound derives from southern rock, hard rock and alternative. They have released four full-length albums. The group's name is derived from Nathan, Caleb and Jared's father and grandfather, both named Leon.[2] In terms of chart positions the band has been far more popular in Europe (notably in the UK and Ireland) than they have been in their homeland. 80% of all record sales have come from UK winning two Brit Awards (best international band, best album) and Australia (where they had 2008's highest-selling album<br>  need enything else|`|xKjm7t5Iaa	He's in a band called The Kings Of Leon...you said anything.

I find thin and bony usually go together...|`|J9AvKefwaa	well people say i am too thin, i am 5'6 and weigh 78lb. Yes I have ANA. I think I am not too thin I think I am not thin enough, but I know I have a distorted perception. Yes you can be too thin..... they section you and make you fat under the mental health act!|`|VVk0hHgpaa	When she looks like a 12 yr old boy.  Women are meant to have curves and meat on their bones.

You can't be thin and curvy...hm I suppose you can...ish, but thin is just a little fat and curvy is just like "You got it goin' on girl!" lol.|`|6UBSUzUIaa	Well, I am still trying to figure out how you have a curvy body and still be thin. A curvy woman has hips and breasts and thighs, and they aren't usually thin; that's why they are called curvy. If this girl "thinks" she is too thin, then yeah... She is.<br>  <br>  *confused*|`|qhU3PDgfaa	this is thin... lol <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/images/items/0811856/081185633X/081185633X_large.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.chroniclebooks.com/images/ite...</a><br>  <br>  but i would anytime prefer to be skinny than fat..|`|IkWcwsj8aa	depends on the individual<br>  <br>  i know i dont wanna see no ribs stickin out or nothin like that|`|vSlOpJoRaa	No|`|GkYR0uP1aa	depends on her height|`|wz8gx3gaaa	When she get flat chested.|`|aQLDF2H7aa	If someone is as skinny as Olive Oyl, that's too thin.

uqLUKbMbaa	We live in a semi rural area.  Our house is right on the outskirts of the town amongst fields and trees.  But there is a bus stop where we can ride a bus three miles into town for shopping and for entertainment.  So we have the best of both worlds.  If I had to make a choice.  It would be rural.

He said that if someone was holding their shoes security would not bother them. Especially if they had hose on and it wasn't obvious.Otherwise if they were blatantly barefoot he had to say something. To them there was a diference between feet hurting and being barefoot.|`|46492533ddbb2d578f91de5478f1e7f3aa	I have, but I have been hassled about it.  I'm not much of a mall person, so others may have had different experiences, but my experience is consistent with our security guard friend - most malls don't want people going barefoot in them.  It's a shame, but unfortunately, it's private property, so there's nothing to be done about it.|`|tmHwyj09aa	you cant walk barefoot in the mall, its against the code of conduct for most malls|`|YSuc7L8taa	Yes, in California<br>  My friends and I went to the malls barefoot all the time.|`|e45f658f9932624abf10e836e95d3bd3aa	I love being barefoot, I do it all the time.<br>  <br>  "What spirit is so empty and blind, that it cannot grasp the fact that a human foot is more noble than the shoe and human skin more beautiful than the garment with which it is clothed."

lttblj8faa	What pisses me off as a teen is when adults are to hard headed and stuck up to realize what GOOD advice we give out some time. Its annoying because our age is holding us back from doing something amazing! And I hate to say this..But some time when you get older your brain gets a little "dusty" if you know what I mean. So we might know a little something more then you guys..Not on everything...Just a few things here and there, It would be nice if for once a parent would Liston to our advice...They don't have to use it...Just keep an open mind :]|`|DooJ5iDGaa	Its is just as difficult as adults knowing so much, and making the same mistake over and over again. Divorces , Infidelity, child abuse...etc. I believe teenagers have their own point of view towards politics and finances, they may not have the same mentality as to someone with twice the years of experience but its good to see where they fall when having an opinion towards such situations.|`|PIRyF8KQaa	I'm a teen i can't stand it!

Wi9nmYIEaa	combination of things I think....economy....usually it does take a while to get a first job...it is competitive....and ....the interviewer may like another candidate more than you....because sometimes it does just come down to personality when there is little difference with the quality of aplicant....good luck  :  )|`|tFGMfDthaa	It very well could be. Unemployment is at it's highest everywhere. Even if you don't want to be a doctor, isn't there some other field you could utilize your training and go back to school and finish up in that other field? Unfortunately with the economy where it is, you might have to take something you don't really want while you are still looking for something else. Some places won't hire someone if they think they won't stay as they don't want to waste their time training someone for just a short time.|`|7nRom97Daa	the economy sucks for the last year. It took me over 1 month to land a job, with at least 50 applications & interviews. On the day I got my job, I had 3 places call within 20 minutes of each other, all wanting me to work there. Just keep at it, something will fall in place for you.
4Ct2FpjOaa	Well, we have AG day at our school every year. Last year and this year too I am in charge of it.<br>  <br>  We don't do it during FFA week but we do it in April. Either way....<br>  <br>  We usually take chickens, lambs, ponies, a quarter horse, calves, pigs, and sometimes a llama. We took a llama last year. I took the chickens and lambs last year. They are a joy to the children. I was the one giving lessons on horse safety. So , like safety around large animals is a good lesson. Showing where and where NOT to stand while near a horse, cow...<br>  <br>  Then lawnmower safety. And then yes, tractor safety. We had pedal tractor races and an animal sounds booth as well.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped =]

DdEzv3NCaa	Ok, so here are a couple of jokes that made me have a laughing fit! :)<br>  <br>  1)  A fellow walks into a bar very down on himself. As he walks up to the bar the bartender asks, "What’s the matter?" The fellow replies, "well I've got these two horses (sniff, sniff), and well... I can't tell them apart. I don't know if I'm mixing up riding times or even feeding them the right foods."The bartender, feeling sorry for the guy, tries to think of something he can do. "Why don't you try shaving the tail of one of the horses?"The man stops crying and says, "That sounds like a good idea, I think I'll try it."A few months later he comes back to the bar in worse condition than he was before. "What's the matter now?" the bartender asks. The fellow, in no condition to be in public, answers, "I shaved the tail of one of the horses (sob, sob), but it grew back and I can't tell them apart again!" The bartender, now just wanting him to shut up or leave says, "why don't you try shaving the mane, maybe that will not grow back."The fellow stops crying, has a few drinks, and leaves. A few months later the fellow is back in the bar. The bartender has never seen anybody in this sorry of a state. Without the bartender even asking the fellow breaks into his problems. "I.. I shaved the (sob) mane of one of the (sniff) horses, and... it... it... grew back!"The bartender, now furious at the guy's general stupidity, yells, "for crying out loud, just measure the stupid horses. Perhaps one is slightly taller that the other one!" The fellow cannot believe what the bartender has said and storms out of the bar. The next day the fellow comes running back into the bar as if he had just won the lottery. "It worked, it worked!" he exclaims. "I measured the horses and the black one is two inches taller than the white one!" <br>  <br>  2) Once there was a swimming race to cross the channel, and two cats were taking part. There was an English cat, whose name was one, two, three – and a French cat whose name was un, deux, trois...The race began and both cats were neck and neck until all of a sudden, a huge wave washed over them. One, Two, Three cat was a strong swimmer and was the only one to reach the other side and win the race. Why? Because, Un, Deux, Trois, Quatre, Cinq!<br>  <br>  3)  The Taco Bell Chihuahua, a Doberman and a Bulldog are in a bar having a drink when a great-looking female Collie comes up to them and says, "Whoever can say liver and cheese in a sentence can have me." <br>  So the Doberman says, "I love liver and cheese." The Collie replies, "That's not good enough." <br>  The Bulldog says, "I hate liver and cheese." She says, "That's not creative enough." <br>  Finally, the Chihuahua says, "Liver alone . . . cheese mine."<br>  <br>  Hope that cheered you up! XD|`|GwHxPCPgaa	when i  was walking my dogs this morning i was trying to look all cool walking 4 dogs (well behaved ones)when i tripped over and fell on my knees , one of my dogs thought this was great  and started to try hump me and everyone was laughing ,so the moral of the story is never try to look cool lol|`|qye6TYGuaa	This is an actual journal posted on DeviantArt:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/e/e5/Furry_Toilet_Rape_2.png" rel="nofollow">http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/...</a><br>  <br>  LMAO!

I'm now almost 14 and I still think I have it. It's a tricky situatuon- many people have it and don't realise.<br>  <br>  I never went to the doctors or properly explained to anyone that i thought I had it.<br>  <br>  Spot the sympotoms:<br>  Obsessive washing hands<br>  Always counting for the fun of it<br>  Obsessive cleaning<br>  Being tidy<br>  Having to do thigns a certain amount of times<br>  <br>  Talk to our mum and tell her that you care about HER. If she disagrees or wont talk think- Is it realy worth checking out.<br>  <br>  If so, persuade her to go to the doctors, or tell someone who can help e.g teacher, schol counsellor, friends, phone lines. e.g child line.<br>  <br>  Don't read too much into OCD because you may become paranoid<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped ....x|`|rpVQpJA7aa	My mom used to be the same way. One pair of shoes in the hallways, and she would yell at me to put them away, etc. Sounds like she has some symptoms of OCD. Does she wash her hands a lot, double check things?! If I were you, I would sit down and talk to her about all this, but not at a time where she is really upset with you for something. You need to calmly talk to her and let her know that she is making it so that you are almost paranoid to be around her. Tell her that she might have some sort of medical problem that can be taken care of by taking pills and then suggest that maybe she sees your family doctor. Also, is she married? Maybe talk to her husband/your dad about all this stuff. He might be able to get through to her better.

KOGxur8Vaa	The overall harmony is a little weak, and your voices are very soft.<br>  If you could both try belting it out a little instead of, singing it like you're in front of the mirror, you'll hear the difference.<br>  <br>  Note for note, it's a bit flat, but without a tonal reference, i.e. hitting a note on the keyboard, or playing to the backing track, it's a decent effort.<br>  Next time, play the note you want to start on, before practicing, it'll do wonders. (from what I gathered, you should be in E flat).<br>  <br>  If you want to beef up your sound a little, try having one singer hold the first note through the first phrase, then on the second drop down to the 7th (go down one note).. seems to be the right progression.<br>  Play with doing things like this, it's fun, and you can make unique sounds. Your voices compliment eachother well!<br>  <br>  Timing wise, it's good.. it's obvious you know the song really well. Keep an eye on plosives consonants like p, b, t , those are important.<br>  <br>  But y'know what.. just go for it. More than anything, it should be fun, and you'll have your buddy up there for support.<br>  <br>  Goodluck! =)|`|AA11506605	yea i guess ur ok singers.. i cant really hear it that great though
fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	Are you kidding me? It's hard enough to decide in one country such as our USA, I don't think it's possible for the whole world to be in one accord. The only way a one world government will work is when that government has total control. Not my cup of tea. People in one home can't agree on the same issues, nor a Church much less a whole country or the united states of one country... You are asking us if Utopia is possible? I think not.|`|tqquLcneaa	As long as the United States is the ruling body of the planet, I would be fine with me.|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	no.....not with one world government....it would be too easy to take over and become a dictator ship    :  )|`|AA10283080	Not a good idea.<br>  <br>  One government equals more power to that government and less power to the people.<br>  <br>  Government will always be corrupt.

Both of them are banned in  many counrties for their content O_O|`|liJKE5B2aa	Saturday Night Fever<br>  <br>  <br>  Roman Catholicism Al Dente|`|gQEtEtLQaa	For me it was probably 'The Exorcist' - it's a bit of a cliche now but it really scared me.  An evil pi**ed off spirit possessing a kid and trying to kill it really spooked me and it the fact that it was through a ouija board freaked me just a little bit more.<br>  <br>  'Stephen King's IT' really scared me too when I saw it for the first time when I was ten.  That freakin clown is still the creepiest thing I've ever seen *shudder*.|`|u2EUom6daa	mines an old movie called "An American Werewolf In London" i watched it With my brother when i was about 10 years old and it gave me nightmares, it was on TV a while back and i had to turn the TV over to another channel lol<br>  <br>  but recent movie would have to be "Hostel part 2" there was this one bit wont go into to much detail but a woman had a fresh blood bath and that part of the movie really turned my stomach.....i didn't mind "Hostel" i have both on DVD but i wont be watching "Hostel part 2" any time soon :)|`|rTDJAtG3aa	I'd have to say Hostel because that could actually happen to you. <br>  <br>  Anything real creeps me out.<br>  <br>  Also the Saw series is kind of scary because that could also really happen. <br>  <br>  Some of the traps in Saw were actual inventions from a man in France, so stay away from France =)|`|946d1d58cab0a4183184ea286020da64aa	Pet Sematary that was based on Stephen King's book.

The older of the two sisters is the main character, and she lives in her own horrific made-up world. <br>  Throughout the entire movie you have the eerie feeling that there's a presence in the house, and it culminates in unbelievably scary scenes. You don't know what's real and what's imagined, and who is mad and who's sane. <br>  This movie is so horrendous because it's about madness, and being trapped in a feeling of fear.<br>  And, ah, I don't know anything creepier than those crawling, pale ghost-girls with long black hair and hidden faces in Asian horror movies, like Sadako in the Japanese version of the Ring!<br>  "The Ring" is also one of the scariest movies I've seen, by the way, and "The tale of the two Sisters" is like it. <br>  Well, in general, I think that Japanese/Asian horror movies are better than Western horror movies.|`|tNoDAhbzaa	The Strangers really creeped me out...|`|iVP98E7maa	the descent gets intense...id still say the shinings one of em....|`|8LUm74jvaa	till now i liked the best "i know who killed me"<br>  it is awsome|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I don't really like horror movies, I prefer the thriller type like about ghosts and stuff. The Others was creepy and The Sixth Sense .What lies beneath is great too!|`|VNum3TKyaa	Well a lot of people say how funny it was but those people I guess weren't raised with religious parents like I was so for me it was The Exorcist that terrorized me for years after. Another for me was Trilogy of Terror the little guy with the knife scared the crap out of me for years one more was Salem's Lot the boy scratching on the window creepy.Now I Can't really think of any that really creep me out like when I was a kid there are lots that are bloody and gross but am I scared or really creeped out later while I'm in bed I have to say no.

BJIo6twUaa	It was a great series until they killed off the professor. From there it went down hill and even more so when they changed the entire cast except for Rembrandt. I didnt care too much for maggie character, she never sides in with a gun, but somewhere finds one and start shooting (yes i know she military, but still since there it seems guns were always needed where in the first few season, werent used all that much).<br>  <br>  When they bought in the Cromags (not sure on the spelling) from there, to me it seem to have lost its spark. I like the first and 2nd season more than the rest. Even if i wasnt too thrilled with the last soon, i wished they would have come up with an ending instead of leaving everyone hanging when it got canceled.<br>  <br>  Over all the idea of the show was great, i just think after the 2nd season they lost touch with the idea.<br>  <br>  <br>  The user comments on imdb, explains it very good about how the show went.<br>  <br>  The early seasons of Sliders were delicious, intelligent storylines with a relatively original premise and decent actors. Then it just got stupid. The first warning signs of a dying TV show came just before John Rhys-Davies died. Still I faithfully watched--that is, until Wade left. Then it just became ridiculous. The early chemistry of the group of travellers was ruined by the addition of Maggie, who was basically just added to balance out the male-female ratio and have get added ratings among teenage boys. Even with her around there were a few decent episodes (the zombie land springs to mind.) But once Wade left and Quinn's "mysterious" past and brother showed up, the show died completely.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112167/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112167/</a>

U8hLan5xaa	Whats the scene?

All this is controlled by a computer using satelittes and loads of other hi-tec stuff. Going on the computer sat-nav theme you could make out that one of the pilots has been messing with the system in the same way someone might mess with a friends car satnav, just for a joke. I once re-entered my friends home address so that instead of taking him home it guided him towards john o groats. So you could have a whole scene where the pilot is all, "you re always messing with my stuff!

But I couldn't resist writing this.. So here goes:<br>  <br>  There is this Hindi Music album with a similar plot. The girl, who is an Indian, falls for this guy. The girl has gloriously long hair. The guy has this gorgeos bike/cycle. The guy sells it to get her a beautiful Saree, and the girl cuts off her hair to get a head gear for the guy. I know my explanation is not doing justice to the actual video. Do watch it here..

d69d49545272c36ef0603d8151da8422aa	Not much different than mine (late 60's and early to mid seventies).<br>  <br>  I teach college age young people and they are trying to find themselves, like all young people have been throughout time.<br>  <br>  We were probably more promiscuous, I know young people are sexually active like we were, but they tebd to be with a [artner longer than we did.  They have more technology than we did, but we havew and use that too.<br>  <br>  I think this generation has a lot of passion about the environment and compassion for other people, like we did.  I hpoe they do not lose that, as so many of my generation did.|`|Fml5V53Baa	I think the younger generation behind me (i'm in my 20s) is more technologically dependent. That can be good and bad. At a young age they're good with technology and adapt with it. Unfortunately this also makes them more comfortable with the "easy" way. If the power goes out, they're bored as ever and can find nothing to do with themselves because their internet doesn't work....etc. They can't just sit down and do something that doesn't need power.|`|RFgApGNsaa	Our parents aren't as tough on us,because they don't want to be like theirs, and let us have more freedom....<br>   so most of us just take the P!ss.<br>  but we are quite similar.<br>  The older generation asssume that the younger one has no idea how tough life can be. they are very wrong.|`|q8Tkh1zdaa	we know how to use computers, we like porn way more than they do, none of the young kids today dress the same at all, and we basically do everything we can to piss off the older generation|`|UEzTKxwYaa	my generation sucks|`|GQJfBM5Uaa	life means many different things than be for,  like there sexually  seems its all good now and being faithful well it means its all good if ya don't get found out,  and to be a switch hitter seems to be a big cool thing now days|`|E3mOv4R5aa	kids these days dont give a **** and are so stubborn, <br>  <br>  back then[60's 70's] everybody was cool but in there own way and had more common sense i guess|`|iBH7NTl3aa	the age gap|`|Af6e3RUOaa	the age gap <br>  how can you tell if someone is the young generation or the older generation and what age do they have to be <br>  say you say they have to be 50 to be the old generation <br>  then a 49 who is classed as a young generation next year will be classed as old so i dont think there is young and old generation|`|dpCsTIEIaa	Not as appreciative for things that have been done for them or going to be done for them.

ojEkgJoqaa	they have really let it get to their head. when you see them with their fans they don't appreciate them and don't take enough time to sign their autographs or just a few  when someone wants to take a pic with them they usually blow it off or don't show appreciation.<br>  <br>  and they only attract the really young people and it won't last<br>  <br>  if you saw them on barbara walters last night they wouldn't even answer some of the questions that people really wanted to hear<br>  <br>  that is why|`|ULx2vAB1aa	they have no musical talent whatsoever. the singer can't sing. the guitarist can't play, and overall they are just pathetic. i heard a live performance they did a couple of days ago with stevie wonder, and they actually killed the song. they literally took a hack saw and carved it up. pathetic excuse for music.|`|wxXguyK3aa	I'm not saying they're bad artists, but I just don't like their style of music.

NO IDEA<br>  <br>  But saying they do not like their music wouldn't be untrue to them it would just be unpleasant to you (a fan)|`|Ed2DGWkeaa	they suck, they're fake, they're gay as hell and they're music is s|`|hHjfoKEHaa	As a fan you obviously can't see it, but those guys are childish and pathetic.|`|MzSFaebraa	They are over publicized.It gets annoying.|`|q9BItD25aa	Their foreheads are too big.......|`|ng7KNpOOaa	*they can't sing<br>  <br>  *they belong to disneychannel and do everything they say<br>  <br>  * people only remember joe and nick and kevin is ovbi the best<br>  <br>  * they wear pants that are way to tight <br>  <br>  * they don't have to announce their purity to the world yet they do for some reason. prob for publicity<br>  <br>  and I don't hate them. there's just better music out there but I do hate how every single teen falls over them and cry when the see them. it's ridiculous|`|qwInrvUGaa	i hate their music, i don't like disney stars, and i don't like their fans who always ask for reason as to why i don't like them<br>  <br>  and not all people say cruel things about them and most do hate their music and you can't have a list of reasons why you can't like them cause some of those reasons are reasons why people don't like them|`|Ufb4XBIHaa	I've never heard their music and don't even know that much about them, but I won't listen to them on a few (admittedly petty) principles. <br>  <br>  1) I'm a bit of a music snob and so I tend to turn away from the things that the majority (ESPECIALLY OF PRE-TEENS/YOUNGER TEENS) find omgawesome (I'm 19). In my mind, their popularity doesn't come from the quality of their music but from the fact that it's popular to like them. (Remember: I haven't actually HEARD their music.) <br>  2) It seems like they've gotten most of their fame through the Disney Channel. Sorta like Hannah Montana. I won't listen to her either. It just seems like they (the group and their 'image', not the music) is being marketed. People are obsessed over the celebrity and not the actually music. Which is fine for some people, but not for me. <br>  3) My twelve-year-old sister likes them. <br>  4) It's just not my style of music.|`|JmqbavUaaa	Why did everyone "hate" the Hansens. Everyone secretly loved them but never said anything because they all looked like girls. I think you just have to appreciate a certain kind of music to appreciate the Jonas Brothers. I think they get just as much criticism as every other celebrity.|`|yVRpdx5laa	I don't think they have talent like the media portrays them. They aren't anything that hasn't come before them. They keep getting referred to as the Beatles of today and that is ridiculous because these guys are only replicating the sounds of those who went before them while the Beatles created their own unique sound waves. They are just three young guys in girls pants and disney made a mockery of them.|`|H2VxdK44aa	i dont like them but i dont criticize them by saying really cruel things but 1. i think they are ugly and 2. i think they dress weird, but i dont say really mean things about them, its just my opinion so i keep it to myself|`|ODvnyAdlaa	they are commercialised and made by the music label. There is nothing unique about them and they have personalities that were created for them x|`|UZEEKKPeaa	I don't even know who they are.<br>  It shouldn't matter to you if others hate them. Maybe you should convince us why we should like them.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Because I am 33 and their music is marketed to a much younger crowd.  I grew out of my teeny bopper boy band phase about 18 years ago.|`|Ojpm4whaaa	every time joe sings he squishes his legs together so his junk looks bigger.........i only have a problem with joe i dont mind the other clones|`|hqA9rzE5aa	I don't hate them, I just don't care for their type of music.

(I'm a woman, it makes me cringe.)  If they wore looser pants, their balls might drop.<br>  <br>  (My bad, I think I said something offensive.)|`|FDt7cC8haa	They were created by and for Disney....They are nothing more than live action cartoon characters acting out a Disney story line...|`|oeCIzoF9aa	They sound like they've been kicked in the balls too many times.  Who knows, it may be one of their past times.|`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	Personally I don't understand why it's such a hot topic on Y!A. I don't care about them either way. Only thing I don't like that they did is their cover of A Pirate's Life For Me (it doesn't sound very pirate-like, more like something you'd find on MTV), otherwise, I don't care much about them either way. I just look at them as some kids who are making money. Disney saw their marketability factor and as a result, they're having a good career. I have no reason to like or dislike them personally, I just think of them as what kids listen to today.<br>  <br>  If you like the Jonas Brothers, then that's fine by me. Everyone has their own tastes in music. You might not like some of the stuff I like, infact you probably wouldn't. But I'm okay with that. To be honest, they're the only thing of today's music that I know about because of how much they're talked about on the internet.|`|mzIfJIQVaa	i hate anyone that became famous by ******* disney channel ya know, but i really dont like their music, its to popular, its a sell out, im punk, i wouldnt like something like that and i dont so yea|`|Kbgc6x5raa	i don't hate them i acctually love burnin' up|`|dDDAbqqhaa	they suck

I've never seen another Japanese film of the era to take on sexuality like this one. Its almost impossible to describe. In its purest form, Its about the search for ultimate sensation.

We were laying on my bed and talking about serious things like marriage and when we get our own house, etc.. He kept looking into my eyes and telling me how beautiful I am. Then he said "The house that I build for you will be inspired by your beauty and will be a representation of how beautiful you are....." (he is an architect) - I started bawling immediately and it was one of the sweetest things he's ever said to me. I started shaking, it was so profound. I hugged him and didn't want to let go..... <br>  <br>  That was an unbelievably special moment for me. He is so amazing ... and I miss him so much now!

Tool, I guess... Not Green Day, though, a bit too political for my taste.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	I second Equally Uneven's answer|`|iZDsMCghaa	Tool and NIN|`|Oz9dSr32aa	Bullet, because not only do they have amazingly awesome drum/guitar solos' but their songs tell a story or broadcast real pain. real feelings. <br>  <br>  annnd <br>   Green Day. They're no where near as hard as the others, but they're classic. they're the revolutionary punk lords. they've given the world of music so much and they still have so much more to offer. <br>  <br>  and i like their music. :]|`|dFacbjIZaa	NIN<br>  <br>  You are quite welcome to keep the rest.<br>  <br>  A7X are Brokencyde are better than what?<br>  <br>  Being eaten by Jaws?<br>  Being duct-taped to a chair and forced to listen to 24 straight hours of Miley Cyrus?<br>  Having Your ears gouged off with a spork?|`|HqfF4bFNaa	bullet for my valentine and slipknot are the best on that list<br>  brokencyde and a7x are better though|`|0ectWZxAaa	Nin<br>  Greenday|`|kqLwCdXfaa	I like Greenday...keep the rest|`|kPKKyZluaa	none of them bands that's for sure|`|0b3fa313a09fd3b8730664822eb4455baa	out of those...<br>  <br>  Aiden and Green Day|`|3L4citcnaa	Ummm, is there an OTHER option? Were you going to 90's garageband types, or fake emo types? <br>  <br>  Though, of the ones listed, Greeday is preferable. Though that is like having to choose between cauliflower and broccoli. Blech.|`|uwFOTLHiaa	Out of that list, my favorites are Tool and Slipknot. NIN isn't quite melodic enough for me, Green Day is a bunch of ******* sellouts, and BFMV is way too mainstream.<br>  <br>  Oh and I don't listen to Aden.|`|bP58ZLWMaa	Tool<br>  Early Greenday|`|jlBIVxJaaa	Slipknot and B4MV|`|c52F2UnYaa	Tool and Slipknot|`|j8CeFZOvaa	Green Day|`|hmjAwZQEaa	slipknot and NIN|`|D1KT9ioJaa	none....how about N'sync and Backstreet Boys|`|pZ3QYmMQaa	Aiden and Bullet For My Valentine...<3...

D657vcVsaa	comment on a personality trait, like if she makes a joke, "wow, i didn't know you were so funny."  if you notice something small, it shows you are observant and are definitely into her because your are paying attention to what she is saying or doing. just be genuine and it shouldn't matter what you say.|`|WtTUNC8Naa	My boyfriend tells me all the time how beautiful i am or gorgeous. It's not about saying the right things to make you stand out. It's all about showing her that you are different then the rest of the ******* out there. Be yourself, don't be someone your not. <br>  My boyfriend is better than all the guys ive dated or met in the past. He's spontaneous, caring, affectionate, loving... well just all around perfect. <br>  Just the sound of his voice, after a bad day at work can put a smile on my face. It's just in the small little things that he does to make him stand out. And believe me, its not all about materialistic things either.
RUoXZmYFaa	No, Twilight was not nominated for an Academy Award (Oscar).<br>  <br>  Robert Pattinson was a presenter onstage during the Oscars telecast, but the movie, itself was not nominated.<br>  <br>  The Academy does not  typically  honor teen-centric, mainstream movies like Twilight, even though it was extremely popular upon its release.|`|Uz1RzHzlaa	HAHAHAHAHA! Is this a joke? Twilight? The worst movie of the year according to critics across the country. Getting nominated for an Oscar? HAHAHAHAHAHA!|`|Ta7snyIoaa	No, like I said before movies like Twilight rarely get nominated for anything. <br>  Robert Pattinson was only there for a fancy montage thing.|`|LIaNBM3iaa	Twilight didn't get any Oscar nominations.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Nomination?

yXt321Rlaa	Well, if they're putting out singles it usually means they already have an album out. Or at least A Demo or EP. If the album was out in September  they would want to release the single before the release of the album to get some radio play and to get people to buy the album. Or maybe A few weeks after it was released. If they already have A 3 album deal, depending on how fast they can write their songs, I would expect all 3 albums to be released in possibly 2 and A half years maybe 3 at the most.<br>  Hope I Helped.|`|giTM8kvXaa	sdfsd|`|UbYJsgUfaa	Its ususally about 1 year depending on wether they tour and stuff like that <br>  its good to keep looking on their website to see if they have any new music coming out

All economies experience periods of recession (usually about every 10-15 years). The reason that there is such a huge emphasis on this recession is the emergence of 24/7 media.<br>  <br>  At the time of the last recession in Engalnd, the internet was in it's infancy, mobile phones didn't have the capability they have now and 24/7 news channels didn't exist. <br>  <br>  Doom and Gloom make headlines and sell papers. This recession is no different to all the others before it and the World didn't explode then. Always take the "impartial" media with a grain of salt. People wouldn't watch the news unless the subject matter is glammed up|`|kTTwUY0Waa	The economy is just another symptom baby. The world is sick and people have been saying this for a long time, but just like the man who wont give up smoking until his lungs collapse with blackened tar infested tumors, so people will not stop consuming until the sky is on fire and your children have no future. Consumerism is the cancer of the earth, let the banks crumble, bring on the anarchy and we will see who survives the next thousand years, because the economists and capitalists have srewed it up.

AA11404443	I watch it, I agree that the second episode was better.|`|AA10954273	The second episode was better, but I'm not sure it would have been possible for it to get worse.  And, while it was an improvement, the fact that they ripped off "The Most Dangerous Game" so early in the show is a sign of a lack of imagination.  Part of the problem is that Eliza Dushku simply appears to be unable to carry the show.  The writing is pedestrian, and the show itself is exploitative and skeevey.|`|lebSL2yaaa	I watched the first one, and didn't think much of it.  I prefer Fringe, and Leverage.

Tf3s78Huaa	It's true that Bill Cosby had a short temper, and often used violence to let out his emotions.  But Family Guy decided to make fun of him, in an episode, when the family was watching home videos, and Peter puts on one of Bill Cosby beating up a little person, because of a jello pop.  But that specific incident never happened.

Klw3Ke3Haa	Because of it's fanservice for mainly the Japanese audience. J-girls love it because it has so many cute and pretty characters. J-boys love it because of it's attractive and sexy girls in their along with a little bit of ninja stuff. It was never made to appeal to audiences of all kind I think.|`|4Zj9eYgPaa	Beats me. People likes coloured ninjas, go figure. <br>  I don't like it because it has lame/toilet jokes, annoying main characters: one that is always going like "the power of dreams and frienship, dattebayo/believe it!" and is damn annoying; the one who is always angsting and trying to kill all that's happy; and the other one who does nothing in 98,5% of the show, which is a lot. Plus, the plot doesn't really help the series: besides being always fighting the Akatsuki, all of a sudden the main character has a brother for gods know why... and don't get me started on that.<br>  <br>   I prefer more realistic series when it comes to ninja, and rainbow coloured ninjas aren't really my thing.|`|JKQGy2aZaa	i dont no its ok but i like the first 2 seeasons of pokemon and the 1st of digimon way better then naruto  <br>  <br>  plus there's alot better funny fighting anime with way better plot and dirtier and more gory stuff in it <br>  <br>  but come on the episode of south park good times with wapons where they make fun of anime is way funny and awsomer then naruto it ok for 12 year old who are starting to watch anime but its just not as awsome as people think|`|Hiasgb75aa	I don't know either. All I know is that it is the most overrated piece of crap in existence!|`|Gem96NQyaa	Really, it has the same appeal as Dragonball, and the less well-known Yu Yu Hakusho.  The jokes aren't constantly lowbrow (though there's some of that, too), but they're not way over people's heads.  There's a lot of action mixed with comic relief.  There's a little romance, but not so much that it takes over.  And it has a very defined goal for each of the main protagonists.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to say that every episode is gold.  And once they deviate from the manga series storyline towards the end, it loses some appeal, because it's nothing but filler episodes until Shippudan starts... but overall, it's one of the better ones out there.<br>  <br>  You also kind of have to keep in mind that it IS meant to appeal to 12 to 15 year old boys.  Much like Dragonball, and the like.  Of course that doesn't mean it's the only group it appeals to, but it's who they market it toward.  Naruto Shippudan is intended for a slightly older audience, and the characters and content age accordingly.|`|tsNMMLMUaa	Naruto is a fantasy land where Ninja's with flamboyant hair and very colorful clothing can run around doing karate chops to eachother, and the little kids who watch it want to be just like them.<br>  <br>  It is another superhero craze. There were comicbook heroes in the past, and now there is television heroes.<br>  <br>  Naruto is a show about heroes vs. villains, and this idea will stick around forever.<br>  <br>  I can't say it is worth watching, because it is so ridiculous and boring, but for those that do watch it, I assume they like it because of all the queer and colorful costumes, the crazy fashionable hairstyles, the shirtless men with muscles, and the fact that they are all senslessly beating the hell out of eachother.<br>  <br>  If you ask me, it is pretty much like a cartoon version of wrestling.|`|Dy14VNebaa	naruto has a really good plot to not to forget its hilarious sense of humor and dramatic tension.some people say its lame because they have no sense of action and adventure.its a really good show and those who cant say anything about it are just abnoxious people.and btw-its not like pokemon and pokemon and naruto arent kiddy shows fyi.|`|yZCUjjDTaa	I Don't Really Know, But I Don't Really Like It....-_- Digimon is better in my opinion it got to confusing and to long for me....though Itachi is my favorite anime character.

Klw3Ke3Haa	IDK, because like you I too only pretty much saw a glimpse of it. It was just way too boring and painful to sit through. Also I happened to have a lot of work to do during that time, so I didn't really watch it.|`|pR0pJNJkaa	I thought the way they presented to actors with previous winners was good this year. I also liked most of the films nominated this year. The Wrestler was so deep. Slumdog was amazing. If it was any other year I would say Benjamin Button would've won. There was great parity for best picture and best supporting actress.|`|AA10742175	Nope!! didnt even watch them! All the people in HOLLWIERD are IDIOTS! They are so out of touch with average Americans it is sad!! THey dont care! so I dont either!!|`|igwpoRxkaa	Nope! I liked parts of it but what I didnt like is that........ TWILIGHT DIDNT WIN ANYTHING!!!!! Humph.|`|6rR7LTl1aa	The simpleton bellyaching about Twilight nearly made me erupt into laughter at my workstation -- unless you can objectively state what made it a notably superior work, you're nothing but a fanatic.<br>  A collumnist I'm somewhat fond of put it best: "That’s the equivalent of serving Pop Tarts on Iron Chef."<br>  <br>  That said, I couldn't suppress the overwhelming sense of...mediocrity, I suppose, that I felt with most of the awards.<br>  <br>  The inane posturing during the proceedings didn't help much, either.<br>  <br>  At least Ledger was recognized for his work.
Klw3Ke3Haa	Yep, it happens to me all the time. I get pissed off way to often from that.|`|l9uGrfSYaa	Not really. I mean........if you want an anime to have a real ending, the best thing YOU can do about it is write a fanfic. I'm usually satisfied though. <br>  <br>  spoilers rule<br>  <br>  nya|`|XNIkS3KNaa	It usually doesn't make me mad, but a few have before.  Like for example Inuyasha and Loveless.  <br>  <br>  The ending like in Elfen Lied didn't bother me because things were actually resolved somewhat and they just left the very end up to the viewers imagination.
Klw3Ke3Haa	To be honest I didn't even know about it until the movies came out. Afterwards, I liked the idea. Because I actually thought that the movies were really well made.|`|BbiyBG0oaa	I think that it somewhat was a good move, the only reason people are bothered by it is because his greatest work was in the empire strikes back which is the greatest star wars movie created.  But I loved seeing the growth of Anakin, in attack of the clones Anakin was kind of a little whiny, but in the third movie you completely see how he has grown and matured and i thought the storyline was pretty good.  In revenge of the sith i thought the Anakin/Obiwan lightsaber battle in some parts were kind of dumb, for instance when they were swinging their lightsabers around uselessly and then decide to have a force battle throwing both of them into the walls.  When I first saw the Phantom Menace i thought it was great how they developed the new technology making the graphics 50 times better but I will say that Jar Jar Binks kind of ruined the movie.  He was soo damn annoying i couldn't stand him.  The prequel was a good idea but to some extent you have to look back at the originals those were true classics.|`|DE3rcXkHaa	I like to look at the end result.....total and complete garbage.<br>  <br>  I never want to see George Lucas near a movie set ever again.  No...no...no....not even to advise!<br>  <br>  He blew it, and 3 times!|`|0g2fDpUbaa	My initial reaction, which was justified in the results, was "oh no!"|`|vLmgRAvNaa	I thought it was fine because when I was a little kid I always wondered why Star Wars said Episode IV at the beginning.|`|SEPSUf0Saa	I think it was a pretty good move.|`|JKQGy2aZaa	i hated it man they suck compared to the orginal there was only 1 good thing about it and thats darth moul the best star wars character ever he probably could beat darth vader but the rest of it was complete garbage<br>  <br>  i was ok with it when they said they were making new star wars but i thought it be actualy be good|`|6rR7LTl1aa	I was for the idea, being as it was a missing part of the story on which the entire original trilogy was built, but the execution was almost wholly abysmal.<br>  <br>  It had some redeeming features, but most of it was unforgiveably subpar.

Whatever you can afford, from 1 to 100 000.<br>  Peace.|`|PicEC6W4aa	Honestly, you can have as many as you want as long as the story only revolves around at the most, three I think. Any more than three and its too much story. Look at the first X-men movie... They had numerous heroes but the story revolved around wolverine and rogue mostly. So the less heroes you revolve around the better in my opinion. Super hero scripts are kind of played out. Its better if you approach the super hero thing with the seriousness of an action movie or drama.|`|wCH0gHqfaa	I would say three members is the ideal number.  You need an odd number just to have that one member that can mediate group conflict and that's a "tiebreaker".  But as far as being crowded, it's hard to say b/c there are a million X-Men.  But six or more seems like it's too much.  Just my opinion.  Nice question though.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	I believe 3-4 superheroes would be appropriate for a team,that way they all stand out along with each of their particular abilities or powers...4-5 would be max and 6-7 would be too crowded to appreciate each 1....<br>  I also am working on learning scriptwriting...cool!!!|`|YyeZ3Mncaa	5

bsnnEsp5aa	It is from Clannad, the second season (Clannad ~After Story~)<br>  (The character with the shark is Sunohara, the characters in the background are Sanae, Tomoya and Mae)<br>  <br>  Its one of my favourite animes, absolutely lovely, amusing yet dramatic story.<br>  <br>  This is the summary for the first season<br>  <br>  CLANNAD (romance, comedy, drama, high school, harem, slice of life)<br>  Tomoya Okazaki is a third-year high school student who is generally bored with life and doesn't take his studies, future, or anything else seriously. One day, however, he meets a lonely-looking girl in the school courtyard, Nagisa Furukawa. She explains to him the source of her loneliness: she had missed a lot of the previous school year and thus is repeating her third year; everybody that she knew has already graduated, and she is lonely. Tomoya is rather indifferent at first, but decides that he has nothing better to do and spends increasingly more time helping Nagisa restore the school drama club. As his relationship with Nagisa grows, Tomoya begins to open up to various other people around the school as well...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|ZRERT1MZaa	to me it may be clannad since the dude in the back looks like this chara from it:<br>  <a href="http://i284.photobucket.com/albums/ll8/AndyFat/tomoya555.png" rel="nofollow">http://i284.photobucket.com/albums/ll8/A...</a><br>  <br>  and the person playing the fish lol looks like the dude being hit by teh girl:<br>  <a href="http://i456.photobucket.com/albums/qq286/eihziekhiel/Clannad.gif" rel="nofollow">http://i456.photobucket.com/albums/qq286...</a><br>  <br>  sorry i havnt watched the anime so i dont know the names lol xP|`|MNPWJPWhaa	its gotta be clannad. the main guy is the blue hair guy. i only watched the first season but i recognize the atr. the blonde dude is the man guy's friend who gets bashed a lot buy some grey hair girl.

Do this on your own.<br>  <br>  But I still have to answer in some manner. A good romantic composer to use would be Liszt, cause he was quite the social butterfly, and a crazy nut with his technique. A good classical composer could be Haydn... Probably just because I like Haydn. now research those two... and write your essay!<br>  <br>  Cheerio
9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	I agree. The only way you will learn is to do yuor own research, LISTEN TO THE MUSIC, and make your own judgements.<br>  <br>  Be warned: some contributors to the classical music section, sick and tired of lazy people like you trying to get others to so their homework for them, deliberately feed them wrong information to teach them a lesson. So, you are also SAFER doing you own homework!|`|aSTmFCiBaa	i think the mass in c is superior to the ninth ,,,,,,stone cold magnificent,has counterpoint,fugal style,harmony,,,,,,converging and diverging,,,has JAZZ,just a chord or two,but it is there,,,,,,,gloria,kyrie,sanctus,,,,,,do... nobis pacem,,,this one is the greatest of the mass,get the cd,robert shaw chorale and the atlanta symphony orchestra   missa lubba was recorded in 1953,,,,the drums in it do more than accompany the voices,the drums do speak/sing,,,,listen and compare the composers intent,you should simply buy them and listen to what you think is the composers intent|`|DMpVSHvXaa	Ryan, it is not nice to give misinformation to these poor people.

Half the people on this forum have collage degrees and have already written essays like this, now its you're turn...<br>  <br>  I'll just say that if I wrote this, it might very well be on the Diabelli Variations... Just a hint perhaps... <br>  <br>  And a suggestion, I'd assume you want this question answered...

d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	As a man... it says don't try to generalize films in general based upon action movies.<br>  <br>  In some films sexuality is empahsized, in others it isn't.  Films run the entire spectrum, as do the portrayal of male and female characters.<br>  <br>  In Kill Bill and Charlies Angel's it was primarily about the women's fighting skill and kick-a$$ attitudes!  Same with the Long Kiss Goodnight.  In Mr. and Mrs Smith it was about 50% sex appeal and 50% deadly skill.  In Legally Blonde it was all about the girl's brains being overlooked because of her playboy-bunny appearance.<br>  <br>  In Batman Begins, the emphasis was on Rachel's dedication as a prosecutor and unwillingness to compromise when it came to justice, unlike Bruce Wayne who wanted revenge.<br>  <br>  In Mission Impossible:2 they introduced this smart, skilled female spy who looked like the perfect foil to Tom Cruise, then reduced her to eye candy just to lure her ex-boyfriend into a trap.  In Lord of the Rings, a woman killed the supernatural being that no man could.<br>  <br>  But that's just a small sampling of movies.  <br>  <br>  What about The Queen? Doubt? Changeling? Contact?

PeuFnqQwaa	Do you want this effect for recording or for live performance? Regardless, you will need a vocal processer, that will give you the appropriate effect. I am not sure what they are using, but you can by rackmountable mutieffects processers that give different effects such as delay, chorus, de essing, compression, reverb, pitch change, pitch correction, harmonies etc. Find the effect they are using and buy the appropriate processor. They could be using a filter and other things as well.<br>  <br>  I use an Alesis MidiVerb for Delay, Reverb etc. and a TC Helicon Voiceworks for pitch correction, voice thickening and sometimes harmonies. I also use a stereo compressor/gate/limiter and two 31 band eq's Try and find an equipment list for the strokes online, and see what they use.<br>  UPDATE:<br>  From what I have seen by searching online, they appear to use distortion on their vocals.<br>  Heres what someone has said in gearslutz forums...<br>  <br>  they actually used a Peavey guitar amp (practice amp i believe).

LBovv7Sxaa	if it was Ben, he would know. because he had the names and files of all the freighter people. and he tried to kill charlotte. so i don't think it's ben.<br>  maybe widmore.<br>  but i think faraday and penny will end up being brother & sister.<br>  because we see in 1954, with Richard and Widmore, a blonde british woman named Ellie (short for Eloise? Eloise Hawking? Faraday's mother?)<br>  and so i think Widmore and Hawking were together, had twin babies (Faraday and Penny) and each of the parents got to take a baby.<br>  Widmore took Penny and Hawking took Faraday.<br>  the writers are HUGE star wars fans, and this is their Luke and Leia story.|`|M8yem2wUaa	I guess it could be Charles Widmore.|`|8uvb3Nroaa	Good guess, maybe it can be Charles Widmore! ha!|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I like Jen's theory that it's Ben. That makes a lot of sense. If his wife and daughter had left it would've only added to his twistedness. Of course it could be Charles Widmore, Richard Alpert, or Christian Shephard (he's always appearing and is already Jack and Claire's father).|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Hmmm that is what I have been wanting to know too! Maybe Charles Widmore, maybe Richard Alpert, Ben, the possibilities are endless almost! Ben would actually make sense come to think about it bc he took Alex when she was born to be his, maybe he was trying to replace the one he lost!!!!
4Zj9eYgPaa	I would recommend you to watch the anime first because the manga plot goes beyond the anime. <br>   I don't think it will make you jump of the chair because it really isn't a thriller so you'll know what's coming, but I guaranty you'll be seeing lots of blood and limbs flying through the air, on the other hand, I can say the plot is one of the best I've seen and the characters, despite one of them being a psycho, are lovable. <br>  <br>  Not to mention the OST is brilliant, specially the opening theme "Lilium".|`|w6nZQeTvaa	i have only seen the anime so i dont know about the manga but if you dont like there to be blood and death then dont watch it.<br>  <br>  there is also some nudity and romance but overall i like it<br>   i hope that i helped you

vH2OF9z8aa	yes they are One slow to action, but decisive and unrelenting once set in motion. A force of nature whose methods are as predictable and dependable as they are unstoppable. The voice of duty, honor, and responsibility. The will to the change the world, not through bold action, but through the thorough and unwavering application of proven means. <br>   The card in the center right represents what stands between you and your partner. Knight of Wands: The essence of fire, such a great conflagration. One filled with vitality and passion for life. A sexy and exciting person, daring in their actions, cocky in their attitude, and utterly without fear. Absolute sincerity, coupled with violent emotions that swing wildly from one extreme to another. Boundless creativity and lust for a change of both pace and place. The rapid approach, or more likely departure, of something that sets your world ablaze. Often suggests travel or escape. <br>   The card in the lower left represents how your partner sees you. King of Cups: The essence of water behaving as air, such as a billowing cloud in the blue sky: Great maturity, endless patience, tolerance of other points of view, and a deep knowledge of human nature. One who intuitively knows the strengths of those around him, and gently cultivates them. Remaining calm and relaxed in all situations, and making artful use of diplomacy or a quiet word to resolve conflicts. The ability to listen to what another person is saying, and truly understand what is in their heart. A rewarding partner and a beloved leader. <br>   The card in the lower right represents what your partner feels about you. The Fool: Fearlessness, imagination, open-mindedness, and an adventurous spirit. Freedom from cares and worries. Ideas, thoughts, and impulses coming from a completely unexpected place. Nonchalance at the threshold of gaining all or losing all. Extravagance and intoxication with life. The pure and undifferentiated power of creation itself, where ultimate knowledge and oblivion are unified. <br>   The card in the center represents the present status or challenge of the relationship. The Hermit: Withdrawal from events and relationship to introspect and gather strength. Seeking the inner voice or calling upon vision from within. A need of understanding and advice, or a wise man who will offer knowing guidance. Personal experience and thoughtful temperance.|`|EuwjIJ3Zaa	Yes, I have.

I think it can be human nature (not every ones) to make fun of the weak.  I believe it's highly insecure people that attack the "weak" or people that have handicaps.  I think sometimes people may also make fun because they are afraid of what handicap people may represent - people in need.  But, you know what?  We're all "in need" to some degree.<br>  <br>  I believe everyone on some level fears becoming "different" or handicapped someday.  These "fears" can make people act so cruelly.  I recently became handicapped in my 30's.  It's been extremely difficult.  But, honestly my handicap has been easier to deal with than how some people have been treating me.<br>  <br>  I don't think people always know what to say.  So, they sometimes choose to say nothing, or choose to speak cruelly.  It's like I'm making them feel uncomfortable because I'm different now.  But, I'm still the same person as I always was.

He lives with his mother, father, and fellow high school student Hiromi Yuasa who moved into his house after her father died. Her father had been a close friend of the family, so it was natural for Hiromi to come stay with the Nakagami family; one year has passed since she came to live in their home. Shinichiro has known Hiromi for years, but before he had always treasured her smile, though now she acts coldly when at home and he cannot bring up the nerve to talk with her either. When she is at school, Hiromi is popular, always smiles, and is talented in sports, but Shinichiro knows she must be hiding things inside her. At school, he meets a strange girl named Noe Isurugi who wishes him misfortune after Shinichiro teases her. After a bit of bad luck, he reconciles with Noe by crafting a chicken out of a tissue box and finds out from her that she "gave her tears away". Shinichiro also likes to spend time with his childhood friends Miyokichi Nobuse and Aiko Endo at the Imagawayaki shop Aiko's family owns.|`|fKcr6KU0aa	You may want to check out Bokura ga Ita or Kare Kano (His and Her Circumstances)?

Off the top of my head the only one I can think of is "Sole Survivor" a very popular tv movie from the 70's that people love and for some reason has never been out on dvd. Little Audrey I have never found on dvd (old cartoon I love).
AA11402617	Honestly I don't see that happening. Not with the original cast. The expectations would be unreasonably high.  Look what happened to Joey.  "Friends" was extended one year longer than the original contracts with the actors.  They agreed to one more season with each of the cast making one million dollars per episode.  I can imagine the circumstances that would make it possible for the original cast to star in the show again for less money.|`|9KWVgb9naa	i will believe it when i see it|`|FxAD44Moaa	whoooopee doooo!<br>  <br>  i have a sister who's worked at  WB for 30 years... she hasn't heard anything.<br>  <br>  <br>  and if there was any viability to this..    why?  haven't we suffered enough with just the syndication flooding?|`|YNuyXl1waa	Wake the hell up, man.<br>  <br>  This is 100% bull****! <br>  A quick check of Broadcasting and Cable's website has no such news (and that is a much-respected TV industry news publication).<br>  <br>  You have as much of a connection with anyone at Warner Bros. as my neighbor's cat does.<br>  <br>  The most over-sold, over-played, and overhyped 1990s sitcom ever...and its "fans" have nothing better to do than spread gossip about "its impending return" on the internet...SHEESH!!!|`|BJoojnQCaa	I find this hard to believe.

bNq32KLcaa	My favourite current Holby City character is Joseph Byrne because he is quiet and seemingly composed on the surface, yet he is deeply neurotic and insecure underneath.<br>  <br>  My favourite previous Holby character is Anton Meyer.

7kMeaccWaa	The film has a very loose plot which is little more than a vehicle to link together the concert footage. It concerns the adventures of Ashley Wallace (Robert Hughes), a na?ve radio DJ who is sent by his boss (Bruce Barry) to get an in-depth interview ("Not an interview, a dialogue", demands his boss) with the group, whose fame and stature neither he nor Ashley have the first clue about, which is to be aired on the day ABBA leave Australia. Needless to say, Ashley singularly fails (and the fact that he has accidentally left his press card behind at the radio station doesn't help matters!), and – armed with his trusty reel-to-reel tape recorder – is forced to follow the group all over Australia, experiencing repeated run-ins with the group's bodyguard (Tom Oliver), as well as his increasingly exasperated boss, who is threatening to fire Ashley unless he gets the interview. Eventually, a stroke of luck at the hotel where Ashley happens to be staying at the time has him bump into Stig Anderson, the group's manager, who grants him an interview. Unfortunately, he sleeps in (earlier in the movie, in a dream sequence, Ashley has become ABBA's best friend; the dream sequence was also used as the video for the single "The Name of the Game" in some territories) and ends up missing the appointment. Just as Ashley is about to give up (by this time, he doesn't even care that his press card – which has also been travelling across Australia, continually forwarded by the postal service – has finally arrived!) and resign himself to the fact that he will soon be unemployed, something truly miraculous happens: he bumps into the group in an elevator at the Melbourne hotel and manages to finally get the interview he needs – just in time to meet the deadline for the radio show to go out on-air. He puts together the final edit in the back of a taxi on the way back from the airport, as ABBA depart Australia for Europe. With only seconds to go, Ashley makes it back to the radio station where, having set the tape up on the studio's playback machine, he relaxes at his control desk to listen as the interview – which he worked so long and hard to obtain – is broadcast over the airwaves down under.|`|BgouZaeSaa	HI EVERYONE.mamma mia called the movie and take place on skiathos a grrek island.MERYL STREEP lives there and her daughter find out tha her mother's past hints three men. so she wants to find out who is her really father. that why she invite the three men to her mariage.

H659yRKAaa	You don't have to, but it would be good to ask a friend or relative to know a little bit about the basics, because if for some reason you mess up, then you can use the score to help you get back on track if the band doesnt stop. You should just know the "value" of each note (how long you have to hold it for) Like a quarter note is one beat, a half note is two beats, a half note with a dot next to it is 3 beats, and a whole note is 4 beats. Like I said, have a friend or relative show you what they look like. They will be easy to recognize once you've seen them.|`|94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	I agree with Bucwheat. Simply being able to "feel" the music will handle that for the most part. <br>  <br>  Also, it's not a given that you MUST sing "on the beat"...many great vocal interpreters over the years intentionally sang just  before or after the beat. If it's good enough for Billie Holiday, it's probably OK for you. :D|`|4wlwyhvnaa	Absolutely not. I have been singing in a rock band for 3 years and I am just learning how to read notes because I am taking guitar lessons.  Nobody that I have ever played with writes out the songs so we all feed of eachother to be on beat. The drummer is the one that needs to stay on tempo and everyone else follows the drum beat. Hope this helps|`|Pi2jc5kZaa	Not really. You can simply count beats with your feet, hit one equals one beat, two hits equals two beats, etc. But it helps to learn to read music anyways if you ever want to pick up an instrument.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	Negative.....|`|emzQNo0Haa	Not at all necessary but it can help.|`|3iZJ4o2maa	No
aihogb26aa	There's been conflicting rumors all over the place about Izzy and George. The creator of the show said that they weren't leaving, but other co-stars have said that they are, and the actors themselves aren't saying anything. It's pretty well known that both actors have been unhappy on the show, both personally and professionally. Both have stated that they are unhappy with their characters' plotlines (it seems like George has nothing to do lately) and the Izzy/ brain aneurysm storyline was written in because Katherine Heigl publibly stated that she was unhappy with the writing for her character. I would not be surprised to see both leave within the next year, especially since Katherine Heigl has a decent movie career so far.|`|n7N6xq2aaa	shes got cancer, cuz they switched the results<br>  she was at the dermotologist last episode to get something on her back removed, that might have something to do with it<br>  but idk cuz she has been seeing denny a lot, so im thinking maybe something with her brain|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Yeah, they're both leaving. Izzy is dying of something. Denny told her he was "there for her"...meaning to take her. George, I don't know what he's gonna do yet. I can't quite figure that one out. <br>  <br>  I'm glad Izzy is leaving though- she was getting really annoying.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I think she is going to get some type of cancer..

Try and save just a little bit each week or better yet month it helps so much, instead of pissing it all away.

5c6b99285c6b8893ed729455cb249619aa	I know how to ease you in. If you try these albums first, you will develop an ear for jazz. I know what I'm talking about. These albums that I am suggesting are easy to like. Yes Charlie Parker was great, but not for beginners. These albums are perfect for beginners, and they are all jazz classics.<br>  <br>  Miles Davis Kind of Blue album. It's a great album for a beginner, and it's great even if you've heard a whole lot of jazz. Get it. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql...</a><br>  <br>  Thelonious is another great and important master of jazz. I suggest that you start out with the Monk's Dream album. Don't operate heavy machinery while listening. Monk swings the hardest of any jazz musician, in my little opinion. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok...</a><br>  <br>  This is the album that really turned me onto jazz. I still enjoy it and respect it. Roland Kirk's Inflated Tear album.<br>  <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql...</a><br>  <br>  Grant Green's Matador album is a great album, centered around the guitar playing, although McCoy Tyner is at his best (piano player from Coltrane's band). It's another great album that's easy to like. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok...</a><br>  <br>  Wayne Shorter's album called Speak Like A Child is a great album that you really have to hear. I can't even talk about it. The whole band is amazing. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql...</a><br>  <br>  Herbie Hancock's album, Maiden Voyage is another great and easy to like album. Freddie Hubbard is at his best through the whole album (on trumpet, fluglehorn). It's a concept album, and it really does flow like the sea, as Herbie intended it to. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok...</a><br>  <br>  Horace Silver plays piano with soul. The songs are great and so is the band. Everything works on this album called Song For My Father. It's another easy to like album too. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok...</a><br>  <br>  Oliver Nelson's album called Blues and the Abstract Truth is another classic. It features the great Eric Dolphy. Get it!|`|p9RQcqNzaa	well im not that into to jazz but i did try to expand my horizons a bit and i found that the yellow jackets were easey to get into as well as jaco pastorious, and bella fleck. these are more on the fusion side of things and thats probley why i enjoy them, im not a big classic jazz fan|`|94b168e3b778f875c1c60bf262ec0752aa	See if your library has the box set for KEN BURNS JAZZ, which was a PBS documentary a couple years ago. That would be a good overview of jazz from its beginnings through today.<br>  <br>  If you like it, I'd highly recommend borrowing the DVDs themselves as well. It was a great watch.<br>  <br>  If you want a short list of 10 people to hear though:<br>  <br>  Louis Armstrong<br>  Count Basie<br>  Herbie Hancock<br>  Dave Brubeck<br>  Miles Davis<br>  John Coltrane<br>  Ornette Coleman<br>  Weather Report<br>  Wynton Marsalis<br>  Bela Fleck and the Flecktones

Forced Diversity....The US thought process is, well if this movie whens an award, the Bollywood will think that Americans have accepted them, and we are all friends and the world can go live in peace, la la la la la......BS....|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Yes, the movie was very well-made. The story of the film is haunting, both Boyle made it with such pride, it was tragic and disturbing at times, funny in brief areas and in other times you wanted to smile and just let out a shout of excitment. The film is truly incredible, it is filled with tremendous performances, the soundtrack was great. The movie is a once in a life-time film, i've never seen anything like it, most likely will never again, that is why it was the Best Picture of the year.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	I thought that they went a little overboard with the Oscars for that film.<br>  <br>  I think it deserved "Best Picture", and "Best Director", but I had the impression that they were just giving it Oscars for the sake of giving it awards, rather than for the actual merit of the individual categories.  It was getting awards in categories that I thought other films were more deserving of.|`|cXPVtTUJaa	Idk, I haven't seen it. But I mean I don't think all of the awards should have gone to Slumdog Millionaire and The Curious Case of Benjamen Button.|`|fghgwE2waa	Hi. Yes. Peace|`|zovrJ0yXaa	it was excellent but the best film of the year wasn't even nominated. that film was the dark knight, and should have won best picture and best director for christopher nolan. slumdog was possibly the best of the nominees but other films like wall-e and obviously the dark knight werent there to oppose it. and i havnt even seen some of the other films of the year like waltz with bashir and man on wire|`|H2qEN27daa	I actually saw it yesterday and I think it definitely deserved to win.

qV8Vz36Iaa	Yes...<br>  <br>  Mr. John Kerry never said:<br>  <br>  "I invented the internet."  In the referenced interview, he did say:<br>  <br>  "I created the Internet."  Meaning he funded money for development of the internet. Which was 100% true. Mr. Rush Limbaugh perpetrated the myth and it was picked up by mainstream media without proper vetting.<br>  <br>  Another favorite Mythbuster is: "Milk is good food."<br>  <br>  Research shows that too much milk actual leaches calcium from bones. Milk is not the best source for calcium. Milk contains fats, proteins, genetically modified bovine growth hormone (in US, not in Canada or EU), antibiotics, and numerous other contaminants.|`|8rKZlLkFaa	Heck Yeah!

They have a lot of upbeat hits.  you'd probably like redneck rhythm and blues, lost and found, boot scootin boogy, cheating on the blues, neon moon, anything off the "cowboy town" album, most things off the "steers and stripes" and "hillbilly deluxe" albums, whiskey under the bridge, and red dirt road<br>  <br>  Alan Jackson is about half upbeat, half slow romantic or sad songs.  He's definitely a good artist to start on with country.  you might like chattahoochee, gone country, tall tall trees, chasin' that neon rainow, don't rock the jukebox, livin' on love, summertime blues, love's got a hold on you, designated drinker, small town southern man, and good time<br>  <br>  Toby Keith is good, the type of songs you're looking for are his popular ones, so you'll probably like any of them.  songs you might like are should've been a cowboy, big ol truck, i'm just talkin about tonight, courtesy of the red white and blue, who's your daddy?, i love this bar, beer for my horses, get drunk and be somebody, honkeytonk u, and as good as i once was<br>  <br>  Chris LeDoux isn't a very well known country artist, but he has a lot of rock influences.  Copenhagen, hooked on an 8 second ride, bareback jack, cadillac cowboy, little long-haired outlaw, and cowboys like a little rock and roll are all songs you might like<br>  <br>  Also, check out Alabama.  They have old classics like roll on 18 wheeler, if you're gonna play in texas, fire in the night, five oclock 500, mountain music, song of the south.<br>  <br>  Start with those and then look up similar artist online.|`|gwc7ZaLoaa	Country Songs..<br>  I Wanna Do It All-Terri Clark<br>  Every Mile A Memory-Dierks Bentley<br>  Fast Cars And Freedom-Rascal Flatts<br>  Who's Cheatin Who-Alan Jackson<br>  Good Time-Alan Jackson<br>  Country Boy-Alan Jackson<br>  Flat On The Floor-Carrie Underwood<br>  Small Town USA-Justin Moore<br>  Where I'm From-Jason Micheal Carroll<br>  Who I Am-Jessica Andrews<br>  That's A Man-Jack Ingram<br>  Meet In The Middle-Diamond Rio<br>  White Noise-Josh Turner<br>  EveryThing Is Fine-Josh Turner<br>  Would You Go With Me-Josh Turner<br>  Long Time Gone-Dixie Chicks<br>  Back Roads-Joe Caine<br>  It's America-Rodney Adkins<br>  Honky Tonk You-Toby Keith<br>  BackSeat Of A Greyhound Bus-Sara Evans<br>  Tall,Tall,Trees-Alan Jackson<br>  I'll Think Of A Reason Later-Lee Ann Womack<br>  Bones-Little Big Town<br>  Good Lord Willing-Little Big Town<br>  You Belong With Me-Taylor Swift<br>  Picture To Burn-Taylor Swift<br>  I Heart Question Mark-Taylor Swift<br>  Should've Said No-Taylor Swift<br>  I'd Lie-Taylor Swift<br>  Ride-Martina McBride<br>  Queen Of My Double Wide Trailer-Sammy Kershaw<br>  Cadillac Style-Sammy Kershaw<br>  Size Matters-Joe Nichols<br>  Me And Charlie Talkin-Miranda Lambert<br>  Perfect-Sara Evans<br>  Pray Out Loud-Jessica Simpson<br>  Kiss This-Aaron Tippin<br>  Party Crowd-David Lee Murphy<br>  Horse Shoes-Adam Gregory<br>  Big Boy Toys-Aaron Tippin<br>  Put A Girl In It-Brooks And Dunn.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rock Songs..<br>  For You-Staind<br>  Smooth Criminal-Alien Ant Farm<br>  So Sorry-AudioSlave<br>  My Moon My Man-AudioSlave<br>  So Cold (Remix)-Breaking Benjamin<br>  You-CandleBox<br>  Far Behing-CandleBox<br>  A Kiss Before Dying-CandleBox<br>  ButterFly-Crazy Town<br>  Torn-Creed<br>  Cold-Crossfade<br>  Inside The Fire-Disturbed<br>  Fear-Distubed<br>  Tear Away-Drowning Pool<br>  Going Under-Evanescence<br>  Epic-Faith No More<br>  All Around Me-FlyLeaf (Christian Rock Band)<br>  Hemorrhage (In My Hands)-Fuel<br>  Welcome To The Jungle-Guns & Roses<br>  Get Stoned-Hinder<br>  How Long-Hinder<br>  Drive-Incubes<br>  Cold Hard *****-JET<br>  American Badass-Kid Rock<br>  All Summer Lond-Kid Rock<br>  So Hott-Kid Rock<br>  Sugar-Kid Rock<br>  My Genaration-Limp Bizkit<br>  Break Stuff-Limp Bizkit<br>  Take A Look Around-Limp Bizkit<br>  One-Metallica<br>  Follow You Home-Linkin Park<br>  Set It Off-P.O.D (Chirstian Group,But Bad ***)<br>  Always-Saliva<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If You Need More.Email Me <br>  Loves_SouthCarolina@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  <br>  Ima Music Freak LLOLL

He has been greedy, manipulative, inconsiderate, selfish, and self-serving.<br>  He has also been manipulated by Dorian for years, and she knows exactly which buttons to push. In his defense, I believe he was trying to be a good Buddhist, but it was just against his basic nature. And waving the Buchanan fortune in front of David is like waving a red flag at a bull, or Jerry Mouse at Tom Cat.  He just can't turn away. Also, I think it really hurts David's feeling (and yes, he has feelings) that the Buchanans went to so much trouble to keep him from finding out that he was their brother. Another approach from the family might have gotten a different result from David, or at the very least, limited Dorian's influence.|`|4ctvWVWpaa	David was never "evil".  He was just a money hungry conman, dishonest, yes, greedy, yes, selfish, yes, but "evil"? no.<br>  David HAS developed a conscience over the years, especially due to his friendship with Viki.|`|dbKj55akaa	David was never evil.

HE IS BY FAR ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS ON OLTL. BCUZ HE ISN'T BAD NOR IS HE A SAINT. THATS WHY I LOVE HIS RELATIONSHIPS WITH VICKY AND DORIAN. 2 PEOPLE WHO CANT STAND EACH OTHER. 1 (DORIAN)BRINGS OUT HIS HEDONISTIC SIDE, AND THE OTHER(VICKY)BRINGS OUT HIS MORAL CONSCIENCE SIDE. LIKE WHEN VICKY YELLED @ HIM 4 BLACKMAILING CLINT FOR 10 MILLION DOLLARS 4 HIM DONATING HIS LIVER 2 JESS, AND HE TURNED AROUND AND GAVE IT BACK BCUZ HE DIDN'T WANT 2 LOSE VICKYS RESPECT.

M8qLP7MLaa	It's hard to say if its the greatest technique ever in Naruto because Madara uses something like the Flying Thunder God technique and Kakashi (someone who has witnessed Minato's use of it) and said that Madara's was more advanced then the Yondaimes.<br>  <br>  And it's hard to say if Naruto were to surpass his father just by learning that technique. You have to consider that he's a sage now like Jiraiya was. You also have to consider the fact that Yondaime never completed the Rasengan before he died. Naruto, on the other hand, did.<br>  <br>  I think with everything considered, he might be on par if not just under Minato's strength. If he hasn't surpassed Yondaime, then learning the Flying Thunder God technique certainly wouldn't hurt him in that race.|`|SEPSUf0Saa	defenatly no!!!! i think it's amataresu from itachi......

KOGxur8Vaa	For starters, using your 'talking voice' probably isn't such a good plan, for a few reasons.<br>  <br>  The range of this voice is limited, as is the timbre. You will lack expression, and chances are you'll have to re-learn to control this voice.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking your trouble will stem from not being able to hear yourself. Conversely, the same thing happens when you can't hear your band. <br>  <br>  It's the same for intsrumentalists, and I've been going thru this for years now. You have to be sure your sound guy is competent enough to mix things properly, and be sure to tell him to turn the dam monitor up. Don't be scared to put them in their place, sure they're generally scary and bald, but they seem to be more obsessed with wires and switches than music itsself.<br>  <br>  One tip i've learned from a lot of singers, is to ram a finger into your ear so you can hear your own voice in your head. It can be a strain on your voice, and awkward to concentrate, but if need be, it can get you thru a song untill you prod the sound guy.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking the reason the mic projects your voice better while talking might be to do with A- the pitch and B- the timbre (tone..?) of your voice.   <br>  By all means play with your voice and master it as best you can, but try and rule out all other interfering factors first.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|emzQNo0Haa	A couple of things here.  Most people probably have a different "singing voice," because when you're talking you don't want to sound like you're singing.  If you're singing out of tune you're naturally going to be harder to hear, notes that are in tune resonate with each other and are easier to hear.  It's easier to sing in tune if you sing loudly, you will support the note better.  But there is a limit to that, if you're just screaming as loudly as you can you won't be able to control the pitch as well.  However if people in the audience couldn't hear you that probably has to do with the levels of the mics as well, it could have been an equipment problem (you and the guest singer weren't singing into the same mic were you?) or maybe the sound guy turned you down because you were off pitch!  Could also be that you were too far away from the mic, most mics you have to get pretty close for it to pick up your voice.  Bottom line work on your pitch (sing all the time!  In the shower in the car whenever you can).|`|zTfMdChTaa	It up to you if you want to practice on your singing voice and make it way better by going to voce/singing lessons or use your talking voice which for alot of people doesn't sound that good. So i'll say do some practice.|`|AA12374184	Thats how you sing and they have schools out there to improve the talking voice to sing perfectly. Trying to sing a different way will only mess you up and confuse you in ways that will make you a little depressed in thinking you can't do it. You can use the other way in high vocals or very low vocals but to be perfect you have to start young and continue your whole life which is kind of perfect in ways. If your just starting out at a late age than you definately would need schooling and you won't be able to go past it. I've been singing my whole life since I was 6 and I think I still need a little schooling on certain vocal strains.Now if your rapping all you have to do is use your talking voice and just explain what you did in your real life. Rapping is not music. If you want to sing go to a good singing school.
OWXI806qaa	I hope so. I think that Audrey gives Jack a special kind of <br>  happiness. And Jack deserves happiness after everything he's<br>  been through. But he would still have to deal with the issue of<br>  that restraining order that Heller filed against him.<br>  (so not this season)|`|1263731b76a5881b98bbd0aacec9a2cdaa	It's possible. But to me, personally, I just couldn't "feel the love" between them. Audrey seemed too much like a damsel-in-distress figure to me, which I disliked. Though perhaps her character was designed this way to offset Jack (as in opposites attracting). <br>  <br>  To me, I think there's much more probable chemistry between Jack and Renee; that doesn't mean I want to see them get all lovey-dovey, but I do hope the writers don't entirely scrap it. As far as poor Audrey goes, I don't think her father would let Jack near her with a ten-foot pole. He said Jack was "cursed" and would probably treat him as such in the future.<br>  <br>  Poor Jack! :(|`|a8b8a2e2715f7a46743d76f2a69e1019aa	=O !!!<br>  It would sure make for one epic twist!!!!!!
75b79fb93f54dbfb6b1ac9d31b7870bdaa	A gifted composer! I loved Jai Ho.<br>  <br>  And Equally Uneven, you don't follow/watch the Oscars?

73C7BXb7aa	Try using a piano/keyboard for the high notes. Sing "aaah" on every note (That's going five notes up, five notes down). As part of a song, if you think you won't be able to hit it when singing then don't try so hard. Most high notes come from your head rather than your lungs so try to gather your breath at the top of your throat.<br>  As for running out of breath, at the end of a long note or end of a line take a quick breath and try not to sing too many high notes on one line because they will cause you to lose the most breath.<br>  <br>  Singing lessons would do a lot of help if you are planning to be a professional.<br>  For the "shaky thing" (I call "warbling" even though the proper word is vibrato =) try humming it first so you know the notes and then gradually get lower or higher slightly (by a note or 2) take short breaths in between to keep it under control.<br>  <br>  xxxBest of Luckxxx<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|iu6kK2ulaa	Here are a few GREAT websites that offer free lessons and tutorials (sometimes with video) that will help you improve your tone and range:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vocalist.org.uk/voicetraining.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vocalist.org.uk/voicetraining...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.expertvillage.com/video-series/586_voice-lessons.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.expertvillage.com/video-serie...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.jeanniedeva.com/site/444991/page/65061" rel="nofollow">http://www.jeanniedeva.com/site/444991/p...</a>|`|H659yRKAaa	As for higher notes, you'll just have to practice sing some scales for like 10 minutes every day, and only go as high as you can. Slowly, you will find it easier and more comfortable to be in your "upper register". Also, be sure that you mouth is very open and that you are exhaling a lot of air as you are singing the note. The air the will make the note quieter, but once you can sing the note, try exhaling faster. You will get more energy in the note and it should be louder because you are increasing the "breathspeed" But always be careful, never work your voice too hard, especially on high notes: it can be very dangerous. <br>  <br>  To have more breath, always stand up straight and make sure that your neck is straight and your larynx and pharynx aren't squished. (Go ahead and google those-- they're the air pipes in your throat). Take a deep breath and let your shoulders get higher as you inhale. Now, never ever do that again. When you breathe, nobody should see your shoulders move at all unless you are dancing. Instead, imagine that there is a deflated tire around your stomach, right at your belly button, and "inflate it" as you inhale, breathing slowly and straight down to your "tire". Never breathe too fast, if you take a really short breath there isnt as much oxygen and you'll just have to take another one. Practice singing long phrases in songs if you are having trouble having enough air. Your body will figure it out. <br>  <br>  As for keeping a steady voice, back to the "breathspeed" thing. It will solve all your problems. Lots of air, moving out quickly as you sing. But listed to yourself, if it sounds wierd, you are probably exhaling too much air. <br>  <br>  "That shaky thing" is called "vibratto", pronounced vih-BRAH-toe, if i were you, i'd stay away from it until you have mastered steady notes. Have a professional  vocal coach teach it to you if you can. <br>  <br>  To find a vocal coach, i would have to know where you are. My suggestion is to put a classified ad in a local paper, or just spreading the word to peopple that you are looking for one. The best coaches are found by word of mouth. Sometimes you will have to audition for them, so pick a song that is fun for you to sing, and also emphasizes your strengths, (your high range or low range, or your ability to hold long notes, or something like that). Know it well, and be yourself in the audition. Ask if you can have piano accompaniment, because if you have the sheet music for them, they will almost always get someone to play it with you, which is very helpful. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)

CMkxSYJjaa	*rolls eyes at other answers*  Ok, from a real gemini guy, we're the romantics that live in whatever fashion our hearts tell us to, and we move in the direction our eyes pull us towards. Gemini is used to raoming around and breaking female hearts because (aside from scorpio) gemini is one of the sexiest signs in the zodiac. We're to high up in the clouds to understand something as hurtful as "being dumped". yes, gemini's take it very hard when broken up with. But the beauty about being a twin is that you'll figure things out and probably move on quick. so dont worry about dumping him, he's probably doing something with someone right now anyway (i have)|`|099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	Love overcomes all stars.|`|pObbmKrPaa	um i really dont believe that those signs mean anything just do what you wanna do and ignore all the voodoo stuff|`|Wiwv6iZeaa	geminis dont pull you back they push you away!

Hh4BORyzaa	I've LOVE this movie, but can't think of the song that was playing in that part.  This website has all the songs from that movie:<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106677/soundtrack" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106677/soun...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
H2qEN27daa	This is a verizon commercial for a cell phone that has the capabilities of being an mp3 player using Rhapsody to get songs. So he is asked what songs his has (on the phone) and he reads them from A to Z. And its implying that he started reading the list at a young age, and is still reading it as he is old (trying to show you that the phone can hold an endless amount of songs so that it would take you a lifetime to read them all).. stupid i think.
H2qEN27daa	Try ebay. Some people made their own compilations of shows or events that they sell their. Or you can put a Wanted Ad on Craigslist and see if you get any responses there.

BbiyBG0oaa	It should be subbed by Dattebayo sometime in May.  It was released August 2nd 2008 in Japan so it usually takes around 10 months for it to be subbed.  Gotta be patient though I'm having a lot of trouble being patient as it is.  There is also a new naruto movie 3 coming out in japan this summer.  Bummer how we always have to wait forever to see these movies.

AA10958272	Because the parents of the kids this movie attracts -- recall them.<br>  <br>  Obviously, the actor had the choice (and he's in his mid/late-40s?).. and he's seen how many Adam Sandler movies doing the same thing. This is for the actor & to sell to an older crowd, more than anything else. Most new stuff may be too expensive to license at that.. that's my guess.
vZwP6Dvdaa	<a href="http://onlyforyou.free-stuff.com.ru" rel="nofollow">http://onlyforyou.free-stuff.com.ru</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|IlYWnmCdaa	if i was still a beginner i wouldnt buy anything to expensive just incase you get bored of it, Sometimes playing the guitar can become frustrating and you can be put off, So why waste money on something expensive. I'd wait till your moe experienced. depends on how good you are now i suppose. The cherry one is the nicest btw lol<br>  <br>  Little bit of advice from someone whos been playing guitar for years, check out charity shops, i no some people think its lame, but sometimes, someone flings away a good guitar. you can pick it up for hardly anything and your contributing to people less fortunate.
POqwp3Fiaa	On a golden theme...-<br>  <br>  The man came home drunk at four in the morning, and his wife was all over him, yelling at him, crying because she thought he was with another woman.<br>  "No, honey, I swear, I was at this bar, and it was so fancy that even the urinals were made of gold."<br>  She said she didn't believe him so she called the bar. <br>  "Hello," she said, "I just want to ask one question. My husband claims to have spent the night at your bar and I have one question; are your urinals covered in gold?"<br>  To which she heard the bartender say, <br>  "Hey, Clarence, I think we found the guy who pissed in your saxophone."
