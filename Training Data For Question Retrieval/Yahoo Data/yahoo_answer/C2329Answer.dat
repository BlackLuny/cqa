YX93lq4daa	Well you look at the district job posting.  If there happens to be an available job that you are qualified for(if you are lucky enough), you should apply.  When you apply they will know that you are interested in a position with them.  Wait a few days after applying and if they do not speak to you directly about, go speak with the principal. <br>  <br>  * We do not send anything to the schools themselves here. We have online systems that store resume, a simple generic cover letter|`|5q7uPqVmaa	Seems like you have a unique advantage over other applicants.  You're on the scene, you can informally ask questions and get to know people, and you have a proven track-record at the school to show that you're a competant professional, right?<br>  So I guess my question is, have you asked whether or not there's a position available for next year that you're interested in?  We had a long-term sub at our school but were initially unsure if we'd have a position available.  She let the principal know that she was interested by just telling her that she'd be interested if a position opened up and made sure that her application to the school district was updated and current.  Sure enough, when a position opened up over the summer,she was the first one they thought of!

dx3jXzuxaa	One home-school mother in my area has a job doing customer service telephone work. She has a broadband Internet connection and VoIP telephone, so they route the phone calls to her home phone. <br>  <br>  Another option is to start an Internet business. You can sell books on Amazon.com or half.com  (or both), or start an affiliate marketing business<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that home schooling will consume quite a bit of your time, and any job you have (home based or not) will compete with that. I would suggest that you find other home schooling mothers (and dads, like me) to work with. Developing a support group will help you with time  management and will provide the socialization your children need. <br>  <br>  Stay focused and keep your mind open. The right opportunity will appear.|`|K0FabRAIaa	Child care is a good way to bring in extra income. <br>  <br>  Selling Avon could help.<br>  <br>  Another idea is to enroll in school while you work from home. Try online school. The reason I mention this is because I was sort of in your position for a little while, and enrolled in school when my child was a baby. Since I qualified for federal student loans and grants, I was able to supplement my income by going to school. I did not know about this extra benefit when I enrolled - I just wanted to go to college. Keep in mind that I do have to pay back student loans, but I'm nearly 3/4 of the way to a bachelors degree now, and am preparing to open my own business, with corporate backing. I might not have qualified for this without college. I got my associates degree first and then re enrolled in a bachelors program. <br>  <br>  By the way, I use Time4Learning to home school my children and its great!  <a href="http://time4learning.com/" rel="nofollow">http://time4learning.com/</a><br>  Its a full curriculum and only costs $20/month.

I homeschool my children and we have so many outings with other families and children, it's hard to choose what to go to and what to skip!<br>  <br>  I work online, there are lots of legitimate ways of earning an income online that you can get into when the children are asleep.

Between them all, I bring in a fair few dollars to help with the family budget.<br>  <br>  Good luck!! Homeschooling is a worthwhile thing to do.
Sozc3MyFaa	Do not use "you guys" etc--very colloquial.  "Seventeen" is capitalized (Seventeen Magazine). You need some punctuation as well, ie : "I will be honest (COMMA),  (delete what's in parentheses--of course they know writing is tough). "But, I never gave up: (semicolon) I CONTINUE to keep trying.  <br>  Grammar: ..."I am trying to learn THE basics of writing".<br>  Dangling participle "Though, my dedication is high....) (The "though")<br>  Use "thank you", never "thanks" .  You do not need the Thanks at the end either.<br>  <br>  You have other punctuation errors.  Since you are in the class, I assume they will help you with this.<br>  Good luck.  Keep working on grammar & punctuation.|`|6xfVxo4Baa	You should probably leave out the bad things about you.

dhXCEumpaa	Idk. Maybe a project on how gravity effects the rate in which two objects fall. Use a pencil and a paper. When you ask which is going to hit the floor or table first, crumple the paper into a ball when everyone answers. So you get Science and a little bit of math. It's a win-win situation. So:<br>  Question: How does gravity affect the rate of two objects fall? (something along that, try to include a variable, not just a constant)<br>  Hypothesis: You're on your own there, I can't just give you one.<br>  Experiment: Take a pencil and a paper, crumple the paper and drop both at the same time. Record the time in which both fall. Then try it four more times<br>  Above and Beyond: Draw a conclusion of your hypothesis based off of your recordings. State whether or not your hypothesis was correct or not and explain why. I have never been at a science fair though so I don't know how it works.

I know some students work in town for cash (no records), but the work is menial and low-paying. I've also seen students go to drug clinical trials for money, but I don't know if it's considered work or not. In all official cases, you need permission from the international office at the university.|`|a66nvk0taa	Normally it is not permitted your first year. After your first year, you may be permitted to work on campus. Your economic and your academic situation may determine whether or not you will be permitted to work.

That is the essence of your thesis statement.<br>  <br>  Start with an attention grabber - maybe a general statement about heroes.(just don't ask a question; it's too overused as an attention grabber).  Then your topic sentence where you introduce your three heroes.

You must take the PCAT exam. Most schools require that you have a minimum of 60 college credits. Once you get into pharmacy school, you complete all the required courses so that you can take the licensing exam and practice as a pharmacist.<br>  <br>  <br>  For more information go to the link below.<br>  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos079.htm#natur..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos079.htm#natur...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pharmcas.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pharmcas.org/</a><br>  <br>  ss

I am a pharmacist, I've done what you are asking about. So here it goes:<br>  <br>  You didn't mention what classes you took in high school, so I will just mention the prerequisite classes you will need just to apply. Mind you, a majority of people getting into pharmacy school today already have bachelors degrees.<br>  <br>  Inorganic and Organic Chemistry including all the labs<br>  Physics. All of the math up to and including Calculus. Biology. Physiology/Anatomy. Technical writing. And of course, all of your other liberal education courses. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

You might as well become a doctor.<br>  There is no demand for pharmacists at this time. You would have to go to school for about 8 years, and make about as much as a school teacher (At least where I live, Long Island, NY). You would need to know tons of math and science to get a degree, but all you would really need to know is how to say "take this with water" and count to 30.|`|mqGMkUXZaa	Look for a undergrad degree program geared towards pre-pharmacy, but it's not required.  Most Pharm D. degree programs require certain courses like biology and chemistry courses.  It might vary according to school.  I was going to apply for pharmacy school, but got another job instead in science.  I double majored in Biology and Chemistry, got a BS in both.  You don't necessarily have to do this, but there are required courses as said before.  Also, it would greatly help if you had a job as a Pharm tech working in a pharmacy in college.  It would look great on your application.  If you can't get a job in a pharmacy, then try cultivating a relationship with a working pharmacist (almost a must on an application), so that person can write you a nice recommendation letter.  Finally, don't forget that GPA, keep it high because there is a lot of competition to get in to Pharm school.  If you do all that, you'll get in.|`|RMGzjECmaa	2 years in college <br>  <br>  4 years in medial school <br>  <br>  2 year more to get a pharm. D. (optional)|`|ZIJvBQAMaa	Dead end road!

2f364660a9e7be4d45ae529341311f50aa	Boot sector viruses infect the system area of a disk; that is, the boot record on floppy disks and hard disks. All floppy disks and hard disks (including disks containing only data) contain a small program in the boot record that is run when the computer starts up. Boot sector viruses attach themselves to this part of the disk and activate when the user attempts to start up from the infected disk. These viruses are always memory resident in nature. Most were written for DOS, but, all PCs, regardless of the operating system, are potential targets of this type of virus. All that is required to become infected is to attempt to start up your computer with an infected floppy disk Thereafter, while the virus remains in memory, all floppy disks that are not write protected will become infected when the floppy disk is accessed. Examples of boot sector viruses are Form, Disk Killer, Michelangelo, and Stoned.<br>   <br>  Master boot record viruses Master boot record viruses are memory-resident viruses that infect disks in the same manner as boot sector viruses. The difference between these two virus types is where the viral code is located. Master boot record infectors normally save a legitimate copy of the master boot record in an different location. Windows NT computers that become infected by either boot sector viruses or master boot sector viruses will not boot. This is due to the difference in how the operating system accesses its boot information, as compared to Windows 98/Me. If your Windows NT systems is formatted with FAT partitions you can usually remove the virus by booting to DOS and using antivirus software. If the boot partition is NTFS, the system must be recovered by using the three Windows NT Setup disks. Examples of master boot record infectors are NYB, AntiExe, and Unashamed.<br>   <br>  Multipartite viruses Multipartite (also known as polypartite) viruses infect both boot records and program files. These are particularly difficult to repair. If the boot area is cleaned, but the files are not, the boot area will be reinfected. The same holds true for cleaning infected files. If the virus is not removed from the boot area, any files that you have cleaned will be reinfected. Examples of multipartite viruses include One_Half, Emperor, Anthrax and Tequilla.<br>    <br>  Macro viruses These types of viruses infect data files. They are the most common and have cost corporations the most money and time trying to repair. With the advent of Visual Basic in Microsoft's Office 97, a macro virus can be written that not only infects data files, but also can infect other files as well. Macro viruses infect Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Access files. Newer strains are now turning up in other programs as well. All of these viruses use another program's internal programming language, which was created to allow users to automate certain tasks within that program. Because of the ease with which these viruses can be created, there are now thousands of them in circulation. Examples of macro viruses include W97M.Melissa, WM.NiceDay and W97M.Groov.

TOqJ8nwaaa	When I was an undergraduate, I began living in he basement of the University library.  It was easy.  At closing time every night, they sent a staff member around to be sure all patrons had vacated the building before turning out lights.  It was hard to hide in an emergency stairwell or deep within the stacks to avoid detection.  Once they were gone, I had the run of the place.  I could sleep on the couches in the lounge area.  I became a kind of "phantom of the library."<br>  <br>  Eventually, the library staff figured out I was there, probably because I had been eating food they left in the staff kitchen area.  They sent in university security to search for me at intervals each night.<br>  <br>  They were so ham-fisted, it was easy to evade them.  First, I would be awakened by a lot of clanking as they unlocked the doors to let themselves in.  Then, the supervisor would tell his staff, "I was a hard-target search of the area."<br>  <br>  "INCOMING," I would think to myself when I heard the commotion.  I'd usually head for the safety of the network server room.  Security didn't like to be near expensive equipment, and risk blame if something broke.  "You win again, my simian friend," the supervisor would utter when at last they gave up the search and left the building.<br>  <br>  Finally, one night my luck ran out and security personnel caught be in the closed reserves area.  They took me to the Department of Public Safety to talk to me, and to document the incident.<br>  <br>  "What's up with you?  Why are you living in the library?"  they demanded to know.  "Your mother's been calling the Dean of Students because she couldn't contact you.  She didn't know why you weren't in the dorm room she's been paying for."<br>  <br>  "Drat!  My mother's about to lawyer-up."  I knew I'd better come clean.<br>  <br>  "The land titles are screwed up in the United States,"  I explained.  "I'm filing suit against the Queen of England, as it related back to colonial claims.  I can't get an attorney to take my case for some reason, so I'm having to do my own work and file pro se."<br>  <br>  "That is positively . . . pathetic,"  said the Security Supervisor.  "You are  deeply disturbed and highly unstable."<br>  <br>  "But. . .  but there are insurance investigators, purposely removing information from the Internet that I need to prove my case,"  I protested.  "If you remove me from the library, they'll get in and ruin my lawsuit."<br>  <br>  The Security Supervisor gently helped me into a squad car and drove me to a division of Student Health, where they told me I would be excused from classes for the remainder of the semester.|`|8902d5093d3e4b74680368048c6a3633aa	It all started one day at boot camp. I was aslepp in bed and all the sudden I hear somone yelling from behind. " YOu are deeply disturbed and highly unstable," screams General Thumb. As soon as I hear his voice I scramble out of bed and give him a salute. He then takes me by the ear and drags me into the bathroom. <br>            When I'm completely awake I see that he is totally soaked. "What do you call this!" he screams again. I knew exactly what he was pointing to. You see about a week later during our free time, I was watching the T.V. when I see The Simpsons is on. It was the episode where Homer installs somthing that squirts whoever sits on the toilet. I decided I'd try to build one myself. I guess it worked. I was ready for one of the biggest beating of my life when is see him staring at me and not moving. " That was positively.....Pathetic." He says. I look at him with a puzzled expression and he continuies talking. "If it were me I would have made the device so it drains the toilet water and squirts that out. Now that will make people mad." <br>              I start to recover from his yelling, I hear somone else yell, "INCOMING !!" before i could even turn around to see who it wasm, a glof ball hit me square in the forehead. I was out cold. <br>               I wake up in a hospitaland see my mother arguing with the General. I can only pay attention vagualy but i hear words like "Sue", and "your as good as dead". And I think to myself Drat! My mother's about to "lawyer-up" AGAIN. Oh ya I forgot to mention, my mom is a lawyer and is always suing people.<br>               The next time I wake up I'm in a wheelchair back at boot camp and my mom is pushing me aroiund. She asks me" Honey, do you remember where that golf ball hit you?" I shook my head and then she yelled, " I want a hard target search of the area." Oh great, I think, here she is searching for evidence. <br>                I fall asleep again still recovering from the concusion and now we are in a courtroom and all the sudden I hear the General saying "You win again, my simian friend." I wonder what he means by again . Oh well.Story short we won the case, moved into a bigger house, and lived happily ever after.

So I seek out where I can make my life more enjoyable. I actually took a Military approach to the thing. I mean, I actually went through the process of sittin' down and telling myself.

"You are deeply disturbed and highly unstable",  Emily retorted, glaring darkly.<br>        "Who else can I torment?" wondered Tim. Bringing his plastic soldier up to eye level, he commanded, "I want a hard-target search of the area."  Following his miltary scout from room to room,  he nearly tripped over the laundry basket.  Laying twisted in a dirt-crusted pant leg was his pet stuffed gorilla from his last birthday.  Momentarily distracted, he began a full-scale frontal assault on the plush beast with his one-man Army. The battle was fierce, and the soldier fought valiantly, but as usually occurred, the long arms of Magilla, with a sudden slashing motion, sent the badly bruised soldier spinning wildly to crash against the side of the clothing dryer.  <br>  "You win again, my simian friend' coughed Tim, voicing his silent hero's lament.<br>         Finished with her hair, and seeking her pink scrunchee, Emily had witnessed the entire scene. "That was positively...pathetic.  Get a life, Tim." <br>          Just then Emily's cell phone rang.  It was Eric, her date for the dance that evening.  "Are you ready yet?  Can I pick you up now?" Tim, his usual self, was chanting in the background, "Emily and Eric, sittin' in a tree"....suddenly he stopped, a serious look on his face.  ".Wait a minute, Emily, you know mom said you had to babysit me tonight.  She has to work late, and dad's out of town.  I'm tellin", he threatened.<br>       "Shutup, dork!!" Emily thundered. "Oops, not you, Eric", she spoke into her cell. "I've got to call my mom", she complained to Eric.  "I have a feeling I know what she's going to say.  Drat!. My mother's about to lawyer-up "  Minutes later, she called Eric back. "Mom says I can't go", she sighed. "But she did say you could come over here till 11 o'clock."<br>        Tim's eyes lit up. He giggled maniacally, "Aha! Another victim!"

Because they are almost adults and therefore do bad kind of stuff that adults do.  Like steal your car, or beat up a college student and take their bike. Or tie up substitute teachers.  Or rape (supposedly) special needs students.  Or have gang warfare with a large muslim community (the gangs were African-American.  Yes, the last incident involved about 200 students.

a16d1d6f39aa1d75b068a79155fb0ee9aa	Do the homework. Most high school studies (especially highschool math) require rote memorization. Doing the homework as it comes up is the best way to accomplish that. Then when you study for a test, go over all the homework and do the questions/problems that weren't required for homework.
eAArmh4raa	Hola buend ia, es un gusto saludarte...<br>  <br>  Aqui te envio un contenido que creo puede ser de tu ayuda...<br>  <br>  MATEMáTICA Y EL ARTE. ENTREVISTA A UNA DOCENTE <br>   <br>  <br>  Entrevista a la profesora y escritora Isabel ORTEGA<br>  (www.isabelortega.com.ar , www.matematicaclara.com) <br>   <br>  <br>  El siguiente texto corresponde a la emisión del 17 de abril de 2002 del programa 'Profesionales en el Arte' que se transmite por Radio Cultura FM de la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, en Argentina y que conduce Gabriel Díaz todas las ma?anas, de lunes a viernes, a las 9 en punto. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Gabriel Díaz: Nueve y cinco minutos. Muy buenos días. Vamos a empezar este programa con una frase. “Bebe vino. Largo tiempo pasarás bajo la tierra sin mujer y sin abrigo”. Esta frase pertenece a Omar Kayyam, conocido como el poeta del vino, pero además de poeta fue un excelente matemático. Y de eso nos va a hablar hoy Isabel Ortega, Profesora de Matemática y Cosmografía, y escritora. <br>  <br>  Isabel Ortega: Hola Gabriel, ?cómo te va? <br>  <br>  GD: ?Cómo te va Isabel? Estuve leyendo tu libro, La historia que vivieron los matemáticos: ?espectacular! <br>  <br>  IO: Gracias. <br>  <br>  GD: Pero antes de hablar del libro, contanos un poquito de vos. Vos estás vinculando la matemática con el arte, tenés trabajos interesantes hechos en la materia, bueno, quisiera que nos contés un poquito. <br>  <br>  IO: Te cuento un poquito. Mi carrera es básicamente docente, yo soy maestra, profesora de matemática, hice alguna otra cosa más en matemática superior, he metido la cuchara en todos los niveles de la escuela, tanto en jardín, como en primaria, he sido profe de secundaria, trabajé mucho en el profesorado formando docentes, en la universidad ense?ando las matemáticas duras, y con el tiempo, como me he vinculado mucho con la ense?anza no formal, es decir, la ense?anza en bibliotecas populares, las clases particulares, las consultas de los docentes, eso ha dado como resultado que empecé a escribir cosas que vine encontrando. A medida que fui publicando, eso me fue vinculando, más y más, con la literatura, con el arte, con la pintura, y entonces empecé a encontrar muchas respuestas para ense?ar matemática dentro de las áreas que no son específicamente científicas. Actualmente hago los juegos de la revista Billiken, si bien he trabajado bastante en lo que podría llamarse escolar: durante un par de a?os trabajé como editora de matemática en Kapelusz coordinando autores, tengo unos cuantos libros que tienen que ver con la escuela, pero lo que se nota generalmente en mis publicaciones es una cosa así poco ortodoxa, en el sentido de que apelo mucho al mundo que nos rodea para hacer matemática. <br>  <br>  GD: Claro, eso hace que la lectura de tus libros sea muy sencilla. Vos hacés de la matemática algo muy natural; como si fuera un juego, y también me dijiste: “la matemática es un juego”. <br>  <br>  IO: Claro. Bueno ahí hay dos cosas interesantes. Una es que básicamente, la matemática es un juego, filosóficamente es un juego. ?Por qué? Porque la matemática se arma con reglas de juego que se van combinando con una lógica para llegar a conclusiones. Tan es así que podemos cambiar las reglas de juego y armar otra matemática. Esto sería para charlarlo largo y tendido pero es así. Eso por un lado, pero hay otra cosa que es importante y es que en realidad, cuando pensamos en nuestro chicos, incluso en nuestros docentes que tienen que lidiar con la matemática, estamos pensando en una matemática cotidiana, no una cosa muy abstracta, muy filosófica, sino en una cosa muy cotidiana. ?A qué me refiero con esto? Uno tiene la idea de que las matemáticas mueven el mundo, es decir, la matemática tiene verdades que las necesitamos para que funcione el supermercado, para que funcionen los colectivos, las cosas de todos los días. Entonces, esa matemática que nosotros tenemos que ense?ar y que aprender, tiene que tener que ver con las cosas de todos los días. Y creo que justamente el sentido que tiene que yo esté acá en tu programa hoy, específicamente, es en relación con el arte. Y la matemática, obviamente, tiene mucho que ver con el arte. Una primera aproximación que podríamos pensar es esto: muchos artistas han sido matemáticos y muchos matemáticos han sido artistas. Es más: la mayoría de los grande matemáticos tienen una veta artística: pintura, música, lo que fuere. Sin ir más lejos, ?quién no conoce a Pitágoras? por ahí, medio dolorosamente porque recordamos el teorema de Pitágoras, aunque recordemos nada más que el nombre: “Teorema de Pitágoras”. Resulta que Pitágoras era matemático. Y Pitágoras pensaba que uno de los caminos a la iluminación (porque era místico) era la matemática, pero también lo era la música. O sea, él comprendía a la matemática ligada con la música y a la música ligada con la matemática. Podríamos pensar también en los pintores renacentistas: en Miguel Angel, en Durero, esta gente que buscó muchas respuestas en la matemática para poder tener herramientas de esas cosas que ellos percibían y que querían plasmar en una obra de arte, a través de, podríamos decir, una percepción visual, lo que ellos veían en proporciones y demás, bueno, apelaron a la matemática (y la desarrollaron, además) justamente para tener herramientas para hacer sus obras plásticas. O sea, que muchos matemáticos tienen una veta artística importante y muchos artistas han buscado herramientas en la matemática. Justamente hablábamos de, vos citabas los versos de Omar Kayyam... <br>  <br>  GD: Omar Kayyam. Es Omar un poeta que si uno lo lee un poco, se aleja un poquito de la cultura musulmana ?no?, porque era más bien dedicado a los placeres, una persona que tenía más bien esa orientación, no lo estricto de la religiosidad musulmana. <br>  <br>  IO: Claro, claro. ?Y cómo podríamos comprender el pensamiento matemático de Omar Kayyam? Omar Kayyam, básicamente, es un poeta. Un poeta muy importante de su época y de todas las épocas. Uno lo imagina a Omar Kayyam bebiendo vino, disfrutando de los placeres con mujeres y tratando de vivir su vida desde un punto de vista muy apasionado. entonces, ?cómo comprender que haya sido el matemático árabe más importante? Y acá, si me permitís vamos a hacer un paréntesis porque hay gente que nos está escuchando y piensa la matemática, el arte y estas cosas y uno dice: a ver, pero un matemático, ?qué, qué, cómo es un matemático? O sea, no pensamos mucho en la matemática porque la mayoría de la gente no tiene vocación para esto, pero pensar en cómo es un matemático es aún más desconcertante. Yo muchas veces en los talleres, en los encuentros con docentes, pregunto: ? a ver qué idea tienen ustedes de los matemáticos? Y generalmente sale una cosa así como, bueno, “un científico muy chiflado”, generalmente “muy asceta”, que “no se permite ningún placer”, “muy encerrado en un lugar donde no ve el mundo” y con sus números y sus calculadoras y demás. Y acá lo tenemos a Omar Kayyam que es todo lo contrario y resulta que es el matemático más importante de su momento. Entonces, el tema es así: Omar Kayyam, en toda esta cosa del placer y de tratar de encontrarle a la vida un sentido en el momento presente para potenciarlo y hacer algo importante con su vida (eso es lo que dio a la poesía como resultado), este hombre yo me lo imagino (esto es una licencia mía) absorto, de noche, mirando el cielo. En ese absorto, de noche, mirando el cielo, viene el tema de la Astronomía (que tan ligado a esta época está, la época de los árabes y todo eso). Para poder comprender la astronomía, necesariamente se necesita la matemática. Y creo que ese habrá sido el camino que siguió pero lo cierto es que fue más allá porque, bueno, se puso a calcular y se puso a demostrar teoremas y se puso a encontrar resultados. Quizá lo importante sería pensar ?qué habrá encontrado Omar Kayyam en la matemática, no?, ?qué es lo que habrá encontrado Pitágoras, que era místico?, ?qué es lo que habrá encontrado Bertrand Russell, que es premio Nobel de Literatura? <br>  <br>  GD: Newton, otro místico. <br>  <br>  IO: Newton, otro místico... aunque Newton... <br>  <br>  GD: Bueno estamos entrando en el tema de tu libro y eso vamos a hablar en el próximo bloque. <br>  <br>  ......................................... <br>  <br>  GD: Estamos hablando de tu libro “La historia que vivieron los matemáticos”. Confieso que cuando empecé a leerlo creí encontrarme con un libro de matemáticas. En realidad, no, si bien es un libro de matemáticas, tiene otra óptica, en realidad, lo que está mostrando es el entorno de los grandes pensadores de matemática. <br>  <br>  IO: Claro. A veces a mí me preguntan cuál es mi trabajo, a qué me dedico yo, en el supuesto de que yo me dedico a ense?ar matemática ?no?. Y yo iría un poco más allá; yo diría que yo me ocupo de ver qué le pasa a la gente con la matemática (que le pasan muchas cosas). Digamos, en cualquier charla, encuentro informal, con gente que no tiene nada que ver con la profesión, y uno habla de la matemática y de que la matemática puede ser algo placentero, algo agradable, siempre sale alguien que dice: “Ah, yo me la llevé todos los a?os”. Es decir, a todo el mundo le ha pasado algo con la matemática. Están los fanáticos, bueno, que somos un cierto diez por ciento de la población, que nos apasionamos, que nos encanta y qué se yo, y están los demás, que no han quedado indiferentes al lado de la matemática: hay mucha gente que ha sufrido con las cuentas de dividir y eso lo guarda como un recuerdo. O sea, que la matemática tiene algo que hace que a la gente le pasen cosas con ella. Este libro, La historia que vivieron los matemáticos, se trata de cómo vivieron su momento histórico los matemáticos, qué cosas de su entorno los motivaron su trabajo mate|`|SDHvDNGJaa	?Conoces a Escher?

t85Oesn7aa	Lil Maz, do you want this to stop?  Why do you want to mention it to a teacher or anybody else unless you want them to intervene?  Even without names, any teacher worth a light would report what had been discussed as there is an 'at risk' indication.  What else could they do?|`|aqto0hJTaa	The teacher would not only be morally bound but also legally bound to inform the appropriate agencies.|`|AA11327884	I'm a teacher in England so can only answer from this perspective but i will put it as i see it, and I've had this issue to deal with:<br>  in English law, teachers have the role as protector for te child/student whilst under their care [ie in school].<br>  A student can confide in them anything, but if the teacher believes that that student is under risk of harm [any type, emotional, physical, sexual] by themselves, by another - or to another, then they are obliged to report it as it would be a criminal offense if harm were to occur and the risk of it to not be reported.<br>  The procedure if to report it to the child protection officer [CPO] at the school [usually a deputy head, nurse or other similarly trained person] and they would then assess level of risk. They would then involve other authorities IF it were deemed necessary.<br>  The CPO would usually contact a family member and negotiate things IF it were appropriate/safe to do so - but other athorities would have to be involved f it were a case of sexual abuse.<br>  <br>  The best people to talk to about this would be childline - UK freefone number [from landlines] : 0800 11 11<br>  Ig they're engaged or busy, hang on - they're really worth talking to and VERY supportive.<br>  One of my friends was abused while I was at school. I'm now a teacher  and had to report what someone told me to someone else - BUT when I did so, I informed the 'confider' first and we went together to the CPO.<br>  <br>  The teacher would generally ask first before breaking confidentiality - but not obliged to do so. They have to look out for everyone involved - including themselves as it is a very delicate aspect of teaching - YET here you are asking about opening up to someone - may I recommend talking hypothetically to a teacher about your friend and then, when you feel able to, get your friend to talk to same teacher, perhaps with you there as well - the sooner the abuse stops, the better.<br>  <br>  My full supportive regards for you - it is never easy, but be brave and get help for your friend.|`|q1puEiJdaa	If you asked the teacher to keep it confidential and gave no names then there is nothing they could do. There is no way a teacher would inform parents in an instance like this because that would be endangering the young person. Teachers do have a duty to report child protection issues, but most teachers would discuss this with the person and be guided by their wishes if they felt that the young person was mature enough to make such a decision. <br>  <br>  Hopefully after speaking with the teacher your friend would see the wisdom of reporting this abuse so that it doesn't happen to her, or anyone else.|`|7DiL2Cwaaa	I guess it depends on who the teacher is, like every person, everyone is different and just because someone is a teacher, it does not mean they are trustworthy, but what the point in telling a teacher about it if you don't want anyone else finding out, would it not be best your friend to talk to a doctor or phone a help line or something ?|`|Fx1CMFlNaa	this is a teacher your talking about he/she will got to the police i know it must be hard for your friend but he/she (i'm guessing she) has to go to the police that perverted b******d needs to be locked up the social serves wont get involved it has nothing to do with the parents. the parents need to know to help support your friend. i live in scotland by the way. according to the law 16 is the age where you can have sex so they might put it down as sexual assualt unless she was abused at 15 if you just want to talk to the teacher well he/she will get suspitious anyway maybe if you start asking questions. do the right thing and get the police involved. if social serveses get involved they cant do anything because you friend is an adult well sort of you can move out when your 16 so they cant take her away. so try talking her into contacting the police let the parents know for support i've been abused although i was very young, so i know what she's going through. if you do tell the teacher he/she will most likely talk to your friend and parents so maybe it would be best to take it slowly and tell the teacher. your friend need all the support she can get|`|KhWcLKv3aa	Put it as a hypothetical question mentioning no names, and there isn't really much that they could do.|`|Vzdu8OH0aa	to be honest i have found in the past whether its meant to be confidential  or not they will tell if they think it's important enough|`|MAdFGBN8aa	I work as a teacher in England but I would assume it would be very similar laws. If someone came to me with a hypothetical question and I was worried I would fill out a concern form. There will be someone who works in your school who is a child protection officer and the teacher would probably seek their advice. It's not a moral obligation, it's a legal one, but they would not contact parents, they would go through social services. It would be made clear from the start to your friend that whatever they said in confidence would have to go further if the teacher felt it necessary. The teachers will handle the case very sensitively and they will be aware of what not to do in case it made it worse. We have to go on regular training for this so please encourage your friend to go to them as they will really listen to them and eventually make the situation better. Go to a teacher that you know will take you seriously an that you feel really comfortable with. They will genuinely care for you and want to do whatever they can to help.

Its awesome, espeically if you are a creative art-orientated person. I won several awards in art shows that way too. I learned how to use photoshop and adobe illustrator and I'm in college and I still use it (although its mainly just for a hobby now).<br>  <br>  It also depends on the teacher, my graphic design 1 class had a tough teacher, but her personality was very nice.. but the workload was heavy and I got an A+, the second graphic design course I took was taught by a different teacher, who didn't really 'get' how to use a computer, so he made us make at least 3-4 rough drafts before we could actually do anything, he also wasn't a very nice person and he'd scream and yell alot and throw fits if someone was being 'slow', even a tiny bit behind in class.... I ended up dropping that class.<br>  <br>  So if you want to do it, go for it! :-)

d374702288caa60bfe6b2b15c7cc54b5aa	Walt Whitman was talking how complex our world seems. He admired how calmly the spider sends out its web filiments in an effort to explore the space around it, to grasp its significance.  He compares man to the spider by suggesting that the threads of our soul reach out to understand the world we know as well.  Our souls need to make a connection with something or someone in order for us to feel that we have a place to belong in this life. Whitman yearns for a "bridge" to understanding where we fit into this enormous universe.  He is willing to allow his thin "anchor" of wonder to be "form'd", stretched, hammered out, or molded ("ductile") until he gains hold of some measure of peace for his soul.

Δημοκρατ?α) es un país del sureste de Europa que forma parte de la Unión Europea (UE).<br>  Situado en el lado sur de la Península Balcánica, limita por tierra con Bulgaria, la Antigua República Yugoslava de Macedonia y Albania al norte, al este con Turquía y al oeste y sur con el Jónico y el Mediterráneo.<br>  Historia de Grecia<br>  Vista por muchos como la cuna de la civilización occidental, Grecia tiene una larga y rica historia durante la cual extendió su influencia sobre tres continentes.<br>  Las costas del mar Egeo vieron el surgimiento de las primeras civilizaciones europeas, la minoica y la micénica. Después de su desaparición, volvió a resurgir otra alrededor del 800 adC. Esta última estableció colonias desde sus polis (ciudades-estado) a lo largo de todo el mediterráneo, resistió las invasiones de Persia y su cultura sería la base de la civilización helenística que sucedió al imperio de Alejandro Magno.<br>  Fue conquistada por Roma en 168 adC aunque la superioridad de la cultura griega modificó profundamente la romana. De hecho, en la parte oriental del imperio la cultura y el griego siguieron siendo más influyentes.<br>  El Imperio Griego Medieval se constituye como uno de los imperios más grandes de la historia de Europa; abarca desde el Mar Adriático y el Sur de Italia hasta Oriente Medio; Constantinopla se erige como la Segunda Roma y como el centro de la civilización heredera de las antiguas Grecia y Roma.

En este lugar el Tíber tiene una isla donde el río puede ser atravesado a pie. Debido a la proximidad del río y del vado, Roma estaba en una encrucijada de tráfico y comercio.<br>  Alrededor del siglo VIII adC los asentamientos se unificaron bajo el nombre de Roma Quadrata. La leyenda cuenta, que Roma fue fundada por Rómulo el 21 de abril de 753 adC. Rómulo, cuyo nombre se dice habría inspirado el nombre de la ciudad, fue el primero de los siete Reyes de Roma.

zgTsCicNaa	I just learned that one of our young workshop participants, Jeff Howard, won a water conservation award from the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority the other week. Jeff's a committed conservationist who has already accomplished so much in a few short years. Here's a glimpse of what Jeff's been up to around Lake Simcoe, the lake he's spent his whole life on:<br>  <br>  Last year, with funding from the Ministry of Natural Resources, Jeff decided to do a benthic study on Sandy Cove Creek, a stream just 10 minutes from his home that flows into Lake Simcoe. (A benthic study is a survey of life at the bottom of a body of water, or as some naturalists call it, "crud in the mud"!) Jeff, sometimes with the help of volunteers he recruited but often on his own, recorded observation not only of the trout population in the stream but of the bird species too, including great horned owl, sandpiper and great blue heron sightings.<br>  <br>  In the summer of 2008 he became a stewardship ranger for the Ministry and led a team of volunteers to complete his study of Sandy Cove Creek. Says his mother, "It's a job he loves to do because he loves the lake and feels every little bit helps. If asked, Jeff just says l do it because that's what I do."<br>  <br>  Since then, the accolades have been rolling in -- a youth educator award from the Lake Simcoe Regional Conservation Authority in 2007, a youth conservation award from Canadian Wildlife Federation this June, and now this latest award. According to his mom, his weekend spent at Nature Canada's naturalist workshop this month was "a weekend he won't soon forget. He met people like himself who care about our environment and know how important it is to protect it and everything it holds. Young naturalists who are very important to this world."<br>  <br>  Dedicated youth like Jeff give me optimism that we will have a generation of nature stewards in the future who will do what they can -- what's needed -- to conserve nature.<br>  <br>  ?

SDDgbtQ4aa	Spells aren't for everyone.  They're for those who have learned how to work magic and cast them properly.<br>  <br>  And you have to be more specific as to what you mean by love spells.  Spells are cast for a specific intent.  A good love spell would be one cast upon yourself to open yourself up to finding the love that is right for you.  An unethical and dangerous love spell would be the kind you cast on another person to make them believe they're "in love" with you (and keep in mind - this is an illusion - you could make someone think they were in love with you, but you couldn't make them actually love you with magic.)<br>  <br>  Spells are much more than words (not sure why you put this question in words & wordplay)  The words one may say in a spell are simply to help one focus the energy they are putting into the spell.  It is the energy one raises, focuses/directs, and releases into the spell that is the driving force behind an effective spell.<br>  <br>  Not exaclty sure what you mean by "authentic" here either.  Most witches create their own spells when there is a need - and spells are personalized to the person they are being cast for.  The last spell I cast, I created that day, and it worked just fine for its purpose.  But a spell that works well for me, may not be as effective for you.|`|frxEgBaxaa	I would check with the Little Shop they have always been friendly with me and i have used thier spells before and they were effective.|`|ptsNu1NNaa	wat do u mean
6yfkiwfjaa	I'm leaving this August for Denmark. I'd suggest any Scandinavian country, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland. Or even a country like Poland, Lithuania, Austria, Portugal.|`|7d3200d35dbf55ac9b047d7fdfa09895aa	Ha well since you know I am applying for one as well, you know I have never studied abroad. However, I have spent a ton of time in France and really enjoyed it. I thought people were friendlier in the smaller towns vs. Paris. I would recommend a place like Marseilles or Montpellier if you choose France. They are both in the south of France near Spain. Marseilles is right on the water and is one of the oldest cities in France. It's very beautiful. Spain is an interesting place too. I've heard nothing but great things about Madrid and the people in Barcelona were very nice. I chose Japan because the culture is vastly different and I am interested in their way of life. European countries might be easier because the languages are similar and the culture gap wouldn't be as great. I guess the thing to consider is how comfortable you are with cultural differences and language barriers. If you would be uncomfortable with ambiguity, I would stick with an english speaking country with similar practices to your own such as England or Scotland.  I hope you find a good match and have a great experience!|`|grz9InCraa	id like Switzerland or Germany :)<br>  ive never been a foreign exchange student so no tips or stories sorry!|`|c1d78585bce15b7e7b1745854b10a452aa	I'm going to be an exchange student and I've chosen  Uk,|`|a4en9urGaa	idk maybe you would want to go to England? im planning to go there when i graduate|`|xfqHi1tRaa	The first thing to consider is that you most likely need THREE country choices. So you're not just picking one!<br>  <br>  If you are from an English speaking country -- avoid English speaking countries! One of the primary benefits of an exchange year is language immersion! You want to come home with another language.<br>  <br>  Check with your exchange program for countries with language requirements that you may not meet! For example France and the French speaking parts of Switzerland and Belgium require at least two years of high school French. Generally Germany doesn't have a language requirement nor do most of the more eastern European countries. Your program will have a list -- if you are going through YFU you can look on line for that information.<br>  <br>  Using that information to possibly eliminate a few choices, look at what's left! If you have German ancestors -- Germany is a great place for an exchange! Being one of the biggest exchange partners, if you pick Germany as a first choice, you almost always get it. It's also central to Europe and easy to travel to other countries from there. If you wish to go further south, Italy and Greece are also great choices.<br>  <br>  Eastern Europe has also opened up to American students lately -- and it can be very interesting. The Czech Republic and Poland are good choices there. If you're very adventurous, look at Russia!<br>  <br>  The Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands are good choices as well. The only drawbacks to going there are the high rates of English fluency -- which makes it harder for a student to learn the language.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|GQTaKHCvaa	If you are set on Europe I would suggest Germany, Portugal, Belgium or the Netherlands!

IjwOIRcmaa	I'm a high school senior so I've been getting a lot of college brochures. A few of them sound like they are really good at letting students like you design really unique programs of study and get a double major. Generally they were really small private schools. You should look out for them, but I can't really remember what any of their names were. You should probably double major in English Education and International Relations. Then, like you said work at a DODEA school or some European school (just remember that you'll need totally different credentials to teach at a foreign school.) You should also consider working with the Peace Corps or something for a while. After you try different things out for a while you may consider going back to college to get a masters in either teaching or international affairs. You might want to look at the military, they'll send you to college and you might be able to do what you want through them.

d3c054109cf626de0b868751662b1b40aa	*Liberation means a movement seeking freedom, equal rights, and status for a group. <br>  <br>  *Front has many meanings, but in this context, it means a political area of activity or interest where there is conflict.<br>  <br>  It is safe to assume that most "liberation fronts" are militant and use violence to justify their cause. It usually refers to a criminal enterprise creating or using a legitimate business to conceal its illicit activities.<br>  <br>  Some examples: <br>  -Palestine Liberation Front (PLO)---a terrorist group formed in 1977 as the result of a split with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine; became a satellite of al-Fatah; made terrorist attacks on Israel across the Lebanese border.<br>  <br>  -Earth Liberation Front (ELF)---they say they're for protecting the environment, but they are accused of economic sabotage and guerrilla warfare to stop the exploitation and destruction of the environment. The group is classified under "eco-terrorism."<br>  <br>  -Animal Liberation Front (ALF)---animal liberation activists who engage in direct action on behalf of animals. This includes removing animals from laboratories and fur farms, and sabotaging facilities involved in animal testing and other animal-based industries. According to ALF statements, any act that furthers the cause of animal liberation, where all reasonable precautions are taken not to harm human or non-human life, may be claimed as an ALF action.<br>  <br>  -National Liberation Front, also known as the "Vietcong"---they were Communist fighters during the Vietnam War who fought in the name of freedom for their nation (Vietnam).|`|98XPkvSqaa	In a political sense, FRONT means organization.  It's a group of people dedicated to the liberation of something or other...maybe Puerto Rico (do you remember the FALN), or Angola, or Viet Nam, or whatever.
apMjpmogaa	Generally, it means a practice interview. You are given the basic description of a job that you are supposed to "apply" to. You go into a room where some teacher or instructor is pretending to be the employer.

TrOEFKikaa	I think he is sort of a narrative device, the eyes of the audience as well as the author. We follow the story through the structure that the inspector chooses to interrogate the facts, thus he is sort of 'reading' the story to us, we feel empathy with the inspector and trust him, he is a convincing voice of neutrality and is percieved as the arbiter of truth because of the faith we place in him.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	He is the catalyst for the piece - his presence provokes the various reactions from the characters - we are not sure he really exists. In some respects he could be described as a sort of sustained Deus ex Machina - an inspector investigating a crime that hasn't really happened in order to elicit attitudes and responses from the Birlings which damn themselves to the audience and reinforce Priestley's socialist doctrine.

xfqHi1tRaa	If you are a high school student, you can often get community groups in your area to help sponsor you.<br>  <br>  Look to the Lions Club, Masons, Moose Lodges, Study Clubs, etc. Write them a letter or contact a club officer and ask to make a presentation at their club. Tell them where you want to go and why; what you hope to gain and how you can use that to help the community.<br>  <br>  Offer to send each group a monthly update on your activities (and make sure you follow up and that it is NOT the same for each club -- many people belong to more than one). Then tell them you will make a major power point presentation when you return home (that presentation can be the same). The club may ask you to contact one of their sister clubs in your host country and you should be prepared to do that.<br>  <br>  Sometimes these clubs will offer several hundred dollars each for your exchange -- so give it a try!|`|GQTaKHCvaa	The exchange program will normally have some scholarships.

ZB0393Kkaa	Patience, patience patience. <br>  <br>  I give bagpipe lessons on the side. Playing a musical instrument requires one to learn a completely unnatural set of finger movements, patterns, and a completely different language. These things don't come quickly, as you probably know. <br>  <br>  Basically you teach a musical instrument the same way to a young person as a mature learner. The technique is the same no matter what age you learn it at. <br>  <br>  Visuals are always nice, but they don't replace demonstration by the instructor. I keep finger charts handy, however I also play the note on my instrument along with them. Also monitor very closely for "bad habits" (I don't play violin however some "bad habits" with the bagpipe are playing on the tips of the fingers, curling the fingers, and leaving lower holes open that should be closed). <br>  <br>  As far as the staff: don't throw too much at them at once. I find students learn better when they are taught the timing of notes before naming them on the staff. It's OK if in the early stages the student has to write the note name above the staff. Gradually wean them off of this, don't do it all at once. <br>  <br>  Just some things I find work for me. But the real key is patience and to always stay positive. Don't put a student down, and always be sure to point out the things they are doing right in addition to the things that need to be corrected.|`|Gfjbp30Maa	When I started violin when I was about 8 years old, I began with a few easy sheets that my teacher picked out for me, and then started with a book titled, "Suzuki's Violin For Beginners - Book 1." You could most likely find this it any local music store, e.g. Bel Air Music Store.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, my teacher was extremely rude and mean. She eventually got so frustrated with me that she told me, "You are terrible, and will never get better." I was devastated, and I wound up crying at my friend's house right after. This drove me to quit violin and start piano, even after my 3 years of taking violin. <br>  <br>  The point is, you will lose your students if you are like my teacher was. Without encouragement, kids often feel neglected and resort to quitting.<br>  <br>  When tutoring, you should look for posture, the right hand positions, the right movement, and for them to  be on key.<br>  <br>  Don't be nervous; just relax and enjoy your time teaching (and don't end up like my teacher!)<br>  <br>  I hope I've helped,<br>  Patricia

If you can read the words but forget them afterward, that is not dyslexia. You should consult with a professional evaluator (a school psychologist or other psychologist specializing in educational evaluations would be a good address) to figure out exactly where the problem is occurring. From what you describe, it could be any of a number of different things that can't be determined in this forum. It could be a visual attention, memory, or processing problem, for example.<br>  <br>  By the way, a grade range of 48 - 74 warrants concern.

wFBVuBOkaa	You don't indicate if you want to work in an antique shop, run your own antique shop, do valuations for insurance purposes, auction... there are different ways to accomplish each of these goals. I'm going to address several different kinds of appraisals.<br>  <br>  You might benefit from a museum studies certificate or similar program. Not only will museum studies teach you how to identify and handle artifacts and detect techniques used to fake items, you build connections with people in the antiques industry.<br>  <br>  A lot also depends on what kind of antiques you want to appraise. If you'd just like to be a low-price generalist, you can work in an antiques shop and network and learn from there. People put out pricing guides and manuals for most mass-produced antiques. It's not like you just look it up in a book, so there is finesse and experience that helps you, but it's not as difficult as, say, pricing one-of-a-kind Rembrandts.<br>  <br>  If you want to specialize: depending on your specialty, you may find there's more money in commissions for museums (which must seek out third-party, trained appraisers and evaluators) and private collectors as well as insurance valuations. You can specialize in just about everything. If you want to appraise books, you might need training in manuscripts, vellum, inks, chemistry, handwriting analysis, certain periods in history, etc. depending on the period and the region you'd be looking at. As a Western Americana ephemera collector my appraisers need to know a fair chunk of urban history, Western history, archives and manuscripts, and publishing history - but we don't need to worry as much about a trade in faking letters or chemistry. But someone who appraises the work of Romantic poets or existentialists would need an excellent background in forgery detection thanks to both market price and a very skilled forger (who was also an appraiser) who flooded the market with fakes. Furniture appraisals are also rife with forgeries, and it takes a keen eye to spot strange wear marks and so on.<br>  <br>  So you see it's not necessarily as easy as "I want to appraise antiques." I recommend museum studies so that you will learn if you want to be a generalist or if you want to specialize, and know where to establish your contacts.

4d8g3q6saa	After the death of LENIN,the Bolshewik (= majority) leader , <br>  STALIN used (a)his brutality,(b)his trickyness ((e.g: He told his<br>  arch enemy TROTZKI the wrong date for LENIN' funeral so it <br>  was  impossible for TROTZKI (who was appreciated by LENIN <br>  very much because HE was the true founder of the Red Army)<br>  ..so T.could not take part in the funeral.But that was a serious  political slap in T's face!) Later much worse things happened.<br>  (c) STALIN's cruelty (step by step he had eliminate all , ALL <br>  the former comrades who LENIN helped in his overthrow of the   democratic government  in 1917 which had been formed after the  abdiction of the Tsar,the Russian emperor. TROTZKI was assassinated by Stalin's order only in 1940 in Mexico City(!)<br>  where Stalin sent a killer to the TROTZKI family who befriended <br>  with Trotzki's daughter so that he could get into the well-guarded hoouse. That killer showed  his fatherly "friend" a document and <br>  asked him to have a look at it,and when T. was reading it,<br>  he smashed him an ice-ax on his head.<br>  Other methods: (d) kind invitations to his opponents or even his<br>  political supporters,even from abroad, but then having them <br>  sent to be shot in the neck or ordered to be taken to hospital by saying they were severyly ill (as happened in 1926 to a great<br>  military leader called FRUNSE[speak:Froonzer,sounds similar].<br>  But the vast majority of his victims were nameless people on<br>  the death lists Stalin signed  EVERY EVENING, and the Secret Police leaderships in the country got short telegrams: <br>  "Another 1000((2000,5000) enemies have to be killed". So they <br>  founnd "enemies" in a city of 100.000,no problem. They barred the streets and  saw to it that 1000 or more were filling the 20 lories<br>  (or more)  they had ordered to get there.<br>  Death lists, show trials for really honest and good people that<br>  had been tortured to"confess" that they had planned the <br>  assasination of the GREAT STALIN. or any act of sabotage.<br>  I will stop, I do not want you to get sick of it.

Enough of this. <br>  I recommend you a book " Archangel" by Robert HARRIS,<br>  it tells the story of a US journalist who had come to a congress in the<br>  1990ies,when Russia was no longer a communist country.<br>  But STALIN's presence is to be felt any moment,and a second string of action leads to the dictator directly.It is worth reading.<br>  <br>  May you have a fine week,despite my bad news from history!<br>  <br>  HySt2812|`|YfIm4IqSaa	Wikipedia should be a great resource.

xTioPxaVaa	You're actually looking at two different fields, an electronics tech and a luthier.  <br>  <br>  If you want to work on guitars (other than the electronics), there are some luthier training seminars.  However, for the most part that industry is still an apprentice-based one.  In other words, you're going to have to find someone that's already established to take you one (for little or no money), and show you the business. To really be successful in that biz, you've got to be part electronics tech, part wood craftsman, and part artist.  <br>  <br>  Every luthier has his own way of doing things, and all of them excel at different specialties.  <br>  <br>  I do my own setups fret work, and electronics work on my electric guitars.  However, I don't do finishes, so I've got one guy I like for that.  I've got another guy that's a wizard with Ovation acoustic guitars, and other that I'll use for extensive neck work on my older Gibsons.<br>  <br>  It takes a long time to get established in that field.<br>  <br>  Amp repair is a little more structured.  If you came out of school with an Associates in Applied Science in electronics, you would actually be ahead of a lot of guys out there.  There's still the "build your reputation" thing you have to go through, and it helps to get hired on with a shop that specializes in that kind of work, but it's a more defined career path.<br>  <br>  My background is in broadcast engineering.  I started out repairing amps and doing guitar mods for friends about 30 years ago.  Since moving to Austin about 10 years, that's blossomed into a pretty good side business.  I'm one of the few guys in the area that can work on the newer modeling amps as well as old Fenders and Marshalls.  I've kind of got a reputation for getting an amp ready to tour, in that I've learned what's going to break first when you start trucking equipment around, and I'll beef that up.  <br>  <br>  I'm also doing system integration for effects systems.  It looks like the big racks of the 80's are about to return, and that would be good for my biz!<br>  <br>  In some ways, making it in the music repair business isn't a whole lot different than making it in a band...just less groupies to contend with.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|767e299d38a97e37140d682673cd290faa	Well, you really do need to study electronics. That way you will gain an understanding fo how the amps work.

Just like personification is a type of metaphor. Just like fiction itself is a type of metaphor.<br>  <br>  A metaphor is any comparison between two different things. Some are overt: "My love is a burning pile of banana peels." Some are harder to see: "I just got a boatload of money."<br>  <br>  You use different types of metaphors for different reasons. A simile is simple, concise, with a nice bounce added by the "like" or "as." Is it any wonder they're so often used in songs and poetry? Personification makes inanimate objects living things, letting us believe in a bit of supernatural and magic even if the piece is mundane.

W3UYWpxiaa	Maybe you misinterpreted his intentions.  It sounds like he was just being warm and friendly and you took it too far.  He did the right thing by passing information along to the principal.  Some people, once rejected, would use whatever emails and correspondence he had sent against him and could get him fired.  Did he ever say that he wanted to start a "new relationship" with you in anything more than a teacher/parent way?  It really sounds as though you misread him and in your email took things too far making him uncomfortable.  What would you do if you were him?  Even if he were interested in you , you are married and have a child that attends the school he works for.  It was fine for him not to be present at the meeting.  I'm sure it was very awkward for him just taking the principal the emails.  Do yourself a favor and put this incident behind you.|`|aqto0hJTaa	If what you're telling is the absolute truth, then it sounds like the principal shouldn't have been involved.<br>  <br>  However, for him to forward this stuff to the principal and for the principal to highlight stuff and use it as "evidence," it sounds like your emails may have gone beyond what is acceptable.  How many did you send?  What did you ask for?  It seems you put him in fear of keeping his job.<br>  <br>  That meeting should never have been held without you present, though.|`|FnE7BiYJaa	It seems that the sexual harrassment law kicked in.|`|2xONxGv5aa	It isn't the principal's business unless you took it too far, from that it looks like you didn't do anything wrong. But that is also some what an invasion of privacy, I would write him and tell him how much of a loser he is for doing that to you! But that would be stooping down to his level. But whatever makes you feel better you should do.|`|59394a1b605823a8a42f1427df951f78aa	This is an unusual situation.<br>  <br>  Despite what everyone else is saying, it is a principal's job to investigate any situation that might involve teachers.  In this situation, where a teacher might feel concerned about the situation (whether he really does feel this way or is trying to stir up something unfortunate only he knows), he is doing himself and his school a service by going to his principal.  <br>  <br>  Remember, principals are the teacher-leaders of a school.  They are the immediate supervisors of the teachers.  By letting his supervisor know of a situation that may have occurred, he is, in effect, making sure that the school is aware of the issue.<br>  <br>  It is a principal's job to step in and intervene, if deemed necessary, in a situation between a teacher and anyone else where the interaction involves the school itself.  You guys might have been e-mailing or talking outside of the school, but your first interaction occurred at the school and the situation progressed at the school.  Principals are ultimately in charge of making sure that a school runs properly, and that there are no distractions (or as few as possible) in such functioning.  The teacher (for whatever reason) apparently felt that you were causing a distraction to him, and thus alerted the principal.  After all, you are the parent of a student that he teaches.<br>  <br>  In your situation, if you feel it is necessary, I would discuss the situation with the principal to bring some clarity to the table.  Beyond that, I would have no contact with the teacher whatsoever, unless it relates to your child or your child's education.  This will keep you both from having further communication issues in the future.  That's really what this whole thing sounds like - a miscommunication.  Whose part the error was on is really of no consequence at this point, but you guys should simply cease all unnecessary communcation.|`|AA11043457	The principal should have been involved with the teacher and  your emails but not to bring in your husband.  By contacting your husband, I believe, crossed a line of privacy.  Sure it was a violating in a way of your marriage, but that wasn't the principal's business.  She should have contacted you and told you not to contact the teacher further.<br>  <br>  Teachers should not be getting involved personally with parents of their students. It can be an ethical problem or give an appearance of a problem.  If  he gives a good grade to your daughter it could look like he was partial. If he gave her a bad grade and things hadn't been going well, then it would look bad and could be seen as harassment.<br>  <br>  You are a married woman, still married and not divorced so  you should not have told him personal things about your marriage.  You were looking for an affair or for someone to make  you feel good.<br>  <br>  You probably need help but with a psychologist to whom  you can discuss your marriage and personal issues and who can advise you or even work with you and your husband to repair your marriage.<br>  <br>  It is not the teacher's place and you put him in a very difficult position. He was being friendly and cordial as he probably is to all parents. You misunderstood it, probably because  you needed a friend and were looking for something more.  <br>  <br>  This could hurt  your marriage.  You don't mention whether or not the teacher was married and it might affect his marriage, too, if he had let it go on.  So he was entirely right to go to his boss to show him your letters and to ask how to deal with it.  However, the principal did not use good judgment in going to  your husband rather than to you directly.  I can understand that the emails made the teacher uncomfortable.  It doesn't sound as though the teacher was accountable as it was your emails that crossed over from being friendly and related to your daughter's education to a personal level which should not have been shared with the teacher.  You need to deal with your relationship with your husband - and get a psychologist to help you work out that relationship.  Your husband may be partly responsible for the disconnect and perhaps you can both work out the problems.  I hope so.  You may have been hurting and looking for someone to help you feel better, but the teacher is not someone that  you should have approached.  All email on school computers is generally the property of the school and a teacher could get in trouble for personal use of emails.  So he did the right thing.  If there is a problem to you as a result of this, you might check with an attorney as to the principal going to your husband rather than to  you.  Yet I think the biggest problem is the one between you and your husband.<br>  <br>  Good luck to  you.

zgTsCicNaa	Charles "Teenie" Harris (1908–1998) was an accomplished African-American photographer.<br>  <br>  Harris was born in 1908 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, the son of hotel owners in the city's Hill District. Early in the 1930s he purchased his first camera and opened a photography studio. He freelanced for the Washington D.C. news picture magazine, Flash!. From the 1936 to the 1975 Harris chronciled life in the black neighborhoods of the city for the Pittsburgh Courier, one of America's oldest black newspapers. He was nicknamed "One Shot" because he rarely made his subjects sit for retakes. Harris took more than 80,000 images during his career. The body of his work constitutes arguably the largest and most complete photographic documentation of a minority community in the United States.<br>  <br>  Unlike his more celebrated African-American contemporaries, such as James Van Der Zee, known for studio portraits, or Gordon Parks, who traveled widely as a photojournalist, Harris was a working-class photographer tethered to a job with a circumscribed beat. His work was rarely seen outside of Pittsburgh, until after his death in 1998.<br>  <br>  In addition to his photo essays of daily life in the city, he captured many celebrities who visited Pittsburgh, e.g. Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billy Eckstine, Lena Horne, Sarah Vaughan, Sam Cooke, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, Charlie Parker, Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis, Eleanor Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Dizzy Gillespie.<br>  <br>  Harris also photographed legendary ***** League baseball players of the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords. Harris himself played baseball for the Crawfords when they were known as the Crawford Colored Giants.<br>  <br>  He licensed his collection of photographs in 1986 to a local entrepreneur, Dennis Morgan, and subsequently these so-called "Morgan prints" were sold at street fairs in Pittsburgh. Harris filed a lawsuit in 1998 for unpaid royalties and the return of his collection. He won the case posthumously. Carnegie Museum of Art purchased the collection from the Harris estate in 2001.<br>  <br>  In 2005 Carnegie Museum of Art created an online gallery of Harris' work. The Teenie Harris Archive Project features a sampling of 1,400 images.

So you should definitely stick with school. The alternatives aren't much fun. They will catch you eventually, and you don't want that to happen. Because the moment social services get involved, is the moment it all starts to go down hill. :-)|`|UmBxV5ybaa	You will get a No Credit and wont graduate.|`|heXiCKepaa	You will fail the year, and you or your parents could be fined or put in jail.  You will lose the benefits of a good education (knowledge, understanding, and financial opportunities).  You will limit yourself at least until you decide to return to school later in life.  You may still be able to make a good living; many uneducated people have the drive to overcome their limitations.  However, you will probably always wonder what might have been if you had attended school when you had the chance to do so for free.|`|XhirXRkpaa	Depending on the state you live in, the laws vary slightly.  However, if you are a minor, your parents can be fined or put in jail for your truancy.|`|MaWUTYf6aa	Your parents might get calls and notices from the school.<br>  You might not graduate.<br>  You might have a talk with the principal or vice principal.|`|t9pCfqj6aa	The School will eventually drop/expel you.

KId5dapjaa	Looks like my schedule this year, except we don't have AP Psychology at my school and I have AP Calculus AB rather than Stats... so I really only have four AP classes.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you about me so far: I've managed all A's first semester, somehow, amazingly. My AP English Language class is not like an AP class and no work is really done there, so I'm probably not going to do too well on the AP Class. <br>  <br>  APUSH is definitely my favourite, but it's hard for me. There's a lot of stuff to remember and a lot of essays to write. It is by far the most time consuming class. Especially mine, because we have to do 2 four page study guides each week (which are two sided, so technically it's 8) as well as listen to a separate lecture on our OWN time and a lot of pretty challenging projects. <br>  <br>  AP Chemistry is all right except things stopped making sense second semester, and I never did very well on the labs and so that hurt my grade. But hey, I came out with an A-. But this semester... yeah, nothing makes sense. It's also a two hour class, which kind of sucks.<br>  <br>  I would say cut back on AP Psychology. No one's going to really care that you took an AP class in Psychology when you submit your resume for college. The other subjects look much more important. The only reason AP Psych would be good is if you plan on majoring in that field later, although if you do, it's going to be difficult finding a good job and pay...<br>  <br>  ALSO, the AP tests are really expensive! It's $90 per test where I live, and I doubt you'd want to spend close to $500 on tests? Unless you can get a fee waiver... I mean, just throwing that out.<br>  <br>  Think about what YOU can handle. Five AP classes would be great if you can survive! I'm barely on the edge of sanity right now.|`|cKk3CQCYaa	Well im taking Statistic,American history, and english right now and i know people who are taking chemistry. A.P Chemistry is ridicolously hard and unless your planning on being a pharmacist or antything in that field dont even bother with it because its not neccisary and will only make your gpa go down. Statistic is extremly difficult and you really should be a math wiz if your planning on taking this and should be considering some field in buisness or else this class is pointless as well English isnt that bad just alot of writing i mean alot i had 6 essays over this break. Ap. American alot of memorization and thats about it and phycology idk but as i said before make sure you have to take these for your major or else its really a waste of time and will just affect your gpa negativly|`|MglbP7v4aa	Wow, what a workload. I took 2 AP classes this year and I'm in 11th grade. APUSH and AP English. I don't know how it is in your school, but english is a killer at my school. APUSH is ok. A lot of studying for the tests, but again it depends on the teacher. But next year I'm taking 4 AP classes. But hey, if you think you can handle it, go for it. But in my oppionion, I would drop a couple this year. It may be overwhelming. Its high school, enjoy it!! Like other people said, take classes that you enjoy, not just because its offered in AP. Good luck!|`|64636daa678d2374eeb4a45c17c43a70aa	APUSH is a lot of DBQs, it's lots of work but not too hard, I didn't know there was an AP English, check if it's lit or lang. I hear language is stupidly hard because of the daily homework. In Lit, you can do everything by reading sparknotes (I take it now). Statistics was fairly easy for me (Junior Year), but I had a great teacher and am math team. You can do well in this class with an understanding of the subject and some practice. I got a 5 on the AP Stat Exam. <br>  <br>  Psych is not an AP class, in terms of difficulty. It's like a fingerpainting class you'd have in kindergarden, at a special needs school. Except worse. I don't take it, but there's a reason why the majority of students take this class. College Psych classes are crammed with students.<br>  <br>  NB, All my advice goes out the window when you have an irregular teacher. Hard teachers can make any subject difficult, and good teachers can make any subject bearable. Difficulty is also relative to an individual person's interests. So is relevance. Ask some seniors, sit in on a class, and under no circumstances should you take something harder than you can handle. Doing 5 APs isn't unheard of at my school.|`|e4b32e33b8c5f290f2ac40c695f487f2aa	US history - easy but time consuming<br>  Statistics - boring and long<br>  Chemistry- kinda hard, but not as time consuming<br>  Psych - easy<br>  English - long and time consuming<br>  <br>  that's a lot of time consuming classes- Other AP's aren't necessarily like that|`|MNl2HmXRaa	Holy crap! Good luck!!!!|`|140d2cb6f23e38d9b4af65f92993c60faa	Its going to be pretty hard, but its not impossilbe.  I know this girl who took 5 ap classes both junior and senior year AND she was valedictorian and has a full scholarship to UCLA.<br>  <br>  Out of those classes, I took AP US junior year and AP English and AP stats senior year.  It really depends on the teacher and your school, but for me, APUSH was a killer.  I was up til like 2-3 each night studying, (but i ended up getting a 4 on the test).  I thought the english was a lot of reading and was kinda hard (i got a 2).  Stats, I thought had pretty simple concepts, and I got a 3 on that.<br>  <br>  In short, it really depends on YOU.  If you think you can handle it, go for it! It'll look good on college apps!|`|xZQjK7oKaa	Only take AP in the classes you like, or what would be good for the job you might want to have in life. Don't put everything on your plate, because it's a little too much.<br>  <br>  And try picturing AP World History times five. Every day. Yeah?|`|3tXvT13caa	ha have fun gettin 2 hrs of sleep ech night and stayin home on friday and saturday nights!!!|`|CeoEHkWbaa	I am currently taking 4 AP's right now and I am in the 11th grade. It can be overwhelming at times but it really depends on which AP classes you take and how easy or difficult you think they are. I am taking AP calc, AP us history, AP english  and ap bio. I took ap chem last year as a sophomore. The class was okay. It wasn't impossible. You do need to be good at math though and understand concepts. My teacher curved our final averages so I always had A's and on the AP exam I got a 4. However, I did feel the Ap exam itself was hard....I was so surprised when I got my grade in the mail. Most of the other people in my class got a 3 or below. AP english lang is supposedly harder than AP Eng Literature but I think that is only in terms of the exam. The class itself is alright...but I'm not a fan of writing essays in general so its not exactly my fav class. I'm taking AP statistics in my senior year, and I have heard from other students, my guidance counselor and the teacher of the class that it is not as hard as people think. It focuses less on math and goes more into concepts and graphs so I am looking forward to it. In my personal opinon, AP US History is much easier than AP World history. I think I may have a chance of getting a 4 or 5 on the AP exam. Its all about memorization really and most of the stuff we learn is repetitve from thing I remeber learing in my 8th grade social studies class. Just make sure that for tests in the class, you spend like 3 or 4 hours studying. I don't know anything about AP psychology. But I would recommend only doing 4 AP's.

KWvGUoW6aa	It all depends. When you are getting ready to graduate, the recruiters will consider not only your academic achievements but also your extra-curricular activities and part-time job experience. A degree alone will not land you a job. You must also keep in touch with recruiters as you get closer to graduation so that at least one of them will know you well enough to put in a good word for you. I have colleagues who work with me who went to smaller schools, and even some of my colleagues do not have their degree in accounting. Right now I am working with a guy who has his degree in Sociology from UCLA but had a minor in accounting and passed the CPA exam. However, I did graduate from a top rated school in Accountancy, and I have a job, many of my classmates got jobs too, although I had one friend who applied to several firms and didn't get one interview; his GPA wasn't as good as mine though.<br>  <br>  So, in summary, it really doesn't matter. But, you have to show the recruiters that you really want the job, and you have to have things on your resume that make you stand out.
CgOs2ViPaa	Eh, I disagree. I think you have a somewhat okay chance of getting in, but not like. a for sure thing, since your SAT scores are definitely not too hot. Well, your ACT is a little better, but it's still not up to UCLA standards. But your ECs are definitely really good. What did you get on your SAT 2's?|`|zC7pkdK1aa	Your chances of getting it are likely. Your GPA is a bit lower than the Average UCLA GPA, but still sufficient. The only drawback is that your SAT score is extremely low compared to UCLA students. You want at least a 2150 to have a high chance of getting in. <br>  <br>  Your extracurricular is good and it does kind of cover your SAT score, but UC system extracurricular are not weighed as high as SAT and GPA.<br>  <br>  Overall I think you have a pretty good chance of getting in.|`|lxrONW88aa	You have a good chance. I know California schools are harder on students that are not living in CA, just so you are aware. Your ACT is okay, but anything 30 and above is safer. I think your GPA is fine. <br>  <br>  Starting your own charity is a marvelous way to be noticed by a university, so good job with so many leadership positions!

Also, it takes the hassle of having to pick something out every morning and worry of repeating outfits. you can also individualize the uniform by adding accessories (if the school permits it) also, sometimes certain clothes or accessories show belonging to a clique or gang and cliques are usually frowned upon at most schools. <br>  <br>  Why they shouldn't: Clothes let kids have personal and artistic freedom. Also, they get to express themselves in ways that they want. Each kid then gets to stand out instead of stick in. Also, uniforms can get $$ and sometimes it is easier to buy your own clothes. Also without uniform you can buy clothes that flatter you much better.

The Department of Education has strict rules as to who can be considered independent.  There are 13 questions on the FAFSA which make a student independent by answering "YES' to any one of them.   Read them over carefully and see if you fit into any of these categories.  If you will be considered "homeless" when your mother throws you out of the house in June, then maybe the financial aid office can classify you in this category, but even with this classification, you must produce documentation to substantiate this circumstance..  Even if you were going to apply for a student loan, the school will request that you complete the FAFSA, so bottom line, you need her taxes.  <br>  <br>  I would talk to your mother and give her this information.  Tell her that her refusal to give you this information will stop you from getting any kind of financial aid, even loans and therefore will prevent you from going to school.   Have her go to the financial aid office with you and they will give her this same information. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope your mom changes her mind.|`|0aebc3da094dcd85852e8ef94004b113aa	You can go online to fill it out.<br>  <br>  www.fafsa.ed.gov|`|cV4tAnY2aa	What the hell!!!!???<br>  <br>  Ok,<br>  <br>  Heres what you do<br>  <br>  Contact the financial aid office at the school you plan on attending.<br>  <br>  Talk to them and explain your situation and see if they can work out you being filed as an independant in your extreme situation. <br>  <br>  If not<br>  <br>  Let's hope they can talk to your mother to explain the importance of filing the FAFSA.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	Do you have your own source of income and did you file your own income taxes last year?<br>  <br>  You can fill out the FAFSA online without your parents if you have your own income.

By starting right away, you still remember what the teacher went over in class, and you have time to read the book again if you have trouble with a section. If you know what chapter will be covered the next day, it's a good idea to read it after finishing your homework. That way, when the teacher explains it in class, you'll already be familiar with it.|`|159394faa2c9a4d53afa1a35b7bd635aaa	Why don't you try to to study with someone who is the top student in the class.If you study with that person,they could give you some pointers.Ask my cousin Takiyesho,from Japan she is taking Algebra 1 also.Contact her at japanesehaki11@yahoo.com.

For example, if you are interested in a science major, calculus and physics are MUCH easier in college if you learn the basics in high school. You don't necessarily appreciate how easy it is to learn a topic when you are in a class of 30 students, for five hours a week until you are in classes of hundreds of students, for three hours a week. At all but community colleges, you do a lot more learning on your own. High school is "spoon feeding" knowledge by comparison.

reHRXlZCaa	In order to qualify as a home student rather then an international student you need to be resident in the country for 3 years prior to the 1st day of the start of your course.  <br>  <br>  If you return to the UK and complete your GCSEs and A Levels, it should bring you to the required threshold to apply for funding but there is no free education at University level, most students now take out loans which must be repaid in order to fund their education.  There are bursaries available but in order to qualify as a home student you must have resident for the qualifying period.   <br>  <br>  I would also advise you to contact the British Consulate and ask them if they can put you in contact with someone who can advise on your options are.  <br>  <br>  If there is a particular course or college you're interested, contact them & see what would happen with fees and if there is any assistance available for 'overseas students'.<br>  <br>  This link will take you to UCAS which is the institution which deals with applications to University, it also has useful information on University courses, links to Unis and information on funding.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ucas.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucas.ac.uk/</a>|`|vhlORK4Waa	Hi there<br>  <br>  If you are a British Citizen what sort?<br>  Just living here doesn't mean you acquired citizenship!<br>  British citizens fall into a number of categories, not all of which possess the right to remain in the UK indefinitely<br>  <br>  British Citizens usually hold this status through a connection with the United Kingdom, Channel Islands and Isle of Man ("United Kingdom and Islands"). Former Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKCs) who possessed right of abode under the Immigration Act 1971 through a connection with the United Kingdom and Islands generally became British citizens on 1 January 1983. <br>  British citizenship is the most common type of British nationality, and the only one that automatically carries a right of abode in the United Kingdom. <br>  <br>  However, other rights can vary according to how the British citizenship was acquired. In particular there are restrictions for 'British citizens by descent' transmitting British citizenship to their children born outside the UK. These restrictions don't apply to 'British citizens other than by descent'. <br>  <br>  British Overseas Territories citizens (formerly British Dependent Territories citizenship) (BOTC) <br>  BOTC (formerly BDTC) is the form of British nationality held by connection with an existing overseas territory. Nearly all are now also British citizens as a result of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002. It is possible to hold BOTC and British citizenship simultaneously. <br>  <br>  British Overseas citizens (BOC) <br>  BOCs are those former CUKCs who did not qualify for either British citizenship or British Dependent Territories citizenship. Most of these derived their status as CUKCs from former colonies, such as Malaysia and Kenya. <br>  <br>  British subjects <br>  British subjects (as defined in the 1981 Act) are those British subjects who were not CUKCs or citizens of any other Commonwealth country. Most of these derived their status as British subjects from British India or the Republic of Ireland as they existed before 1949. <br>  <br>  British Nationals (Overseas) (BNO) <br>  The status of BNO did not originally exist under the 1981 scheme, but was created by the Hong Kong Act 1985 and the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Order 1986. BNOs are those former Hong Kong BDTCs who applied for the status of BNO prior to the handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China. Hong Kong BDTCs who did not apply to become BNOs, and who did not gain PRC nationality after the handover, became BOCs if they did not have any other nationality. <br>  <br>  British protected persons (BPP) <br>  BPPs derive from those parts of the British Empire which were not officially part of the Crown's dominions, but were instead protectorates or protected states with nominally independent rulers under the "protection" of the British Crown. The status of BPP is sui generis - BPPs are not Commonwealth citizens (British subjects, in the old sense) and were not traditionally considered to be British nationals, but are not aliens either. <br>  <br>  The laws are complex on right to remain, so I suggest you get some advice from the embassy in Amman.If you however hold a British passport then you can come and go as you please.<br>  <br>  Don't really understand you question about education - if you are 15,  you need to be in full time education and have parental or adults looking after you - where are your parents - who would you stay with.<br>  <br>  There is free schooling in the UK, just a case of getting the right school in the right area and making sure they have room for you<br>  <br>  Halcon
xQuFfny5aa	I agree with "George."  I, too, develop favorites through the course of a trimester.  It's not something that I look for or want to happen.  It just does,  What makes a student my "favorite" is typically his/ her desire to learn, respect for me and others in the class, and all those other things that make a good student (brings materials to class, homework handed in on time, no tardies, few absences).<br>  I try very hard not to make my "favorite" known to the class.  I don't call on this person any more than anyone else.  I don't treat him/ her any differently in conversation or in scoring of class materials.|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	My favorite students are the ones who are giving 100%. They are the ones that are doing their personal best. They may not be the smartest in the room, but I know that they are trying hard. So, anyone in the room could qualify for my favorite.|`|IWSc7xkiaa	I guess you could say that I have favorites, but I don't try to treat them any better. I see these types of questions on Yahoo all the time from students who are annoyed, but you have to understand that teachers are humans too. We like some people better than others, it's just a part of life. What can I do about a student who takes care of his or her business, but just keeps to him/herself? I don't get to really "know" them, so I might not joke around or interact with them much. Some students are more outgoing and let their personalities show. Some don't try to "fight" the teacher, but instead get along and try to learn something. It's hard not to like these students. I think, however, that a teacher has to be professional enough to NOT give those students any type of special treatment.|`|n662efY5aa	I'm not a teacher. I have helped out in a couple 3/4 yr old classrooms though. I'm a senior in HS planning on teaching elementary.<br>  <br>  Teacher favorites are inevitable. We are all people, therefore we all have personalities, feelings, etc. We get along better with one person better than the next. It's impossible to throw 30 random people into a room and tell a person to like them all equally. <br>  <br>  One thing you can be sure of is that teachers do not favor the know-it-all students, though everyone seems to believe that. A teacher who does is one who does not care. Those students are easy and require little attention. A teacher tends to favor a student who they feel they are helping a great deal. A student who comes in a blank slate and is interested in learning from the teacher is an amazing student. When they are filled to the brim with everything you've taught them...:0) it's such a great feeling. A student who is beyond others in the class or one who is far below others is favored by teachers who prefer a challenge.|`|NvrVjOhBaa	Unfortunately, yes I always do. Every semester or class, I seem to find one. This year, it is a young man who I can totally see being my protege. He's smart, shy, and unknowingly adorable (I'm a woman, btw).<br>  <br>  I'm like 20 years his senior, and I'm in a happy relationship, but I can't help but enjoy his presence in class...<br>  <br>  Most of the time it's a female who is an excellent student. It may be wrong to have a favorite student, but it is difficult. The key is to hide it!! I don't give him different grades, and I don't give him special attention. =)|`|ow7KPTpoaa	I'm an intern at an elementary school working with 5th grade & yes we all have favorites. They tend to be the hard working quite students. Its human nature.
IaPUUV26aa	Depending on your major, many opportunities can be available. It can also depend on any group or organization you are in. It varies by department, however, so to be sure, you should check with the department you are thinking about.

Moz2d806aa	PhD is certainly more prestigious... If you have a good major. There really is no higher degree than a PhD in engineering or physics. However, A PhD in some made up subject is not so great.|`|abb6fe2c0e4ace7bef02cf6682a6679daa	I don't think you should worry about prestige, you should look for a job that will make you happy. It might seem like prestige will make you happy, but I don't think that it will in the long run.<br>  <br>  The biggest reason that I am going for a Ph.D. is because I want a job that won't bore me. Most jobs become repetitious after a little while, but with research, at least you are learning new things constantly, coming up with new ideas, solving new problems. <br>  <br>  Admittedly, some M.D.s do research, but most of them see a few different problems all the time. I would hate to go through all that schooling to wind up with a job that I didn't like.<br>  <br>  There are some programs that combine the two (MD/PhD programs), but these are extremely difficult to get into. If you want to try, get as much research experience as possible, but don't let your grades slip.|`|kE545Tseaa	Ph.D... Thats what I am going for within 10-12 years after my senior year in High School. I say the Ph.D  is far more prestigious than the M.D but both are very admirable to obtain. Go for both if you can :)|`|LuWT8KQBaa	PhD is waaaaaay more prestigious, but both are admirable.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	The PhD takes longer, on average, to earn, and it shows you have done original research and contributed to your field.  I see that one as more prestigious (I may be biased since I'm working on one currently) and the MD as, frankly, more useful.  As they say in med school, 'C's get degrees' but an average below a 3.0 will get you kicked out of grad school.  My friend who went though med school said it was hard to get into, but once you got in you could coast along with your class and be pretty sure you'd graduate.  In grad school, you have to stand on your own, do original research, and defend your work in front of experts in your field - many more people drop out of grad school vs med school.<br>  <br>  But prestige level shouldn't be the main driver in your decision - they are very different degrees.  If you want to work with patients, go with the MD.  If you want to do research and/or teach, go with the PhD.
JVhXuu9qaa	No.  You are supposed to address what the author  has to say.  You may agree or disagree, but whichever it is, give your reasons!<br>  Critical analysis may also address HOW the author presents her/his material.<br>  Does the writing engage you? - make you want to know what happens next?  Or is it predictable, and therefore boring - writing which wants to browbeat you rather than engage you in a debate?  Did the writing teach you something?  What?  And if not, what would you have heped to learn about?<br>  What's the writer's intention?  And does the writer deliver on it or not?  And why? -- What went right?  - and what went wrong?

W3UYWpxiaa	If it is an assignment unless the movie offends you in some way you should watch it.  Is it for extra credit?  If so, you don't have to watch the movie, but if you need the extra points you should.|`|aqto0hJTaa	Yep.|`|AA11043457	Do you need the 10 extra points?  If you receive 10 points credit to see it, then it would seem that you have a choice.  See it and get 10 points or don't see it and don't get the points. If you think  you should get the points and not see it, well you know better than that.<br>  <br>  If the video is not R rated, then there is no reason you should not see it.   You might find it very interesting.  One of the neatest classes I took in college was one on religions and we studied a number of different ones and discussed them and talked about which one we'd be more interested in if we had to join one of them.  It was a great discussion.  It is really a help to you to understand different people and their cultures - sort of diversity training.  I think you might find it a bit interesting. I would.  I don't know why your Mom said it was boring, but even if it is, by seeing it you get 10 extra points.  Might that turn out to be a letter grade?  <br>  <br>  What do you really lose except a bit of time in seeing the video?  <br>  Look at it and see what you can find from it.  You might be surprised.|`|FJU82Ycmaa	Even thought the film may be "boring and weird" you should want to broaden you horizen and learn more about the people you interact with everyday and will continue to interact with the rest of your life.

However, college students have a hard enough time applying for internships due to the competition - you'll be lucky to find any as a high school student.
AA11043457	One thing  you will learn, I hope, in your education, is not to use "always".  There are times when the teacher should not stick to the subject matter.  If a student is killed and kids are upset, as they would be, then it would be appropriate to take the time to talk about it.  Something could have come up that is related tin a way o the subject matter but is a current event and it might be an appropriate time to discuss that - or for the teacher to change the lesson plan to deal with that issue.   There are also inter-disciplinary lessons too where all the classes deal with a subject but on different levels.  For instance art class could have kids drawing about Pilgrims at Thanksgiving.  History class could focus on that. English could focus on language about Pilgrims or story - like Scarlet  Letter or the witch trials, etc.  <br>  <br>  Without knowing more specifically of a situation it would be hard to evaluate it. But there are sometimes when the lesson plans can be changed and even a move outside the subject matter might be appropriate, but that should not be a regular occurrence if it is not connected to the subject.|`|pjlsAUoDaa	to the essential subject matter... yes<br>  <br>  but that doesn't mean that the way in which the subjects are executed has to be by the book and/or boring. for instance, when learning about photoshop in a computer course, make a flier for your favorite store.

Statutory rape differs from forcible rape in that overt force or threat need not be present. The laws presume coercion, because a minor or mentally retarded adult is legally incapable of giving consent to the act. It includes all forms of sex and it would count even though the persons involved are not very far apart in age. Once you are underage IT'S A CRIME!.

Well-designed graphical user interfaces can free the user from learning complex command languages. On the other hand, many users find that they work more effectively with a command-driven interface, especially if they already know the command language. <br>  Graphical user interfaces, such as Microsoft Windows and the one used by the Apple Macintosh, feature the following basic components: <br>  <br>  pointer : A symbol that appears on the display screen and that you move to select objects and commands. Usually, the pointer appears as a small angled arrow. Text -processing applications, however, use an I-beam pointer that is shaped like a capital I. <br>  pointing device : A device, such as a mouse or trackball, that enables you to select objects on the display screen. <br>  icons : Small pictures that represent commands, files, or windows. By moving the pointer to the icon and pressing a mouse button, you can execute a command or convert the icon into a window. You can also move the icons around the display screen as if they were real objects on your desk. <br>  desktop : The area on the display screen where icons are grouped is often referred to as the desktop because the icons are intended to represent real objects on a real desktop. <br>  windows: You can divide the screen into different areas. In each window, you can run a different program or display a different file. You can move windows around the display screen, and change their shape and size at will. <br>  menus : Most graphical user interfaces let you execute commands by selecting a choice from a menu. <br>  The first graphical user interface was designed by Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970s, but it was not until the 1980s and the emergence of the Apple Macintosh that graphical user interfaces became popular. One reason for their slow acceptance was the fact that they require considerable CPU power and a high-quality monitor, which until recently were prohibitively expensive. <br>  <br>  In addition to their visual components, graphical user interfaces also make it easier to move data from one application to another. A true GUI includes standard formats for representing text and graphics. Because the formats are well-defined, different programs that run under a common GUI can share data. This makes it possible, for example, to copy a graph created by a spreadsheet program into a document created by a word processor. <br>  <br>  Many DOS programs include some features of GUIs, such as menus, but are not graphics based. Such interfaces are sometimes called graphical character-based user interfaces to distinguish them from true GUIs.|`|fb980253971f873d3c314b602330b5dbaa	file size of a what?? please be specific....

Merely the appearance of a deadly weapon, even though it is used for an innocuous purpose — such as being cleaned or whittling wood — suggests terrible consequences later on.<br>  <br>  www.wikipedia.org<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Foreshadowing is used in written art and film to give hints about things to come in later plot developments. It can be very broad and easily understood, or it may be complex use of symbols, that are then connected to later turns in the plot. Sometimes an author may deliberately use false hints, called red herrings, to send readers or viewers off in the wrong direction. This is particularly the case with mystery writers, who want to bury clues to a mystery in information that is partially true and partially false.<br>  <br>  www.widegeek.com<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|1203d31ab3bc3d0447a306d55a7bde5faa	Foreshadowing is a literary device in which the author "hints" at things to come in the work - sort of a forward reference.|`|d374702288caa60bfe6b2b15c7cc54b5aa	To foreshadow is to indicate or suggest something beforehand. <br>  The act of providing vague advance indications; representing beforehand.<br>  <br>  "Iraq's actions may foreshadow an escalated war."|`|AA10167852	It is a clue or hint, such as a dream or premonition that a character has, that gives a glipse of what is going to happen later on in the story.|`|AA11159413	It is where an author hint at something coming up in the book.|`|bbbO743naa	Foreshadowing is when you give little hints about what's going to eventually happen in the story.<br>  <br>  For instance, sometimes in a story someone will have a bad cough, but think nothing of it. Then at the end, that person dies of lung cancer. The coughing was a slight foreshadowing of what would eventually be their downfall.

kmIO9JYMaa	In the right sentence it could work but it would usually make more sense to say they :have: a real disadvantage|`|d374702288caa60bfe6b2b15c7cc54b5aa	The word "at" is a preposition that can imply location, position, condition or circumstance.  In this instance, If someone is "at" a real disadvantage they are in a position or circumstance that could cause them to lose or fail.  A "real" disadvantage is an even more perilous state.

Wn0nwNFjaa	Nursery is free 12.5 hours a week from the term after your child's 3rd birthday. However, if you need help with paying for the costs of daycare apply for Working Tax Credit. The amount will depend on your circumstances and can cover up to 80% of the costs. A single parent will get more money than a couple. In my case, a single parent, working full time with a declared income of ￡24,000, paying ￡850 per month to a private nursery. I get a total of just over ￡6000 a year in combines Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit. <br>  <br>  the free 12.5 hours per week at 3 years can be in either a school nursery or a private nursery, the choice is yours.|`|txGRbdLSaa	A child is entitled to a free nursery place the term they turn 3 years old and it usually works out at 5 morning or afternoon sessions per week ( about 12.5 hours).<br>  It might be a good idea to contact your Local Education Authority for a list of nursery schools in your area.<br>  Also a good source of information is the Surestart website.<br>  Hope this helps.

cKCsjeETaa	If the errors are frequent and consistent then this is a good sign the student has some kind of linguistic understanding and an ability to structure a sentence etc. Point out the errors and assign a couple of drills which highlight the correct method. <br>  <br>  It also depends on age. Are you speaking about college students or is this a 5 year old child. For younger students elocution is now being closely linked with spelling/reading problems. Concentrate on these areas. Recent studies conducted in the UK are moving away from the term learning disability, and assessing students on a sliding scale, all with equal potential if their individual needs or idiosyncrasies are catered for. <br>  <br>  If you are posting a question like this on this site then I hope it's not your only source of assistance as a teacher. Many schools have serious support structure problems! Keep up the good work and keep the faith, teachers are the future for all!|`|3bBv23BNaa	Depends on how you assess disability. A true learning disability is a discrepancy between how the child is achieving ( grades, daily work etc) and their potential..(IQ)<br>  If a student is fully capable intellectually to understand work but consistently makes little Progress, the same errors, etc, then it is very possible there is a learning disability.<br>  Teachers can usually tell after having the students a few weeks if this is the case...getting them tested and the help they need is harder. There are many programs (corrective reading, read naturally, rewards, etc) that can help students work with their disability.<br>  Also if a student has a low-normal range IQ..80's then it may be they are working as hard as they can.|`|IWSc7xkiaa	Depending on how severe the errors are and how consistent they are, I would possible recommend that they be tested. This way, if they have a problem they could be put in a program that would allow them to get the necessary modifications to help them succeed. If they did not fall into this category, I would know that they just need a little more motivation and help within the classroom.
AA12282846	It's important to go over the notes that you take in class after every lecture. This will allow you to absorb the information faster. And ask for help! Sometimes, teachers can be really disorganized when they teach a class, but if you go up to him/her after class and express concern for your grades and ask for help, they will recognize your efforts and perhaps bump your grade up if you are on a borderline grade (B+ into an A-, or B- instead of a C+). Also it's not just how long you study, but how you study. Sometimes I feel as if I study for 6 hours straight but don't get anything accomplished because I'm too tired to focus properly or I'm not eating properly.
77d7d84d5a4a1152b83fd0114e664134aa	If you pay on a subsidized during school there will be no interest.  Subsidized loans have deferred interest until repayment begins.  So, if you completely pay it off before repayment is scheduled to start, there will be no interest.  Smart thing to do

eb9n9yhcaa	what does philosophy mean???|`|UxooffHZaa	Consistency. Never let anything go, unless you're always willing to let it go. No matter which student does it. No matter what outside circumstances are. If you're not consistent, then the kids will find excuses to act out. However, if your rules are clearly stated (taught and posted), and the consequences in order of severity are posted, (1st time, this happens, 2nd time, this happens, 3rd time, this happens, etc) you shouldn't have problems with discipline. Once discipline is out of the way, you can focus on teaching.
8LyR0efpaa	You probably would be wise to start simply by telling the story of what happened.  When you get through, step back mentally and ask yourself how you would have felt if you had been the owner of the jacket.  That's the first key to regret and a serious effort not to commit the error again.  When you understand how that person felt, you are ready to write your paragraphs explaining why you think your action was a mistake.  A smart idea would be to close with a list of three things you plan to do in order to help others.  If you can make this experience have the result that you bring more good into the world than you do bad, you will be a better person, and the matter will truly be closed.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	Well, if you include the words "blah, blah, blah" I'm sure that whoever you are giving the letter to will totally believe that you are sorry and that you should have used some common sense and made some better decisions and that you surely would never do anything like this again.|`|gWlcDZJ6aa	For starters, learn to spell.<br>  <br>  Oh, and of course,<br>  <br>  GO AWAY TROLL!

AA10729675	You have to answer honestly.  But you have to be clear, concise, and your English must be perfect.  It also has to concern you, and no one else.  If you want for instance a high paying career, you do not have to mention (for instance) that it is because you want to do better than your neighbors or to please Auntie Julia.  I think that you see what I mean.  The bottom line, however, is to show that you are ready to contribute to their program, and to society at large.  This is important because we all know that if we work just for the money, we get just that: the money.  But if we work to contribute, then we do have a career and real interaction.  This in turn hopefully leads to progress for all.
mVR5WmDoaa	yup, white, red and blue. just like the US.|`|kamZAhTwaa	ok found a better answer than before<br>  <br>  The Union Jack is made up of the Crosses of St. George (representing England), St. Andrew (Scotland), and St. Patrick (Northern Ireland). St. George's and St. Andrew's were ordered amalgamated by James I for use by His Majesty's subjects at sea in 1606, though the exact design was never fixed. St. Patrick's, a red saltire on white, was added and the design was finally standardized in 1801. Wales is a Principality and is therefore not represented on the flag.
AA10176626	babbyt:<br>  <br>  Honestly? No. You will not find a loan from a legitimate lender unless you can either qualify on your own, or provide a highly creditworthy cosigner.<br>  <br>  This is how the whole worldwide banking and lending crisis got started - banks abandoned their usual caution, and starting lending money to just about anyone who asked nicely. Fast forward a few years, and the banks have seen a ton of those loans go bad, and every single bank has scurried back to its old-fashioned, ultraconservative lending practices.<br>  <br>  When you apply for a loan, the bank verifies that you have the income to repay the loan. I presume that you're not working now, and if you are, you're working a part-time job that earns you a few hundred dollars a month.<br>  <br>  The bank also verifies your credit. Your credit history is like letters of reference - other creditors tell the bank if you've been good about paying back loans in the past. If you have established a solid track record of borrowing and repaying, the lender feels confident that you'll pay this loan back too. If you have established poor credit, that tells the bank that you're not a responsible borrower. If you have little or no credit, the bank has nothing to go by, and that's not much better than poor credit, as far as the bank is concerned.<br>  <br>  If you have neither income nor credit, you are asking the bank to trust you with thousands of dollars in exchange for nothing but a smile and a promise. They won't do that anymore. Any bank that lends you money is gambling that you'll actually finish school, get a good job (hard enough to do in this economy), not rack up too many other bills, and pay them back. That's just too risky.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong - I feel badly for you, but you need to recognize that banking is a business. A stranger on the street won't lend you $10,000 because you swear you'll pay it back in 10 years, and neither will a bank. Unless you have income and credit, you're nothing more than a stranger to the lender, and they'll treat you the same way that you would treat any stranger who asked YOU for a $10,000 loan.<br>  <br>  My only question relates to your statement that you can't get money from the federal student aid program. EVERY student is eligible for a Stafford loan, unless you have defaulted in previous Stafford loans, you're not a citizen or eligible non-citizen, or you have certain drug or sex offense convictions. The Stafford loan is approved without the need for income or credit - which is what makes the Stafford loan so valuable. You should be eligible to borrow from $5500 to $7500, depending on what year of college you're in. If that's not sufficient for you, I can't think of anything else to recommend.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you - I hope you get this resolved.|`|AA11635897	no, it's not possible

82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	Depends on your principal. My principal usually asks what to look out for.<br>  <br>  Some things:<br>  Are you keeping the students engaged and on task?<br>  Can you discipline properly without disrupting the entire class?<br>  Are you calling on all students or just a few?<br>  Is your lesson creative?<br>  Are you speaking clearly so that your students can understand?|`|vYNOotEMaa	Well, if it's your seventh time, review past evaluations.  Look for what was reported as "weaknesses", and be sure you have improved in those areas.<br>  <br>  I know it's a pain to have to be extra prepared, and be observed. Some places are using video cameras, that's real pressure.  Then, you have to look at yourself on video, and an administrator points out things you do that annoyed him/her.<br>  <br>  But, overall, it's how you interact with the students, and how attentive you can keep them. Working with some age groups are easier than others.<br>  <br>  Be sure you have lesson plans typed out, stick with them, and keep students active.  <br>  <br>  Always encourage them to ask questions, and if students are silent, ask them to respond, or recite out loud.<br>  Do a review of lesson, and go over your goals for each lesson.<br>  <br>  Administrators like to be able to point out that you had goals for that day, and you met them.<br>  <br>  Some sort of evaluation should be planned, if not oral questions to the students for feedback, then a quick 10 pt test, and have them exchange papers to grade.<br>  <br>  Then, check answers in class.<br>  Have students hold up hands to answer questions, and also, find out how many had perfect scores that day.<br>  <br>  That increases feedback to evaluator, that you reached goals, and students actually learned something that is measurable.<br>  Good luck.|`|AA11043457	I sure understand your concern.  I used to represent teachers and we wrote responses to evaluations at times.  Some observers are fair and some aren't.  <br>  <br>  So I don't want to psych you out even more. \\<br>  <br>   Know your material.<br>  <br>  Pay attention to class discipline so kids are paying attention or you deal with it quickly without getting the class off the subject.  Lack of discipline is a big issue for new teachers.<br>  <br>  Stick to your lesson plan though you can use comments to teach more, but don't get off the lesson plan basics.<br>  <br>  Spend a few minutes before end of class for assignment, but better to put it on the board and have them write it down even before class.  A lot depends on the grade level you teach.  Can have a copy of assignemnt to hand out or for them to take as they leave.  Just have to assign the work for next class and homework without taking too much of the class time.  <br>  <br>  If you have a problem with an observation, request to observe a veteran teacher who is considered to be excellent.  If you feel it was inaccurate, if you have a union, talk to the union rep to see about responding to the evaluation.  By not responding to negatives, it looks as though you agree with it.  Hope this is not an issue for you at all.<br>  <br>  Doesn't have anything to do with eval. but one way to be successful is to use "Success Cards" and write a note to a kid's parent to let them know of something their kid did well in school that day.  When parents know you care about their kid and that you notice the good things, they'll listen a bit better when something bad comes up.  You will have the parents' support many times in many ways.  It can be done with simple cards. If you have a union, see if they have them.  NEA does have them.  Otherwise prepare yours on computer and print on light cardstock. Put in a #10 envelope and mail home to parents - don't give to the kid to give to the parent.  By sending it home, the kid gets surprised by the parent being all happy with them because the teacher said they did well on something and kid may act like they don't like it, but they do and you get more cooperation for the kid as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|K5uoaetaaa	Not calling the children retards!

I would work on improving those areas of concern. I am sure you know exactly what to do if this is your seventh time. Keep your students engaged in the learning process. Don't forget to close your lesson. Those are a few of things that I would be aware of. I think the most important thing to do is to take a deep breath, and relax. I have taught for 6 years, and I still get nervous when I see my administrator coming into my room. Its not as bad as what it use to be, but I do understand what you mean. Relax.

SATTX6egaa	Check out virtual schools. I go to one and I do basically everything by myself. You have teachers that you can email if you have questions. Everything you need is laid out for you and most of the time they send you a computer to use. In my case, a Mac laptop. My parents both work and I do everything by myself. Occasionally I email teachers for help. It's great and I'm getting good grades.<br>  <br>  Edit: Actually, two of the three schools steph mentioned above I've gone to. I went to Connections Academy for two years and started IQ Academy this year.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you are stressed out about the people around you at school ,homeschooling will probably be better. But if you are having trouble actually learning because of the way it is being taught, then I'm not sure. It depends on a lot.|`|oZ39bLSkaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  The short answer is of course you can teach yourself. You have gotten some valid answers here with things you should consider.<br>  <br>  I would just like to add that studying on your own is tough. it takes an incredible amount of motivation and discipline. If no one is there to make you get up or ask you why  you did not do your assignment, the only thing making you do it is yourself. This can be tough for even the most well intentioned person. Between distractions and discouragements, things could fall apart. I do not say this to discourage you, just to be smart about how you go about setting up a home school situation.<br>  You would do well to set one up where you have accountability,either through online classes or a daily/weekly accounting to your parents, something.<br>  <br>  All the best as you pursue the best education option.|`|Z5g7hCXraa	How do you feel about answers that all start with the big word IF?<br>  <br>  You can, IF<br>  <br>  --you meet state requirements<br>  --your parents allow it<br>  --you are diligent, responsible, and hardworking (wait a minute, if you are then you'll succeed at anything!)<br>  --you are old enough to be alone all day.<br>  <br>  Possible solutions:<br>  --go to a grandparent's or other family member's house for the daytime when your parents are working, and do your schoolwork there, under adult supervision.  <br>  --talk to teachers at school and work out a solution with them<br>  --discuss this with your parents (this is most important.  Be respectful if you want them to hear you out)<br>  <br>  There are online schools and courses on dvd, or programs that are all text and/or workbooks.  There are many ways to learn.  Look around and ask questions before deciding.  Also, remember that there will likely be some expense for your parents, but your school work shouldn't take as long as a public school day, so you could possibly help by getting a job IF you're old enough and all those other IFs.<br>  <br>  Just talk to your parents, pastor, and teachers, and let them walk you through this.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|NxiLcBlTaa	I was home schooled up until high school and my mom worked through most of it, so I basically homeschooled myself.

k6bUrwcKaa	Dana, did you not have anything at home from your class? You should have asked me for help, I know A LOT about that from my class. Did you get a C+ on it? You know, all three religions believe in the same god. They call it by three different names: Christians, God, Jews, Yahweh, Muslims, Allah. You did repeat yourself a lot, but I understand why. You probably should have explained a little more about the differences, and you could have even gone farther than three. I think you know that the Jews believe in the first part of the bible, but they do not believe Jesus was the savior, or founder, Messiah, w/e. They also all have a religious leader, like a priest, , Rabbi, and a Mullah. Christians and Muslims have more religious leaders, but you get the point.

VtRbZiy1aa	first of all you have to realize if that i what you want to do. studying medicine is very hard and tedious work and if you don't want to have a career related to medicine then I suggest not to go for it. You go to college or university to study medicine and realize that it is not your thing, then you just waste around a few thousand dollars to study in post secondary education.<br>  <br>  if you really want to study medicine but need motivation, then find out the sector of medicine you want to study. Do you want to study pharmaceuticals? you want to become a surgeon? family doctor? also think about why you want to study it. IS there someone sick that you want to cure? is it your dream to become one? do you want to earn good money? think about those. <br>  <br>  spend a few more years studying and you can live the rest of your life happier|`|Rf2r23sYaa	If you have to "motivate yourself" then it's not your calling.

b1VOBcikaa	The president of Brazil's Central Bank said Monday that the Brazilian economy will suffer from the international financial crisis but still would grow more than the 2-percent average projected globally for 2009. <br>  "Brazil will undergo a deceleration in the credit next year, which will produce a general deceleration of the economy, but in a much lower pace than many countries," Henrique Meirelles said during a meeting of the Sao Paulo Industries Federation. <br>  <br>  Meirelles said the Brazilian Central Bank already has spent 176billion reais (77 billion U.S. dollars) to battle the impact of the crisis -- 106 billion reais (46 billion dollars) to increase market liquidity and 70 billion reais (31 billion dollars) to reestablish credit in other sectors of the economy. <br>  <br>  The central bank still has more than 200 billion dollars in foreign reserves, Meirelles said. <br>  <br>  That's what I found about the brizilian economics this year xD<br>  I also know that brazil is famous with coffee and suger, so maybe you can open up a suger factory, =]<br>  at least I tried :)
0aJlEmIxaa	In the first stage, the students, the young people are educated, are given opportunity for expansion in their ideas. <br>  <br>  In the second stage, the forces which inhibit intellectual freedom are fought.<br>  <br>   In the third stage those forces inhibiting spiritual freedom are fought and<br>  <br>   in the fourth stage, the general attitude or prevalent ideas dominating the society are challenged so that those that are true in their path speak out openly, not only against direct suppression but against faulty concepts and faulty practices which have maintained the corruption or degeneration. <br>  <br>  And in the fifth stage, the same is done for all the practices which have suppressed the spiritual, mental and physical upliftment of ordinary people. The true Dharma of human beings is fought for in all spheres in the fifth stage.<br>  <br>   In the sixth stage, the leadership of the society is altered and by the very momentum which has already been built, there becomes a readiness within the society for new leadership. The people cry out for it, the intellectual stage is set, the all-around society has evolved and can no longer tolerate old practices, old ideas which are degenerative, and thus new leadership is forced to come to power which reflects the new ideas, the new thinking, the feelings and attitudes of the people which have been restored through intellectual freedom, education and spiritual discipline to a healthy state. At this point, the corruption in leadership will no longer be tolerated, and new leaders will rise reflecting the thoughts of the people. Then when this occurs, this new order must be established and an ever vigilant fight maintained to preserve Dharma and dislodge corruption, delusion, and policies reflecting the greed and avarice of leaders. <br>  <br>  In the seventh stage, through this vigilance, a healthy society may be maintained for many years without loss of balance between all of the factors in the society and the true nature of human life. In this way, through a systematic approach, a society may be changed and an unhealthy degenerating culture brought back to health and life.

The biggest thing is your self confidence, honey you have to have self confidence and people will flock to you no matter your weight.

You're far too young to be doing diets on your own -- it's unhealthy on SO many levels. Most will help you lose weight fast right now...but wait five years until your metabolism sucks from all the crash diets and you end up weighing triple whatever you're at now. I've watched that happen quite a bit. ;)<br>  <br>  You're young -- you have A LOT of growing to do. Don't screw up your health right now for a quick solution.  Get on a meal plan that still gives you all that you need -- and only someone with experience with you can plan that for you - everyone's needs are different. Talk to the doctor.|`|BUFgf2S2aa	Exercise with good eating habits will be your best bet.  It seems like a slow process, but once you've achieved your goals, you'll see how quickly the time went by.  I wouldn't do the Atkins diet until you have been checked out by a doctor.  I did it and had a lot of health related problems afterward.  If you just portion control, and stay away from breads and junk food as much as possible, you'll do better than most.  Drinking 8 glasses of water a day actually does help, as weird as that sounds.  And exercising can be a drag, and once you stop it's a really hard habit to start up again.  If you would add walking (fast paced) to your daily routine (start with 10 minutes a day for a week, and then up it 5-10 minutes every week thereafter) you'll do great, it'll build muscle, burn fat and tighten up your ab area as well (if you practice proper posture and are actually speed walking).  The idea is to increase steadily so that your body demands itself to burn the energy and not to get used to a certain level of inactivity.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Med8LbTcaa	I'm sorry to say, the Atkin's diet will not help your problem. Atkin's himself died of heart disease and obesity. Protein rich foods like meat, cheese, bread, etc they all produce toxins in your body which contribute to weight gain. Many people on here are very eager to contradict that. You need to focus on eating cleansing foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. While most people would agree that eating fruits and vegetables is a healthy thing to do, you don't eat 5 servings of fruit a day. That's ridiculous. Here's the regime that has worked for the seven different people I know who had weight problems: <br>  <br>  Eat as much fresh fruit each day as you can, and go low on the bread, grains, meat, cheese, and other heavy foods. This is the crucial part that allows your body to cleanse and rejuvenate itself, allowing for weight loss. Taking a probiotic and enzyme supplements seem to assist in weight loss as well, and if you can get them, it would maximize the benefits. <br>  <br>  Also, exercise is important, but not as important as diet. This might be hard to believe, but many people find it difficult to exercise because they are so toxic. After you clean your body out, you will find increased energy to exercise. You don't have to exercise in any special way; walking outside for a half hour a day and increasing the time slowly is a great way to build up on exercise. Of course, drinking plenty of water helps too.<br>  <br>  I guarantee you will lose weight fast on this kind of diet and regime. After you lose weight, slowly introduce green vegetables and small amounts of bread and foods like this. But staying away from meat is a necessity to maintaining good health. Good luck!|`|c6zBPGooaa	Why did you stop exercising? Exercising is an important factor when it comes to losing body fat.<br>  <br>  The only failure is accepting failure and giving up.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to bother typing several long paragraphs but briefly say:<br>  <br>  -Balanced meals. Split your meals into 5-6 smaller meals and have each every 3-4 hours. Your metabolic rate will be up to speed.<br>  <br>  -Remove starch, sugar, white bread/rice/etc, saturated and trans fat from your eating plan.<br>  <br>  -Drink a lot of water and calorie-free liquids like unsweetened tea.<br>  <br>  -Cardio. At least 4 times a week and weight lifting. Believe it or not; a woman does NOT get bulkier if she has muscle. She gets a nice, sexy shape and smaller. Lift weights at least 3 times a week. (Make sure to not lift weights that your body cannot lift.)<br>  <br>  -There is NO such thing as spot reducing. It's a myth. You lose body fat in all places first. If you want a flat stomach lose your percentage of body fat and get some muscle.<br>  <br>  -Gain muscle.<br>  <br>  -Depending on your height and body weight, have at least 250 calories less than your ideal everyday calorie intake.<br>  <br>  -Only have a snack if you're hungry. Stop eating when you're full.<br>  <br>  -PATIENCE. <br>  <br>  -Remove non-nutritional trash like potato chips, candy, etc. Have some vegetables or a fruit instead.<br>  <br>  -You should have lean protein, vegetables, at least one fruit and whole wheat in your meals. Very important.|`|uOTD3qwZaa	Just exercise constantly, don't eat lots of fast food, or greasey food. Also don't eat past your filling point. Eat until your stuff if you eat when your not hungry it's packing on unwanted calories you don't need.

8LyR0efpaa	I'll help you with the ones I know.  A "topic sentence" comes at the beginning of a paragraph, and tells what the whole paragraph is going to be about.  For example, suppose you are writing an essay about dangerous animals.  One of your paragraphs might begin with something like "One of the most dangerous animals in the world is the Siberian Tiger."  That's a topic sentence.  Everything else in that paragraph must be about Siberian Tigers and what it is that makes them dangerous.  An "adverb clause" is a group of words which contains a subject and verb, but is part of a larger sentence, and tells how or when something was done.  For example, "After Wanda baked the cookies, she ate every one of them," contains the adverb clause "After ...cookies," which tells when the eating took place.  A "transition" is a word or sentence which connects two ideas in an essay.  For example, "Snakes are very dangerous animals.  Therefore, it is not wise to put your hand in their mouths."  The word "therefore" is a transition, showing that the two ideas are connected by "situation/result" relationships.  As for the remaining matters, I have no idea because there isn't sufficient information.  I would think it is obvious what an explanation is.  A statement is any sentence which is not a command or a question, but I do not think that is what your teacher is looking for.  I also have no idea what is meant by "follow up sentence," and I teach English for a living!

hmOXtGTwaa	There is a difference between "ignorant" and "stupid". There is an anti-intellectual current in America, and there is an issue with a short attention span, so few watch or listen to in-depth reporting or read newspapers with long stories. Moreover, the younger generation is more into enjoying today, and less interested in politics, history, or other things that you would think the average person should know. They say, "Why do I need to know it.? It doesn't interest me." I have been asked if Bangkok is near Thailand; is that stupidity, or ignorance and a lack of interest in geography?

I don't think so.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Expanding Universe<br>  The Friedmann equation relates various cosmological parameters within the context of Einstein’s general relativity. Alexander Friedmann derived them in 1922. This famous equation states that the energy of expansion is proportional to the sum of matter energy, cosmological (vacuum) energy and curvature energy. <br>  As stated before, the model proposes three different types of space-time curvature for the universe: positive, zero or negative curvature: <br>  A closed universe is one where the space-time curvature is positive, somewhat like the surface of a sphere. It will first expand, then reverse the expansion and contract back to a singularity. A flat universe has zero curvature, somewhat like a tabletop. It will expand forever, but at a rate that eventually approaches zero. An open universe is one with negative space-time curvature, which can be more or less described by the form of a saddle (in three dimensions, where space-time has four). Such a universe will expand forever with a rate that will eventually approach some positive constant value. <br>  There is in fact a fourth possibility, where the expansion rate will first decline, then become more or less constant for a while and then increase ad infinitum. The cosmological constant can, if nonzero, give rise to this situation. This is what present observations tell us about the real universe. <br>  The attached pdf document gives an engineering overview of what this model “tells” us.

You can't allow a youtube video to sum up the intelligence of an entire country.  It would be ridiculous to say that a silly video like this one represents all Americans. There are stupid people like this in the world, but you have to keep in mind that sweeping generalizations like this are unfair and are not a true representation of all people. It is an unfair stereotype of the American public. Just because a statement may describe some of the people, does not mean that it describes all of the people.

AA11604732	There is a line in THE RAZOR'S EDGE that goes "It is easy to be a saint on the top of a mountain."  <br>  <br>  you need to ask yourself the question:  Do you want to go to a bad college where it will be easy to "have a relationship with God" or do you want to go to a good college, where you might have to work to have a relationship with God?<br>  <br>  Love -- whether it is with a human or a God, takes work and is worth little without it.  Going to a bad school where you don't challenge yourself doesn't help you become a better Christian.  It helps you become a robot.  Does your God want robots in Heaven?<br>  <br>  There are actually lots of Christian colleges that are very good academically.  Most of them ar Catholic -- which may be a problem for you.  But think about schools like Boston College, Holy Cross, Fordham, Georgetown and Villanova.  They can offer you a Christian environment and a good education.

8LyR0efpaa	As a Texan, you already know how important Spanish is, and you are wise to realize that it will only become more so.  An exclusive major in Spanish might, however, limit your choices.  You will be able to teach Spanish itself, of course, and ESL to Spanish speaking people.  You would also be eligible for positions requiring ability to use both Spanish and English, provided you have whatever other qualifications are necessary.  But it is those "other" qualifications which you might want to think about.  Before you change your major, talk to someone in the counseling department and find out what your choices really are.  The counselors have experience with the job market and the necessary training, and they will be able to tell you if you are headed in the right direction.|`|p8otQ2vuaa	if you are going to a spanish speaking land its okay to have it as a major. and then you can go study math, science, and writing.|`|gTA72yY4aa	maybe you should major in something like nursing and minor in spanish.<br>  <br>  i dont think spanish is a very promising major|`|yloXePoPaa	You could do translating for lots of different companies in Spanish or medical assisstants with a spanish degree but i think its best to have it with something else. especially since teh economy and job market have gone to hell right now we need better skills.|`|1IAlxzzzaa	ahaha community college? no wonder youre majoring in spanish
AA10176626	The FAFSA rules are very clear in situations where an applicant's parents are divorced or separated.<br>  <br>  Under the most common circumstance, an applicant must provide financial information for the parent they lived with the most in 2008.<br>  <br>  If you lived with your mom and your dad for exactly the same amount of time in 2008 - and living with neither certainly qualifies for that - then you are required to provide the financial information for the parent who provided you with the greatest amount of financial support in 2008.<br>  <br>  There is a common fallacy that tax return dependency and financial aid dependency are somehow linked - but these are two entirely different uses of the same word. It does not matter whether your mother claimed you as a dependent, whether your father claimed you as a dependent, or whether neither parent claimed you as a dependent. Anyone, or no one, can claim you as a dependent, and this has no effect on how you are required to complete your FAFSA application.<br>  <br>  You (and anyone else reading this) should absolutely ignore the respondents who always pop up on this type of question, advising the questioner to "put down the parent who has less money, because you'll get more for financial aid that way". The FAFSA rules specify which parent must be included - the rules do not give applicants a choice.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.

AA10176626	Beeswax:<br>  <br>  Do you want the honest answer, or the "everything's possible when you dare to dream" answer? I can give you either one, but I would prefer to give you the honest one.<br>  <br>  Almost every state in the country (Minnesota is one of the very rare exceptions) charges non-state residents a lot more money to attend state universities than they charge students whose parents are legal residents of that state. States do this because the state residents subsidize the cost of university education through the taxes they pay every year.<br>  <br>  Some states charge considerably more - and California is about the 'worst' of them all. If you've been reading the paper lately, you may have heard that California is suffering from an overwhelming budget crisis - this has actually been going on for quite a while. <br>  <br>  One way the legislature has been trying to increase the amount of revenues that the state takes in is to ratchet up the costs for non-resident students who wish to attend a California state university.<br>  <br>  Non-residents pay $339 a credit hour more than residents do - in other words, non-California residents pay $1017 more for EVERY 3-credit course they take. Multiply that by 4 years of coursework, and you'll pay $40,000 more for the same degree as your state resident classmates.<br>  <br>  The ONLY possible source of that kind of money is scholarships, either from the school, or from private scholarship organizations.. When you say that your grades aren't as "high as they could be", that has me a little worried about whether you would qualify for significant scholarships.<br>  <br>  One source that will not help you make up the difference between a California school and a Michigan school is federal student aid. Federal aid, which IS the largest source of financial aid for most students, is not particularly tied to the cost of your school, and it's not intended to enable students to attend their dream school. Federal aid is intended to help young men and women afford a college education. You don't get rewarded with more money if you choose a pricey, out-of-town school.<br>  <br>  I very much understand your dream - California beckons to many people - for many reasons. Unfortunately, however, reality tends to rear its ugly head sometimes, and this is one of those times. There is actually very little justification for paying tens of thousands of dollars more for the same education in California that is readily available to you at state universities all over your home state of Michigan.<br>  <br>  Students from families with enough money to ignore the difference in cost are free to make that expensive choice, but if money is an issue for you, and your grades are not extraordinary, you will have a near impossible challenge to overcome.<br>  <br>  I sincerely wish you the very best of luck.
8LyR0efpaa	Using grammar correctly is like driving a car.  Three things are involved.  First, you have to recognize the traffic signals when you see them.  In grammar terms, you have to know when a word signals that something is going to happen later down the road.  You cannot write "he don't knows nothing" because signals tell you a)"Beginning of sentence -- capitalize!!" b) "He" is third person singular, so it's "doesn't." c) Verbs like "do," "can," "will," and many others are followed by base verb forms, so you can't put an "s" on the end of "know," and d) The sentence has a negative already, so "nothing" is incorrect."  In each of these cases, we look at the word and recognize that it has a message about what should happen later.  Second, you have to understand what you are expected to do, once you recognize the signal.  (That's where the books and software come in.)  Third, you have to do what is expected.  If you see a "stop" sign, know what it means and what you should do, but you don't do it, then you are no better off than if you had never seen the sign in the first place.  Some books which are helpful are "Practically Painless English" by Sally F. Wallace, and "The Least You Should Know about English" by Teresa Glazier.  They are old, and rely on a lot of practice exercises (with answers), but they do the job.|`|sJZXhPxyaa	just read more. books and magazines work just fine. or, when you're watching tv or movies, pay special attention to language and write down words/grammar stuff that is new to you.
AA11043457	Fantastic idea.  You have no idea how a teacher will appreciate little notes of appreciation.  But what would also be really nice is to write a letter and send a copy to the principal.  Then it may get put in the teacher's file in the office and itis there if someone else looks and the principal knows the teacher is doing a good job.<br>  <br>  As to the letter, instead of saying, "I've decided..." Just start with the Thank you. like:<br>  <br>  Thank you so much for your help this quarter (or whatever term is). You are an excellent teacher and have inspired me to continue learning with an open and positive mind. I appreciate all your work, it’s meant so much to me.

i5tOQGgFaa	Definately look at this as a learning opportunity but don't let them allow it for a long period of time, because you are right, it's not in your job description and you aren't getting paid for it.<br>  <br>  Planning directly corresponds with your class curriculum.  This is something you may need to discuss with you boss and possibly get the past lesson planning pages so you know where the teacher left off.  If they do not have a curriculum, which sadly is the case is situations like this, then think in general what the children need to be taught.  I'm going to assume that this is for preschoolers and therefor will respond accordingly.  A toddler curriculum will vary.  Please keep in mind that this is general information.<br>  In a childcare/preschool class we normally see a schedule similar to the following:<br>  *  Free Play (centers-dramatic play, fine motor, games/manipulatives, art, etc) or your chosen arrival routine.<br>  *  Morning Gathering- story/fingerplays/day's info introduced/calendar etc/this is sometimes called Large Group.<br>  *  Small Group:  class seperated into 3 groups with a different activity at each group and rotated.<br>  *  Outdoors/Large Motor<br>  * Free Play again for an extended amount of time.<br>  *  lunch<br>  * bathrooms/nap<br>  * large group-story<br>  * snack<br>  * outdoors/large motor<br>  * free play.  Some do another "small group" during this time.<br>  <br>  Now I would recommend you make your lesson plans according to your classroom routine.  Themes are your easiest choice.  You'll find more ideas this way.  Your play centers should have some connection to your theme.  Your large and small group activities should as well.  If you search your chosen theme for the week (or two weeks) and add preschool, on an internet search,  you will come up with an abundance of ideas.  If you have some theme ideas I'd be glad to send you some of my list of activities that I do at this age...but I wouldn't have enough characters to do it right now :-)  Feel free to email!|`|FkGh0LuWaa	Google preschool themes and a bunch will come up along with some activity ideas.|`|d162f121edc74fbff5dcd0d3373d75e6aa	Try this site - it has educational interactive and printable resources across the board and the themes are widely used .|`|AHHAGxlCaa	you havn't said the ages of the children<br>  <br>  I would google some eduacational sites|`|AA10380382	You could go to the ccnet site. my work uses it.

Of course, I had to move to Maryland for my first job. Teachers aren't paid well in MD, so you can usually pick up a job down there for a year or two, then move back with experience. (Unless you're married to a lawyer, nobody above 28 years old or so teaches in Maryland)|`|7uedTD6Iaa	First of all, I teach in MD.  And we are paid just fine.  The pay differs between counties.  The northern counties (the ones closest to PA) are paid the least because they are considered to be very rural areas.  Of course we are not rich, and I believe the average pay of MD counties is less than that of PA, but in the grand scheme of teacher pay--I'm happy with what I make.  And of course people who are over 28 teach.  The person who said that has no idea what he/she is talking about.  <br>  <br>  Depending on where you are in PA, teaching in a bordering state may be an option for you.  I have also heard that getting jobs in PA are very difficult.  I work with 2 women who moved from PA because of the tough job market and used to be roommates with a former PA teacher.  She told me that when she worked there it was so hard for people to get jobs there and her coworkers thought she was crazy for leaving because she'd have a hard time getting back into the system if she wanted to return.  <br>  <br>  I haven't heard of people having much success with on-line job sites, not to say that they aren't useful.  What I've seen as the most successful job seeking tactic is to apply directly to the districts you want to work in.  Most districts have an on-line application process.  If you haven't heard anything after applying, call the HR department at that district's board of education.  Many districts also sponsor job fairs.  Find out when and where these are and attend them.  You can find out by calling the HR department.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|5q7uPqVmaa	I don't know that you need to tie yourself to a teaching job websites.

AA11604732	To get into an Ivy League school, you will need an unweighted GPA of 3.8+, lots of AP and Honors classes, SAT scores in the 2200+ range (out of 2400) lots of extracurricular activities and a killer admissions essay.<br>  <br>  Extracurriculars are easy to pad & hard to verify, so they don't count nearly as much as many people think.  Quality is more important than quality -- and it will mean more if it is easily verified.<br>  <br>  Since the top schools reject more qualified applicants than they accept, the admissions essay is an important tool for making yourself stand out.  Spend a lot of time on it.|`|bVJSlo3Raa	Why? You can get an awesome education at a non-ivy leagure school why do you want to attend one? the prestige because I will be honest that is what most of attending one is about however an ivy league school is not the best school if you are wanting to do a degree in science or maths you need to think what you want to do before you decide on a university|`|SDSmotQiaa	1. How can you stand out? No, you don't have to find a cure for cancer (although it wouldn't hurt lol). You should show that you are passionate about something. It doesn't really matter what, as long as you are passionate about it, and show it through your activities, essay, whatever. <br>  2. The SATs are pretty important for Ivy League schools. You're going to need a score in teh 2200 + range (preferably 2300 +) which I think is ridiculous, but schools like Harvard and Yale want this. This is not to say that someone with a 2150 would have their application automatically tossed in the rejection pile, but if you have something like a 1850, forget it. The most important thing is probably your grades and SAT scores, but extracurriculars are important too. Also, the essay and teacher recommendations.<br>  <br>  I'd like to add that you should know that very qualified, talented people get rejected from Ivies, so you should be realistic. Make sure you apply to safety schools and good match schools. Ivies are reaches for basically everyone because they are so competitive. And, I know you don't want to hear this, but Ivies are NOT the best schools. They are fantastic institutions, but there are so many just as good (and some may argue better) universities and colleges out there. Seriously, know this, and be realistic. I wish you good luck.

bCi8BCBBaa	Your question is pretty complex.  <br>  <br>  The French Revolution of 1789 set the stage for resistance to colonial rule in Latin America.  It overturned the monarchy and special privileges for the ruling classes (the monarchy and the church).   It was inspired by the Enlightenment principles of citizenship and rights for individuals, written about by Voltair, Rousseau and others. Of course three sentences won't explain it.  The Napoleonic wars and two more revolutions with the reinstatement of the monarchy took place before France's political structure took its modern form. <br>  <br>  Simone Bolivar was a Venezuelan creole who went to France to study and became an admirer of the principles of the French Revolution.  He brought back with him the ideals of the revolutionaries.  He is considered key to Latin American liberation from colonial rule. <br>  <br>  Here is a chart of revolutions after 1790.

QebfMqdMaa	I agree with the above answer. Most colleges--and I'm speaking very generally here--look at a combination of your grades and classes. When I was in high school, lots of people took super easy classes (Home Ec., Interior Design, etc) and got A's and B's, while others took harder classes (AP and Honors) and got low A's and Bs but they got into better schools than the 'easy A' kids.<br>  <br>  Why? Colleges aren't stupid. They know that 'easy' classes don't challenge students and that a B in Honors or AP math/science/English, etc is worth more than someone who got straight A's in a cooking class or drawing courses.<br>  <br>  So, don't take classes that are too hard just to look good to colleges--I tried that senior year and hated it, BUT be sure to challenge yourself and go for classes that you actually have to work in. This tells colleges that you're willing to work hard and are smart/mature enough to handle college classes, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|rWLEftUPaa	you should take harder classes AND get good grades.but i would take ALL honors and AP i am a jr in hs and doin that right now.its not that hard as long as u study.and college like to know u took hard classes and tried.scholorships look at hard classes.plus if ur takin all regualar classes u prob will not be ready for college anyways.|`|AQcYUDfzaa	BOTH!|`|AA11635897	it would look better to get a higher grade in an easier class, but if you can get As in advanced classes, go for them.|`|2EIH11m8aa	You should take classes that are challenging for you but you will get a good grade in as well.  They look at your unweighted and weighted GPA's which are calculated by finding out grades and how difficult your classes are, so both are important but i don't know if i could say one is more important then the other.  Scholarships could look at what classes you take but the odds are they will just look a certain GPA and then focus more on extra curricular activities and things like that.|`|hEFthejvaa	higher grades are definitely more beneficial. i learned until my senior year from an advisor that i didn't need to take ap classes in order to impress colleges. if my gpa was substantially high, that's good enough (but of course you need a good SAT score).<br>  i was pissed. i had a 3.4 GPA with all AP classes but i could have easily gotten a 4.0 if i didn't take any of those classes.<br>  <br>  but depending on what you want to major it's highly recommended that you take classes similar to your major (but they don't have to be AP). for example my major is engineering, which is why i took a lot of science & math classes.

AA11604732	I'm confused by your question.  Are you asking about Western Ontario or about MIT (in Cambridge, MA)?<br>  <br>  If you want to know about MIT, then your grades are way too low to get in.<br>  <br>  As for the University of Western Ontario, the average HS GPA is 85.1  It looks like you are close to the average of those accepted -- so you have a decent chance.|`|gS69btMpaa	MIT would be 16's SATs and 3.80 plus GPA even before they look at your app,also strong Math and Chemistry....

AA11604732	To become an attorney, you will have to go to law school.  That is done after you get a college degree.  They do not look at your HS grades or your ACT course.

(And no, I'm not even Catholic).<br>  <br>  Considering what you're good at and your interests, I, too, would suggest majors in the liberal arts--history, English, creative writing. Since you're good at public speaking, you might want to think about Communications (which could lead you to a career in print or broadcast journalism).<br>  <br>  There's also sociology and psychology, but that involves both science and math, so maybe not.<br>  <br>  I majored in English Literature and loved every minute of it. With that, you could go into publishing, editing, teaching or even marketing (although you have to be extroverted for marketing, IMO).<br>  <br>  So, yeah: small school with a liberal arts degree. One of the schools I absolutely fell in love with was Hope College in Holland, Michigan.

AA11071040	Each state has at least one sanctioning organization for public schools. In many states a separate organization governs interscholastic athletics at most private schools. Each sanctioning body divides its member schools up into anywhere from two to eight size classifications based on enrollment and then each classification is further divided into geographic regions. The size classifications are arranged from 'A'/'1A' (the smallest) to 'AAAAAAAA'/'8A' (the largest), though the nomenclature and number of size divisions vary from state to state. A school's size classification will change if its enrollment rises or declines over the years. At the smallest schools, particularly in rural communities or smaller private schools, variations on the game using six, eight, or nine players per side instead of the traditional eleven (or twelve in Canada) are encountered.

iEExVH1eaa	Early childhood education, or ECE, is very different from elementary school teaching. An aptitude for one doesn't necessarily lend itself to the other, nor does it preclude it.<br>  <br>  One of the main differences is the presence / absence of structure for each of these roles. While elementary education uses an established state / provincial curriculum, with some creative add-ins from the teacher, a daycare teacher and owner has to create her own daily structure, creative activities, and even snacks.<br>  <br>  An effective ECE teacher incorporates art, music, and movement in a number of different structured activities, while the school-based early curriculum is more word- and activity-structured, with somewhat less freedom to explore other disciplines. This difference becomes markedly greater the older the schoolchildren.<br>  <br>  While neither field is especially lucrative in and of itself, there are perks. If you are interested in continuing your education and getting into administration, you could move up the school ladder into a vice principal / princapal role. The more you educate yourself, the higher pay you can command in the public school system.<br>  <br>  Your daycare income will depend largely upon demand in your area as well as base rate. My wife moved from an area where the base pay for a certified ECE instructor was around $17 per hour to an area where $12 per hour was the standard, just by changing provinces. That said, you get some amazing tax benefits from running a home business. Working out of your home, however, you can get some excellent dollars depending upon your area. It is not uncommon to be able to charge between $400 and $700 per child per month.<br>  <br>  One drawback of the home business is that you are 100% liable for anything and everything that happens to those children in your home, and insurance can be expensive. You may also have to meet certain standards in your home: i.e. number of exits, rails on stairs, fenced yard, certified fire extinguishers, etc. Getting set up can be costly.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

QebfMqdMaa	I'm really just guessing here, but what I always thought was that the simple act of teaching at a college level made you a professor.<br>  <br>  Like, a high school teacher--who normally has a masters degree--is simply a "teacher" but if that same teacher decided to teach at a community college they became a "professor."<br>  <br>  I always assumed the "professor" title was there just to distinguish them from one another, if that makes sense.<br>  <br>  If someone has a PhD--at my former university--we referred to them as "Dr. So-and-so," but they're still a professor, they happen to have a higher-ranking academic title.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the professors at my college who only had their MA/MS, etc, were simply referred to as "Professor Blah-blah-blah." Or, as in most cases, by their first or last name.<br>  <br>  Most professors/doctors I had really weren't all that caught up on titles; most just told us to call them "Jane" or "Nick" or whatever. <br>  <br>  Weird, right? Imagine going through ALL of that schooling, getting those hard-earned letters after your name, and after all of that, your students just call you Jane. :)|`|hEFthejvaa	no only those with a Ph.D can be considered a professor. age doesn't matter but the degree gives you the name of "professor". some of my teachers are still young & i'm guessing some only have an MS. but surely they're still working to get higher degrees then they'll be called professors.<br>  <br>  either way, i call everyone teachers. i hate calling them professors b/c it makes look like they're better than us. most teachers really care about the proper education of students. but professors care more about the researches & writings they're doing in order to get awards & be highly recognized, instead of the students being taught properly.|`|x2mgUMb6aa	only a professor can truly be called a professor.|`|5nmvSXr4aa	I'm a student, so I can't give you the exact answer BUT: <br>  <br>  At Clemson only PhDs have the right to be called "Dr." and thus are the only people who are given the title of "Professor".  <br>  <br>  Professor is sort of a loose term - no one I know calls their instructors professor.  We either say "Dr. Smith" or address them by first name.<br>  <br>  The indicator is pretty obvious - most young teachers either don't (or don't yet) have their PhD, and they are usually more laid-back and ask us to call them by first name.  Most of my faculty (95% of Bio instructors) definitely have their PhD at least though.
QebfMqdMaa	When you apply to college, they ask for your most current transcript, up to the last term you've completed. However, they don't necessarily conclude that your senior year grades will be the exact same as the ones you had during fall quarter/trimester/semester.<br>  <br>  What happens is, they either let you in based on your overall grades and pay close attention to your most recent ones since those'll be the best reflection of your academic ability in college.<br>  <br>  After you're accepted, though, many colleges will tell you that your acceptance depends on whether or not you keeping getting the same grades that you had before. Basically, they're telling you not to get lazy now just because you got into college.<br>  <br>  After you graduate, they will go back and check your grades again--and if you just started slacking off at the end of senior year, many colleges will revoke your acceptance.<br>  <br>  (Believe me, it happens. A few years ago, the University of Washington made headlines because they started kicking people off their acceptance list because they let their grades slip at the end of senior year).<br>  <br>  So, just do your best and finish your senior year as strong as possible because even though it might not feel like it, all of your grades matter.|`|AA11579568	Whatever your GPA is when you request the transcript is what will show up. There is never an assumption of how well or poorly you will do. If you request transcripts after you graduate, the final GPA will reflect your entire senior year.

siQhjTkkaa	Hello<br>  <br>  As other answers suggest, there are alternative entry routes to university when you are a mature student so A levels are not essential at this stage.  It is particularly important that you have already had work experience in this area, not least because you have gained an insight into the job role.<br>  <br>  If you haven’t already done so, check out these sites: <a href="http://www.rcm.org.uk/," rel="nofollow">http://www.rcm.org.uk/,</a> the website for the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and <a href="http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/</a> for a further overview of the midwifery role and working conditions.  There are also contact details in case you have any queries.  <br>  <br>  Then, for a list of midwifery courses, have a look at the UCAS website at <a href="http://www.ucas.com/students/coursesearch/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucas.com/students/coursesearc...</a> - use the link to any course of interest for entry requirement details.  (N.B. Minimum requirements in literacy and numeracy are set by the Nursing & Midwifery Council (NMC), <a href="http://www.nmc-uk.org/)." rel="nofollow">http://www.nmc-uk.org/).</a>  Contact the faculty of any university of interest for further advice on entry requirements for mature students. You don’t say where you live or what age your little boy is, but if any universities near you offer the course, the admissions office or student services will have information about support facilities such as child-care or financial support available for your course.  <br>  For guidance on the UCAS application process, have a look at <a href="http://www.ucas.com/students/beforeyouapply/." rel="nofollow">http://www.ucas.com/students/beforeyouap...</a>  As a course interview is generally required, information on applications and interviews may be useful: see<br>  <a href="http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Applications__CVs_and_interviews/p!eefmd." rel="nofollow">http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/...</a><br>  <br>  If you’re unable to meet general entry requirements, you may wish to consider distance learning through the National Extension College - for information on relevant GCSE courses, see <a href="http://www.nec.ac.uk/courses/." rel="nofollow">http://www.nec.ac.uk/courses/.</a> <br>  <br>  The Open University course, K101, Understanding Health and Social Care, is often acceptable as an access course for mature students.  However, do contact any university of interest to check if this meets the entry requirements for that institution.  For K101 course details and information on financial support, see <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01K101" rel="nofollow">http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.d...</a> or contact your regional centre (see <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/organise/p3.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.open.ac.uk/about/organise/p3....</a> for contact details).

But I went straight from college and so that wasn't a problem for me...<br>  <br>  But on my course...I would say at least a 3rd are mature students. From talking to them it seems like they all did an access course in either health and social care or acess to nursing. <br>  <br>  Access course should take place at your local college..so you will need to do some research into which one...or the job centre can help do that for you.<br>  <br>  After you done yor acces course, you will need to start doing your UCAS form..the form which has to be completed in order to apply for universities. This will be done at www.UCAS.com<br>  <br>  I know that with midwifery universities do like people with life experience especially those who already have children. <br>  <br>  So from my point of view.. aslong as you do an access course you will be in for a very good chance<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck hunni xx|`|zK1V9Mu7aa	I am in the exact same position as you. You should check out the colleges in your area as they may do an 'Access to Higher Education' Course. In my area they do an 'Access to Nursing' Course. These courses are designed for mature students who would like to go to Uni but do not have the necessary qualifications to do so. The course is supposed to be very intense so you must be prepared to do alot of hard work. They are run over 1 year full time or 2 years part time usually,and will include the skills that will be needed to ensure you will be able to cope in Uni. You will also need to check out the Universities in your area to make sure they will recognise the course as a way to get on to their midwifery degrees.<br>  The only problem with an access course is that they are not recognised as qualifications, and so you have to definitely want to progress on to Uni otherwise your year doing the course will have been a waste.<br>  If you want to go the A level route that is also fine, because if you do decide not to go on to Uni at least then you have gained some A levels.<br>  I would definitely consider the Access Courses though, many Uni's do recognise them as a way into Uni and they show a students dedication and commitment, which they are looking for.<br>  Hope this has helped you.<br>  X|`|M7365DToaa	without qualifications there aren't many universities which will let you jump straight into a degree course. however, you may be able to take a foundation year (essentially equivalent to A level difficulty, to bring you up to scratch for your first year). if you pass this then they should be able to offer you a place on an actual degree course. contact universities directly for information on what foundation years they offer (as i'm not sure which would be applicable to midwifery, as i am a history student) Good luck and all the best|`|e00fc1c299d34a3d8c47805b7ceab0a4aa	As a mature student (mature at 24 i know!) you dont necessarily need qualifications as much as life experience. But you could always do a foundation year first which should give you a good grounding in writing essays and studying which youve probably got out of the habit of now.|`|X8fwBpsyaa	As a mature student you actually have a lot of options. Firstly I'd suggest contacting the university you're interested in studying with. Ask them what sort of qualifications they'd be looking for in a mature student. If you have some experience that should count in your favour. <br>  <br>  There are several routes into higher education, A levels is one of them. A lot of colleges will take mature students, and there are a lot of distance learning colleges that will also do them. Getting these might help not only with getting on the course you want but with self esteem and mean you have them to add to a CV. <br>  <br>  You could also try an access course (as another poster suggested), they can be very good, but do check to make sure the uni you want to go to recognises them. <br>  <br>  You could do a foundation degree. Most universities offer them, and they basically bring you up to scratch with university level work. Passing it means (in most cases) you can progress straight onto the full course.<br>  <br>  A lot of universities offer flexible foundation degrees, but if you need to keep working or have other commitments going into uni for your foundation degree may be difficult. You could try the Open University, they offer a wide rang of courses such as Certificates (these are the level up from A levels), diplomas, foundation degrees, full degrees and even masters and Phds. And you'd be able to do them from home (which might be cheaper as you'd be able to keep working). Check through their prospectus (<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/health-and-social-care/index.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergradua...</a> and see if there's anything that fits. Also check with the uni you're interested in as to whether or not they'd want that specific qualification. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you find the option that's right for you.

siQhjTkkaa	Hello<br>  Social workers are professionally qualified staff who must be registered with the appropriate regulatory body, in order to practice.

xfqHi1tRaa	AFS is one of the top three programs operating in the U.S. -- the other two are Rotary and YFU. Rotary is the cheapest, but most competitive.<br>  <br>  I would actually avoid Intrax -- they are linked to AYUSA and that organization has had many, many complaints. In fact, they cannot even place students in some schools in our area because they do not take good enough care of their students.<br>  <br>  I might suggest that you contact all three top programs. See which representatives you like, which program will offer you the better deal and where you want to go. You won't go wrong with any of them, but you are in the driver's seat! Some things that might help -- which one(s) have representatives in your area? Which one(s) place students at your school? These are the people who will work with you and your family for a very important year of your life. <br>  <br>  One of the  most important part of a program is the local reps --  that's why AFS could be better in one area and YFU in the other. But you can't really go wrong either way.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GQTaKHCvaa	AFS!<br>  <br>  AFS is really old and well established. They have a great reputation and run a lot of exchanges to a huge selection of countries.<br>  <br>  Intrax is newer and they have just started sending outbounds. They don't do real pre departure orientations and have a really limited number of countries. Also, the support staff in other countries isn't as good.<br>  <br>  I am going with AFS and I have found the people pretty helpful and it is really reassuring knowing that they have a well established reputation.<br>  <br>  ~good luck
3cDNvGTkaa	The writing score has no effect on the overall score. So if you got an 18 the only scores included in that would be the english, reading, math, and science. If you got a 24 if would be the same thing also only the english, reading, math, and science, scores would have an effect on it. It's the average of those subscores that make up your total score.<br>  <br>  Again the writing is it's own separate score, so whatever you get on the essay has no effect on the overall. The 6 that you got does not get added to your overall, your 6 is just a 6, it's your writing score, that's all that it is.

AA11604732	ASU is one of the least selective major universities in the US.  They accept over 90% of those who apply.  If you have a HS Diploma and a pulse, then you have a good shot at getting in.<br>  <br>  It will help if you establish residency first.  When you apply, make sure you address your background in your admissions essay.  Let them know that when you were younger you did not value education, but that you now realize how important it is, and have a new attitude towards it.<br>  <br>  Since you aren't transferring credits, you probably don't have to tell them about your experience at Community College.  That should help a little.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|BFB51h78aa	Ask your employer; corporations like Walmart typically will give grants for education--espacially to its employees.<br>   HOWEVER, you must be in good standing w/the institution that you owe $$ to, and usually have to be in good standing (with regard to grades and $$) for a few semesters<br>   Godspeed...

xuztRbN7aa	You're the type that gets really paranoid, despite the fact you have high academics, involved in many clubs, and so forth and that would probably affect you in the long run (not just in college, but the rest of your life).<br>  <br>  Since this is your first year in high school, this is normal.  That's how I felt when I was a first year high school student.  Here's are some things you need to know to succeed:<br>  <br>  *High GPA is great and all, but don't think that it's your life.  Don't stress yourself into trying to get a 4.0.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't get a 4.0, I'm saying don't stress yourself into getting it.  Any GPA at 3.0 or above is very respectful and you shouldn't think that your GPA is something to worry about.  <br>  <br>  *What branch of research are you interning in?  It's rare to find an research internship for a high school student (such an offer is normally given to junior, senior, or graduate students in college).  I also noticed that you're also part of soo many activities in school which seems to put a heavy workload in your life.   My advice to give you is to limit the amount of extracurricular activities that you have. Keep only the ones that you really love to do.   Colleges want to see loyalty, not popularity.     <br>  <br>  *Stay in touch with your guidance specialist and college career specialist.  Every school has both and you should get to know them since they'll be the ones who will help you get into college.  <br>  <br>  *Have fun.  I hate those type of parents who thinks fun is a waste of time.  I admire a student who studies effectively (not long hours) and plays like mad.  Every once in a while, hang out with friends, play a video game, just do something that is not work (no that doesn't mean do the laundry or clean the house either.  That's not fun!).  <br>  <br>  Enjoy your high school year and remember:  Life is too short to worry about numbers on a report card.|`|IjwOIRcmaa	Because you are so busy with so many impressive extracurriculars, I think you are doing very well to get into a prestigious college or university. If you manage to maintain, or improve, your A/A- average while staying involved and taking honors you'll probably do fine. The only thing you could do better would to get involved in a little bit of service-related activities.
DyEIc0K8aa	You are the only one who can answer what you should do... but if you want to study for it and become a nurse... go for it.|`|CceiP7q5aa	go for it, im studying to become a childrens nurse and its the best thing ever (im 19) i know people your age who are studying to become nurses and because they are older (than me) have more life experience and that.. can also relate to their parents of the children better etc.. which branch are u interested in?|`|Qz7YtDXUaa	go for it, I am 18 and that is what I planning on doing, I am going to my local community college, I am first applying to get my CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant) because Nursing Programs can be competitive and this way you earn in about a trimester and then you can work in a hospital and sometimes they will even help you pay for college and you get experience, it is a win win! Check out places like fastweb.com it will help you find financial help if you need it and also help you find schools if you need to based on the major that you want! hope this helps!|`|sP4KSFvQaa	Find a nursing school and get on the enrollment list.

x0rqNORPaa	general business, marketing, communications<br>  <br>  a college degree will overqualify you for a car salesmen position|`|zJYwwxJUaa	take a business major|`|hEFthejvaa	you don't need to go to college to become a car salesman, all you need is a high school degree. but if you willing to do an extra 4 years of school (which is expensive) & get good grades it will make your resume look better than someone with only a high school degree.<br>  <br>  majoring in business (specifically marketing) would be the best. maybe taking some sociology or psychology classes would help b/c in order to be a car salesman you'll have to be good with talking to people & convincing them to buy your car.|`|QebfMqdMaa	You do realize that you don't need a college degree to become a car salesman, right?<br>  <br>  You could sell cars right out of high school if you wanted to.<br>  <br>  BUT, just to humor you, you'd want to take classes on business, accounting, marketing and maybe even one or two on psychology (to help you get inside the head of the consumer).<br>  <br>  Honestly, though, if you want to sell cars, you don't need a degree. However, if what you want to do is open/own your own car dealership, then, yeah, I'd suggest a degree (even though it's still not mandatory).|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	No degree needed but if you insist on which would be best:  Probably a degree in drama.  This is as all that matters is for you to make a sale.  You therefore need to do some acting to make yourself convincing and the buyer feel comfortable, which will differ upon each customer.|`|x2mgUMb6aa	get to bed you have school in the morning,leave the serious questions to the adults.

GahpE5U2aa	Canada and the US are not in Europe... o.o<br>  <br>  All tuition is free in Sweden for the moment but starting 2010 we will be charging non-EU students to study here.<br>  <br>  And neither Canada, the US, or the UK charge would could be referred to as "low" tuition fees by any definition. But of course it differs from university to university. The better ones will be more expensive of course.<br>  <br>  But there's always scholarships to get into the better universities...<br>  <br>  Since there are thousands and thousands of universities there's not much I can help you with.<br>  <br>  But here's a list with some universities that offer Mechatronics-related courses in the US:<br>  <a href="http://mechatronics.mech.northwestern.edu/links/university_links.html" rel="nofollow">http://mechatronics.mech.northwestern.ed...</a><br>  <br>  And here's a list of institutes and educational organisations that deal with Mechatronics:<br>  <a href="http://www.mechatronik.uni-linz.ac.at/links/worldwide.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mechatronik.uni-linz.ac.at/li...</a><br>  <br>  And also don't ignore Germany since they have relatively low tuition fees.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
