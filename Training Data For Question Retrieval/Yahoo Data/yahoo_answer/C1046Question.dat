It seems I was trying to keep my Arnis and my wing chun completely seperate from each other I dont believe that a beginner is wise enough to mix martial arts together without having a high degree of understanding in each one 1st. anyways I noticed when I did wing chun I was getting the similar feels of tension I would get from doing the stick work . This was messing up my chi sao for a long time then I got 2 sticks and did a tai chi sword drill which emphasizes sticking sensitivity and fluidity based off of pressure from the opponets sticks right after I did that drill my chi sao was better and more fluid. So in turn everything you do weather it be sticks or empty hand correlates and effects the other? is this true and how is it so? muscle memory?

20090225083834AAv82mi	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Help with fantasy baseball keeper selection...?	I am in a fantasy keeper league. I have already decided to keep Ryan Braun, Grady Sizemore, and Tim Lincecum. I have room for one more keeper if I decide I want to keep one more player.       I have been contemplating whether to keep one more bat and draft pitching heavily early on or keep it even and go after the best player available in each round. If I decide to keep the bat then its between Carlos Quinten or Mark Texieria. If I choose Billingsley then I will be pretty even, 2 bats and 2 good quality starters going into the draft.      If I don't choose a 4th player to keep then I get an extra draft pick in place of my keeper. So essentially I will have the first overrall pick. (remember this is a keeper league so studs like CC, Roy Halladay, Albert Pujols, won't be available).      What should I do? Keep one of Billingsley, Texieira, Quinten or not keep them and take an extra draft pick?

Tendulkar is still the man, but he needs to be fit more to continue his great run. he's actually doing better these days than in past 2 yrs! Sanath shld give him some of his steroids, meds to prevent injuries and keep his batteries running. we all want Tendulkar to play in 2011 WC, so keeping him well is key. what say?

20090309153838AA4SBL0	Sports;Basketball	What is considered a foul in basketball?	I was playing 2 on 2 street basketball. I started off well scoring 6 straight baskets, but then the guy Ding me started playing what I considered dirty, but I'm not sure if I'm right on this.      the guy I was playing was really heavy set, and short, so I could easily beat him off the dribble, which is how I scored so easily. but after the 6th basket, whenever I would get pass him, he would reach in and disrupt my dribble with his hands, or move his leg to undercut me, or he would bump me while I'm in the air with his body. When he's got the ball, he would post me up, but he would use his elbow to move my body aside, like a hook only with his elbow instead of his entire arm. I'm not sure if this is a foul or not, but he would literally elbow me in the chest. when he puts the ball on the floor, he would use his left hand to move my body aside. I thought you wern't allowed to use your off hand move the defensive player, I'm sure KG got called on that when he tried to use his left hand to keep a guy away during a dunk.      are any of these things fouls in basketball?

20090309154033AAmjOK1	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	How much is this worth? Football memorabilia / Antique?	I recently inherited a signed leather Football from my grandfather who passed away. He was an avid liverpool fan and a member of the supporters club for some time.       After Liverpool won the FA cup in the 1964 - 1965 season, the Liverpool supporters club held a raffle in which the winning prize was a leather football signed by all of the FA cup winning team. The signatures are a bit faded now and the ball is slightly deflated. However i was curious if anyone knows how much an item like this is worth. Of course some of the team have passed away since this item was signed and it would need some restoration. But how much would it be worth to a potential buyer? would the Anfield Museum be willing to purchase it? and how much would it cost to insure? Any ideas?

And having him backup only makes it better for the celtics becuase he wont have to worry about being the 4th best on the floor which he probaly wouldnt like, i don't see how this could hurt the celtcs, but what do you all think? does this make the celtics better or worse?

20090227150248AAvcY4C	Sports;Water Sports	A unique SCUBA problem needs your imagination...?	Howdy divers! I've got a unique problem. I'm headed down to the Caribbean for a week with my girlfriend and wanted to do something very romantic. I've tracked down a first english edition of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea. Bear with me here...      I've had it completely sealed in acid free mylar plastic and wrapped that inside a 100% waterproof pouch. It is completely waterproof and has only a tiny bit of air inside the bags, with plenty of room to expand. My idea is to put it inside a tiny antique looking box or wrap it in cloth then put it somewhere where she will "accidentally" find it, along with an engagement wedding ring. The guides say that they're happy to do it with me when we're on our night dive the night before (my girl doesn't like night dives), but my only concern is that it will float away. What do you think is the best way to secure it in place? I was thinking of putting a few stones in empty space of the box, but it still floats along the bottom (Of my bathtub), almost neutrally bouyant. Any ideas or suggestions? Another way you might do it?      PS: Will obviously not touch any coral or damage anything. Will lay it gently on crushed coral or sand in an open area.

Chelsea did amazing against Barcelona, who are the best attacking side in the world at the moment. I have not seen any team in the last year that contained Barca the way Chelsea did. They truely deserve to be called one of the best teams in the world. and they deserved to be in the finals in my opinion.      So, not that the final is Man Utd v Barca, who do u think will win?      do u think Fergie has learned from Chelsea how to containt Barca?   will Fergie use the same tactics, or go for the kill?

20090309113021AASRtWH	Sports;Other - Sports	What is the point of a hunter trophy?	What is the point of a hunter trophy when the hunter kills a large animal with a fine-tuned scoped rifle that a 12 years old could use?   Wouldn't the trophy be more valuable if the hunter would use a hunter knife instead of a rifle?   What is the point in taking pride in something that is basically a coward's victory?   I'm just asking because I was at my friend's house and he showed me his trophy kill(a large deer's stuffed head) and he was so proud of himself for shooting that animal.   Don't misunderstand me I'm not a green animal lover, I just think that shooting something that is at a distance isn't a big deal.   Give the hunter a knife and a net and if he can kill the same deer then it is something. Especially if it is a bear. But showing off with a rifle-kill is just lame instead of cool.   I watched a few hunts on YT and they overjoy when they kill a wild pig from a distance from a lurking-place. Would they be able to do it in close quarters combat?   Or if they must use a rifle, why use a scope? And instead of a big deer, why don't they shoot a small animal like a rabbit? Shooting a rabbit from 400 meters without a scope would be something. But this...   What do you think?

My friend who played GYM CLASS volleyball, was asked to join the team in September. He tried out and was horrible. He could not spike when he was 6'4, couldnt pass, couldnt serve (every serve hit the net), yet he still made it. I could spike, but the passes were horrendous from some kid who did get cut. The coach didn't even know my name and I asked him a question and told me to buzz off. Everybody was shocked when I got cut because I was better than most of the kids that made the team. I practiced 3 times a week for 2 hours for a whole year, and it went to waste, and it happend like last year, coach hated me for some unknown reason and cut me, when I never spoke in my life to him. Is it even worth trying again when the same thing has happened twice? I feel depressed and left-out because all people talk about is volleyball. The coach doesn't allow managers or people who just practice with them, but don't play games. Is that also corrupt to recruit a person in a PUBLIC school?

If not what stem would I have to buy to have them fit?       I want bullhorns (my old bike had them on when I bought it) and using the track bar I'd chop it and save a little, but may just get the bullhorns and skip the extra effort (since the difference in price is not that much) unless I have to get a stem then I'll go with the track bar and use that extra $10 towards the stem.      Help me figure this out please.   I'm just all confused -

20090309173212AAwrIis	Sports;Surfing	Help with body boarding and its safeties.?	Well i go to the beach a lot during the summer. And our waves aren't really surfing waves. And i don't know how surf. But then i have to learn, lessons, and equps. Tried boogeyboarding but i liked bodyboarding better. But i found out i was bodyboarding all wrong til the beginning of last summer, and then i practiced like crazy.       What i know so far...That you stand in chest deep water so i can push off the ground. Get to a wave that is at its steepest point before tipping. Push off the ground and make your head and shoulders below your hips. So your angled down. Then you kinda swim and then start sliding on your chest. Then your boarding.       Im like the only kid on the beach who can body board. Everybody else body boards but they are doing it all wrong. So i don't have anybody to learn from in real life.       The things i need help with is being able to go sideways on the wave. I tried to carve in the wave but i always ended up going under. Also, when i went body boarding last year, sometimes my body was dangerously angled downwards. I kinda put too much power, and bad timing. But after a few seconds i got owned. Just slammed on the sand and water went up my nose and everything. it hurt like a mofo.    So i wanna know how to get out of that situation. I know there is a way.       Thanks guys, and since i had to learn bymyself most of the time. If what i know is wrong. please let me know...Any tips are appreciated and please tell me have to carve in a wave and how to correctly abandon ship.

I also played fullback and tight end on the practice squad. Sophomore year i was listed as starting D-end and special teams as well as 3rd string tight end and 2nd string Full Back.I was also the teams Co-captain until I ended up quiting the team and transferring to a public school due to financial reasons. Now coming into a public school there is a lot more competition on D-line I now seem small tight ends and full backs are rarely used in this offensive scheme. Now going into my Junior year i want to try maybe a slot Receiver.And of course i can catch not really a burner though   Me-height-6'2   weight-165   bench-185(12 reps)   leg press-445 max   40 time about-4.78(best) 5.13(worst)   I know you really can't tell for sure unless you've seen me play but please just give me an evaluation of what you think

They are a little bit to dodgy for bumpy pavement and sidewalks but, I don't have the first clue how to make them work for such an environment.  I probably should have ordered skates meant for the outdoors, but I don't like to buy clothing and shoes I haven't tried on.  Any information to make these work as best as possible would be great.

Either that or they are a bunch of poor bastards that cant afford a well-made bike so they have to say "ITS NOT ABOUT THE BIKE" when i ask a question about purchasing a decent road bike.  I am pretty sure I know more about bikes than all of you that would say "its not about the bike" because I actually rode bikes with various different levels of groupsets.  PLEASE IF YOU WANT TO TELL ME ITS NOT ABOUT THE BIKE THEN GO AHEAD AND TELL THAT TO SOMEONE WHO GIVES A DAMN ABOUT YOUR OPINION.  oh and do bring your POS bike to a local race.  Its not about the bike?  well then why do they make high-end bikes?  and if its not about the bike then why do they even bother making improvements in technology?  IF ITS NOT ABOUT THE BIKE THEN WHY DO THEY CONSTANTLY STRIVE TO MAKE A BETTER BIKE?  SERIOUSLY IF YOU ARE STUPID, IGNORANT, AND A REDNECK PLEASE DONT GIVE ME YOUR ADVICE THAT "ITS NOT ABOUT THE BIKE" BECAUSE THATS NOT WHY I ASK THE QUESTION!!!        anyways for serious riders the question is this.  what are the benefits of buying a LOOK 565 complete bike with fulcrum wheelset and Ultegra SL groupset vs buying a Trek 2.1.....the price difference is about $2,000 and when I test rode both, the difference was hardly worth $2,000.
