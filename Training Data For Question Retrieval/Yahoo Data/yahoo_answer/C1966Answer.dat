(you have to d/l it though) You can transfer it over to itunes, or windows media player, and then onto your ipod. That's what I do with mine.  :)

This increases your chances of them contacting you to participate in betas.

That erases the photos, but also erases "housekeeping" stuff and errors. It isn't a guarantee, but formatting improves your chances of trouble free use of your memory card.<br>  <br>  There are many mobile options for storing and viewing photos, your camera is a very bad choice for that.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	once you format<br>  they are gone.<br>  I have 5 canons.<br>  it explains it in the manual.<br>  it might do you good to read the manual<br>  from front to back.|`|99ab666d64d9efa53079a431c3c15bd0aa	Luckily, most FORMAT features just erase pointers, not the actual picture data.

Although I haven't take a large quantity of pictures, the ones I have taken are phenomenal, even in low light situations. This camera also has dual image stabilization. The reason I bought this camera is because I was looking for a point and shoot camera that takes high quality pictures. In fact, Consumer Reports rates this camera Excellent for image quality while no other cameras are rated this well. It also takes nice videos. I bought mine for $180 from Amazon and they offer many different shipping services. Good luck|`|c1ce42ef95c55422ecf6eb28ce1afd49aa	I  have been in Europe since 2008 so I have no idea about the present prices and models. I hope somebody will be better informed and able to tell you more about it.

AA11539218	yes, you will have to download third party software in order to do this. iTunes only works one way, to put songs on the ipod.

There are many free programs just search google for "ipod to PC transfer" find a free program and install it.  Launch the program you just downloaded, plug in your ipod and drag and drop songs into the itunes library....some programs are different than others but all will do the same basic thing.

You may need to crop the image to get rid of peripheral parts of the image you do not want - In MacOS, Command-Shift - 3 grabs the whole screen (so you need to crop), Command-Shift - 4 provides cross-hairs so you can select just the portion of the screen you want. The resulting image grab will be saved to the Mac's desktop and be used in whatever image application you have.

Choose a brand that appeals to you. Then you have to think about getting a spare battery, what size memory card, if you want an extended warranty, how much you can afford, what size zoom, if you want manual controls, the size of the camera, finding a reliable place to purchase it, and the list goes on and on and on.......<br>  <br>  The first thing to realize is that almost any digital camera will take good pictures. If more people would read the manual more than once, they would be able to take better pictures. Usually, the person assumes it is the camera when it could be them not knowing exactly what to do. Just give yourself more photographic knowledge by doing more reading on the internet.<br>  <br>  I really believe buying a camera is an individual choice.<br>  The person needs to read alot of reviews on cameras so they can decide on the features that they really want and need.<br>  Go to the store and hold them so you can see if they feel comfortable in your hands.

This can be either a 4-pin firewire 400 (most common in Windows laptops, also called i.LINK in Sony Vaio land), 6-pin firewire 400 (common in desktops and Macintosh computers) or 9-pin firewire 800 (the "bottleneck" will be at the camcorder because the DV port is limited to 400 mbps firewire, but you may have other uses).<br>  <br>  A good fast CPU is always handy - and new computers all pretty much have them these days. 2 gig RAM (or more) for standard definition DV and 4 gig (or more) for High Definition HDV. A separate hard drive so the video project files are not on the same hard drive as the start-up system.

qGfAlDd2aa	It won't make a difference.  The data transmitted over the cable is still the same.|`|UinOWcMUaa	NO -- your TV is probebly already 60hz ... But unless your TV is 120hz.. it won't make to much of a difference for you because..most HDMI cables will push your signal to accomadate the 120hz...<br>  <br>  You'll be ok... you made look into having your TV calibrated before too long though.. It would be great for your plasma..|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	Everyone has it wrong so far.<br>  <br>  It's BS, let's get that out of the way.<br>  <br>  Next, it has nothing to do with LCD or plasma TVs refresh rate.<br>  <br>  Remember that the frame rate or refresh rate coming out the blu ray and going to the TV is going to be either 24, 30 or 60 fps. No matter what, that's all there will ever be coming from blu ray to the TV. There are no other frame rates supported by TVs or blu ray players.<br>  <br>  Some plasma TVs are 480 hz (Panasonic) and the new LG and panasonic plasmas will be 600hz. That all happens after the fact. so 120hz LCD or whatever, it has nothing to do with what the cable can carry.<br>  <br>  Use it, or any HDMI cable on any TV with HDMI, no issues no worries.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Take back the Monster cable.  I'm serious.  Get a cheap no-name brand.  You shouldn't pay more than $10 for a cable.  (You paid close to $100, right?)  Monster's cables work fine, but they are way overpriced.  They perform no better than cables that are 90% less expensive, especially in short runs.  Their "educational" materials are complete b.s. too, deliberately deceiving.  Do yourself a favor and read this:<br>  <br>   <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/hdmi-cable/?tag=rb_content;rb_mtx" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/hdmi-cable/?tag=...</a><br>  <br>  Summary: "Expensive cables aren't worth it."<br>  <br>  That said, your Samsung is 60Hz, so your current cable will work just fine.|`|AA10594501	As I understand it, the 120 Hz is generated within the HDTV by interpolating frames. The 1080p signal from your BlueRay is 60 Hz (60 full frames per second) maximum. So the cable has nothing to do with 120 Hz or 240 Hz, and certainly not to plasma or LCD.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	It'll work fine on your plasma set.<br>  <br>  Only the newest LCD sets support 120Hz, and there's no reason why a HDMI cable wouldn't work with a set that supports a higher refresh rate.

AA10965358	It means that you can use it on another network.  With GSM carriers you can "unlock" them so that they can be used on another network, where as on CDMA networks (Verizon) the phones are locked to the network.  If you reflash them, change the OS on the phone, you cna use it on another network.

It has a nice keyboard and a great screen, but it's the largest and heaviest of the AT&T Blackberries.  It's a true world phone, it will work in Japan and Korea (other Blackberries won't).  It has a much better browser than previous Blackberries, but it's nowhere near as good as the Iphone's browser.|`|wYg3del2aa	Depends. I have used a Bold, Storm and Curve.<br>  <br>  Out of all of them I like the Storm keyboard the best. For me the Curve is too small and the Bold's just feels cheap and very hard to type on.<br>  <br>  It is really something to get used to.<br>  <br>  Other than the keyboard its a phenomenal phone that has a Hi-Res screen and is very responsive.

KQL3tqS7aa	Unfortunately, you will need a US Cellular specific phone.  Reason is, is that the programming cannot be completed with phones from other companies.  I suggest you call customer service and they maybe could get you to telesales to get a new phone or they could get ahold of a retail location that may have used phones.  If you have insurance on it, losing it would be covering for a $50 deductible.
KQL3tqS7aa	The batteries should have a 1 year warranty on them, so if that is the problem, you should be able to go to a store and have them swap it out.  However, the charging problem could be either the charger itself or the charging port.  If the phone is less than a year old, it would be covered under the warranty, unless it has physical abuse or liquid damage.  If it has liquid damage, then insurance would be the only thing to cover it, but they ususally want to see the phone before they will add the insurance.  I suggest you take it to a service tech and see if it is the charging port and in the meantime, try a different charger.

zAsTQLbdaa	OK, I've had this problem too.<br>  1) First reset your router, usually you can unplug it, wait 20 seconds and plug it back in. Try connecting again.<br>  2) If that didn't work, go into your router settings. Find your IP Address. On windows press the windows logo key and "R" at the same time, then type cmd in the window that pops up. then type in: ipconfig in the window that pops up after that. do you see 192.168.X.X?<br>  3) If you don't then use the numer you saw. In this case use the first to sets of numbers (192.168) followed by a zero and a one (0.1) it should look like this (192.168.0.1) now make sure the first to digits correspond with what you saw on your computer. Now type the number (192.168.0.1 in this case) in your brower (Internet Explorer or other) address bar.<br>  4) login if you have to (a common default login is: admin and no password<br>  5) see if your router has a "return to default settings" or something along those lines.<br>  6) try connecting from your ipod again, if you have no more luck you might need to call the customer support for your router or get help somewhere else.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|3niZfJslaa	you probably need to enter your wep key it should be on the side of your router
fp9bOiVFaa	The old schedule was every 18 months, but the 50D broke that rule by coming out 12 months after the 40D. With Nikon outperforming Canon I wouldn't be surprised if the new release was closer to 12 months than 18. The 50D was announced in August so I'd expect the next iteration  (60D?) to be the same, and come out a month or two later.|`|bo54Lw59aa	Seems that Canon's typical schedule is to release a new body about every three weeks or so.  Sure seems that way.
6DUEgAezaa	filming definitely isn't easy. i myself am a skateboarder.<br>  unfortunately a fish eye lens is essential when filming lines, or in some cases, single tricks, but the good news is that you can get some pretty decent lenses for not a lot of money. try the opteka 0.43x if you're not looking to spend a lot of money, it's about thirty dollars, which is very good compared to most lenses. when you get the lens learning how to properly film shouldn't take to long. just follow whoever you're filming closely and make sure the camera is low to the ground and pointed upward. <br>  if you can't get a fisheye right away, or ever, it's not all that bad. it is difficult to film lines without a fisheye, however in most cases single tricks like over a set or whatever, tend to look better just getting a good angle and slowly zooming in or out depending on whats going on.<br>  i personally prefer the way the long angle shots look compared to fisheye. anyways, good luck!

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	There is no mandate to change the AM or FM stations to digital.  The spectrum that AM and FM occupy isn't as valuable for other uses so I doubt that there will ever be a mandate to force this change.  The FM stations may eventually switch to digital on their own if 95% or so of their audience can receive digital.  This would take years as people replaced FM receivers that failed.  Why pay the power bill for 2 transmitters if you don't have to?  Due to the lower frequency, AM would have a difficult time switching to digital.  This would take longer than the FM switch if it ever happened.|`|becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	At least in the US, no decision has been made to switch to all digital radio. So, no need to worry.

First, you will need an audio file or song in .mp3 format. You can email me if you need an .mp3 file for a specific song. Upload that song into Ventones. Once it is done loading, you will get to choose a 30 second segment from the song to be your ringtone. To make it sound more realistically like a ringtone, I would suggest choosing the one second fade at the end.<br>  <br>  Next, once the 30 second ringtone is done uploading, you will be given the options to either download the file to your computer, enter your phone number and have it sent in a text, or generate the download URL and enter it in your phone's web browser. (I would choose the last option to enter it into your phone's browser.)<br>  <br>  Once it is in your browser, it might get slow, just because the download files are setting up and all that stuff. It will automatically download (it's a very small file) in about a second or two. To find the file, go to your "My Music" section (name will vary based on carriers; just play with it a little) and set the song as RINGTONE. <br>  <br>  Congratulations, your song is a ringtone =)<br>  <br>  (Note: I'm not sure if you have to pay to download it because you're using the Internet. I don't think I had to pay)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

eObzadUhaa	They postponed the date of release on the game because they felt that they needed to advertise it more so that more people would buy it. I, personally, was looking forward to the game being released and felt it was kind of a silly reason to delay it's shelf date. They also said that they wanted to add and tweak some more features of the game and make it compatible for Mac users. I don't think there is a legal way to get it for free. Maybe the girl was a tester for the game? You should put a link to the youtube video up.

vN4v4fR2aa	Really, it depends on you as a customer.  I personally feel that the protection plan is great for budgeting because you KNOW when you're going to spend the money and don't have to pony up larger sums at a moment's notice.  Ok, so a moment's notice is a bit of an exaggeration considering any charge covered under the protection plan is billed to your account and due with the next billing cycle.<br>  <br>  If you feel like you can afford a $49.95 service call if your service goes out for whatever reason (outside of your original warranty if installed by a certified technician because then it's no cost) and you feel comfortable enough that you can solve just about any issue that may arise, then you might find it more costly to pay the $5.99/month (total of 71.88 per year, or about one month of service at normal price for some customers).<br>  <br>  If, however, you're one of those who have a set budget and can't, for whatever reason, have anything out of place within that budget (one such case may be if you're on a fixed income) then it's best to have the protection plan because it keeps from throwing your budget out of whack.<br>  <br>  The protection plan covers, in a short list, equipment damage due to normal wear and tear (so if you or your child drop your remote in a toilet, or you throw your receiver out the window in a fit of rage you're not covered), lightning strikes, dish realignments, dish relocation (For line-of-sight only, cosmetic reasons are not covered), receiver replacement, remote replacement, cabling (which, after the install, technically belongs to the property owner), and other related DirecTV equipment.<br>  <br>  If you're unsure, you can always opt for the protection plan at a later time, but just remember that pre-existing conditions are not covered and you have a 30-day no-claim no-pay period (you're not billed and you're not covered to prevent oh-and-by-the-way situations).  If something DOES happen to come up, though, and you need a service call you can often opt for the protection plan at that time and get a discount on the service call.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind, the biggest thing about the protection plan (and most customers are not aware of this) is that it has a 1 year commitment to it, so if you stop it before 1 year is up you have a $10 fee (as of the last I checked the details, which was fairly recently).  After the year it can be cancelled at any time.

887aKDITaa	That's the official adapter for the xbox 360.  It is the best one you can get and setting up is a breeze.  Sometimes it seems like it's hard to get a good signal with it but overall its your best bet.  Make sure you have a decent wireless router to work with it.  I use a dual antenna linksys.<br>  <br>  If you shop around you should be able to find it for less than $99.  Ebay sometimes has some good deals and watch your local gamestop/game trading stores.  Sometimes they will have a trade in for cheaper.|`|stD8Dbn1aa	You will still need a wireless router to hook up to your modem.

617345a78bc2d8de39dfc7b0e5317c54aa	Al compresor le "quitaste" un poco de su vida útil. Y como ya te dijeron: tu cuenta de la luz se te incrementará. De ahí en más no sufrió mayores da?os.<br>  Y cuando digo que le quitaste un poco de vida al compresor, no te preocupes, fue muy poco. Los compresores están dise?ados para durar muchos a?os. Yo tengo un refri que ya duró más de 20 a?os, así que ya te imaginarás para cuánto están dise?ados esos motores.<br>  Suerte.|`|8a4f7f63ae42e87eb792a7b874707543aa	no se si a los nuevos les pasa pero a los mas convencionales despues del tiempo el motor se sobrecalentaria al tratar de enfriar espacios mayores|`|NzLJ6UzMaa	al tenerlo abierto la congelacion del refri no llega al punto requerido por el termostato,por lo tanto el motor sigue funcionando y se puede quemar por exeso de trabajo. cierralo|`|wayRTnD7aa	al refri nada a tu cuenta de la luz...uffff subirá un buen poco...|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Si  estaba de par en par y trabajando, se puede descomponer!
74ca01050454f087aba1ed0946cdcdadaa	Pues eso solo es un mito amigo,, aun las empresas no se han decidido a bloquear los telefonos celulares que reportas como robados y de todas formas existe la forma de volverlos a usar o simplemente se desmantelan y se venden por partes. EL codigo que dices simplemente sirve para sacar el numero IMEI o numero unico de tu celular que es el mismo que esta detras en una etiqueta cuando quitas la bateria o el mismo que registran en tu factura cuando lo compras, no es un numero magico ni nada|`|80v9vYyRaa	muy buen punto.... te pongo una estrella<br>  saludos|`|yLvwalG1aa	Jajajaja, eso lo sacaste de paradisezone.net|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Si, interesante, ya me habían dado esa información por internet antes, pero MUCHAS GRACIAS.<br>  Saludos!|`|a244d7aee63105c02a893e6e43a0cdbdaa	Apoco si se puede??? Pues le voy a intentar gracias por el dato
6cc55262a2bd3c09f25a17589f66fbffaa	cuando pediste el saldo te decontaron $2, por eso mencionan que tienes $298, los cuales puedes usar sin ningun problema para hablar y/o mandar mensajes, pero si quieres entrar al portal de ideas telcel vía tu celular, sólo puedes disponer de los $200 que menciona la grabación, si los consumes todos, tendrás todavía los $98 que no podrás usar para ideas telcel, si quieres de nuevo entrar alli deberás abonar una tarjeta.<br>  en resumen el saldo total que tengas, no importa como te lo desglose la operadora, lo puedes usar para tus llamadas y mensajes, no te preocupes.|`|65def94d9c705581cb72fb83663aec07aa	al consultar tu saldo te cobran $2 y no te deben de quitar 200$ es mejor que vallas  con tu operador y le digas que te quitan el saldo  y despues le digas tu pregunta.|`|ecf3b2c323abf19e47273265944e7a71aa	Hola mira te explico como esta el asunto de los $300.00 <br>  <br>  Cuando lo compras te dicen que te da 300 pesotes de tiempo aire pero resulta que esos 300 son diferidos eso quiere decir que inicialmente solo tienes 100 y despues te quedan 200 pendiente de los cuales tienes que ir abonando 100 exactamente cada mes o antes para que te den ellos los 200 que te hacen falta esto lo hacen con el fin de que saben que mucha gente no les va a meter el saldo exactamente al mes por que muchas veces no hay entonces de esa manera pierdes tus 200 pesotes y solo te quedas con los 100 pesos iniciales. Lo que dice Hiro acerca del numero gratuito es cierto aun que el mes pasado la activacion de tu amigo gratis no tenia costo por que ya venia con ese beneficio por haberte comprado un amigo kit nuevo y de las recargas de 30.00 y 50.00 es para solo un mes si no te lo gastas en un mes te lo quitan y ya valiste.<br>  <br>   Espero que te sirva la informacion.|`|rXHNLHlgaa	es lo malo de los rateros de telcel te dicen que te dan 300 de tiempo aire y realmente solo son 100 que se te acaban en 2 llamadas para que entonces tengas que abonarle otros 100 minimo que te va a durar otras 2 llamadas y los planes de renta no son mejores porque te cobran hasta por usar el bluetooth maldi.tos rateros de telcel|`|CXX6NG7Xaa	Cuidado, porque cada vez que pides tu saldo tiene un costo el servicio, que se te descuenta de tu saldo.<br>  <br>  Te recomiendo que actives "tu mejor amigo" al *264 por solo 50 pesos.  Para hablar con alguien gratis por un a?o, esto es marcas el numero de tu amigo, y habla por casi 4:58 minutos gratis, despues ya te cobran.  Es importante que sepas que deberas tener como minimo $5.00 pesos de saldo.<br>  <br>  Si ya no tienes mucho credito pero tienes alguien que te pueda proporcionar credito en esa emergencia, mandale mensaje pidele que te ponga tiempo aire electronico (tiendas) desde 30 pesos.  <br>  <br>  Con estas nuevas formas de tiempo aire, esto ha sido una muy buena forma de auxilio.<br>  <br>  Seguramente compraste tu telefono con $300 peos de tiempo aire, pero tienes que ver las especificaciones, pues ese tiempo te lo dan en partes.  Y cada vez que vuelves a poner una tarjeta de van liberando $100 pesos.  Si quieres mas informacion *264 o el portal telcel|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Pos si, pero si quieres comprarle cosas a Telcel, tienes suficiente dinerito! jojo!|`|462410aca33c137f7676b925b3385428aa	Que molestos son, ahora tienes que ir al centro del telcel para que te pongan bien tu saldo, ni modo, o como te dijo Almejajajajaja,<br>  <br>  saludos amiga.

x5SWBq4saa	por lo regular cuando uno compra zapatos, pide los dos para medirselos, y por consiguiente, uno se fija si son iguales. Si no hiciste eso, pues si deberias ir a la tienda a que te ense?en otro par, ya que si los has usado ps claro que no te los cambiaran.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Pues ve y aclara tu duda directamente en la tienda, a lo mejor ese modelo que tu compraste es en particular vanguardista!
