20090307174508AAUS7H2	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good beginning of a story?	The witch was brewing away angrily.      "I really need those scales!" she screamed, sprinkling her evil black fairy dust in the potion. She took a piece of fish and threw it at her specially bred lava alligators. Then, she took another one and threw it at Super Barbie who was tied up in the corner of her cavern. The fish landed on Barbie's face.      "Like Oh my Gosh! You just like totallly ruined my hair! First you like wrinkl my like brand new sundress and now you like, do this! OH my gosh!" complained Barbie in her Valley Girl voice, "You know you'll like totally like never get away with this.      "Shut up!" screamed the fairy witch in anger, "eventually your mermaid friends will try to save you and I can get their scales. Then I can rule the world with my Magic Evil Tissues!"      "You know since you like ruined my like clothes you could at least like let me borrow some of you like clothes! There like so totally cute! It would also be like so totally awesome if you could give me some haire and beauty tips! I just love your style!" commented the Barbie casually not aware then the witch was steaming with fury. Its really peculiar that Super Barbie of all people would admire the faerie witch's style. Barbie was beautiful with bleach blonde hair pulled bakc into a perfect pontyail. Here face was blemish free. As hard as you ever tried you could never find anything wrong with Barbie's face.She was like the perfect supermodel.      On the other hand, the witch had short bright and shiny lavender hair. She was always wearing and orange hat to match her long orange dress. The dress had so many ruffles you could barely see the purple trimming. She wore magic red pumps and her face was long and narrow with a gentle tint of green. She always wore bright red lipstick to match her shoes.      The witch was part fairy. Nobody knows what color her wings are because she is ashamed of having such pure blood running through her veins so she hides her wings under her dress. Her dream since a child is to take over the world.      --------------------------------------...   Hayden and Lillian both knew they had to save Barbie and not have their scales taken. If the witch got ahold of their scales the end of the world would come. The Magic Evil Tissues would dominate. Hayden, who was one of the witche's distant cousins throuh fairy blood knew every weakness the witch had and every trick she might pull.      Hayden and Lillian kept swimming along around the witch's secret underwater cavern looking for an entrance. They looked through the glass and saw Barbie tied up in the corner.      Lillian, who was part elf, noticed that tiny pieces of coral were embedded into the glas. Since normal elves had control over plants, mermaid-elves had control over sea plants.       Lillian focused all her energy on the coral and the glass burst into tiny little pieces.      :You!" the witch shrieked grabbing her Evil magic meatball. she threw it at Hayden hitting her in the back. It quickly turned to acid  burning her.      Blood was streaming bdhind Barbie, Hayden and Lillian as they swam away.      "We should like so toatallly hurry ub before the like mongoose sharks like sniff your like totally gross blood!" warned Barbie looking back at the witch furiously shaking her fist at the girls.      "Mongoose Sharks? Those things have been extinct for years! How did that witch get her  hands on mongoose sharks?" explained Lillian suspiciously.      "I don't know! Do I like look like I like know? I would likd so totally like tell you if I like knew!" answered Barbie bitterly.      "Let's get you back to your sandcastle and get you cleaned up. When was the last time you fed you pirrhanna?" Lillian aske Hayden.         I'm only 12 and this is the first few pages of a story I started writing. I know it really wierd so don't criticize me on that. Do you have any tips or suggestions?

Wolf knew what she had discovered was something big very big on the scale of the universe big. She knew only theses things came to worthy people and she knew there was some sort of mistake but, what she saw was no mistake wolf was the chosen one  and her duty was to find the other swords before the demons could.

20090307180911AAJTUAo	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think about these poems?	I used to dream of empty blue plains, winter mountains and storm held dreams. But now its lost in a haze of green, poured in backwards, dipped in gasoline. We were lovers and haters and together for long. The blue eyed couple slathered in youthful lust, in stars and dust mites, together thick and thin. Everything ends; did you know that too?      Go.       The soft white curves of the corners of the room, remind me of you, connected soft angles. From hip to waist to nape to chin, ankle to calf to knee to limb. Again I leave and come back too thin, too shaken, too wild, too everything. I am extreme, like the waves in your dreams. We kiss in moonlit frost.      Return.         Drenched black and blue, some red on the edges. In your head you can see me, but not with your eyes. Why so hard, princess? What do you dread? I'm a zombie, you say, you hate the rest. I keep going and going, too much stress. Broken and twisted, sticky tack gone to decay. Hard lips on soft ones, you turn away again.       Decisive        Please need me, I pray. I want tears, I want lust, I want to be dripped with starlight. In love too soon, we could fly to the moon. Just give me one thing, that love that we had. Nothing ends completely, really, honest to truth. Spin with me on a windmill up high in the sky, with lips like summer and skylit blue eyes.            heres the second one:        Inside I am mottled with moribund spiders,   twisted in pain kicked blueberry veins. You are simply mine.   I tell the truth, the truth in bright blue,   iloveyouiloveyou   no i don't. Backwards facts of open minds,   just because I can, I say it.    I don't hold on, just speak again    again and again in sour pink lips.    I plunge a bit deeper, press my hands to your back,   I'm gone again in the flood of what I can do.    Can and may distinguished by me,    cold and kind, dashed in half.   Crystals chandeliers hang, gently swaying,    let me fall into your arms.      What's beautiful,   me, me, the way my arms curve around the color of my eyes and strands of hair combined in black, brown, quicksilver reflections on evanescent lips.   I want to run away, but I just can't.   They all hate me, drunkenly muttering, into your hair.   They do, they do.   And so I'll try and pull me away,    pull you in,    and close it all out.

20090307181541AAKJFhK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Did you enjoy "The Catcher in the Rye?"?	I just finished "The Catcher in the Rye," which I borrowed from my English teacher because our school doesn't teach it and she said that I should probably read it because when she went to college, a lot of professors referenced it, and she'd never read it and was always lost. So, anyway, I read it expecting it to suck because it's a classic and all, and I absolutely LOVED it. When I brought it back to her, she was like, "So what'd you think of it?" and i told her that i thought it was amazing and I love it. Then she gave me this look and was like, "Seriously? I didn't really like it that much..." and i was like WHAT?! I thought it'd be law that an ENGLISH teacher has to love this book. She said she'd have to re-read it. So, seeing as I loved it, and she didn't really think it was all that great, what did YOU think of it? Thanks. =]

I'm looking for an uptempo solo song for a soprano that is a "state of being" piece (ie i'm so happy, i'm so in love, i'm so sad, etc).  I'm trying to avoid the typical cheesy songs like "I could've danced all night," "I enjoy being a girl," "wouldn't it be loverly," etc.  I've been looking for something at least a little obscure, but haven't found anything I like yet, so help???      my voice is classical style, think julia andrews-esque, so major belt and/or pop-ish songs don't work well.

20090307180841AA0Cs5j	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Ideas for Short Horror Story?	I have this short, horror story and it's due in a few days. The only rule is that NO ONE CAN DIE in it. I had a couple (stupid) plot ideas, listed below:      - A teenager tries out for a new singing (or any kind of performing) competition that is about to air its first season. She, and everyone else trying out, just has no idea that these "judges" and everyone else involved in the "show" are all individuals that plan to kill them, if they don't do what they do best. Basically, the worst performers don't go home - they go to basically the equivalent of hell...or something along those lines that's just as terrible. [I must add that I've been watching too much American Idol lately. It kind of "inspired" me.]      - A girl befriends the new boy in town who seems sweet and innocent and loves to play hide n' seek. But when he gets the main character and all the other young neighbors to play along with him, it's a fight for their lives as he attempts to kill everyone he "seeks".       And those are the only two ideas I have right now. I just really don't want to write about haunted houses or vampires unless I can come up with something more creative. But which idea is better...or do both of them suck? Are there any betters ideas...or anyway to tweak one of my own to make them more interesting?      Serious suggestions only. Thank you. :]

20090227092725AAIS6ml	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of this poem?	Although you are a friend of mine   and letters we exchange,   I wouldn't know you on the street,   and doesn't that seem strange?      You hold a place within my life,   unusual and unique;   We share ideals and special dreams,   and still, we do not speak.      I picture what I think you are,   perhaps you picture me.   An intriguing game for both of us   for someone we can't see.      So for this friendship we possess,   we owe this mail a debt,   Perhaps the charm lies in the fact   that we have never met.

Can someone please explain the difference to me in human terms?  I don't need links, I just need someone to explain it simply to me.  :)      The two confuse me.  I understand one uses photographic emulsion and one uses paint, but I don't know why or which.  I thought there was a type of printing where just paint was used - is that silk screening?        If so, how is screen printing different?  Does screen printing somehow use light to print images, since it calls for photographic emulsion?      ACK, I'm so confused!      Thanks in advance!
20090307183536AA0E8W2	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please everyone help???	Do you think these names match the personality?   Autumn-girl, girlish, friendly, brown hair, brown eyes, olive skin.   Noah-girl, tom boy, shy, short black hair, green eyes, white skin.   Edward-boy, friendly, nerdy but doesn't look it, brown hair, hazel eyes.   Max-boy, hot, braces, kind, outgoing, blond, blue eyes.   Odette-girl, mean, ugly, pimples, glasses, red hair, brown eyes, freckles, thinks shes cool.      This is for a book I'm writing by the way. If you want to read it I'll post a bit below:      I was just packing away my books when my phone rang.     “Mum”   “Autumn” she whispered   “Yes”   Then the line went dead. I looked at it a confused look on my face. Then shoved it in my bag.    “Ew look at the geek!” someone yelled.   I spun around but no one was looking at me. They were looking at the new boy. What was his name again?   “Noah, what’s up?” I yelled at my best friend when she came up behind the boy.   My best friend came over wobbling on the heels her mother makes her wear.   “Are you coming to art class?” she asked when she finally made it over here.   “Yes why wouldn’t I”   “I don’t know. What I do know though is that if my mother makes me wear these again I will break my ankle,” she complained   “Yeah. And you won’t tell her that why exactly”    “You know how she is, it’s high heel this pedicure that”   “You know you might get along with her if you go with her flow”   She laughed grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to our art class.                Our street seemed oddly quiet. I picked up my pace and started to run. By the time I reached my front door my lungs were burning with the effort to breathe properly. I scrambled around in my bag for the keys. Like the klutz I was I dropped them before I could open the door. I stepped inside and slammed the door behind me. I expected my mother to come out and see what was wrong. She didn’t. Afraid now I ran upstairs to look for her. She wasn’t in the bathroom, her room or mine. I flew back downstairs and looked around. I couldn’t find her anywhere. I went to the window to see if her car was in the driveway. It was so where was she. As I made my way over to the backdoor I heard a whimpering sound coming from the laundry room. I’d forgot about that. I picked up a pot plant that was on the table next to the laundry door, just in case, and slid the door open. I stepped in and froze. A scream stuck in my throat, I broke out into a sweat, and my head spun then the last thing I saw was the floor.

20090307182259AA5Z1S8	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you think that this sounds okay to you? (Party scene)?	This is just a part of my story. Alicia just got into a huge fight with her friends, and they told her that they hated her and all of this stuff at this party. She was running to get out of there when Cody grabbed her arm and stopped her. Could you please read this and tell me if you think that it sounds okay? I know that there will be grammar and spelling mistakes. Thank you.            I felt someone grab my arm, "Whoa. Where are you going like that?"      I stopped dead in my tracks. I turned around and saw him. It was him. The gorgeous guy from earlier at the street crossing and at the party in the door way. The gorgeous guy that smiled at me when he walked by. He was finally talking to me. For one second, I totally forgot where I was by looking in his deep brown eyes.      "Are you okay?" He asked and dropped my arm that he was still holding, "You sure were running."      "Oh, umm..." I looked down at the floor trying to think of something to say, "I was just..."      He smiled looking at me and stretched out his hand, "My names Cody."      I looked back at him and shook his hand, "Alicia."      "Do you want something to drink?" Cody asked walking into the kitchen, I noticed that he hadn't let go of my hand. He was still holding it. I could so get use to this. But why would he want to?      "Umm.. Sure." I said back real fast catching up to walk by his side.      When we reached the kitchen, he grabbed to bottles of bud light and opened one of them for me. I wasn't one to drink. I was completely against it because of my mother and her binge drinking lifestyle. But what the heck? Things couldn't get any worse and I swear, when am I ever going to do something like this again? Everyone is doing it.      "Thanks." I said before I took a big long drink.      Cody took a drink of his and leaned up against the kitchen counter, "No problem."      "Are you a friend of Savanna's?" I asked him, I had never seen him before in my life. I wanted to know who he was and why he was here?      "No. But I am a friend of Trace." He said back to me.      I rolled my eyes and took another drink of beer and said, "Meeting you is the only positive thing Trace has ever done for me."      Cody laughed and said, "I suppose you don't like him."      "Like him?" I said laughing, "I absolutely despised him. He is going out with my best fri-" I had to stop myself, she wasn't my best friend anymore, "Well, I mean ex-best friend."      "Yeah, I saw what happen. I'm sorry." He said in a really soothing tone. No one had ever say they were sorry to me before. Never. Just Savanna, and sometimes I knew she didn't mean it. But when he said it, it actually felt like he did.      "You saw that?" I asked him, I wish he hadn't. I didn't want him to see my friends ganging up on me. I probably looked pathetic.      "Yeah, and for what it's worth, I'm totally on your side." Cody said, taking a drink of his beer after he was finished.      I looked over at him, I couldn't believe what I was hearing.      "I know Trace, and he can be selfish. I know that Savanna hangs out with him a lot too, so I figured she probably don't spend that much time with you." When he was finished, I just shook my head and took another drink of my beer.      "You hit it right on the head." I said laughing.      He laughed and sat his beer down, "Hey, do you want to dance?"      I knew that I should probably just leave and go home. I knew that I shouldn't do it. But inside I didn't care anymore. My mother hates me. My friends hate me. I practically hate myself.      "Yeah, I would love to dance with you." I said taking another drink of my beer before setting it down.      I smiled as he took my hand and led me to the living room where the dance floor was sparkling with disco lights.

20090307184311AA3Fg8y	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Any advice on writing a book where the main character is sixteen and PREGNANT?? (10 points!!!!?)?	Ok, so I am currently writing a novel on this website. I have currently finished originally writing chapters 1, 2 and 3. The girl isn't a whore or anything, she is prgnant by her ex boyfriend, and her new boyfriend is supporting her a little bit *too* much, being obsessive, etc. and she lives with her Step Mom and her Dad. Her real Mom has a 'replacement' family and later in the book they reconcile (on there due date, she helps her get through it and they come together and her Mom and Dad and Step Mom and (other) Step Dad become friends at the end of the book. In Chapter 4, the whore girl who broke her and her ex boyfriend up (he was cheating on the pregnant girl with him) is going to beat her up (in other words a cat fight) and her Dad signs her up for a tour of the school. In chapter 5, the pregnant girl goes to the school. Her tour guide is honor roll student, and the principals son, who happens to be really nice and really hot. In chapter 5 she is about 4 months pregnant. They go out for lunch and start hanging out (as friends) but, then the pregnant girl (Veronica) starts to fall in love with him (he has loved her ever since he first saw her [like love at first sight....or something]). After that, I barely have any ideas. In chapter 3 she wants to have an abortion and almost does and then backs out. Since her Step Mom can't have a baby, I was thinking that she gives the baby to her, idk though.   HELP PLEASE!!!! Also I know she has to face the option of adoption. Any interesting couples (besides gay, since that was used in "Secret Life"), that can want to adopt the baby and add some more dramma to the novel????   I will give ten points!!!!

What mood does it create for you? Thanks :)      Setting: The Abbot stands in front of a table. Three aristocratic figures sit around the table facing him. It is dark. Candlesticks are aglow, black drapes are drawn behind the table. Shadows are cast on the walls.          Abbot      It is no doubt a frosty night to call upon you so   Late as it is, my noble friends.   Forgive this man whose beard comes whiter each day   Whose memory fails and falters.   Had I known a better choice, or livelier alternative   I would have died a thousand times   Turning and then burning   Than summon you here on a cold November Eve.      Yet every setting sun is but one occasion lost   A slipping chance from our unclenching fists.   How regretful!   And if conduct can be crime then so   Some acts undone are well-committed crimes   And not to act is enough treason   To incur the holy wrath.      So, let me call for your attention   Undivided and complete   As I divulge my troubles recent   Which pain my heart and tear   Me.      PAUSE      Senior A      Many troubles, Father Abbot   Have moved us to grieve, of recent   The poor are chained with heavier fetters   Of which even wild beasts are free   And the rich do not sleep soundly   Any longer, but nightmares of revolution   Rattle them in their sleep.      Senior B      True. True. Difficult times.   One cannot help but wonder   In these sweet words the poet speaks   "What troubled storms and icy winds   This Our Lady of December brings?"      A MELANCHOLIC FLURRY OF NODS   SENIOR C GETS TO HIS FEET      Senior C      When the coffers are empty, My Lords   And the spiders spin their webs   In the nooks of what were   Olden palaces, gilded stairs   And crystal chandeliers   ‘Tis then we can truly grieve.      Senior A      What do you imply?      Senior C      Let us not shed tears of fear   But lift a finger!   Are we not the pride of Salamanca?   We, skilled wizards, have   Done wonders before   Time and again   Day in and day out!   Our smiles cultivated fields   Our scowls shook the earth!   If heaven disfavours us today   Then let us act with   What little favour   She has thrown our way!      ALL BANGING ON THE TABLE (IN AGREEMENT) SENIOR C RETURNS TO HIS SEAT      Abbot      I am glad I witness this   Sure sign of fortitude   Which my noble friend expresses   In so fine a language.      Gladder, that I find us all agreed   On the course we are to take   To challenge the crises   That threaten to shake   The very foundations   Of our ancient institutions.

I don't like romance but so far loved reading books like My Best Friend's Girl,Island of Lost Girls and Inside out girl. Any other suggestions?

He, the blackbird, he am I,   Bird beloved of the wild deer.          Comes the deer to my singing.      From the Mountain Black,   From the summit,   Down the trail, coming, coming now,          Comes the deer to my singing.      Through the blossoms,   Through the flowers, coming, coming now,          Comes the deer to my singing.      Through the flower dew-drops,          Coming, coming now,          Comes the deer to my singing.      Through the pollen, flower pollen,          Coming, coming now,          Comes the deer to my singing.      Starting with his left fore-foot,   Stamping, turns the frightened deer,          Comes the deer to my singing.      Quarry mine, blessed am I   In the luck of the chase.          Comes the deer to my singing.             Comes the deer to my singing,          Comes the deer to my song,          Comes the deer to my singing.

20090307194044AA9StZj	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I have a question about writing a series, trilogy, or just two books?	So, a series is more than three books right? In a series, each book has to have a different goal, right? Like what the characters are trying to achieve, whether it be love or some sort of gadget, they have to be different in each book, right? Please enlighten me on this.      A trilogy is three books...I know that. But in those three books, can I have different goals in each book? I know LOTRs was all about destroying a ring....but can my trilogy have one goal for each of the three books?      And lastly, writing two books. If I write one, would the second be called a sequel? What exactly would be the point of a sequel? Can I do a sequel to a book if I just want to explore with the characters (with a plot of course) some more?      I am wanting to do a trilogy but maybe just two books. I haven't decided yet.

Okay, so I am writing a book and can you please be honest.. is it good so far? here it is.. enjoy..                  As I walked down the long street to the bus stop, I thought to myself. Okay Sapphire, try not to do anything stupid or embarrasing today. Just get through the day, and you’ll be fine. But there are very good chances, that that will not happen. So, I just kept on walking, and prayed not to trip, or end up at the curb with my pants around my ankles (Luckily, I wore a belt today).      When I got to the curb,  I realized that everyone was either talking to friends, or  listening to music, so I just stood in the back and waited. The bus finally pulled up, and everyone piled in. When I got in, there weren’t many seats to choose from. I looked around and saw a seat with a beautiful brunette girl, about my age, sitting in it. I built up enough courage to go over and ask “May I sit here?”     “Um, sure,” she said and smiled, “Hi, I’m Ruby.”     “Hi Ruby, I’m Sapphire.” I said with a smile back. All though, I was still a little nervous, I started to relax.     “So, you new here?”      “Yeah, I just moved here last week.

20090307194852AAoYBwH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is my writing any good?? or should i just quit now?	Adalie woke to the sound of rain dripping into large metal buckets. The roof of her house had many missing shingles and when it rained it often leaked. It didn’t help that her house was on the edge of a rather dismal lake, which seemed to make it rain heavier there than anywhere else. The dripping of the rain was pleasant tho, and although her nose was cold, the rest of her body was warm and toasty under her heavy quilt, and she wished she could sleep just a little bit longer. Sighing, she kicked off her covers and ran to empty the buckets. There were chores to be done, and on top of that she didn’t want her bedroom to flood and give her any more work to do. With that done she pulled on her heavy galoshes, threw on her raincoat and went to milk Nanny.      It was cold outside and windy. The fog rolling around the lake enveloped her house and made it hard to see. Luckily she didn’t need to go very far. Adalie ran into the lean-to and slammed the door. “We really should make an entrance from the house,” thought Adalie as she grabbed a handful of alfalfa. “M-e-e-e-h,” Adalie bleated very much like a goat. The snowy white goat trotted to her outstretched palm and started crunching. Adalie pulled up her stool and bucket and milked her. Then she raked the floor and added clean wheat straw. She checked the chicken coop for eggs and found three which she promptly stuck into her pockets. She patted the goat between the horns, then picked up the milk bucket and headed back to the house.   “How many eggs did you get?” asked her father as she came into the house.   “Three, one for each of us,” she replied.   Her father was a tall man. He had a shock of black hair over a weathered and stern face, his voice was gruff, and his eyes sad but he treated his girls very kindly. Everyday he tended the neighbors many goats. Once he had had as many, maybe even more, but much time has passed since then and now he only owns the one she goat. That goat gave them milk and cheese. Their few hens provided breakfast. “Perhaps I should buy another hen,” he suggested.   “We cant afford it,” replied Kader. “Besides, 3 eggs is plenty enough for us.”   Her sister, Kader was almost 17, more than five whole years older than she was. Kader was tall and beautiful in a way that Adalie was not. Where Adalie was tall and thin, Kader had round soft curves. Her hair was the color of warm honey and not the drab dark color the rest of the family had. Since their mother passed away it was she who ran the house. She alone made sure the house was clean, that there was food to eat, and that Adalie behaved. Already the floors were swept, the stove blazing hot and water heating up for the midday stew. Coffee was already steaming in three mugs. Now she took the eggs away from Adalie and proceeded to cook them. Kader scrambled them up with the rich goat milk and added cheese and chunks of onion and peppers. She divided it among the 3 of them giving their father the bigger portion. Along with the eggs they each had a hunk of bread, that although a little stale, was just fine toasted a bit and dunked in the dark sweet coffee.   “mmmmm,” mumbled Adalie.   “Delicious omelet Kader,” said her father as he stood up and put his cap on. Rain or shine the goats always needed tending. Rapid knocking came from the front door. Her father opened it and there stood Landric the neighbor’s son.   “The goats have got loose, Bill, he exclaimed. “It seems the storm broke a section of the fence and they have all wandered off.”   “I’m off to work girls,” he said.   “Bye Pa,” mumbled Adalie her mouth full of food.   Kader helped her father with his coat all the while shyly sneaking peeks at the young man who had arrived for her father.   “Good morning Kader,” said Landric. “Are you well?”   “Yes, thank you, Good morning,” she blushed.   He wished Adalie a fine day as well then he and their pa headed off to the pastures.   Adalie put all the dishes in the sink to be washed. “How can you like him?” said Adalie as she scrubbed. “He’s stiff and boring, plus his ears stick out.”   Kader laughed. “He is sweet, and honest, and works hard,” she replied. “Plus he has a cute rear,” She was promptly wacked on the head by the dish towel.      The two girls finished washing the breakfast dishes, then pulled out a big wooden chest from Kader’s room. Inside were yards and yards of lovely crimson silk, covered in lace and little china buttons. It had been their mothers wedding dress and now it was to be Kaders. They got to work finally finishing all the sewing and measuring that had taken them months to complete. “Try it on, Kader,” said Adalie. The dress was beautiful. It had puffed sleeves and a tight lace bodice. A row of tiny china buttons went all the way down the back. The skirts were wide and full and trailed the tiniest bit. Adalie whistled, “You are going to look real grand like at your wedding.”      Kader blushed like always at the mention of the upcoming wedding. Young Landric had asked for her hand nearly 5

I get these feelings sometimes like my life is planned out. Some things I can tell will happen in the future. Like there is this guy who is just a random person I know and I can tell he will be the person I marry when I get older and I can tell that my best friend who is the sweetest person in the world is gonna turn on me by the end of the school year. And I can tell that my sister and her husband are going to have a baby in another year. Is there something wrong with me?!? Has anyone else ever felt this way?

20090307193407AA34pWy	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like this preface?	Preface   I knew that death was the only way to stop my grieving so now that its here I won’t grieve it. I’m sure I’ll miss my family and friends but how could I ever life without her. Without him.        I saw the terrified look in my friend’s eyes. Why should they die for something I foolishly did? I led them there and if they weren’t fast they’d never get away.         Dumbly I believed them. I believed that they could bring her back. I took the bait and became the fisherman.        I was ashamed. Hopefully they would satisfy there needs with me and leave my loved ones alone. My face portrayed shock I could feel it. Obviously when I jumped in front of my friends they would attack me for interfering. I’ve seen it happen. Would they stop because of their son? I pondered that thought but decided they wouldn’t care. He was the one that led me here. He was the bait. I felt used.       Because of you.      Any advice would be great.

20090307190109AABL6Iy	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem?	Abigaile's Number.      Her feelings burn in a quiet ripple under her skin;   Dancing around in her mind,   They taunt with whispered threats of exposing the darkening cloud inside her.   Thorns erode on all sides,   Keeping her heart out of chagrin.      Her spirit is cloaked in sadness,   And her soul wandered far off a long, long time ago.   She is one with the moon;   Ever changing in appearance.   The chains which bind her are her callousness.      The beautiful wings always flutter just out of her grasp,   The gentle petals fall swiftly to the ground.   She is too hidden beneath the mountain to catch a ray of sunshine,   Though it shines, and shines, and shines.   Her eyes have been clouded by fear.      The darkening crypt lingers around every bend;   Taking her deepest terror and echoing them in her footsteps.   She understands nothing of her own thoughts.   Neither can she unravel a note of reminiscence.   Which will only lead her to the end.      ---      You can also read/comment here:    http://www.poemofquotes.com/members/dark...       Thanks!

Read what ive written and tell me what you think, i know im young but i can take any critisism you throw at me.   Thanks a bunch          Ari sat alone on his bed, his back against the cold concrete wall. He watched the patterns the rain reflected on the wall through the bedroom window, the city lights flashed different colours between cars driving by on the busy street, hypnotized by his own personal light show.    He felt detached from his body, off in another world where his emotions and thoughts had taken control of him. Today was his birthday, and a sudden wave of depression washed over him as he remembered all the birthdays before. When his parents had been there to celebrate it with him. He thought back to last year when he had gotten nothing more than a handful of crumpled five dollar bills from his mother, all the way back to messy dinosaur ice cream cake and racing car wrapping paper. But that was a long time ago, back when they had been a real family, when his parents loved each other, when they loved him.    His thoughts were interrupted by an obnoxious ringing in the next room, Ari sighed, trying to pull himself out of his thoughts and back into reality as he walked slowly towards the ringing.    After a minute of searching, he pulled the cordless phone out from underneath a pile of papers on his mothers desk.                  Theres a little bit more, but i dont want it to be too long.

20090307191113AAJBwby	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Okay My friend is trying her hand at writing a book...?	I honestly think that she shouldn't quit her day job...   I was wondering your opinions on this... :D if you dont want to read past the like 1st word i dont blame you...          Chapter 1          I watch every day pass as I go along as I’m not different. Like I’m not a were-poodle. I look at the world and the regular people and I envy them. They live regular lives and they get to have everything I have been denied. They get a regular family, regular friends, and they don’t turn into a poodle at the full moon and when they get angry. When I look at my friends with their boyfriends and girlfriends, I envy them. They have someone to love them. Whether it is for a few days or years, they have someone. I have no one. Everyone I fall in love with either dies or leaves me. Every time I get close to anyone they are taken from me.       My phone rings while I’m thinking so I just ignore it; if its important they’ll leave a message. I just don’t feel like talking to anyone. I do this every once in a while. There are times where I just disappear for awhile where no one can find me. It gives me time to think, time to be myself. I can’t be myself anywhere else. Not even my own home. People are always watching my house looking for something unusual, some proof that I’m not human. I have to hide anything that might suggest that I’m more than human. Anyone could be my enemy. Anyone could want me dead. Anyone could be a slayer (which, despite rumors, kill any supernatural being, not just vampires). I can only trust the few people I call my friends.       My thoughts drifted to the girl of my dreams, the beautiful Hebe. She is the most beautiful girl in the world and she doesn’t even know I exist. I keep trying to get her attention, but she ignores me. Why do I care if she ignores me? Why do I care if she knows who I am? I know I shouldn’t try to get her attention, but I cant help it. I love her, but I cant involve her in my life. I wont sentence her to live her life with someone who turns into a pink poodle. I might not be able to live with her, but that does not mean I can’t admire her from afar.      Just to let you know i spared you 3 more paragraphs of useless nonsense. Please tell me your opinions on her writing and tell me whether or not to tell her that she sucks...

In that moment, I didn’t care what would happen.  I relished the time I had.  I had spent it well.  I knew that no matter what happened, the choice…the possibility was always in my mind.    But it didn’t matter- no, it never did.  This was never anything that I contemplated.  Because in those six impeccable months I was given, I had lived.  It was enough.  I had spent my time the way I always wish I would.    I was given more than deserved.  I was enclosed in something so vast and divine, it was unrealistic for me.    But it was reality.    I did whatever it took- to keep them safe.  To keep all of them safe.  Even though it was a trade for my own life, they would be safe!  These were my happy thoughts, while I faced the vileness.    Even though I couldn’t walk away- they could!  They would be breathing the moist air of Astoria.    Going to Astoria was the best thing I had ever done in my life.  I knew that my life was over…in a matter of minutes…but I didn’t regret the decision I had made in January.  I was thankful, grateful to myself for going to Astoria.    I also felt no guilt for sacrificing myself.    No, sacrificing wasn’t the accurate word.    Giving myself up.  Accepting the consequences.  But I never took my decisions back.  And I would do them again.  Over and over.  For all eternity.  Until the end of my existence…which wasn’t much longer.    I was frightened; I was noble enough to accept that.  I wasn’t planning on facing death with a valiant look adorned on my face.  I was scared.  I was terrified.  I would look at my fate, and shudder.    If I was given one last request, I knew what it would be.  The answer was so evident!    I would re-live those months.  Not change one detail, just re-live them.  They were the happiest, preeminent, perfect, incomparable, peaceful times of my life.  And even though they were “wrong” according to the dark, wicked, killers beneath me, they weren’t wrong to anyone else.  I was satisfied, content with everything.    The content feeling washed through me abruptly.  It tingled my fingers and my toes.  Incongruously, I smiled.  It wasn’t a smile of happiness.  It was a smile that I was doing the right thing.  In my mind, anyway.    While the feeling was still there, I plunged into the dark, deep, terrifying water.    I met my fate.  I met my destiny.  My eyes burned as the salt water flew itself into my petrified, widened eyes.    I was unharmed by the water.  I didn’t know if it was burning hot, or freezing cold.  My content, satisfied emotions acted as a shield.  A barrier that blocked out everything but the feeling of gratitude to my past months.    I would remember them forever.  And with the hope of going to haven that I grasped so tightly in my palms, I would retain everything I experienced.  It was all too beautiful to forget.  I wouldn’t allow myself to forget.    I opened my eyes, and faced my killers.  They grinned, wickedly at my face.    My face was stiff and hard.  But not angered.    The calmness was almost overwhelming; I was surprised at myself.  I was staring into the twisted faces of my soon-to-be-killers, and calmness was my only emotion.  But it didn’t matter.  I was at ease.  Because even in our darkest hours, we still have hope, some tiny persistence that pushes us forward, to our goal.  And even with my inevitable ending, in my darkest hour, I was able to find light at the end of the tunnel.  I still had my hope.    Then, I lost my air.  It was thrown out of me as if a boulder was thrown onto my back.  I was being crushed- angrily and forcefully.    As death slowly and painfully took it’s toll-I was still content.  Still happy, still at ease.    Because none of it mattered.  I was still happy because the person I loved more than my own existence- more than anything else, would be safe.    My eyes dimmed, and all I saw was blackness.  I sunk deeper and deeper into the water, and heard the laughter of my malicious killers.    It was over- I was over, and I was content.

20090307184913AAbpjvM	Arts & Humanities;History	American History - Family Rivalries / Gangs?	I remember watching the History Channel and saw this documentary about these two families.  They would kill each other whenever they saw each other.  Reminded me of a gang but it was between two houses of actual families, kinda like Romeo and Juliet: Montagues vs Capulets.  The time period: my educated guess would be after Civil War and before Al Capone, but the people didnt' look like cowboys tho.  They did use old school bolt rifles and 6-shooter revolvers.  Anyone have any information on any American family rivalries like this?  The documentary made it seem unique and almost legendary so perhaps its the only popularly known American family rivalry?

20090307190210AAwDcF0	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I am an aspiring writer and would like to know what unbiased people think of my writing. Is this good?	Hello everybody!         I am 17 years old and attempting to write a novel in the romance/ suspense genre ( If Twilight comes to mind, I will admit that wretched book has claimed me as well... Don't worry, I don't plan on writing a Twilight rip-off). While it is about vampires, I've managed to bypass the cliche of the situation by suggesting dark religious undertones with a sort of twist through out it. I am hesitant to describe the plot on the internet, so I've posted a piece that needs little explanation. This was a prologue to my story ( I chose not to use it because it was too melodramatic) and is told by a girl ( who is in high school- NOT A MARY-JANE, I SWEAR! I've taken great pains to make sure that I am not describing myself :). The plot isn't really important ( and not even fully developed), but it is crucial for me to know if I have "what it takes" to take on a novel.          My writing experience: Two articles published on my high school newspaper, one short story currently being converted into a short film for my school film class, and three works on Fanfiction. Aside from the tons of essays I have to write for my AP classes, I really don't write much for other people to read. I'm curious to know if my writing is up to par...            The following is something I wrote months ago. I realize it is amateurish in its style and content, and way too passionate ( I mean, who really thinks/talks this way?), but I simply want you to analyze my skills.             Thank you. :)                                                          1.          Never has my entire state of being revolved around a place so vile and utterly despicable as hell- and yet, the very thought of the scorching inferno makes my blood burn with an intensity I never thought possible.           Fire was never something I could describe as beautiful before- I had always regarded it as a source of destruction and inevitable pain. Now, the element has taken me with its hypnotic dance. Enthralled me. Cruelly enchained me with searing iron, and etched an ugly pattern into my freshly burned skin.          It is with smoldering tears that I tell this story. Writing about my fall from grace I believe will be the easiest part- it is the bedlam that I had to leave, and its effect on me that is the most painful to remember. It is my unbelievably stupid decisions that suffocate my throat, and the unfair events that really make me choke on bile.         I hope that seeing the ridiculous events on paper can make the entire fantasy a believable reality. What I was thrust into was neither slow nor kind- quite frankly, it was hell. However, now that my nightmare turned dream has ended, I am afraid of losing it in the bleak world I had guiltily been happy to leave. Sadly, the life I’d known since childhood had been incredibly boring, which is why my kidnapping wasn’t a total regret- but a blessing disguised as a sin.        I don’t know if writing about my experiences is the wisest choice- if somebody were to read my work, that person would surely tell my parents, my church, the school and the local neighborhood watch. I would no longer be the perfect Christian child, and the epitome of gentle grace. I would be a monster of the worst kind. A girl possessed and in dire need of an exorcism. I don’t care anymore. If I had read these words five months prior, I would have fainted on the spot and lapsed into a religious fervor of archaic tongues and convulsing repent…           Such ideals no longer apply to my every thought. The bright light of the orange flicker doesn’t make me flinch anymore-Smiling; I would place my longing kiss on the seductive flame.            Okay, I'm ready for constructive criticism. What's the verdict?

My family is italian, and when my grandfather died, I was given the necklace that he wore every day for his whole life. It is a gold necklace, and the pendant is a boat steering wheel behind the head of a woman wearing hoop earrings. It looks as though she has some sort of mask covering her eyes. I have been told by my mother that it is "The Lady of Sorrento", and legend has it that she is a blind woman who guides all of the lost sailors home safely. I am not sure that my mother is correct-- the necklace came from my fathers side. I cannot find anythinggggg about her on the internet, and I would assume that this necklace was made special for my grandfather, or something similar, because of the scarcity of literature on it.

20090307155824AANY3oR	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	An excerpt from my story--fight scene?	yeah, yeah, I know. "Come read my work! blah blah blah." horribly annoying, but I'm deadly curious to hear feedback on this. I've taken writing classes before and it became very apparent that I suck at poetry and never developed very far in prose, but I'd love to finish this story one day. I appreciate any and all comments. Be as brutal as you can. I can take it!      This bit comes out of some place between the beginning and middle of the fuller story, so the two named characters involved have been introduced already.       The woman tried to scream, but was choked off by something. Cory tried the knob and found it was unlocked. Inside, she saw three figures struggling in the dark. One was the woman being held tightly around the throat by one hand of a tall dark figure with glowing eyes. The third figure was Peter. Cory recognized his bowl cut and protruding nose instantly. He was circling the other two cautiously and lashing out with his hands at the tall man as if he had claws. His eyes gleamed dimly in the light coming in through the windows.    Cory was confused, but excited to participate. She closed the door behind her and slung her back pack towards the wall. Freeing the woman was her first priority, so she ran to where the man was holding her and drew her dagger. The man saw her coming, but was preoccupied with Peter, who was tearing at the man’s throat, relentlessly. Cory grabbed the man’s fingers to pry them off the woman, but he had her so tightly that the poor lady had gone unconscious. With her dagger, Cory stabbed him through the fore arm—separating his ulna and radius—and dragged the dagger down towards his hand to rip it apart and render it useless. The man yelled out in horror and dropped the woman who fell to the floor without movement. Peter’s eyes were glowing brightly now. He seized the opportunity and lunged at the man. The two fell to the floor on the other side of Cory. She decided to let them duke it out and took this moment aside to see if the woman was still alive.    Peter tore at the man’s throat and face while pinning him to the ground, but was only able to do superficial damage before the man struggled free and threw Peter against Cory, knocking them both down. He stood up tall above them. His left arm was hanging useless in two parts and bleeding profusely, but he seemed to have more energy and strength than before. His eyes were glowing white against his shadowed figure and Cory had a split second to wonder if he was the Jaggar beast before he leaped at her and Peter both. The two of them rolled out from under his aim and took up standing positions on either side of him. He turned on Cory first, drawing himself up to his full height and glaring at her with those eyes. His features were illuminated by the street lamps shining through the window. He looked like an ordinary man—a very huge, enraged, and snarling man. If she wasn’t so thrilled to be in battle, she would have been terrified. He came at her and grabbed her right arm with such a tight grip, she had to drop her dagger to release the pressure in her muscles and hold back a scream. He rammed her against the wall with the full force of his body and pinned her there. Then he let go of her arm to grab her throat as if to rip her trachea out.    Picking up Cory’s dagger, Peter stabbed the man’s back just to right of his spinal cord. It went in up to the handle, and Peter didn’t have time to pull it out before the man, crying out in pain, dropped Cory and turned on him. Cory fell to the floor stunned and choking. She was blacking out from the lack of oxygen so she dropped her head to the floor to try to get some blood flow. The man threw Peter across the room and immediately went to the woman still lying unconscious or dead on the floor.

Do you know any techniques on how to prevent this from happening again?

You welcome it with a sad face,   that crunches on the victorious,   and smolders the new race.      You crumble in fear,   and hold your breath,   for they are near.      They find your wicked heart   raging with cuts and black blood   and they buckle it up to the cart      They see it is gnarled from the pain   looking very grotesque   for it is staid

20090307205526AA4HxBa	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is the point of life? Is it to please your body? Through many forms "love, money, religion, drugs" etc.?	If we look at the big scheme of things, humans have existed for such a short time, compared to the universe as a whole. Not only that, but even within earth, there are 6.7 billion people. SO, what is the purpose of 1 out of 6,700,000,000. I noticed a relative of mine, in his 50's. He has kids, a family and also successful. You know, he plays games on a computer, cell phone, etc... To connect those things: If you think about it, your life does not make any difference in the scheme of things. What you do has no effect on the Universe, not even on earth. No matter what you do, you will still die. So, is life really about pleasing your body? In whatever form you chose to do this? Are you, "the brain" in control, or does the body really use the brain to find better ways of pleasing itself... This is sad...

20090307164641AAbXgNd	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	In Breaking Dawn, how did  Edward get Bella pregnant?	First, he's vampire which means that his blood isn't pumping, which makes it impossible for him to get an erection. Without an erection, he wouldn't even be able to have sex in the first place, let alone get Bella knocked-up.   Second, he's dead. So, he wouldn't have any living cells in his body. Sperm is living so Edward wouldn't be able to produce any since he's dead.   Does no one else see the flaw in Meyer's writing? This being only one of numerous flaws throughout the series.

My grandfather had always told me that he was half German and half English. But as I was looking through my family tree i noticed that his grandmothers name was different. It was Ola Jane Van Neman. I looked up Van and they said that it doesn't exist in the German language, and it certainly isn't English. But it was Dutch. Then he said that he thought she was Dutch and was born in the Netherlands. But his family doesn't keep records so I do all the geneology myself. What do you think, is it Dutch, German, or I was also thinking Polish, if they have Van in the Polish language? Of course he is still both German and English by his other grandparents.

20090307195619AA7qmEZ	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	What would you do in my shoes?	Ok so I taught dance for 4 years at the same studo, only thing is the original owner sold the studio to someone after I had worked there for 2 years. There is a big rival dance studio that was always competing with us. I ended up quitting teaching because I moved to a different town, got pregnant, and now am a mom. Well I am to the point where I want/need to go back to work. I went job hunting today and nothing sounded very promising. I would never go back to work at the old studio I worked at because the newer owner was horrible to work for. I decided to go check at the rival studio to see if they needed a teacher. Well the owner of that studio wants to hire me. My problem is, the lady who first opened the studio I used to work at told me and all the other teachers that she did not want us working at the rival studio. I really need a job though and they want me to teach there. I am pretty good friends with the lady who doesn't want me to work there and I am scared she's going to be mad when she finds out. Should I go for this job or pass it up because the other lady wouldn't want me to take it. I mean she sold her studio so I don't understand why she would care sooo much, I guess its just because she started that studio and wants to see it get a lot of success. Hope I didn't confuse anybody. I think I'm just stressing myself out over nothing but what do you all think?

Okay, so its at a community theatre but there's some pretty amazing talent there, and the people who usually get leads are pretty well trained.      Its the junior version, so the cast is composed of teenagers. I want to audition for Belle! (i do actually look like her!) So please      what should i wear?   (there is a very very basic dancing audition which i should have no problems with) Should i wear like a blue ribbon or something?      What song should i sing?    i have a strong falsetto, like its not whispery or anything and its effortless but i need to use it a fair bit, and in my opinion my voice is high but i have no training...the audition is in a few months, should i get trained?      Thanks a lot!

My topic is the modeling industry and i am examining the positive and negative sides of the industry...the positive being that it inspires young girls to be fit and have confidence, and it aids the American economy.   The negative side is that it causes health disorders like anorexia, bulimia, and low self esteem because of the "perfect woman" image ideal.      For a specific part of the project, I need to create original artwork that portrays my subject. I can make anything I want, it just has to be original and I have to make it within a day.

20090307175533AAxBbM2	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can someone please judge my vilanelle :-)?	Memory Lane         Alone stands a house upon the hill,   pale light cast upon rubble heaped.   The souls of occupants live on still.      Silver memory seeps ‘oer window sills,   ‘ever dancing hand in hand with time.   Alone stands a house upon the hill.      Ghosts will roam empty halls until,   heavenly spiders tire of spinning web.   The souls of occupants live on still.      The rhythmic churning of a fallen mill,   echoes long in the chasms of my mind.   Alone stands a house upon the hill.      By ghosts no bedroom shall be left un-filled;   retracing the steps of their ancient lives.   The souls of occupants live on still.      And forever searching for my lover Jill,   I now turn away from that queer place where,   alone stands a house upon the hill.   The souls of occupants live on still.
