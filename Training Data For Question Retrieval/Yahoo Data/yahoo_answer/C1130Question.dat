I had a baby a few months ago and a hairstylist told me that during pregnancy your hair can lose protein. Is that my problem? I have very frizzy hair and it's sometimes dry and itchy. Are there any products out there (decently priced, please!) that work great to replace protein?

20090222144456AApqb0g	Beauty & Style;Hair	How do I get my bangs to stay like this...?	My hairstyle looks very similar to this:       http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/famecrawl...       But whenever I wash my face, I need to put on a headband to keep the hair out of my face. However, when I take it off, my bangs get messed up and they look really weird. They "swoop" in the opposite direction so my bangs are around my forehead instead of covering it. I can't get it to swoop the right way unless I shower and dry my hair again. How do I blow it to make that curve?

20090222145743AAxxfMY	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Random images to add to a floral backpiece?	I'm compiling some ideas at the moment to send off to my artist so he can design a piece to go in a gap in the middle and then up the sides of my back around my existing tattoos to turn it into a backpiece. I've toyed around with lots of various ideas but I've eventually decided to have an assorted floral design in the gap and up a bit of the sides and then as it gets higher up it'll get more viney and leafy and then in the thin gap there is at the top of my back I want to bring it round into a sort of vintage border. (really difficult to explain lol). Anyway - I like the idea of having random images dispersed amongst the flowers just to break it up a bit. There's not too much room so it'll only be two or three things. Perhaps a bird, an old fashioned compass, any other ideas? No stars, hearts etc - either animals or random vintage objects.      And before anybody spurts the 'this should mean something to you' line - every tattoo I have on my body has the most significant meaning to me. I see them as serious pieces. This is just for merely decorative purposes. To make my back look a little more feminine, and add some colour to myself because so far I've only got black and greyscale tattoos. And something to have a bit of fun with. So just chuck some ideas at me, see if there's anything I haven't thought of!

20090222152959AA5FgRG	Beauty & Style;Hair	Is it good to leave conditioner in your hair for 1 hour? please answer?	I have poofy/frizzy/thick/ damaged hair.        I asked before if mayonnaise and egg yolk is good for your hair... people said it does nothing and just smells bad.       So should I leave in a conditioner for 1 hour. I'd just put it on the bottom half of my hair, then rinse it all out with cold water.      I have these conditioners:   -Herbal Essences (Blue, hello hydration, AND Pink, dangerously straight, AND Red, Break's Over)   -Redken All Soft   -Tresemme Silky & Soft (or something...)   -Lots of pantene.. which I do not like.   -I also have 2 little tubes of this conditioner stuff... from Clairol.. When I dyed my hair about 2 months ago, it came with these little tubes.   It says "once a week color treat, enriched with aloe,      It seems really conditioning..         SO which conditioner do I use??? if it's good to leave conditioner in your hair for 1 hour....

I am probably getting sidebangs and layers, but I don't know exactly what I want. I have an ovalish shaped face, and I guess a big forehead, I don't want regular bangs because I just don't like it on me. Please give me some ideas!

20090222154120AANJghM	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Didn't tip the tattooist?	I just got my first tattoo the other day. The guy was super-nice and did a really good job. He told me he'd charge me $100/hr, and it would take 3 hours, but it ended up taking 3.5 hrs and he charged me $350. Since I paid with a card, and he rang it up for exactly that amount- I just left. I didn't have any cash for a tip. I'm thinking about it now- and feeling a little bad. I was thinking about sending him an email thanking him for doing a great job- and sending a good picture of the final image. Should I mail him $$? I live far away (was visiting my family)- and don't want to send cash through the mail. Would it be wierd to send a check? I don't know- should I feel bad- or is this ok?

I want to know how many of you girls out there use this on a guy whenever you're pissed off at him, and whether or not most of us guys can avoid it or not, because i couldn't. This chick slapped my face, but did it so i was totally thrown off. She gave me this cute smile and then had her hip out and real smooth put her left hand on it. THAT confused me. Then she whipped her opposite(right) hand out and slapped me. Ever used that move before? Saw a girl use it? And tell me whether or not the guy was able to avoid or block it? I can't. I want to know if that has, or does work on most of us. I hope not!

I've never had any problems with my face, I have had pretty good skin and got compliments from EVERYBODY, but I just couldn't commit to any cleansing products. I'm not using anything at the moment, just soap.   But right now I have the odd zits that comes and leaves a mark, or they end up getting flaky (just the zit area). My skin used to be perfect, but now it just looks blotchy.   I think I have normal skin, not too dry, not too oily, not sensitive. What would you recommend I use? Something that isn't like clinique where you have to do many consecutive steps with many different products, but rather something that's just a simple product or two, just a quick step or two.   Oh and I'm a 20 year old Female if that makes a difference.

(wtf?) so she didnt get them. like a week later she (no.2) calls me from stitches and says shes gonna get them and so she did. 5 mins later i went to get them. she ended up telling her friend (no.1) that she got them to make sure it was ok with her (nice). she was pretty mad and shes all like you lied to me, yur not being symathetic to my feelings, why dont you care about my feelings. and my friend( i was on the phone shes telling me all this..) (no.2) told her she wouldnt wear them to school just for her and shes like im gonna b mad anyway just knowing that you got them. and i was pretty pissed that she has the nerve to treat my friend that way when she was trying to b nice to her. anyway (no.1)  wore some things similar to mine a couple of times and i didnt get mad and shes acting so ridiculous. i mean y would you let a pair of pants affect yur relationship? i mean she was saying stuff like thats what made her, her (but she wears like aero and hollister..nothing against that...i have like one aero shirt lol) and if a pair of pants makes u who you are then yu really have like a problem.. i donno does anyone think i have a point? cuz honestly its an article of clothing..material..      thanxx<33

20090222111616AAkEgKa	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Cross tattoo, or other religious symbol...?	want to get a tattoo of a cross (or other symbol) on my forearm, but im not sure about the design of the actual tattoo.      I think I want Hebrews 15:3 underneath it which states "God has said, "never will I leave you never will I forsake you".      So I want a cross design with maybe something that looks like a depressed type of mood, but with hope...or someything like that.      Or just a really good cross design, or religious design for my forearm.      Thanks..      And I don't want to hear how getting a tattoo is a sin...I already have one, and I don't believe that it is a sin. A sin is something that seperates us from God, and in no way does me putting a cross on my arm seperate me from fellowship with God.      I also would appreciate that no one post unless it is going to HELP the topic.  Telling me I'm dumb for loving God doesn't help, and just shows immaturity.

Unfortunately, the hair stylist convinced me to get copper because no other color would show too well, for some reason. Anyways, when I get my hair done again, it would have been 3 weeks since my hair was dyed, I was just wondering if I got dark blonde and caramel highlights all over, put over some of the lighter blonde highlights, not all of them, and over the copper highlights, if that would be safe?

20090222120049AAdjgMn	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Can I still look pretty, even with a bumpy/long nose?	People everyday tell me that I'm really pretty. Apprerently, I have gorgeous eyes, and nice hair. But I almost feel like they're just saying this just to be nice! I used to not notice that I had a big nose, until I had a few people point it out to me. Now, whenever I take a picture of myself, all I seem to notice is how bumpy and long my nose is. It even makes my entire face look bad! Why do I suddenly feel this way? I used to not even know that I had a problem with my nose! I never really had much problems with my face! But now I do! Can I still be pretty, and guys, do you sometimes find long noses attractive? And what can I do to make my nose seem smaller? Thanks everyone :)

Now, im a 15 year old guy, im not emo or goth or anything, and i really want to shave my head into a mohawk (the Chuck Liddell style) during the school march break (which lasts a week in March). Now, my parents are strongly against it, saying "Youre gonna look like a monster", "Halloween is on October 31", "only freaks have that kind of haircuts", "Later youll have to shave your head" and "youre gonna make a fool out of yourself". Now, to be honest, i really dont care, whether my school mates laugh at me or not, the important thing, is that i like it. And i dont wanna look like a monster (even though i might look a little, but that haircut is still awesome!). So, how can i convince my parents with good arguments so they can allow me?

So, I end up using "ivory" makeup, and it looks a bit dark in the mirror, but not too bad.        However, natural lighting makes it appear orange -- always.        I was told this is because I'm using the wrong tone of makeup -- but I've tried samples of every base shade I can find, and everything does it.         Is there anything more I can do?

20090222133836AA8kRuK	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Horrible MAC cosmetics experience?	Yesterday I had my makeup done at the mac on queen in Toronto.    I've never had anything against mac stores, but I literally had the most horrible experience. The male that did my makeup was really rough and heavy handed with all of his brushes, even after I told him that it was scratching my face.       He didn't pay attention to my features at all and just applied something that looked very genetic, and didn't even do a good job at that.       My foundation looked clumpy, and he applied powder concealer under my eyes which just looked dry and disgusting.       I tired to work with him, and explain what I wanted, but he didn't listen to any of my requests. I don't want to hate, but next time I'll be doing my own makeup. I honestly wish that once he started being rough with the brush that I had just said thank you for your time and walked right out of there.       Has anyone experienced anything like this? Is this typical?   There are so many loyal mac lovers, and I was literally appalled by how horrible my experience was?

20090222144411AAISwsb	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Can I actually get rid of freckles?	I have had freckles since I was little. I am very pale, and have blue eyes, which means I burn easily. I wear sun cream with high factors, and try to stay in the shade as best I can. But I like the sun. I like being outdoors to play and swim and sunbathes. It makes my hair go blonder.         Is there any way I can get rid of these freckles? Or might they fade with time?

20090222145054AAXEOZK	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Do You Ever Take Shoes Off In A Restaurant Or Store & Put On Top Of Shoes?	I was waiting outside in the seating area for a table to eat at after church with my family. I was wearing a nice dress, and a pair of high heeled thong sandals. I put my toes over the thong straps.        A hostess, waitress, or whatever (I don't know her job) comes up to me and says "You got only one warning. Put your shoes back on all the way or we're going to ask you to leave."      It wasn't like I came in barefoot, or holding my shoes. My feet were not even touching the ground. I just had my toes out of the thong strap piece.      My bf's mom was pissed at hearing this lady yell at me. Then this lady yelled at someone else who was standing with one of their feet out of their shoes while paying for their meal.      So we went across the street to IHOP instead.      Does anyone else do this? Why do people take this so seriously? Someone putting their toes over their flip flops does not ruin the Chicken Kiev sitting in the oven at 400 degrees. Has anyone else been yelled at for this?
20090222145102AANbogS	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Where can I buy cheap blazers/vests?	I want to be more fashion-forward and high-fashion but I can only afford so much.  Usually blazers are like $300+!  Vests are like $95+!  Where can I find cheap stuff but NOT at places like Walmart, Steinmart, Marshall's, etc...      Also, I don't want the "fat man's blazer" where it makes you look fat because it's so loose and leaves room for fat people.  I want one of those slim-fit ones.  Same thing with the vest.

20090222152909AArzDpJ	Beauty & Style;Hair	Help me with my hair for work!?	I just got accepted at subway to work and anyone who sees girls working in Subway or has worked there, knows that we have to wear our hair up. My hair isn't very long, it's shoulder length with chin length bangs when it's curly and then my hair is about 3 inches past my shoulders when I straighten it <---- I always wear it straight. I can't really wear a pony tail because when I put it up I have just enough so it's all back but I end up with this silly looking little bit of hair puffed out at the back of my head. I can't make a messy bun or have a cute flowing pony tail or anything. Can anyone think of good ideas? so far I have been doing pigtails, the ones that are super low around the nape of your neck, I put it so they are right below my earlobe. It looks sorta cute. haha XD. I just wish I had more suggestions. Thank you so much! ^_^

20090222151236AANz0er	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Okay, I really need some help here. Minimizers, anyone?	I know it's not normal at all for a 13- year old girl to have a size 36C chest. I know this, and I notice it every day! I haven't found a bra yet that makes my chest seem any little bit smaller. I don't want to wear one that is like 5 sizes too small, because that's just painful. Is there a brand or a type of bra that will make me look about at least two number sizes smaller, or maybe even back down to a B? I've found a few really comfortable ones, but they are just that, and not what I'm really looking for. They're just 34 and 36 C bras. I really want my chest to look a bit smaller. Help? O.O

20090222145606AAKoZS9	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Grade 8 Grad Dress..?	Hello : )   So I'm in the eighth grade, and graduation is in a few months. I don't really feel comfortable in an over the top dress. Most of my friends already have their dresses, which are elegant, or sparkly..and just, not something I would wear. My sister had her grad 2 years ago, and is always telling me that I should get my dress soon, because they'll be out soon. I don't have a problem getting a dress now, it's just the concept of wearing a frilly dress or something scares me. My sisters' dress was pink, sparkly, and halter liike, most girls had the same type.   Honestly, I'd like to go in a casual dress, cardigan, and flats or something, but I'm being told that's too casual.    So my actual question : would a regular dress and cardigan, or a dress and leggings be too casual? Also, could someone post links or something, to what I should look for, something that isn't too dressy, but not too casual? Sorry if this is confusing, or doesn't make sense or something.   But thanks : )
