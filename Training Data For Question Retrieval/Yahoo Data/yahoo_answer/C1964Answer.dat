us8isFmiaa	When you plug your device's approved wall charger into a UPS or car inverter, it is not battery-to-battery. If it was, it probably would not be good. Both UPS' and inverters provide 117 volts AC, which is essentially the same as plugging into a 117 VAC wall receptacle. I would not be afraid to use a UPS or inverter to charge my cell phone or laptop this way. Maybe somebody will disagree with me...?|`|JuvkVZvnaa	It's more like battery to AV converter to transformer to battery <br>  <br>  Nothing to worry about.

In fact my TV only has slots for the white and yellow cables and it still works great.|`|1WgOj89kaa	All you have to do is change the settings on the PS3 to accomodate your TV Picture Quality and leads you are using. You did not need to buy another cable.|`|B2RMvj3zaa	First, you can't connect an HDMI cable if you don't have an HDTV...So that purchase was just a waste of about $40.00. Second, if the game needs to be run in a set resolution and you have a non HDTV, then either buy an HDTV, or you're beat.|`|djq4Jp49aa	Just use the regular AV cord that comes with the PS3 (red, yellow, white) or you can use an older cord from a PS1 or PS2, that has the coaxial plug, if you only have that on your TV.|`|AKttccOkaa	You'll have to Buy some sort of Adapter I suppose...

us8isFmiaa	The remote you are getting should work with your box, with some possible exceptions...<br>  Any Comcast remote, old or new, should control the basic functions of any box. However, an older remote may not have some of the functions to control a newer box, like DVR controls and tuner swap. You only need a code to program the remote for a TV, VCR, etc. I found instructions and codes for various Comcast remotes on their website. Sorry I do not have the URL, but I found it. You will just have to search for it.

us8isFmiaa	Good question. I don't think it has anything to do with the phone per se. I know that Verizon provides a way to block numbers on their residential land-line service. Contact your cell provider to see if they have that service.
bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	you dont really deauthorize an ipod only a computer is deauthorized.  He wont be able to add songs and keep the old ones because the music is on your computer.
p1dcw35Qaa	You have to set the ps3 menu to output whatever resolution your tv is (720p, 1080i, or 1080p). My best guess is that you have it set at 480i. Also, make sure the connections are all tight.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	If you have a good cable with good connections--and there's no reason to think you don't--you must make sure you are selecting the correct display output.  So when you tell the PS3 to output via HDMI you should also tell it to choose the resolution automatically.  But before you do that you can actually see what resolution the output is in.  Make sure that's at least 720p and you should be fine.  If it says you're in 1080p (for example) and you still have the fuzzy picture then I'd say the problem is outside of the PS3.
k0BF9M0Haa	Hmm well I suggest QuickPwn.com<br>  <br>  They've come up with a way to jailbreak up to a 2.x filmware so you should be good to go.<br>  <br>  I also advise you to look it up on YouTube for a visual aid.|`|AA11525080	That would depend on the firmware.
4Pk6VNftaa	The PS3 requires all games be burned onto blu-ray discs.  You're going to end up spending about $300 on a burner and a pack of 10 discs.  Oh, and you'll need a modchip...which I don't think exist for the PS3 at this time.   Oh, and don't forget that some PS3 games are upwards of 25 to 30GB in size, which on your average high-speed internet connection will take you well over 120 hours (that's over 5 consecutive days) to download.  That's 5 to 10 times longer than it'd take you to finish most PS3 games...<br>  <br>  So while you could probably find some idiots wasting their time ripping PS3 games for you to download and burn on expensive blu-ray R discs, you won't be able to use them.  But feel free to waste your time and money on a pointless - and illegal - activity.<br>  <br>  Seriously, if you want cheap PS3 games, just buy them off other people from eBay or Gamestop.  You'll pay less, and avoid the risk of  being sent to prison and/or being fined several hundred thousand dollars.  Buy it used, resell it, and your total cost can be way under $15 per game.|`|1WgOj89kaa	For the amount of money you would be spending, such as 300 for a burner, because PS3 is blu - ray, remember, and you will need a special chip as well.

lS9J9Nrpaa	As the proud owner of a BlackBerry Curve 8900 (and a previous owner of many Sony Ericsson phones), I have to say that a BlackBerry is the best kind of phone out there.<br>  <br>  But...it entirely depends on what you're looking for. If you want e-mail on the go, an advanced browser that beats the majority of other phones and an almost endless ability to customise your phone with external applications then get a BlackBerry.<br>  <br>  But while a BlackBerry excels in web surfing and e-mail, a Sony Ericsson will excel in other areas, such as the camera capabilities. The C902 is from the CyberShot range, which is clearly aimed at those who want to take decent photos with their phone. You will not find any BlackBerry that can match the CyberShot's range in terms of camera quality. Even the newest BlackBerrys available - the Bold 9000, Curve 8900 and Storm 9500 - only have 3.2mp cameras at the highest end, with the Bold only having 2mp. <br>  <br>  But then a BlackBerry is more aimed at the business user. The CyberShot range caters more for entertainment and media. I couldn't care less what kind of photos my mobile phone takes as I have a 12mp HD Kodak digital camera. It all depends on what suits your needs.<br>  <br>  But there is a saying that is absolutely true - once you've had a BlackBerry, there's no going back. I could never go back to a 'normal' phone after having my fantastic BlackBerry!|`|LzSj90pbaa	There are so many things wrong with this question.<br>  First, a blackberry is not a phone. A blackberry is a brand of phones. It is IMPOSSIBLE to compare a single phone to an entire fleet of phones.<br>  Second, what is your definition of the word 'better'. Are you wanting an easy to use phone? are you wanting a phone with many features?<br>  Thirdly, without knowing these two things, this question cannot be answered.

LzSj90pbaa	Tell them you bought and insured an N series phone, not an E series.  You can argue that although the specs of the phone are close to the same, it still does not have a front facing camera, which is common on the N series phones. (although the e51 is the most underrated symbian s60 phone out there.) You could say that are screwing you out of an N series phone to give E series.|`|ORGIk7Vkaa	I had same problem before and that's the reason why I no longer pay for insurance. You would think your supposed to get what you paid for but unfortunately when you sign on for insurance what they don't tell you is that they'll give you a phone comparable meaning with the same features. If I were you I would ask to speak with a manager. they'll probably come up with some bs as to why you can't but be persistent. If that doesn't work contact you cell provider and explain the situation to them. If the representative is not on your side hang up and try again until you get someone who's with you on this matter. If your account is in good standing they'll help you to get your issue resolved. First exhaust your energy with the insurance company and if all fails call your provider. Remember be very persistent. Let them know that you have no problem canceling your contract and going to another provider.

If you read the warranty, it probably says something like, "Radio Shack will repair or replace the item, at our discretion".<br>  <br>  it is very doubtful that you will get your money back.  That is totally up to the store manage -- who has apparently already said "no".<br>  <br>  Have them fix the unit, then sell it.

HekFanRvaa	you need to download it. And to do that, yes, you need an internet. there's no other way. you can't download it from PC then transfer to PS3. it doesn't work. Download it directly to your PS3 and just click the file to install and you're on!|`|1WgOj89kaa	Yes, you can download the demos fom the Playstation Store. But you have to have a Playstation Network Account first of all. To have this, you have to be connected to the internet either wirelessly or wired. If you have a PC and have a wireless router, you can connect wirelessly by scanning for a network with your PS3. If you don't have a router, then you will need an ethernet cable and a modem. Run the ethernet cable from the modem to the PS3, thens select Wired connection on the PS3. You are now online. Make your PSN Account, then you can download free demos from the Playstation Store. There you Are.

spaMZZiVaa	Mainly because LCD over 40" come in 1080p standard as compare to plasmas you can still buy a 720p. 1080p plasmas and LCDs are about the same though.<br>  <br>  And of course you'll pay more for the 120hz which is optional|`|AA10482044	Plasma is v. expensive to run and fades out in under 5 years.  LCD is winning the war now.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	LCDs are more expensive because they're still developing technology.  So the 60Hz is less expensive, but the 120Hz is more expensive.  Even the 120Hz has an inferior picture to the best plasmas.  Check any list of "Best HDTVs" and you will see more plasmas than LCDs.  That said, LCDs are lower maintenance and are perfectly good as far as I'm concerned.<br>  <br>  And to clear up some earlier misinformation, it's LCDs, not plasmas, that have the poor viewing angles.|`|I51RUYZraa	This is something I will catch flack from plasma enthusiasts for sure but the facts are facts.  LCD TVs are far more reliable, they use a good deal less power in a lot of scenarios and still have room to improve when all companies adopt LED technology in their back lighting.  Plasma TVs often offer high contrast ratios but this has yet to be measured under an industry standard measure so for now its a fluff spec and really nothing more.  I am also noticing that LCD TVs offer full high def (1920x1080p) at much smaller sizes which is great if you don't have a large living room to accommodate a 60+ inch TV.  The largest proposed disadvantage to LCD is response times, this is the time the TV needs to refresh due to micro mechanical limitation but on TVs with numbers in the 5ms or less this isn't an issue as the human eye can only distinguish changes withing 1/20th of a second (or 5ms).  Also you have to consider future costs, an LCD TV stands to only break down when the backlight dies, for a plasma the whole screen is the backlight so when if goes out guess which one is pricier to fix.|`|9dqNECO6aa	Im reading down the comments on this page and i don't understand how there can still be so many misconceptions about LCD and Plasma screens. <br>  <br>  In answer to your question a poor quality plasma may be a comparable price to a good quality LCD. As with everything prices will vary a lot between different companies that manufacture or supply TV sets. Its down to you as the consumer to whittle through them all and decide what is the best value for money.<br>  <br>  With regards to the quality of the pictures I personally believe that Plasma kicks LCD way way into touch. With better refresh rates and more vibrant colours. Yes they may not be as bright as a LCD but i can deal with closing the curtains for a better picture. With regards to burn in that's just not a problem with plasmas now technology has moved on. Nor is lifespan a factor with plasmas that's just another myth. Anyone that doesn't believe it go and take a look at a propper blue ray pic on the new Pioneer Plasma, in my opinion the best picture on the market at this time (In the sensible price bracket).<br>  <br>  Just my 2 pence worth.....|`|AA12271834	It really shouldn't be.  I would see if the LCD is on sale.  Both LCD TVs and Plasma TVs have their advantages and disadvantages.<br>  LCD:<br>  Pro: <br>  * Better all round viewing (based on light conditions)<br>  * Better viewing angle <br>  * No burn in<br>  * Don't need to be refilled/recharged<br>  Cons:<br>  * Can't handle black (black is a near black colour)<br>  * Max size around 50"<br>  <br>  Plasma:<br>  Pro:<br>  * Can be very large well over 60"<br>  * True colours (can express every colour including black)<br>  * Tend to be cheaper (though LCD technology is really coming down in price)<br>  * Best resolution possible (though LCD can get close to the level)<br>  Cons:<br>  * Possibility of burn in (an image stays on the screen permanently)<br>  * Poor visibility in bright conditions<br>  * Poorer viewable angles then LCD<br>  * May need to recharge/refill plasma over time<br>  * Min size around 40"|`|0Kcd8Dkyaa	LCD is better, less power to run them, more reliable, easier to fix.<br>  <br>  Plasma will go to the same place as Betamax. Lol|`|5QEg7ApRaa	LCD cost more on a consistent basis because of how they are put together. It is also on a basis of size, you wont find many plasma's under 42 inches. You probably wont find any under 32 inches. The plasma telivision thrives on the fact that it doesn't costs AS much to produce a bigger picture as compared to LCD. You also have to take into consideration the companies that make them. Sony doesn't make plasmas, they never have and probably never will. The Sony brand in general have always carried a higher price for their merchandice. If Sony specialized is plasmas and Panasonic specialized in LCD's instead of the other way around we MIGHT see that in general Plasma's cost more. Don't think that LCD's cost more because they are better. Better is a very relative term. They do some things better; No screen burn in, they do keep a better picture longer, reduced glare because they don't use a glass screen. However LCD's require more expensive technology to keep up with a plasma's level of picture and even then they still can't produce the same contrast ratio (contrast ratio in very simple terms would be the depth of color most noticiable in the black range.) If you take a look at a lot of LCD's especially the cheaper ones, black doesn't really exsist its just a very dark grey. Also in order to fight motion blur LCD's have to incorperate additional technology such as the (120 hz which cuts in half the time it takes to lay out the pixels on the screen. Normal progressive scan is 60 hz) Plasmas don't have a problem with motion blur so the standered 60hz on a plama looks just fine. LCD's do last longer and carry a better picture longer. This however is based on viewing hours of 60,0000 or better which means for most of us we probably wont notice much for at least 15 years. The way technology is progressing in 15 years TV's will look so much better than they do now it wouldn't really matter if your picture faded on your current TV or not. It would still look insignificant against the newer technology.  <br>  <br>  don't associate price with a better product.|`|3d9513bff802e1bb1c92ea294d374e25aa	They're not in a lot of cases, if you are looking to buy an LCD that rivals a Plasma they you will pay top dollar. The tech in the top LCD's is ridiculously expensive to produce in the mission to better Plasma on picture quality. Whilst I agree with most of the comments here, I own 3 large plasma's and 3 large LCD's (and not cheap ones). The LCD's are for gaming and HD movie use, but are particularly average with analogue or freeview broadcasts. Plasma is still here because its better. Roll on OLED, that'll be a laugh!|`|nUi6Y7HWaa	Plasma t.v.'s have better cleaner looking colors, but lcd's have the better overall picture and look much better when coupled with HD or blu-ray, thus the increased cost.|`|wHWtWT1paa	i think plasma is more

23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	Yes.<br>  The tv licence (not license - that's American) is compulsory for anyone who owns television receivers. It is a government tax that has nothing to do with what channels you actually watch or whether you watch by terrestrial, cable, satellite or internet streaming.<br>  <br>  Most of the licence money goes to the BBC where it pays for 4 televison channels and dozens of radio stations, also an excellent internet service (infinately better than Sky's) and pays for (most of) the digital tv transmitters and distribution system. You get more value from the licence fee than most people think. <br>  <br>  Also, it's cheaper per year than Sky and there are no advertisments taking up 33% of the programme time (true - you get 20 mins of ads per hour on alsomst all satellite channels) + subscription fee.<br>  <br>  The fine for not having a licence is ￡1000 and that is what is normally charged by the courts.

spaMZZiVaa	I had 4MB and upgraded to 12MB in an older game and DID if fact see an improvement. I think it depends on which game it is. I guess the new more popular games have the better servers and require less bandwidth|`|2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	That's plenty of bandwidth unless someone else is using your Internet connection at the same time- downloading music or watching streaming video etc.  The extra 0.5mb you get from  from upgrading wouldn't make much difference unless something else was chewing up bandwidth.<br>  <br>  If the problem is the servers being overloaded, that's not a problem with your connection but at Microsoft's end.<br>  <br>  Are you on DSL or cable?  What are your ping times?  Moving to a different ISP might help.|`|1b85748ff0626abc0819d93f878ad293aa	If you are using 1 MB wireless DSL connection that could be the problem. The 1 MB shouldn't be a problem if it is cable with a wired connection. I had a friend who was using DSL with a wireless connection and it was awful. When he moved he got cable and ditched the wireless adapter and now everything rocks great.

z0GqpcvPaa	i dont think so buddy...|`|EIINtnIpaa	Dont Know|`|hOEQMnBOaa	Well really it's all about using music software fruity loops or sony acid for the pc are my favorites and my friend's use logic. Music is broken into parts different instruments or beats and vocals. If you take "samples" you can remix using arpeggiators or whatever tickles your fancy. Basically get some good sequencing software. Pretty much anyone can do it except for a beginner it will take alot of time of cutting adding pasting blah blah. It does get alot more complicated if your looking for a crazy remix but that's kind of basic. My friend uses a korg keyboard and logic he can remix songs but he writes his own techno he alot has a sequencing device that looks alot like a mixer. And I do think so buddy

KLL0Acrwaa	You are confusing megapixels with megabytes.  They are not the same thing.<br>  <br>  Megapixels is a measure of the image dimensions (height x width) in pixels.  So, for example, an image that is 2000 pixels high x 3000 pixels wide is 2000 x 3000 = 6 million pixels total.<br>  <br>  The image file that comes from this can vary in size, depending upon the compression applied to the jpeg file, so the file size can vary from 300 kb (high compression) to 1.5 megabytes (low compression).  <br>  <br>  To get the maximum quality from your Exilim, use low compression.  That should result in a file around 2 to 3 megabytes in size.  In other words, what you're getting is already a 9mp photo.  If you want to check, just get the pixel dimension of your image.  If your image is 3456x2592, that's a 9mp image.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	Its because the camera is writing the file as a Jpeg. All cameras shoot in Raw (the data strait from the sensor is the Raw data) on compacts this is converted to a Jpeg which is a compressed format. During the conversion all unused data is 'dumped' this is then compressed. This is why Jpeg is describes as a 'lossy' format.<br>  <br>  Only if you can shoot in Raw will you get all the data, then your file sizes will be a lot larger.<br>  <br>  Note though that all manufactures Raw systems save the file compressed. This is 'lossless' compression, none of the data is lost. The amount of compression is determined by picture content so on my 10Mp camera some of my Raw files will over 9Mb some as small as 6Mb. Only Adobe DNG format does not compress which is why it can be universal.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|9a004d684503f5f0d53f02a59ff6d13faa	Your camera may be taking 9mp images, but it doesn't sound like it's taking them at the finest setting (your file sizes should be larger than that.  My 6mp camera usually produces 3megabyte jpegs at its finest setting, and 1.5m jpegs at the normal setting.<br>  <br>  On your camera, press REC, then Menu, then Quality Tab, then Quality (Snapshot).  If you see that your camera was set on Normal, or Economy, there's your problem.  Set it to Fine.  You'll notice your file sizes will be larger now, and your pictures may look a little better.<br>  <br>  Kodak compresses their jpegs more, so file sizes are actually smaller than they would be on other cameras.  Still, I wouldn't be surprised if your Kodak isn't at its finest setting, either.  You can check your Kodak's image quality setting using the menu, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope that solved your issue.|`|AqKALUItaa	What you're seeing is the file size expressed in kilobytes (kb) or megabytes (mb), not megapixels (mp). <br>  Here's an explanation from : <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/145581/frequently_asked_photo_questions_for_may.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/145581/fr...</a><br>  <br>  "Megapixels Versus Megabytes<br>  <br>  Those Ms you're throwing around are, not surprisingly, a pretty common source of confusion, Brett. The problem is that you're measuring two very different things and calling them both "M." When you set your camera to its optimal quality mode, it is taking 10-megapixel photos. Megapixel is shorthand for "a million pixels," so your camera takes photos with 10 million pixels. (The resolution is probably in the neighborhood of 3888 pixels across by 2592 pixels down. If you multiply those two numbers you get about 10 million.)<br>  <br>  But pixel resolution doesn't have a lot to do with the actual file size, which is measured in megabytes. The file size will depend upon several factors, including the amount of data compression used to save the photo (this is sometimes called the JPEG quality level). All things considered, 4 megabytes is about what you should expect for photos of this size.<br>  <br>  Still confused about the difference? Think of the megapixel resolution as the physical dimensions of a framed photo (say, 8 by 10 inches). The file size is the photo's weight on a scale, such as 14 ounces. As a general rule, the larger the picture is, the more it should weigh, but there's no direct correlation between the two values."<br>  <br>  "More Details About Megapixel vs. Megabytes<br>  <br>  I just read your article on megapixels vs. megabytes. You clarified the difference between megapixels and megabytes, but there's more that can be said.<br>  <br>  The reader was concerned about a 4MB file vs. a 10-megapixel camera. A more detailed explanation would say that each pixel is three color dots (representing the three primary colors, red, green and blue). Each color uses 1 byte, so there are 3 bytes per pixel. As a result, a 10-megapixel camera requires 30 megabytes (30 million color-dots), but this gets compressed by the camera when the picture is saved in JPEG format. Typically, cameras use an 8:1 compression ratio for JPEG pictures, which reduces that 30 megabytes to 3.75 megabytes--very close to what the reader reported.--Dennis Foreman, Binghamton, New York "

It is excellent.  I talked to a professional photographer before I bought mine and he told me that going up in mega pixels is a waste of time unless you are going to blow the pictures up to  poster or life size.  My camera's pictures can be blown up to poster size and you do not lose any quality.  It is a 6 mp.  The thing that matters in good photography is the lens.  It is what clears up and makes the pictures sharp.  If you buy interchangeable lens go with the one that has the built in stabilization for shaky hands.  I bought camera, 2 lenses, tripod, memory card, and carry bag all for $1000.  That was a year ago.  I have taken a lot of portraits and nature shot since then and have never had a bad picture.  Also when you buy your camera buy one that has the lithium ion battery.  Not the kind you have to replace.  My battery when fully charged lasts approx 2 months and can take thousands of pictures.  it also runs the flash.  I have no regrets.

It's a problem with certain (older) models of the system.  <br>  <br>  Just as an FYI, Microsoft recently extended the warranties of all of their consoles to 3 years, but I'm not sure if the disc scratching problem is covered.  You should give them a call at their technical support line.<br>  <br>  Microsoft has been dealing with the scratching issue for a long time:  <a href="http://kotaku.com/5104832/microsoft-sued-over-scratched-xbox-360-game-discs" rel="nofollow">http://kotaku.com/5104832/microsoft-sued...</a>|`|3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	If your console is vertical and an older model that is the reason. The disk does not sit securly inside and hits things inside the disk drive. Lay it down horizontally to stop it from scratching the disks.|`|AA11539218	lay the console on its side while playing games....most of the time the reason for the console scratching games is because of its vertical orientation as opposed to the horizontal orientation.|`|XdHbcN2qaa	yeah mine does that too. it sucks, cheap *** microsoft, cant get anything right

caLPjFI7aa	honestly in general the game was very easy. Nor the game cube or the wii is really different. The only hard thing about the wii was if you are not used to the controlling it can be odd. But i do agree the wii version is really easy because in the sense you as the person can give personal aim while you gotta take a chance when controlling for instance when you go against baddies in the wii version and surrounded you can just flick and start taking down them quick while in controlling you need to swivel hold this button and then use the stick to aim and pray you didn't waste a bullet.  I believe the wii improved the controls but graphically it stayed the same.  I think the wii version is a little better because its more of an on hands feel and feels like your in the game ( if you buy a gun case for the wiimote and nun-chuck).  it can be really fun.  I personally didn't like gamecube controlling because they tried emulate what they did on 64 and was a crash and burn and tried to match what dual shock was when playstation and microsoft introduced it.|`|uctxzjIIaa	The Wii controls do make the game easier than it would otherwise be. But at the same time, the game rebalance features that weren't put in until the PAL GC release are carried over to the Wii, so you get far less ammo to work with than in the JP and NA GC versions.<br>  <br>  Plus, you can use the Classic Controller or a Gamecube controller on the Wii versions and it will change the gameplay/controls to the Gamecube style.|`|qSKWUDEvaa	The wii version is way beter. Its to easy if you put on the easy settings but when you go on hard it gets tough. the aiming has improved and is soo much easier it is accurate and it feels almost natural to play. the graphics arent top of the line but they are great. Also the sounds are great cos the feel that bit more real as they come out from the wii remote thingy so it sounds great and has a great atmosphere. A great game all round.|`|SeIkrhbjaa	It is easier in the sense that the control system is a great improvement upon the Gamecube's by allowing precision aiming when dispatching those nasty zombies.<br>  <br>  Play the Wii version on hard if you want a challenge. Making the game artificially difficult (and less enjoyable) by choosing an inferior control system is pointless.

AQ4b4Iilaa	Look for the "unsharp mask" setting, it will sharpen your images.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	The two answers ahead of me concern sharpening a photo that is out of focus and the unsharp mask can help a little.<br>  <br>  Blur is cause by camera or subject (sometimes both) movement and while there are some stand alone programs that can attempt to remove some of that motion blur, it can only reduce it in one direction a little bit, so if you camera is moving up and down and your subject is moving  in a different direction, you can only correct some of the blur.<br>  <br>  To avoid this in the future, choose a shutter speed of at least 1/250 of a second and pan with the movement of the subject (you may find you will have to increase the ISO setting on the camera to shoot at that shutter speed).  This will insure a good starting point toward getting a very sharp image|`|5lmGvQzQaa	enlarge everything, you see it less when less detail is hidden, any picture editor would have a "sharpening tool" that would be your second option.|`|d8a3053a854f992c6ac62b53ecfdbb9baa	download( ACDsee free addition). that should take care of your problem!

PPyDF6FKaa	There are lots of different mp3 players around, all different storage sizes for different prices. iPod is the market leader, but not the cheapest, there are one that do the same job for a cheaper price. <br>  It's definitely worth changing over, CD's are nice to have, but they are very out-dated now. Having everything on a tiny mp3 device does seem the way to go. <br>  MP3's can be brought very cheaply online now, much cheaper than CD's. I use <a href="http://www.mp3obsession.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mp3obsession.com</a> they review cheap mp3 download sites that will work with any mp3 player you have. The tracks start at 9c so you can easily fill an mp3 player for very little cash. <br>  Playing an mp3 player in the car is tricky. If you have a tape deck, you can get tapes that have a headphone jack on so you can plug your mp3 player into that and play it through your stereo. If you have a CD player there isn't a lot you can do. You can upgrade your radio to one that has an AUX port in the front, this way, you can plug your mp3 player into the stereo using a shirt headphone-headphone cable. <br>  Hope this helps you out, good luck whatever you decide.|`|q8ElPFenaa	100+ CDs would fit on a 30gb ipod classic but if you want to get new music Id go for the 120gb classic.|`|283e5e2bd616fc1aae3e4d9d71341f66aa	get an ipod get like the 2nd gen or 4th gen|`|9r1uueQsaa	you shoul try the itouch 32g. its about 400$ but its really good. it has a <br>  -3.5 lcd touchscreen <br>  -built in speaker<br>  -1 warranty<br>  -applactions(over 1,500)<br>  ---*games<br>  ---*utilities<br>  ---*entertainment<br>  ---*resources(books, gps, weather, etc.)<br>  ---*communication(aim, myspace)<br>  -internet browser<br>  -plays videos<br>  -photos<br>  -over <br>  ---*7000 songs<br>  ---*40 hours of videos<br>  ---*25,000 photos<br>  ---*36 hours of music playback<br>  ---*8 hours of video playback<br>  -can charge 80% of battery in 2hours<br>    <br>  <br>  this is probably your best buy for all your songs<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you may also consider the ipod classic 120gb<br>  <br>  it has:<br>  -120gb of storage<br>  -30,000 songs available<br>  -150 hours of videos available<br>  -2.5 lcd screen<br>  -same battery power as itouch<br>  -doesnt have apps<br>  -comes in white and black

3CJAUyqPaa	There are lots of them.<br>  <br>  Manufacturer short list usually includes Sony, Fuji, Canon and many others.<br>  <br>  Many times "clear photos" don't happen because the person using the camera is trying to use the camera in a way that is was not intended or they did not read the camera's manual (and followed instructions).<br>  <br>  For example, if you are in a poor lighting environment, trying to photograph something 100 feet away with a 3x optical zoom pocket digital still camera, the photo of the subject will be poor. If you are trying to capture something moving at high speed with a camera's lens set to the auto default of 1/60, chances are good there will be blurring of the subject.<br>  <br>  Digital still cameras are designed to take digital stills. This includes pocket and SLR cameras. They were not designed to capture video - but that feature is an afterthought. Consumer camcorders were not designed to take still photos - and that feature is an afterthought.<br>  <br>  What cameras have you looked at?<br>  <br>  What kinds of pictures are you expecting to take?<br>  <br>  What kinds of video are you expecting to capture?<br>  <br>  If your expectation that the camera be able to capture photos and video with great quality in ALL environments (low-light, close-up, far away, good and stereo audio even in loud audio environments, etc.), then you are setting yourself up to be very disappointed. As well, if you expect the camera to know what you want for all kinds of environments with no manual intervention from you (staying in "auto" mode rather than learning to properly use the various shutter, aperture, and other settings), you can expect that your photos will continue to be poor quality.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	canon a2000|`|1jFG5h1iaa	I just purchased the Samsung SL310w. It has 13.6 mega pixels and a 3.6x optical zoom. The reason I bought it is because Consumer Reports rates the picture quality excellent. No other point and shoot camera they've tested was rated this high for picture quality. They also recommend the camera for an all around good camera. So far the pictures I've taken with it are phenomenal-almost better than my Nikon D60 which I bought for $650. I would highly recommend this camera and also because they battery lasts extremely long.

rTOuZYyjaa	i think the xbox 360 drop $40-$50 off the current price in june this year and the ps3 will soon follow sometime this year how much i don't know|`|N2rntAqvaa	Everyone is *expecting* the PS3's price to drop in April, 2009.  But Sony has never confirmed it, so don't get your hopes up.  About the Xbox 360, I don't really know, but if there will be a price drop for it it just means that Microsoft really is desperate for money.  The Xbox 360 is worth 100$, in my opinion.  Since there is a Red ring of death, overheating, accessories that add up to an expensive price (you will need those accessories) and LIVE costs money.<br>  <br>  There are no dates, just expectation.  The Xbox 360 just had a price drop this summer, so there won't be an another one soon.  The PS3 is supposed to drop the price in April, but it is not 100% for sure, and no one knows the exact date.|`|Do9oGxwbaa	from everything ive been reading, it sounds like there will b a price drop in april 2009 but i dont no to how much     As for da 360, i have no clue but i think da 360 is da best system bcuz my PS3 has already broken down and i treated dat thing like a prince, but i treated my 360 like a peice of crap and its more durable than my broken PS3....my 360 has been on for about 3 months striaght with no red ring of death,i got it 3-4 yrs ago....Never had and hopefully never will have red ring of death!!!|`|1WgOj89kaa	The XBOX will have quite a significant price drop, simply because Microsoft will start to become desperate. Sony will probably keep it at the current price, simply because you get so much for your money already.|`|jxpV13rTaa	the xbox has cheap models because some dont even come with harddrives and some (like the 20 gig) are so small they arent really worth getting. the ps3 will drop a hundred bucks come april.|`|VcNHahtgaa	It's a rumor for PS3.<br>  <br>  360 just priced dropped last year.<br>  <br>  If your interested in buying a PS3, go to Best Buy and buy it there. They are giving away FREE $50 Gift Card and FREE Guitar Hero 3 when you buy a PS3 there. <br>  <br>  GH3 is about $50 right now.
rTOuZYyjaa	eventually yes but when i don't ron (geez roon enough question's today or wat?)|`|tD915UQ7aa	Maybe yes maybe no.  While I'm sure from a consumer's perspective they want to fix the problem quicker so they reassure their customer in the hopes of shipping more products.  On the business standpoint however, everytime your 360 gets the RRoD you most likely take one of two routes.  Either you send your Xbox to Microsoft for them to fix it and pay them money then or have previously payed for a warranty.  The second option is to buy another 360 all together.  By not fixing it they make more money which is the main goal of a business.|`|3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	No not even the newer consoles are free from it, but they have fixed the disk scratches and added a new heatsink to the GPU to reduce heat and reduce the chance of RROD. I honetly could care less if my XBOX RROD becuase there is a 3 year warranty for it. Only ones that would get me pissed are a disk drive error which is only covered for one year. I don't see what the fuss about the RROD is anymore if there is a 3 year warranty on the console. Unless you are going to mod it and therefore have to void the warranty.|`|cHh0PTTsaa	Well, they replace and refurbish broken units but they have improved on the new models.  RIght now it's just the Arcade models that have the Jasper chip configuration which utilizes the 65nm cpu AND gpu and uses less power.  Heat related problems have been cut drastically and don't be surprised that the new models have a failure rate of .001%|`|wIM3vNtwaa	No unless they completely redesign the insides of the 360 which they won't because it costs money|`|qusKbEmBaa	Eventually they will find a way to fix it, but by the time they<br>  fix it they might come out with a new Xbox. Who knows ?<br>  But Eventually overtime it will be fixedd<br>  hope i helped.<br>  ( I need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as best answer, thanks)
j5Apt8hWaa	You don't need to know the resistance present within the electronics of any digital camera.<br>  <br>  What you might want to know is the mAh rating of the 3.6v Li-ion battery you are using in the camera ... <br>  <br>  Some formuali you can use to sort of figure out the ohms if you are really that curious.<br>  <br>  Voltage = Watts / AMPS <br>  E = P ÷ I <br>  <br>  And Resistance = Voltage/ AMPS<br>  R = E ÷ I <br>  <br>  E= Voltage<br>  P= power measured in Watts<br>  I= current in Amperes<br>  R= resistance in Ohm's<br>  <br>  If you know the number of shots the camera can take on a fully charged battery, you can approximate the cameras resistance, but remember, you are also using battery energy with you have the LCD turned on, using the power zoom, auto-focusing and using the flash.  To factor that in, you will need to take a Scientific Wild Guess.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, you can ask a repair shop that would have the schematics of your camera in it repair manual.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	I'm intrigued, why would you want to know this?<br>  <br>  The resistance will alter depending on what your camera is doing, if the screen is on the resistance will be at lot less. When the shutter fires it will reduce again as the shutter solenoid takes current, but only for a fraction of a second..<br>  <br>  Resistance is a function of Ohms Law so if you can measure the current taken from the battery (or an external power pack) and you know the Voltage you can then work out the resistance V/I=R. (Volts divided by current (in Amps) equals resistance in Ohms.<br>  <br>  As an example if it draws 100mA (1/10th of an amp) it would be 3.6 / 0.1 = 36 Ohms.<br>  <br>  Chris

AA11056614	It's probably a settings issue. You may have to "assign" the optical input on the AVR to "TV" or "SAT" whichever input you are using to listen to the TV.

Even if somebody offered to fix your PS3 for ￡50, don't.

d1fee41232bb81bff138e747ce6187bdaa	First of all you will never get surround sound from hooking up to the TV audio output. Since when is a TV producing dolby surround sound to its audio out jacks? They are stereo jacks (2 channel sound only). If you have hooked it up this way you are only hearing left and right but louder and probably on all speakers. Not true surround sound.<br>  <br>  Second...what is your TV source? Is it cable TV or satellite TV? Is it in HD? You need to run it to your HTIB system input and then run the output to your TV. Presto, TV is in surround but only if program is broadcast in surround. You have to match up the cables from the TV signal source and the HTIB input. I don't believe this Samsung unit  even has HDMI inputs. What do you expect...you get what you pay for?|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Almost all TVs are only in stereo or mono, so you won't get surround sound from them at all.<br>  <br>  If you still want to have the TV shows use your surround speakers (even if it's just the front ones) most TVs have a pair of audio output jacks on the back (red & white)  Connect these to an input on your home theater.  Now use the TV's setup menu and under Audio there should be an option to turn off your TV's speakers and use the audio-output.  This will send the audio signal from your TV to your home theater.|`|AA11056614	First, recognize that only some TV programs are broadcast in surround sound. If it's in stereo you can use a matrix decoder setting on your receiver to get psudo-surround.<br>  <br>  In terms of that TV, I believe it has an optical sound out jack ... if so you can connect via an optical cable to your A/V receiver and get true surround form Dolby 5.1 broadcasts (and pseudo surround from stereo using Dolby Prologic on the AVR).<br>  <br>  Almost all modern TVs have stereo outputs (dual RCA jacks), so at a pinch you could connect that way too (but sound won't be as good).<br>  <br>  Note you may have to set a setting in the TV menu to enable the audio out jack.|`|iFu4ASF2aa	If you TV is hooked to your stereo turn the sound from the TV off and use your stereo.

Just away for a second and it was gone (I usually have my dog with me and don't worry / she wasn't with me that day).<br>  I cut it off immediately, but they can, and did browse through my contacts. They even tried calling a few. Nothing much you can do, except hope they don't have a charger to keep it up and down load anything, and never keep anything confidential on your phone again.<br>  Sorry.<br>  The good thing is that the phone can not be re-activated without it being flagged as stolen.|`|AA12145238	To cut off the line is different to blocking the phone.<br>  I am sure Verizon would have blocked the phone.This way noone else would be able to use the phone as it is not accessible.<br>  there are ways around it though.As thieves know how to get it working again.They will have to clear the memory etc and reset it.This way all data will be erased.
PWa2ICLHaa	When you plug your Mp4 player in it should come up in the My Computer folder as F: or something like that (maybe a different letter), Go to My Computer and open the one called Mp4 player or something similar. When you open that it should come up with a bunch of folders saying Music, Video's, System and some others, open up the one saying Video or something similar and select all of the music you want in the music folder, right click it and select cut. Then go back and locate the folder called Music (or similar) and press paste into that folder.<br>  <br>  For more computer tips go to: <a href="http://computertipsnow.com" rel="nofollow">http://computertipsnow.com</a>
AA11056614	Many/most Bose speakers require an equalizer to work right (even then they are often deficient in the midrange). They are also often equipped with proprietary connectors. That said, you generally can't connect speakers direct to a TV ... you need to connect to an external amp/receiver (which will power the speakers) and connect the speakers to it.<br>  <br>  So ... unless you are prepared to go with a receiver/amp I would forget it. And even with one I wouldn't recommend the Bose speakers. <br>  <br>  If you really want to get good surround sound from a TV (at least from programs broadcast in surround (not all are)) first verify you have an optical or coax audio out jack on the TV and if so connect to a home theater system with surround speakers as part of the setup. If you only have stereo RCA jacks you can only get stereo (but can generate pseudo surround using the Prologic setting on the home theater/receiver).|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	You need a receiver.  You can attach the speakers to the receiver and then run your DVD, cable, etc. audio through the receiver.|`|ihYl3mJqaa	More detail is required on the model of speakers to determine exactly what you need.

BpXdkLTBaa	Have you talked with anyone about their rates? If I were you I would go with Cricket if you have that in your area. They have unlimited calling, texting, and all that for 40 a month. I personally use ATT, but I am on a contract. Also, you will want to see what phones they offer. That should also factor in. You do not want to get into a prepaid thing only to find out that you are going to have to replace your phone more often due to crappy phones offered with the prepaid plans. Good luck.

Can you try it in another player?<br>  <br>  "Is it because of 2 movies on it?" - no, double sided discs are part of the official DVD spec, and quite a lot of DVDs have been released in this format. Any DVD player should be able to play them.|`|16bmDD8Eaa	Your dvd player may not support the double layered dvd's. I would say it's the player.

p1dcw35Qaa	I have had several Norelco shavers over the years and have liked them all. The 7140 has a newer blade system so you may like it better than the 7110. I bought the Norelco 1050 Arcitec a year ago and it's the best yet. Granted, it's expensive but it's by far the best shaver I've ever used.
p1dcw35Qaa	If it's hooked up with the red, green and blue wires switch the green and blue around on the back of the tv and on the cable box. If this brings up a picture (it will have bad color) then your green wire or input has gone bad. Try a second input or new wire. Someone may have turned the contrast all the way down on you (little sister/brother?) so check that. If it's a rear projection, the bulb may have blown out (this should make the power button blink on most models). Well, without more info that's all I can think of.|`|5LWq12epaa	did you try pressing the input button because it could be on the wrong input

This is a free service and the texts from T-Mobile do not count against your messaging bundle.|`|FFcJFPadaa	You can use the #999# to check your minute useage but that wont help you with how many texts you have used... for that you can either A: go to my.tmobile.com and sign up online... and the site will text you a temp password to your cell so that you can sign in... then you can change the password to whatever you want.

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	I use a $40 surge protector (not just a power strip) from Radio Shack.  It does exactly the same thing as the Monster product costing 3 times as much.  That's why I never recommend a Monster product for anything, because although their products work just fine they do it no better than something half the price.<br>  <br>  If all you need is a surge protector then go with something affordable.  You can get a good power strip/surge protector for less than $100.  Once you cross the line into voltage regulators and UPSs your price will go up considerably.  One product I see recommended a lot by those who know what they're talking about made by APC.  See a good discussion here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://forum.blu-ray.com/showthread.php?t=73512" rel="nofollow">http://forum.blu-ray.com/showthread.php?...</a>|`|AA11593071	Same here, using the monster $150.00 unit, colored coded, easy hookup in the dark.|`|AA11056614	Little point in suggesting a specific brand since I don't know what you have available to you locally, nor your price point. That said Panamax (1st link) products are highly recommended (but pricy). See the 2nd link for a guide to surge protectors.<br>  <br>  A proxy indicator of protection capability for medium/low end devices is the joule rating. Higher is better. get the best you can afford, but note that some higher end devices don't use this type of rating. The more you spend the better the surge protection from really dangerous things like lightning. One indicator (although by no means foolproof) is the claimed $$ value for protection.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure where you are, but in Canada you won't get a worthwhile surge protector for less than about $50, and $100 or more isn't unusual for a well regarded, multi outlet bar.. A combo UPS and surge protector can be a good bet too, particularly if you have a projector based home theater.|`|ilESWxrAaa	I am currently using a Monster Cable Home Theatre Surge Protector and from the Power surge I got last week can reccomend their products.

oM7zA7Jhaa	90% of my guitars have locking trems, they dont get in the way, they are great for laying your palm down for those crunchy riffs we all love, and if you have it set up right, it will not go out of tune. The point of the locking tremelo is to keep your strings finely tuned while performing dive bombs and vibrato, my guitars never go out of tune , even after laying the most devastatingly brutal whammy tricks down. It won't bother you i guarantee it, unless your a rhythm man then you may prefer a hardtail, good luck!|`|RplkclzJaa	Whammys arent that bad, i have a strat and even though I rarely use the whammy bar when i do it generally stays in tune if the strings have been broken in so you wont have to tune much more than you normally would unless you are really working the whammy|`|XL4sAPbmaa	mchlstnr is right man|`|AM33tqYAaa	pros - you can make wierd sound effects with whammy<br>  cons - knocks out of tune, and it sometimes interferes with picking

It isn't a perfect solution, because certain features, like hammer-ons or pull-offs and some other quirks make it a bit more difficult to play. My advice is to either trade-in for a PS3 version of the game and upgrade your guitar, or just stick with playing what you have on your PS2. The adapter isn't worth it, unless you're very desperate or can find one for less than $5.

fLYMqZ8zaa	No, it should be fine as long as you write on it not near to any connection holes or the screen- write on it in a large, clear place on the camera. I suggest you write quite small so you don't spoil the look of the camera.
OhTPygYlaa	The Dash has Windows Mobile Office which includes Word/Excel/Power Point and Outlook. It can create/edit Word docs.<br>  Hope that helps.

bC42lYYtaa	It isn't a problem, it is supposed to do that.<br>  Just plug it into iTunes, and in about two minutes it will start restoring your iPod.<br>  I just upgraded last night, what it does is restores your ipod to when you first bought it, which is why it has the usb cable and itunes pic, cause there isn't anything on it.<br>  So plug it up and wait for it to put your stuff back on it.<br>  It didn't recognize mine either, but I just left it plugged in and it started syncing.
p1dcw35Qaa	You want to make sure you get a converter that has enough power for a curling iron. The iron should have a watt rating on it. The one linked below is a high power one for blow dryers and should work fine. I have bought from Ron's hardware before and they are ok and inexpensive but VERY slow to ship (figure on 2 weeks to get it) so if your in a hurry, look elsewhere.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ronshomeandhardware.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=788893&click=1014" rel="nofollow">http://www.ronshomeandhardware.com/Produ...</a>|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	A typical curling iron should be under 100W You just need to get a transformer whose capacity is greater than the wattage of appliance you wish to operate.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you get the version of the appliance made to work directly in your country though.
Xxviy63Paa	Yes. Assuming you are using windows, go to softpedia.com and download the driver. I know they have a driver for sixaxis which probably works for dualshock too. PES on pc won't use the rumble feature anyhow.<br>  <br>  The charging cord carries data, too, so all you need to do is plug it in to your pc. Once you've got the driver installed it should detect as a gamepad (you may have to reboot) then start up PES and reconfigure the controls.<br>  <br>  If PES isn't configurable to gamepads, I'll eat my hat. I have played the ps3 version and it's full of button combos. It is made for gamepad.<br>  <br>  changing it to FIFA type control may be a challenge though because there are a lot more combos and special moves in PES. Also I think FIFA uses circle for shots by default, PES uses circle, x and triangle for passing and square for shots. Tons of combos by adding L1 or directional buttons. The system is really cool, I like being able to make a normal cross, high cross or low cross all with the same button. Made a great header goal from a cross, first time I played.<br>  <br>  If you can't locate it on softpedia, just run a search on "sixaxis XP driver" or "dualshock3 vista driver" etc whichever specifically you're looking for.|`|oAdPL4vWaa	kozzm0 is rite
Xxviy63Paa	Never heard of any way. The ps3 plays all its ps1 stuff by emulation, including the 60gb which emulates them as a ps2 (which plays them by emulation) so they don't work the same as normal ps1's. <br>  <br>  There's a way to play ps2 backups in a 60gb ps3 but only in that model because it contains the ps2 cpu and gpu so it works as a ps2, meaning it's possible to use swap magic to get the disc to boot. But not ps1 games. The ps3 knows it's not on an original disc.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you're typing this on a pc, why does it matter... just use a ps1 emulator on your pc and it will work great, and you can play the backups. Plus the ps3 controller plugs right in to your pc's usb port and works with the emulator out of the box. Easiest emulator to use is pSX and there are some better ones that aren't so easy.|`|hTbvfUOeaa	yes you can

If it is the older style you just have to keep your fingers crossed. Just don't buy those Intercoolers. Studies have shown they actually increase the risk of RRoD.|`|RpCwfcRzaa	There is no sure fire way to prevent it from getting the red rings. You can reduce the chances by keeping it in a well ventilated area out of a media cabinets and off of carpet. You shouldn't leave it on if you're not playing it and let it rest between gaming sessions. Even when taking these precautions, you still have a risk of the rings. The older 360s (those made between 2005 and early 2007) have a much higher risk of getting them.|`|l5AOEcZ4aa	Just don't put it in an Entertainment stand make sure it has alot of space (well ventilated area) .|`|LKiVXEcCaa	Ok first off stand it up and out in the open to keep it from overheating (#1 cause of rrod).

2uXdXMO9aa	the ipod shuffle is very good for this activity,.<br>  <br>  it is 30 pounds itself,and is 3 cm long and 5 cm wide, pretty small! its very simple to use, jst play button, pause button, and toggle the volume. you can set the mp3 player to a setting called 'shuffle' where it shuffles the songs you have imported onto it so you can good a good mizture of different varieties of songs that you enjoy . or you can put it to play through where it goes through every album you have imported. it also has a strong reliable clip which is very useful when jogging and wont fall and break. however ipod headphones are not the best for jogging so therefore you may need to spend a bit more money on oher high quality headphones.<br>  <br>  hope this is the mp3 player for you!<br>  <br>  good luck :) x|`|Efonm1znaa	You need an mp3 player that is made into headphones, so there is no cords in the way.|`|XL4sAPbmaa	get the little sansa 4gb clip-on thing|`|1jcnJJN8aa	In my humble opinion, any mp3 player would work fine. Why? They are much better by a mile than cd players. They don't skip, you can read the artists names and track, and are more compact and far out more stylish. i do not know much about much that currency can be translated to US money but if you your looking for a good mp3 player at a fairly low price, check out the Sansa series mp3 players. or  the RCA series mp3 players, or the ipod shuffle. You can get them from 40 to 70 US dollars. There are cheaper ones too. But make sure your headphones are long enough so you can store your mp3 in your pocket or your shirt pocket. I recommend strapping it on your arms so you can have easy access to the songs or tracklist. Unfortunately, there are not many accessories that can be bought for mp3 player specific models. But if you are willing to spend a good $150 to $200 on your model, buy an IPOD nano or a IPOD classic. there are tons of accessories for the ipod dedicated on fitness including a pedometer!  Not bad at all for an mp3!|`|f06Sy0dfaa	Ipod shuffle is great.
