20090202193721AAs3zd4	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Do you think that the idea of "Equality" could possibly be taken too far?	Before saying anything, I would like to have you ponder the thought and REALLY think about it in depth before coming forth with an answer...    I would like to see where your mind takes you before I ever take it somewhere entirely different.    Thought processes intrigue me-- do not think of anything as right or wrong. I'm extremely open-minded so even if I disagree, if you explain yourself I may be able to see your perspective and you may even receive best answer if done so well enough.

"Can you tell me why Voldie wants to kill me yet," asked Harry with an eager expression on his face. Dumbledore looked at him intensely and chuckled. He took of his glasses and cleaned them with his robe.      "Well, Harry," he said. "I suppose it is time you knew." he gestured to his lap and Harry sat on it. Harry could barely contain his excitement and awe.       "Voldermort had always been attracted to men. He had his eyes on your father, Harry. He wanted to kill you and your mother so that he could seize James and give him the love potion his mother had once made. He didn't succeed, though. People say that your father fought valiantly for your life. The sad truth was that he tripped on a bucket and fell down the stairs. Voldie, in his blind rage attacked your mother out of anger. He tried to kill you, but you know what happened after that.."      Harry looked stunned at the story he had just been told. He looked as if he was going to cry.      "PSYCH!" screamed Dumbledore. "Voldermort isn't gay..." Harry looked relieved that the story was not true.      "... but I am," continued Dumbledore, staring at Harry in a seductive manner and wiggling is eyebrow. Harry immediately jumped off Dumbledore's lap.            ~         Some say I have an active imagination. Review my work?

20090202141253AAumHwe	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I need to find the name of a book that was read to me when I was little?	its a book about two clown dolls that fall in love and such and one of the clowns has to go away for some reason, and the other clown that was left there is all alone and depressed and takes out his heart (or he gave it to the other clown when she left, I don't remember).       Anyway I know I didnt leave alot to work with but if I had to try and remember the name of it I would say its something like "The Tale of the Velvet Heart" (or Silk). It had something to do with velvet i think...      Also, this may be a short story or in a big book of short stories. I have looked around for this book alot and can't find anything. If you know or have any ideas please help me. Thank you.

20090202141929AAfbKBh	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Which acting class should I take?	I'm a junior in high school, and soon we can have to choose next year classes. We can take classes at a community college, but I don't know which one to choose. Which class sounds the best, and will help me more in my future. I would love to become a film actress. So which one will help me with that, and could I put this on my acting resume, if I took some of these classes?      Acting I: Improvisation and Foundations   Description: This course uses lectures, discussions, and interactive exercises to learn, demonstrate, and evaluate the principles of improvisation including basic stage awareness, non-verbal communication, self-awareness, and team work. Students will work in ensemble to understand, evaluate, and use the concepts of objective, intention, and motivation. Written analyses as well as presentations may be used to demonstrate understanding of these skills and concepts.      Foundations of Acting: Stage Movement   Description: An exploration of movement and its use in developing characters constitutes the basis of this course. Movement is explored as communication, as play, and as an expression of self. An emphasis on self awareness continues to be a focus. Other focuses may include stage combat, exercise, and various types of dance.      Theater Practicum   Description: In this class, students choose a particular area of practicum study such as acting, directing, assisting a director, working on a technical crew assignment, or another major responsibility. Students research, analyze and participate in some aspect of a North Hennepin production. This course may be repeated for credit. Prerequisite: Consent of instructor      Thanks so much, help me choose please!

20090202160541AAD9QYF	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Edward Cullen is possessive, controlling, overprotective, bossy, clingy boyfriend who wouldn't be that way if.?	I KNOW I'VE ASKED THIS ALREADY. IF YOU'VE ALREADY ANSWERED IT, THEN DON'T ANSWER IT AGAIN. I JUST WANT TO HEAR DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEWS/DIFFERENT ANSWERS.   he had a life of his own outside of Bella and their relationship.   Agree or disagree?   I love Twilight and I couldn't wait to read the other books.   SPOILERS FROM NEW MOON AND ON   I read New Moon and I thought Bella was so dramatic how she's going to wonder into the forest and take a nap on the cold, wet, dirty ground because Edward broke up with her. The whole book was basically about her losing her mind and whining about Edward and that got old. I thought New Moon was okay. I liked it a lot, but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would.      I read Eclipse and that's where I started to stop liking the story. Edward is just way to overprotective and it's annoying. Bella wakes up and she and Edward drive to school together. They have practically every class together. They hang out with each other after school when she's not working. He pretends to leave then when she goes upstairs he's waiting in her room so he can watch her sleep. There's nothing romantic about him watching her sleep. that's so weird. I would be freaked out if my boyfriend did that before we even started dating let alone while we were dating. Bella is just whiny, selfish, stupid (she keeps calling herself selfish and stupid for playing with Jacob's heart but she's obviously not that sorry because she won't leave him alone), clingy, whiny, she complains way too much, submissive, a doormat (Edward will not let her see Jacob and even goes so far as to take her engine out of her car. she actually begged him to see him. she's not 9 years old, if she wanted to go she should have. what could he do about it), and she can't breathe for 15 minutes if Edward's gone. Their love was so cute but it started to make me sick and both of their behavior got on my nerves.      And Breaking Dawn was just stupid. I'm not even going to get started. first of all...What the hell is Reneesme?? if that's even how you spell it. why would she do that? then she considers giving the child to her best friend that was in love with her that just had love at first sight with the child and is basically a pedohile and all she thinks about is having sex with Edward. Bella needs to be smacked. hard. twice.      I was so disapointed in the Twlight series. I thought it could have been something great, but I feel like Stephanie Meyer just rushed it. I think she was trying too hard to catch everyone by surprise and she ruined the story.   What do you think?   Do you think Edward would be less-Edwardish if he had a social life?

20090202143152AAEO3TC	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	How can i convince my parents to buy me an open hole flute?	ive been playing my closed hole flute for 3 years this would be my forth. Now i play in my intermediate schools concert band because im in 8th grade and i participate in my high schools marching band this past season. My parents aren't very supportive of my musical interests and hardly ever went to my marching competitions. Now this past christmas there was only one thing on my list an open hole flute. Christmas morning even though i got many nice things i was still very disappointed that the one thing i wanted was not under my tree. My parents say they will get it for me but they say i have my closed hole flute so its not like i really need a new one. Whenever i bring up the topic they always say that i don't really need a new one even though it will improve my skills musically.Im also the only musician in my entire family so im treated as almost an outcast for listening to classical music and being in band.There has only been one other musician ever in my family and that was my great grand father that was a violinist but is of coarse not alive. My parents have also said that my flute is to expensive but i have found a very cheap one but they still say its to much. They have also just recently spent around 2,000 dollars for a new dirt bike for my brother when he only goes riding like 3 times a year at most and for over half the year it sits in the garage because its to cold outside to ride. My flute is not even 1,000 dollars so how is it to expesive. I would also be playing my flute every day of my life until or beyond my collage years. I have also been asking fo a flute since 6th grade and nothing. This is soo unfair so how do i convince my parents to buy me an open holed flute.

(mainly for guys) ?	hey 10 points best answer mates      Here's the story and ill put in the links to the pics          Today when i was walking down the road i saw a girl. Her hair was brown and she had hazel coloured eyes. She looked about my age, 17. I waved and she smiled.    We actually ended up talking because once i had come out of tescos I accidentally hit one of her shopping bags and it split open. I helped her pack the bags up. I kept apologizing. I got a closer look at her, she was wearing a black mini-skirt and white strapped top, she wore black boots aswell. She had a few freckles..        http://s567.photobucket.com/albums/ss113...

You sway like a crane to the tunes of tossed stones.    I am what you made to live in    from what you had: hair matted as kelp, bad schools.          Oh, you will never know me. I wave and you go    on playing in the clouds    boys clap from erasers. I am the pebble    you tossed on the chalked space and war-    danced toward, one-leg two-leg, arms treading air.          In this, your future, waves rechristen the sea    after its tiny jeweled lives    that hiss “Us Us” to the shore all day.    Where’s the kid called Kateydid? the moonfaced    Kewpiedoll? The excitable pouting    Zookie? The somber O-Be-Joyful?          Lost girl, playing hopscotch, I will do what you could.    Name of father, son, ghost. Cross my heart and hope.    While the sea’s jewels build shells and shells    change to chalk and chalk to loam and gold    wheat grows where oceans teetered.

20090202151012AAI0meP	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Second Draft, better ?  In Praise of C***?	The small of you, on my fingers and face is like having you here, still,   Long after you have gone.   Old enough to know better, young enough not to care,   wise enough to make every second last an eternity.   Your wet lips, slick and firm, like warm wet pocket,   Your tongue, hot and insistent, like a pink, wet Terrier, darting and probing,   licking, tasting, drawing me into the cave of your sweet mouth.   Not even the ripest, most succulent fruit in the whole of Edens long forgotten orchards,   Tastes as sweet as your hungry ****, as I lick your lips, up, and down,   and you drip the sweetest of nectars, all onto my lips and chin.      God is a Woman, and Her name is ****,   there is no finer ambition, than to seek her heady Gnosis,    In Her, all Mysteries are birthed.   Every last one  of us, bar none, grew in Her salty, dark sea, for a time. Waiting, for the birth of the world,  beyond Her gates.      Yours, my Love, is the ****iest of ****s, the most High,   The Holiest of Grails, the Cup that runneth over,   The fabled stone of the philosophers, ever ready to turn my Base Metal into Purest Gold.   So, come on, my Holiest of Holeys,   Let me see your busy fingers, working away, in, out, up, down,    then into my mouth, mixing your taste, with my spit, then back down,    The warm, furry moist Heaven, of your Hot, Hungry Hole,   Open your pretty lips,    Brazen, shameless,   Let me feel your breath, hot on ny neck, as your back arches, like a cat's.   Your eyes, lock to mine, the silent begging between us, tight as a bowstring,   Urgent, and mutual, Our Lust is our Child,   New to the World, It's hunger, huge, and unfed,   carries us along, like an afterthought, in it's spiralling, Tsunami like grip,   Round and round, faster and faster, into a whirlpool of feeling,   It's identity, lost, matters not. All it knows, it knows all.   Of You, of Me, and of something else,   not born of Woman, or Man, but both, and neither,   A self begotten Paradox.   It's only reply, is, it must be answered.   The Details look after themselves.      Your P*ssy yowls it's long, low, silent Yowl,    as if in agreement, and we begin the Dance.   Gently, so gently, I knock at your door,   eagerly awaiting your response,   silently, you draw me in, and Islip past,    wearing you, like a fish wears a river.   Ilet your waters wash over me, A warm, lazy current,   that dreams of the faraway Ocean, knowing that its fate is to merge,   and become one with its Salty depths.   Unhurried, and without any knowledge of movement,   The boiling, vast, Idiot Child of our Lust,   moves inexorably towards its fulfillment,Bump, and grind, Rock and roll,   on and on, in and out,   The Beast with two backs rises and falls,   again and again, on and on, Up and down,      No two clumsy Timepieces ever synchronised with such seamless timing,   no drumbeat ever more than echoed it's Perfect rhythm,.   So, Dance then, whoever you may be,    I am the Dance of the Lord , said She,     and She leads us all,   in ecstasy,   In the name of ****, and **** with me.         Wow, I need a cigarette now !

20090202155713AAlFteW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Critique my writing, por favor?	Well, I have completed two chapters, but I will only post the first. Any suggestions or editing is welcomed. Thank you for doing so!      Dawn      The sun was completely hidden behind the clouds and fog. Mist wrapped around every inch of my body. An expected morning in Monterey. I’ve climbed down from my house to the edge of the sea. The path to the bottom of the cliff was marked dangerous, but with my coordination it was deadly. I’ve been here many times before, but I still managed to scrape my hands when I fell on the rocky breach before reaching my secluded spot. Well, this part of the beach was already vacant, but there was a large crevice inbetween two lanky cliffs that I could find safety in. I come here at least once a month. It’s more out of necessity than habit. It’s the only place I can collect my thoughts. I can be myself. I can not have a care in the world, or I can sort out every care I do have. Looking out into the vast sea of unknown, it is oddly comforting. Comforting to know there was more out there, more than just what I have. To a normal person it may be nothing particularly important, maybe frightening. But I know I’m not like anyone else. And so I see it differently. A question mark I can dissect while the tide numbs my thoughts. A safety net that I can wrap myself in, falling back on the rock and sinking to the dry sand the water can’t touch. This is my place to just…exist.      And every morning I’ve come here has been the same. Early morning. No one was out, not even kayakers, not that they’d be on this side of the peninsula anyway. The mist was always here, coating every inch of the sandy floor to the excruciatingly high tops of the cliffs. Sea gulls can be heard looking for food, maybe an occasional sea lion’s call. The waves are somber and barely reach the rocky shore that leads to my abyss. Every morning I come is like this. Except for today. For today I can feel that I am not alone. There is a tension in the air that I can almost taste. As I push myself back up to stand I heard a snapping of a branch to the left. There is a good amount of trees to the left that somehow grow in this dense sand. My head snapped to the sound of the break and I took a sharp breath in. This part of the beach is never occupied by any humans and rarely by animals. I gripped the rocky wall behind me and leaned forward, peering into the sparse grouping of trees. There was nothing I could see besides the leafless black and white trees. The sand at the bottom was mixed with rocks and I couldn’t tell of any shadows. The fog was of no help either. I shook my head. I tried to convince myself that my mind was just playing tricks on me, but that thought was defeated by the truth. I’m not alone. I can feel it.      I tried to be careful in my haste, only falling once. It was a difficult climb back to civilization, but I eventually made it back to my house. It sits on a street, too close to the houses around it, that is out of the way of the other part of the neighborhood. It’s small and charming, two of the main reasons my mother bought it. My sister Abby and I don’t need nor want a large house when it is just us and my mom. I caught my breath as I unlocked the gate that was attached to a wooden fence that wrapped around the lawn. I walked up the three stairs and entered through the front door. I was home alone, which wasn’t comforting since I had just been scared out of an isolated crook. At least I had comfort in the fact that I was probably the only one who knew a path from the beach to my house, I probably made the only path in my walks there.      It’s Sunday morning. Most families are at church or going to breakfast. Abby is at a friends house she spent the last night at and my mother, Denise, is at work. Of course. She’s rarely around because of her job as a nurse, but when she is, everything is right in the universe. She’s fun and outgoing, young at heart. My mom is my best friend. I’m the exact opposite of her, which is probably why we get along so well. She can soothe me and make the stresses of life turn into opportunities. She is forgiving and practical, always able to bring me back down to my senses. I, on the other hand, am questioning and insecure with the world. I worry too much, care too much. I’m always trying to understand the ‘whys’ of things instead of just taking things like they are. I guess the simple truth is not good enough for me. But Denise can make me relax and see the simplicity of life. She can make me enjoy it instead of question it. She may also be the reason for my monthly escape. It is the only place I can just be. She is always trying to teach me to just absorb everything and breathe, and my spot is where I can succeed in this. She’d be proud of me when I am simply living in that visit to the beach, but I would and could never let her see that. I’m already worried that someone else is down there, I would never willingly invite someone there, not even my best friend. I need space and is

20090202152919AAnzS72	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	What's it like to be a stripper?	I must admit that I've  toyed w/ the idea of stripping because it makes so much money and I'm not bad looking, but I wanna know what exactly goes into it? And do I have what it takes?      I have a boyfriend of 2 1/2 years and even he's told me I should strip part time because I'm so hot & would make a lot of money.      I'm in school full time so a little cash on the side would be great, but what tools do you need and as a woman do you feel good or dirty stripping?      Is it dangerous? Have men tried to take advantage of you?      SO on, just tell me what your feelings are on the stripping thing.      Also between 18 & up and 21 and older, which kind is better to work at.      I've attached a couple pics too so you can tell me if I really DO look hot enough to strip.      Please don't report this question, I'm just curious!       http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g120/h...        http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g120/h...

20090202163251AAAnoNq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How is this part of my story?	its the very beginning of it btw:      I’m finding it hard to sleep tonight; I can’t seem to settle. All I can think about is blood, I close my eyes and I picture a razor gashing across someone’s wrist, and I watch as the get gets so deep a vein bursts. And all that beautiful shimmering blood pours out, down her arm. It begins to slow down, and then it stops, the arm falls and it doesn’t move. It’s like an overwhelmingly beautiful piece of music being played to you, all these little emotions that you savour. I knew it was time, I had to kill again.     I had already buried about four people in their unmarked graves in the past two months. I normally only kill when I feel a dire need. It’s a precious thing, taking away someone’s life and so I don’t like to do it too often, I don’t want my favourite hobby getting boring on me.  Tonight I was having one of those urges; it’s only so long that I can function in society slightly normal before I have the need to kill again.    I reached out under my bed and pulled out my tool bag. Where I keep most of the instruments I use when I head off to do my work. All those little knives I carry are so pretty, they can really create true art, and the body of my poor defenceless victims is my canvas.  Just splash that crimson blood around a bit and a masterpiece is born.  My favourite is the pen knife, so simple, easy to hide; your victim won’t even see it as you crawl up behind them and slit their throats. Oh so dark, rich, and delightful.                i will add more if i get a good response but i didnt want the question to be too long.

I semi know the answers, but I want your opinion too, so I can make a better essay response. The first one is, "Pony thinks Darry doesn't care for him and mistreats him. Soda says that Darry really loves Pony a lot. What evidence is there for each view. How might the two be reconciled." and the next one is, "Cherry reveals that she is not happy in her role as a Soc. Why is she uncomfortable as a member of this group? What might Pony say he dislikes about being a greaser?" and the last one I need is, "Do you believe that Pony will "stay gold" or do you believe "Nothing gold can stay" give evidence from the story to support your opinion". On that one, I want your own personal opinion, and why you think that. I need help ASAP- It's due Thursday. I will chose the best answer depending on who is the most detailed.

FEEL      What a heart does feel is so intense vivid and real   It beats with soaring delight in the sweetest rites   That it returns the soul to celestial heights   However, its clenches of waving pain   Make us lose site in the happiness we can gain   To feel can stop breath in the depths of sorrow   Until ones, soul seems empty and hollow   To live is to love but not without pain   For opposition is our teacher and hope for gain   In this mortal game called pleasure and pain   To hate is to die and live in vain   So live with love intense and real   Make the heart reach and want to feel.   The creator of all and author of this plan   Wants us to become so much better then man   So fight and hold stead fast to His Word   And know that your prayers are always heard   However, pain and sorrow may be your lot   Trust in God, for he knows what needs to be taught   What a heart does feel is so intense vivid and real

Oh, how I miss those warm summer days,   When all the world is so off pace,   And lazy days go by and by,   While the sun hangs lowly in the sky,      I lay down slowly on the luscious green,   As the hot sun casts a spell upon me,      Its  green-texture cool and crisp,   Like a freshly turned pillow beneath my head,      As a gentle breeze puts me at ease,   All the days troubles swiftly  drift away,      Wild Flowers brush against my face,   With colors so full and fresh,    As if coming from an artist’s canvas,      The sweet aroma putting me to sleep,   Almost like in a timeless dream,      Bees buzzing and lawn mowers humming,   Fresh cut grass and barefooted children,   Butterflies fluttering and tree leaves dancing,      All tell me to lay down and stay,   And just to enjoy this warm summer daze,      Stay and lay,   For just a little bit longer….

20090202155801AAJGif7	Arts & Humanities;History	Have you see this movie and do you know its name? in ww2 women?	The movie is placed around the time of World War I or II, I am not sure, but more inclined to believe that it is World War 2 instead of 1. An actress who plays in it has red hair. It all begins with this actress and her fiance. She is pregnant, and the two of them have a fight and so the fiance hits her, she ends up in the hospital. She forgives him, then she gets pregnant, he comes home drunk and I think he throws her down the stairs. So she has a miscarriage. She leaves him and travels with her parents I believe to England. She meets this handsome guy there. They fall in love and marry. She first gives birth to a son, then to a daughter. The daughter dies of some disease and the son starts hating her for that. Then World War 2 breaks out, the husband goes to War. The Germans occupy her house, she has a relationship with the German captain after he rescued her from being raped by the soldiers. Then her husband comes back paralyzed. They have a lot of kids. 8 total I think. In the end, he dies and the family open up 6 diamond stores around the world. If you know the name, please tell me. It is way more exciting then my recap. Thank you.

I shut it off and got back into bed and about 15 minutes later I felt the touch on my wrist again but was not scared. I just ignored it and it went away.      NOW THE KICKER!

So I kept thinking in my head if this is true tell me who you are! Then the name Katie Beers came into my head. I knew I would forget this so I texted myself with it. I just looked it up and its a girl who was held captive in 1992 but not someone who is dead???

20090202154129AARAbnS	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can anyone help me? I need a short summary for the book "The call of the wild".?	Okay so my english teacher told my class today for homework to find a summary of The call of the wild, and an adults opinion on it. Unlike many others, I am not trying to get you to "do my homework" or anything like that. We have just started the book "Nothing but the Truth" By Avi. I suppose this is the reason we have to get summaries on The call of the wild, because it is mentioned on page 7 in "Nothing but the Truth" And not that it matters, but I'd just like to include that I am in 8th grade. Please do not send me a link of a summary. I've looked at practically everyone of those. I need a summary with a maximum of 7 sentences (and no run-on sentences!) and also your honest opinion of the book. Thank you in advance.

Yeah, not exactly a topic everyone's ok with but I have to do a murder-mystery story for my english class. It has to be 2 minutes long. Normally, I'm good at making stories except these type of stories aren't my best so I don't know what to do!      Here are the guidelines you MUST follow:      -Start by describing the crime scene      -Describe the important location(s) (especially the murder scene!)      -Give out clues of who the murderer is during the course of the story      -Keep things realistic;No magical fairy princesses with chocolate pudding ;P      -Don't forget to describe the important characters : the detective, the person that is accused of the murder, the victim, the suspect(s), and the witness(es)      -Use murder-mystery vocabulary      -At the end of the story, say who did the murder and why      Well, that's it. I'm looking forward to some of your stories.      *P.S. If you don't feel like writing the whole story, write me half of it with a cliffhanger at some point and I'll see if I can elaborate from there.*

I don't really like books that everyone is reading, so best-sellers are out of the question. I'm also not into romance novels at the moment, so if anyone would have an idea which books are amazing, intriguing, fun and far from being scary, annoying and sad, I would like a list of your top 10 (or 20 if you can) books that I would probably like to add to my library (and would wanna read more than once). I like a lot of different genres, but don't want teen books, or any of the ones I mentioned above.       Old and new books would be fine. As long as I can find them and they don't cost more than $40 anywhere.       Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Its important, and morality instill.  Its not about sports playing in the street.  And every body jamming to the beat.    Culture is you, culture is me.  Our heritage is vital cant you see?  Its a mind set, and a life style too.  Values and characters thats always in view.    Mocko jumbies and masquerades are good to see.  But culture is you, culture is me.  The things we hold dear to our hearts.  About our country that wont let us part.    Heritage is richness in full gear.  Nation building, we should hold dear.  Sports, food and frolic will someday pass.  What value we inherit will never depart.    Generation will come so they will go.  Values and moral will exchange hands.  Lets all live together as years passes by.  Give out what we learn dont let our culture die.

Every time I talk about WW2 online some Brit flips out and keeps telling me that "Britain stood alone" for the entire war, and that they always took the hardest jobs and battles, and that the US did almost nothing.      I would argue that the US did A LOT in WW2 including saving Britain's ***. the only hope they had outside the US was the Soviet Union who would have just as simply invaded Europe after defeating Germany.      So why won't any Brits accept that the US played a major roll in ending the war in Europe? Is it that they can't accept that their old colony has surpassed them as a world power?

20090202170357AADpXER	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	A poem I just wrote, what do you think? Thoughts and opinions are welcome. Any criticism is welcome as well?	the spectre of America hangs over my shoulder,   with Ginsberg stealing my shadow.   I crawl down the bleary street, the night grows colder,   my breath struggles in wisps of cloud,   my hands are stained with blood, the dagger of love's conscious act   in my hand. The world strains forward,   eager at the scent of iron, baying at the stench of it all.   Freedom accursed! Woe upon the fellow and his keep that dwells    shallowly in his bed! Look upon the wretched,   and feel ashamed for your ignorance, for as a hand is stretched out   for Heaven, it is cut down in laughter.   Wine flows openly and without reproach from the barrels of indulgence,   and like the blood of my hand it stains   the roads crimson. Satan! What wrath of you wrought,   you serpent fiend, you prey on men,   and seduce them with the hips of motherhood, a binding agreement    from which there is no ill escape.   Mother I plead of you, cast me away,   I am not fit for carrying this upbeat stone any longer, I want to fly and be free! But what is my mind is not me,   or so you claim, your rusty brow etched in permanent grimace,   your hands frozen as fists, the ever-present fear of a drunken husband,   who loves women so, but loves you so little,   where have you gone? My imagination grows stiff with the morning,   and in the upper neighborhoods where the children play,   all lust for love is lost, for as I wander these streets   I can't help but wonder if my thoughts are the wonderings of an intellectual,   or the imaginings of a benzedrine kick run dry.   Life will make sports jackets of us all.

If you were reading/watching this and this was the introduction, would you keep going? What could I do to improve?      [Narrator]: And in the end there was war. It was not always this way…the Vampyre’s of each nation were once peaceful; that is, until one went rogue. His name; was Darius. He tricked some of the most powerful of the Vampyre’s into believing his lies, breeding an army of evil and tainted power. The few remaining Vampyre’s went into hiding, allowing the Army of the Damned to take over. And so the story begins…         All answers appreciated, thanks.

20090202132706AA0keLY	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	1984                ?	I read 1984 back in highschool, but I've still got some questions about it.      1: Red country is always at war with either Blue or Green, and at peace with the other. When Red stars a war with the peaceful country, they make peace with the warring country. Then Red rewrites last week's newspaper to make it appear that Red was ALWAYS at war with Blue and ALWAYS at peace with Green, which is a lie.      Wouldn't it be easier to admit the past than rewrite it? Not only do you have to rewrite every history book in the library, you have to brainwash people into believing it too.      2: Is it possible that Blue and Green countries don't even exist? Red says they do, but do they? Maybe they were made up in order to manipulate people into the history-rewriting and brainwashing exercises. Does Big Brother exist? Does Goldstein? Who keeps shooting the missiles at the proles? Maybe there are no leaders and there is no war, it's just smoke and mirrors to make the people feel grateful that they live in a moderately safe country instead of a hypothetical war-torn one like Green or Blue.      3: Red is a Communist state and most of it's citizens have a bad quality of life. Poor Winston can't even afford to get face-razors. Are the citizens living in poverty because they have to, or because the government is withholding supplies? Maybe Red wants their people to be miserable?      4: Which leads to my big question: Is there any point to all of this? Sure, Red has an iron-fist over a zombie state of loyal comrades who live in slums, fear imaginary war, and erase their own memory at the drop of a hat. Is there any conceivable reason why Red would want to rule such a rotten state of affairs? It's malignant and appears worthless. So why bother?      Any ideas?

What can I write, where do I start?  Its gotta be something from the heart  I dont care if its about the skies or the trees  Oh God help me will you please?

How can I really get into what I’m writing, I like what I’m writing about, but I really don’t feel . . . I’m not sure how to explain it, I don’t feel like I could just keep the character in my head, and not feel that I have to write out his/her story. Sorry if you don’t understand what I’m asking.

20090202175417AA7FGdL	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you read my book?	This is my book please tell me if you think it is good.      The Day of Black Sun.   By: Trent Knutson         Chapter 1       Jon woke up and he was somewhere he didn’t know of. It was a large cave of someplace he thought, but in the distance he saw no light at the end. He thought to himself “I am dreaming this can’t be true” but deep inside him he knew it was, he knew why he was here and most importantly he knew who had brought him here.       It all started on Midsummer’s Day his eleventh birth night. Fa had warned Jon that someday he would be taken from his home and “set free” he said, but as Jon sat there now he said out loud “right now I am anything but free”. Then when he was sleeping a demon wolf came up upon their camp sight and slashed his giant paw upon Fa’s chest. As he lay dying there he said “son, this all happened for a reason never forget that. Jon swear that you will never forget that” when Jon said nothing he said it louder “Jon swear, swear it on your soul that you will never forget that it all happened for a reason”. “I swear upon my soul that I will never forget”. Now what Fa was going to say hurt the most to Jon “now I want you to switch bows with me”, “but Fa you need yours…” his father cut him off “Jon do it I will be glad to have something of yours when I pass. So Jon switched bows and left the camp sight by hugging his dad and saying “that nothing will ever be the same again.” And his dad said, “yes it will son, when this is all over everything will be back to normal” that left Jon smiling on his way out.      Now Jon is on his own with a little food left and his knife, his dad’s bow and his sleeping sack and he was braving the woods with this demon wolf still on the loose. He was one of the White Hare clan of the far north. But when his dad had been hurt we had to leave the camp sight so the demon will not hurt the others. So he decided to go get water and set up camp for the night. That’s when everything started to go wrong. When he was getting the water one thing went right he had found his pack-brother. One white hare was wondering close to the edge of the woods in the snow “probably looking for his mother and father” Jon said to himself, but they were nowhere to be seen. So Jon being able to speak to all animals put his hands to his lips and called the hare to him.       As soon as the hare heard the call he came running to the voice thinking it was his ma and pa. But when he got there it was this strange figure. “He smells like white hare, he can talk the white hare but he does not look like the one of the pack”. The hare thought to himself. He went and examined him and when he went to the backside he saw that he had no tail. “Are you a hare” the animal asked. “No but I no the way of the White Hare and I can lead you the way a pa can, I will give you shelter food and a friend but you will have to be my pack-brother” The strange hare said, “ok if you say so, I will go with you and be your pack-brother” the animal said. “Good” Jon Said, “but know one thing I am the pack-leader at all times”, “ok” the hare said. And so it be written in stone that the Hare and Jon are pack-brothers from now till the day they both die.         Chapter 2       So now they were together. So they set out on their long       defying journey. It was nearly ending dawn and they needed to set up camp. They picked a comfortable spot but close too the water so if it floods they will be in trouble.   But little that they know that was the least of their problems…   Late in the night Jon woke up with a fright someone or something was outside camp sight. He first heard the sound of crunching leaves which he thought was very strange, then he saw them two large figures walking in circles around the camp sight with for no apparent reason. Now Hare was awake and knew they were there “when they get to the other said we break for it ok” said Jon in hare talk, so they packed their stuff very silently and when they reached the other side they booked it out of their setting traps behind them as they went.

20090202184125AAmyuMY	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	It's kinda a poem, and kinda just a writing.?	As I think of my gain,   I think of pain.      As I think of my tears,   I think of rain.      As I think of rain,   I think of the rainbow to come.      As I think of you,   I think of tears.      As I wonder about you,   My heart skips a beat.      As I worry about you,   Tears begin to fall.      As my tears begin to fall,   So does the rain begin to fall.      As the rainbow comes up so beautiful and mysterious,   So does the throught of my true rainbow.      As I look at the stars for guidance,   They guide me to you.      As I follow my heart,   It guides me to you.      As it hurts seeing you walk to someone else,   It feels like a shadow left behind.      As I cry with such pain,   I think of all the pain I give to others.      As I wish to end the pain,   The smile you give me prevails.      As I sit here alone in the darkness,   You come to guide me.      As I think of love,   I think of mi amor.         As I think of an angel,   I think of you      As I say I love you,   You look away.      As you look away,   It eats me inside.      As all I can say is the truth,   I love you…      As I think of the words to say to you,   I say I love you!      Forever and ever, Jessica…      I hope you like it, leave your comments please. It's the poem im giving her for her birthday.

20090202192702AAALzN6	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem?	Out of the 2 poems which do you like best?      1. First Valentine - The sun started the world with the day of love. Roses, Tulips, and Carnations is the theme every year. Above the pedals are the hearts that are consumed by the smell, the look, the feeling of what the day means to the holder and the receiver. Anxious girls awaited the day of a flower approaching them, with the guy who held their feelings on the pedals, and their thoughts on the stem. With only five words to say that means the world, and the one answer that could kill the day, the first Valentine that would change it all would say, will you be my Valentine.      2. Leaving Roses - Looking upon the misted cold glass, only shining upon me is the light from the text. Ears laid upon the wall, body cornered in the room, eyes gazing at the words, mind turned to what is now my past. Living in now what I feared most, hoped, wished, avoided for the most time. Leaving my presence to be with another, the other you choose, they choose, he, she, together, I. Getting up with what you had held me down, now still with me as I walk by you. Sense you when I hear you talk. Hoping to leave it where you will depart. Along with what I first gave you, your Rose.      Okay I know their not the best but tell me which is good out of the two and some criticism, which I don't mind by the way.

We held hands as I looked at his Adonis-like features. I begun to bite my nails and then it happened. Snap! I broke a nail. Edward's head jerked around and he cradled me in his arms.      "Oh, Bella! Whatever will we do? Don't die. Oh, woe is me. I love you, Bella! I'm trouble, Bella. I don't deserve you. You should leave me now, Bella," he said, still holding my hand.       I looked at his perfect features. His perfect face and his overall perfection.       "We'll get through this, because I love you Edward!"       "You know I will give you anything and everything", he said. We continued walking and he let go of my hand for 5 seconds. I tumbled down a hill and fell into a random dark ditch.       "Oh, Edward ... save me because I am incompetent without you and Stephenie Meyer loves to portray me as the damsel in distress which promotes sexism. Oh, Edward I'm such a Mary Sue, but you still love me, don't you?"

20090202134758AA3kB8W	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How can I help my mother?	I apologize in advance for the length, and for the fact that this isn't exactly philosophy. I like you guys the most.       My mother was recently diagnosed with Ankylosing spondylitis after having been to countless doctors, misdiagnoses, and wrong treatments. It took her 25 years to get a diagnosis. The disease is hereditary and affects .5-1% of the population. She also had breast cancer last year. This year, my grandfather was diagnosed with bladder, lung, and bone cancer. He only has about 2 months left. My Pop goes to the same oncologist as my mother did, and she accompanies him to every chemo treatment. My mom had recent bloodwork to check for some other disease they thought she might have (she doesn't have it.) This morning when she went with my Pop to the oncologist, the doctor came in and asked her if it'd be alright to tell my grandfather the news. (she assumed it was the negative bloodwork.) So she said yes. The doctor went on to tell my mother that the disease she has is hereditary and he is the likely giver. My grandfather has already lost a son (mom's brother died when he was 25,) and now he thinks he's the reason my mother has been suffering her whole life, and that his predicament is what she will end up like. He's only cried twice in my mother's presence; the death of his son, and now this. She thinks he's going to go to his grave thinking he failed.       Not to mention my poor grandmother! She's losing her husband, lost her son, and saw her daughter suffer through cancer and this disease.       My mother hasn't come down from her bedroom all day, and I'm worried about what this is doing to her (psychologically.) She and her family has already been through so much. HOW CAN I HELP HER?! =(    She's also worried that I might have this disease too.
20090202203324AA5uvFi	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Question about John Keats poetry? best answer=100pts?	Here is the John Keats poem "ode to a nightingale"   Ode to a Nightingale      My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains   My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,   Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains   One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:   'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,   But being too happy in thine happiness,-   That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees,   In some melodious plot   Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,   Singest of summer in full-throated ease.      O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been   Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,   Tasting of Flora and the country green,   Dance, and Provencal song, and sunburnt mirth!   O for a beaker full of the warm South,   Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,   With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,   And purple-stained mouth;   That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,   And with thee fade away into the forest dim:      Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget   What thou among the leaves hast never known,   The weariness, the fever, and the fret   Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;   Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,   Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;   Where but to think is to be full of sorrow   And leaden-eyed despairs,   Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,   Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.      Away! away! for I will fly to thee,   Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,   But on the viewless wings of Poesy,   Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:   Already with thee! tender is the night,   And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,   Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;   But here there is no light,   Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown   Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.      I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,   Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,   But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet   Wherewith the seasonable month endows   The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;   White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;   Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;   And mid-May's eldest child,   The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,   The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.      Darkling I listen; and, for many a time   I have been half in love with easeful Death,   Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,   To take into the air my quiet breath;   Now more than ever seems it rich to die,   To cease upon the midnight with no pain,   While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad   In such an ecstasy!   Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain -   To thy high requiem become a sod.      Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!   No hungry generations tread thee down;   The voice I hear this passing night was heard   In ancient days by emperor and clown:   Perhaps the self-same song that found a path   Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,   She stood in tears amid the alien corn;   The same that oft-times hath   Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam   Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.      Forlorn! the very word is like a bell   To toil me back from thee to my sole self!   Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well   As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.   Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades   Past the near meadows, over the still stream,   Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep   In the next valley-glades:   Was it a vision, or a waking dream?   Fled is that music: - Do I wake or sleep?       "One common, and perfectly viable, reading of the ode is to see the nightingale as a sybolic artist and its song as art; the poem is then seen to speak the traditional themes of inspiration and the immortality of art as opposed to the transience of life.."   What does this quote mean?   the 100pts was an exageration... but if you answer this question to my liking i will ask as many questions as you want and pick you for the best answer all time. THANK YOU! No, this is not my homework. It is like 1/20 of an essay so do not worry.

Why is she here?   Living in silence,   Now to appear.      Sorrow and grief is what I see,   In the mirror in front of me.   Why is she so lonely?   Why is she so sad?   Because of her friends,   Her mom, and her dad.      Ugly and dumb are what I see,   In the mirror in front of me.   Where is her self worth?   Why is she so depressed?   Because she doesn’t feel   She’s as good as the rest.      Why can’t I see what others see,   In the mirror in front of me?   They say that I’m smart,   Talented, and cute.   I just hope that one day   I can think it too.

20090202193121AAjNplS	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Good young adult fantasy novels?	I am 15 and have the reading level of a college graduate but a normal attention span, so it's hard to find books that are both exciting and challenging.    I love fantasy, but I can't find many that don't involve swordbanging.  If you could recommend any good ones that have zero swordfighting and/or are set in modern times would be amazing, especially if it's a series.  Check out the list below... thanks!  I'm also open to other genres if you have really good books.      I have read:      Harry Potter series   Lord of the Rings series   Twilight series   City of Bones   Eragon series   Wicked Lovely series   The Mediator series   Inkheart series   Song of the Lioness series   Trickster's Choice series   Vampire Academy series   Keisha'ra series   His Dark Materials series   Warriors series   Midnighters series   Uglies series   Peeps   Blood and Chocolate   Looking For Alaska   The Host   The White Darkness   The Warrior Heir series   East of Eden   Blue Bloods

20090202203805AA5IEgp	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	The Brain Family of Stafforshire in England?	Hey. I'm doing research on the Brain Family. As far as I've gone is of a William Henry Brain who was born in Staffordshire in England in 1888.       He served in the Australian Army in WW1. He married someone called Mary. She was married before and already had a son called Arthur. Willliam Henry Brain died in Western Australia, Australia.       I found William Henry Brain's war record. It says his next of kin was his father-William F Brain.       Does anyone have any information of this family or information on other family members of this family? Preferrably more distant family? Is anyone on yahoo answers part of this family? I am. William Henry Brain is my Great Grandfather.       I've been told from my family that I have a very distant ancestor who was a knight who protected a king and queen a long time during the time of kings and queens in castles.      Please help me with all information of this family. Please please! Thankyou!

20090202195207AAqltaz	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	Marquis mystery, guillotine France 1800's?	Marquis mystery, guillotine France 1800's?   There is a story in my family that my 3rd great grandfather (last name of Marquis) had to flee France to avoid the guillotine. He had fled to England and had a family.      I am figuring that this would have happened somewhere between 1800 -1850. My question is : is there anyway to find out if there was any Marquis that was to be beheaded or if there were warrants?      I only know the name of his son Henry Marquis (my 2nd great grand father) and his descendants but I don't know the name of my 3rd great grandfather. I don't even know where in France he was born.      Could this unknown Marquis have been in the French History books as an obscure reference or this could have some story passed down as gossip? What would the political climate have been like after the French revolution and Napoleon. I am not familiar with French History and feel that I might start making assumptions then find out it was nothing.. Help

20090202200712AAjbMIC	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you know the author of this book?	The book is aimed for the young adult crowd and was a mystery. It involved 4 high school students on their way back from a competition where they were being mimes( I remember the football player complaining about tights). While driving a huge storm comes along and their truck breaks down and they go to a house and a guy lets them stay in the house. But the guy and the lady that was with him don't really live there and are probably robbing the place, and leave them in the house while they leave. While the 4 kids are in the house they find a bunch articles and tricks involving a magician, the lights go out, people disappear. There was also a dog...no idea why I think the dog part might help. Does anyone remember the author or the title of that book?

Ive been drawing for a long time,and ive recently gotten back into it a lot. I feel like i'm pretty decent at it when i can actually think of stuff to draw(could use help in that department as well)      Anyway, I draw very sketchy, and I do a lot of erasing and stuff. I admire those who draw very clean lines and such, but I just cant seem to do well without using a lot of pencil strokes rather than leaving the pencil down. Is there a good way to train myself into this?      Also, any tips on proper drawing gear would be appreciated. I get lead smeared all over my paper all the times and crap like that, shading tips too!

20090202202611AAXyiCp	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good story/?	OK i wrote this myself and im not done keep in mind im only 11 NO REALLY MEAN COMMENTS comments like I wouldnt read that r ok      Before I Die……             Ch.1- My life        I woke up from what felt like days of being asleep. I woke up today and felt no different than when I went to sleep. To tell you the truth I might feel worse. As days go by I feel sicker or maybe I’m just getting sick of this room, this hospital, all this medicine. Well let’s start from the beginning. My name is Leah and  I was 7 years old when this started it started with me feeling terribly ill and then my life started changing   ,    forever. I’m 13 now. I have, no let’s make that had a tumor. It was removed today my stomach I still very weak. Even though it’s gone I have this feeling that it’s not  gone, that I’ll never be cured. I cry every day in the mornings, at night before I go to bed, just laying  wondering if I’m going to survive. The hardest part is my family is just me and my mom, my dad left us when he found out about my sickness. I hear my mom cry every night I think she thinks the same things that I wonder. I have only one friend, Kayla , one friend that’s dying I got the news last week they told me that they’ve tried everything they could and it’s not curable. I cry even harder every night now. Kayla entered the hospital the same day I did we shared the same room. We related to each other. I’m not allowed to see her anymore I never got to say goodbye. I’ve got to get some sleep now we’ll talk soon.        Ch.2- Torture       A couple of months have past since I last wrote. Kayla died last night I feel that a part of me has died too. I sometimes think she’ll be happier up there. She suffered 10 times as bad as me. I still won’t accept that she’s gone, for good. I’ll never see her again. Well alive that is. I miss her so much. Well she’s gone and I’ll just have to accept that. I saw my father. Just seeing his well it just…. Disgusted me. When I was young he told me that he’d always be there when I need him. Well that was a lie he was never there he doesn’t  know and I don’t want to know him. He said he came to try and make up the years lost he wasn’t here I think it was guilt I don’t think he even cares. I met a little girl 3 days ago I see her every day now. She is 4 years old and suffers with a brain tumor. She is very strong I think she can survive it I hope she can survive it. I can’t leave  the hospital yet. The doctors say I’m not strong enough. I know that I also have to wait to see if it returns.

OK I'm way too old for this series but I've read the first book and am just in the process of finishing New Moon.      I don't get why the character of Bella goes back to Edward at the end when she had such a sweet guy as Jacob Black - I mean Bella and Edward's relationship is all wrong, its creepy, obsessive and based on an unequal sharing of power (Edward has all the money etc, chooses her college for her, ugh . . .)  Jacob and Bella have a much more "normal" relationship based on shared interests and friendship - in real life they would have a much better and more lasting relationship.      I was seriously so disappointed I don't think I can read the other books!  Perhaps I'm missing the point as I'm older than the target audience but it just doesn't make sense to me . . .Bella is an idiot to leave Jacob for Edward, lol!
