20090129040942AASHyfK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Re ask: Need relationship help, i might have come on a lil needy towards a girl i like and more things in the ?	im turning 21 this year i havent been in a relationship before and im a normally quiet ish guy and there is this girl that i have liked for a while now and i am trying to pursue her and get her to like me the same way. i have also recently found out that one of my friends also likes her but i haven't said anything shoud I? I know that im lacking in confidence and sum of my friends have been helping me out and im trying to improve. so ive started looking for a job and trying to be more independent cause i think this will help me come off as a more confident person. some other things ive been doing in an attempt to get her to like me more is talk to her more, try to see her as much as possible, i know where she works should i make a visit or would that be to forward? ive also got her mobile number is calling for a chat would be out of line to random? will she she right thru me:P haha im a lil to self conscience or over thinking probably. but i have notice a few occasions i have kept asking her if she wants a lift i think i do this to often and has made me seem to needy or something. so i was wondering if i just stop doing this a bit after maybe seeming a lil needy could a relationship still happen or have a screwed it up? when chatting to her are there and do and donts in topics to talk about? i thinking the more time spent together more chance of a relationship? i really like this girl and dont want to stuff it up so any tips would be very much appreciated. -a shy guy needing help :) if there is anything else i will add it in later.

20090129042354AAGZG1c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls...how do you feel about guys dating a few at a time?	Some guys when single and wanting to find a GF choose to find a few girls..I dunno how many - could get real messy! - before they choose the one they want to date exclusively.      Not being a "playa" but rather saving time if you think about it.      Girls, after how many dates do you think is enough for a guy to make the decision to move to exclusive?      ALSO:   How would you feel if this guy was sleeping with some or all of those girls whilst he is dating you?   Put off right?      In contrast, how do you feel about this dating approach when sex is NOT involved?

20090129042953AA5kUc4	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why can't I forget about my ex?	The girl I liked since the day I started college (last year). Finally had the guts to talk to her, and everything turned out well. I was 18, she was 21. We were together for 4 months and everything was going good too. Around the Fall, the school didn't do much for her, so she decided to go back where her friends lived (...found out her ex lives with those friends as well).    We talked a few more times. I was concerned and as for her, she told me, "I didn't want to bring this up to you because I was afraid on your reaction, but my ex asked me back out again, and I couldn't say no". After hearing this, I felt shattered, as if my heart already had enough pain from her leaving.    I will admit, she was my first girlfriend, and things could had been better if she didn't leave, but no. 4 months being with her made me felt shattered for another 4 months.    After a whole year, I moved on, and I did things that I focused on doing for myself......until now. Now, for some reason, I can't stop thinking about my ex, but this time without me being upset (which I find weird). I keep thinking about her...but I'm not all that upset like a year ago. When I think of her, I catch myself just sitting in my quiet room, not even moving.    Most guys say that I should meet other girls...but I don't know. For a guy like me, I don't even pay attention to women much and I don't know why.    What could be going on?? Why can't I forget about my ex??

20090129041856AAf6VBx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just broke up with a "great guy". Will there be another?	Here's the deal: I just broke up with a really sweet guy. He was thoughtful, generous, funny, a great listener, we always had a good time and the sex was incredible. In the end, I just got bored. I couldn't picture myself with him in the long run; and I didn't want to continue wasting his time (or my own).       A little background information on me: Despite my best efforts, I can't seem to stay committed to one person for more than a year. I've dated handsome guys, nice guys, smart guys, funny guys, bad guys and good guys. In the end, it just never seems to be right. I'm a nice person and I don't want to believe that I'm just "not cut out for love". Am I crazy to want it all? I'd like to find someone who's funny, kind, smart...but makes my toes curl. I just haven't found ALL of those qualities packaged together. I guess I'd like to know that there's better out there...and I'm feeling a little blue because I'm worried that I've used up all of my "free passes" for love.       I want to continue dating, but I am so tired of feeling guilty every time I break up with someone. More than anything, I'm tired of hurting people. I don't want to start dating again, only to find out that I'm not the monogamy-type. Any thoughts? Or encouragement from women who have had similar experiences? LoL. It'd be great to know that I'm not alone out there. Thanks in advance!
20090129042747AAbN1xP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for the Girls/Women?	Does me having my Bad Breath a turn on for you?
20090129041638AAnzN9z	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Really screwed up marriage. Need objective opinions. ?	I'd like the personal opinions of anybody with some experience. My husband and I have been married almost 5 years and oh boy, what a mess.   1) For religious reasons, I was bent on not marrying anyone who drinks at all. I made it very clear to him when he first started talking marriage and he swore he would stop from that day. He didn't but I believed him. Yes, I was young, gullible and inexperienced. So he carried on drinking every few days, which I only realised after the wedding. We would get into fights when I smelt it on him, and he denied it. The fights would turn violent. Finally after about 2 years he saw that I really wasnt going to accept it, so he stopped, but he hates me for it. He thot I would 'understand'. Now I dont trust him and believe that he drinks when either of us is out of town.   2) He had a dubious relationship with some female 'business contact' which involved him lying to me about his whereabouts, taking her out to meals and clubbing one-on-one, and bringing her to his social club after telling me that it's just guys, so I couldnt go with him. Caught him redhanded via a PI, checking of msgs etc. The usual suspicious wife thing. His defence is that she;s just a friend, and he didnt sleep with her so whats my problem?   3) During the period he was with her, he became very worried about losing his wedding ring, so he stopped wearing it, and he also totally stopped having sex with me. And he never came home till 2 or 3 in the morning.   3) He'd rather wait for me to go to bed so he can watch porn then to come and have the real thing with me. In fact he's so used to porn that he can;t even ejaculate inside me (sorry tmi), so he has to masturbate during sex. Unfortunately, I've been wanting a baby real bad the last couple of years. and his method of sex is not conducive for that. So we have to schedule sex, which turns out to be stressful and un-enjoyable for both of us. BTW I've put on abt 5 pounds since the wedding. I'm 5'1'' and now weigh 119 lbs.    5) Since 3 months after our wedding till about 4 months ago, he used to beat me up if we had a bad fight. I tried to give as good as I got, but he usually managed to overpower me. Injuries include bruises all over my face and body, bleeding from lips, eye area, and a pretty bad nosebleed once, which he wouldnt allow me to see a doctor for. He'd also spit on me repeatedly, choke me, and grind his elbow against my throat. Never told anyone cos I didnt want my family to worry, and was too embarrassed to tell anyone else. Last year I told some friends and 4 months ago I told his and my parents, who warned him not to do it again. He did it once last month, and panicked and tried to convince me it wasnt his fault. Every beating was because I 'pushed his buttons'. Every fight came with him threatening to divorce me.   6) He won;t see anyone for counselling because he 'doesnt have a problem, only I do". I've been seeing a psychologist who said she can help me deal with my emotions, but can;t help the marriage since he';s not there.   7) However, when we're not fighting etc, he's funny, he's smart, he's generous. He agreed for me to quit my job so I could study full time and now he's supporting me financially. Bascially I have full financial security and freedom to spend as I like, a beautiful home of my own, a car...everything anybody would want.   But now I just feel empty inside. He's trying to improve after the parents got involved - he comes hom early, he claims not to be going near any woman any more, he doesnt drink (that I know of), and he has gone about 4 months with only one episode of violence. But I cant stand his attitude. Among other things, we're so different, and I really wish I hadn't married him so quickly, cos now I know we're not compatible in out outlooks, values etc. Yet I'm afraid to divorce him in case I regret it later. Should I give him a chance to redeem himself or should I just leave?

20090129041919AAfUCfc	Family & Relationships;Friends	Really worried about my friend working herself into the ground. What can I do?	I live with a group of friends.  We're all primary teachers just starting out in our careers.   One of the girls is working herself into the ground.   She finishes school after half2 sometime but never ends up coming home from school till after 6 or 7.   She might sit down for an hour or two and go back up to her room doing more stuff for the next day.   No matter what we've said it hasn't helped.    She's a complete perfectionist when it comes to working but this is ridiculous.   From Monday to Friday she is not enjoying herself at all.   She broke down crying last night saying she was a crap teacher which we all believe to be far from the truth.   You arent a crap teacher if you got As in teaching practice in college.   What can we do?   If we suggest going to the cinema or going for a drink she wont come cause she has stuff to do for school.   Nobody is going to thank her for all the work she is putting in.

20090129045305AALkBpl	Family & Relationships;Family	OK guys...The topic is:  shirts, socks or underwear with holes in them.  Why?	My husband doesn't throw out his boxers or socks when they get holes in them.  I toss them out when they're about at the point of disintegrating in my hands while I fold them.  His favorite sleeping t-shirt has a great big hole in the front.      My husband is not the first man I've known who doesn't throw out these types of articles of clothing once they become ripped or torn.  Actually, it seems that they are worn even MORE FREQUENTLY than the non-damaged clothing.  He isn't normally a slob.  He just wears holey socks and boxers.      Why do men do this?

20090129043629AA87pIR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do I get funny feelings for a girl who is a complete opposite to me?	a few years ago I used to go to this supermarket to shop when I lived with my parents...  after shopping there for a while I started to develop jittery feelings for one of the check out chicks. I think she knew it... I asked her for her number and she gave it to me. We went out to coffee eventually.... but the conversation didn't go as planned... we had nothing in common whatsoever lol. I still spoke to her occasionally... but I didn't pursue her... she played so many damn mind games with me it sucked. I reversed it and played mind games with her too... noone takes advantage of the president of Russia lol :)      So anyway she left her job and I didn't see her anymore... I moved out of home and didn't shop at the supermarket where my parents lived. Now I'm back living with my parents 2 years later and now shop at the supermarket once again...      Tonight I saw her in the supermarket as a customer... I couldn't believe it. But I think she noticed me quickly and looked away after half a second (note 2 years has passed since I last saw her). Everytime I walk into the supermarket I think about where she is and what she is up to... I don't know its so stupid.. she is nothing like me at all. Anyway I tried to shop as fast as possible when I noticed her... I just wanted to get out of there because she didn't want to talk to me... which was stupid because I never left her on a bad note.... plus why wouldn't a girl dig the President of Russia? there aint no better guy than me :)      Now I leave the supermarket to quickly get a bottle of alcohol.. (not vodka lol) and guess who is behind me at the cashier. It was her.. but I chose not to say hello to her... because I walked past her enough times for her to notice me... (I wasn't 100% sure it was her) but now I know its her.      The weird thing is.. she must of left her grocery trolley within the supermarket to get some alcohol. She might of saw me walking into the liquor store outside the supermarket? is this just a coincidence?      I guess it would make sense to leave the trolley at the cashier then walk outside to the alcohol shop to buy a carton then come back and put it in the trolley...      Anyway what do you think? would she be worth saying hello to despite her not making any moves? or should I just move on? I don't have trouble getting female attention. The Presidential status does wonders..  lol I'm not Putin.. just a gimmick haha. but I still do well with women in general.      So...???

20090129043105AAumop2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ex-husband asked me for a favor, should I help?	Ok this really sucks because I have a huge heart but at the same time... I refuse to get taken for granted. My ex-husband is in need of a favor & of course it involves (money) I don't mind helping  him or anyone out because we all need a helping hand sometimes BUT here's why I'm skeptic on lending HIM money:      He's a dad now to a beautiful 1 month old baby boy & the baby mama doesnt live with him cause supposedly she lives back here where I am & he sends em money...iduno, but him & I stopped talking for 2 months now. Thats another thing...he was always texting me alot telling me he missed me to come visit him...then right after his boy was born he stopped looking for me. I had text him to say hi one time & he never responded...that was 2 months ago till this morning. On Christmas he didnt bother to say anything...on new years nothing either...& get this...today is my birthday & he didnt even remember. I know him like the back of my hand & knew that him texting me...& at that time had to be some kind of catch. I called him up & asked him what was up & he poured it out quickly that he needed money. He didnt say happy b-day he just went straight for the favor question. He said one of his guy friends crashed his car & he needs it fixed & noone can lend him money cause times are bad. I had asked him how much he needed & he said whatever I could give him but soon. I would think that his job pays him really well & if his guy friend crashed his ride then the dude should pay for it right?  I noticed he didnt care to conversate...once I told him I'll get back to him see what I can do he quickly said ok I really appreciate it thanx i'll let you sleep now...still no happy b-day lol!  I was like Hey, do you even know   what days today? he was like uuhh thursday...im like mhmm and? uuhh the 29th ur bday yea (sarcastic) ...I paused when he said that & still didnt say happy bday...so he was like i didnt 4get I had other things on my mind...but hey thanx for helping...then b4 hanging up he said it...Happy bday babe! trying to be all cute ...I was cold & said uhuh thanx.... (click)  I think he noticed my tone cause 2 mins later he texted Happy bday MY LOVE have a great day....lol! my love he says lol!     11 years of knowing eachother & he still treats me like Im weak. Ive been over him ALONG TIME AGO but for him to have the balls to ask for money after ignoring my exsistance these past 2 months AND 4getting my bday ...says alot. When I needed money help he dissed me way back when. When it comes to money him & I would clash. Long story trust me. Am I right to feel this way? I dont feel I should help him at all...what do you think?
20090129044222AADc4UP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Stupid fight around the same time each year?	ok, i know he's stressed.. i know he's been working a lot, and misses his kids more because of it. i know he's been having a hard time dealing with his pain in the neck father... i know he's got a lot going on... but lately, he is getting pissy about EVERY little thing...      now, normally, i am good about "picking my battles" with him... i know not everything is worth fighting over... he is not, but usually, its not this big of a deal.. but lately, its been an every night thing.. he always finds SOMETHING insignificant to get angry about with me.. its a bit much. he lets it go by morning, but i cant take it anymore...       i've talked to him, but he keeps saying that he's getting mad because its me who keeps insisting on whatever it is i need to know or do... like, here's an example - 2 nights ago, he said his daughter had a project she needed to work on and since she was going to be home with me that afternoon, i was trying to get more info so i could make sure she was doing it correctly... there was a note sent home about it, but it went to their mothers house... i asked him what she needed to do and when he didnt give me a full answer, i mentioned that there was a note but i thought it was at their moms, and he didnt remember the note and started getting mad cause i wouldnt stop asking questions. i figured he'd say, "ok, i'll talk to their mother in the morning and find out." but no... well, whatever, so i quit, and didnt do the project with her. she could do it at her moms the next day... last night, we fought over who farted.. he kept saying it wasnt him, i said it wasnt me, and he got mad cause i insisted it wasnt me.. it was SO STUPID!      this morning, i said very nicely, "babe, can we please stop fighting about every little thing. we fought over a fart last night!" he says he got pissed cause i was insisting, and it was like he was starting the fight all over again.. if i hadnt shut down and stopped talking, it would have gotten him mad again.. and the weird thing is, last year, at this same exact time, the same thing was happening, we were fighting every night about the stupidest stuff for about 2 weeks... it got really bad.. i'm wondering if its that we really havnt figured out how to live together, and maybe thats the reason for it.. we dont live together, per say, but the nights he has his kids, i stay at his house to bring them to school in the morning (and this is new since he just started working 3 weeks ago..) and the nights he doesnt have them, he stays at my house..  the difference is that for the last year, i stayed at my house when he had the kids... now, asside from when he works, we're together much of the time... we were together a lot before, when we were both out of work, but now, things are a bit different.. i'm not sure what the issue is, or how to rectify it! and no, i'm not leaving him and his kids.. they are my family and life...

20090129043307AAzf7Gx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this flirting getting out of hand! I need some advises here...?	Recently, I start to flirt a lot with one of my female colleague during workplace, and she quite open to my flirting too. But as time goes by, the flirting start to get more "hotter" (no body contact yet, I'm a gentleman); she would tease me to get me into mood if I try not to talk her (because it would always work on me) and I would start to tease her. All the while, she would stand there, smiling as she enjoying whatever sweet talks I throw at her (which I don't really mind) and I would stand so close to her; that I almost smell her hair.       I really don't mind if she using me as a toy for amusement, simply because I really enjoy every moment when I'm flirting with her.       So the questions here is -    1) Is this flirting going too far?    2) Should I stop because I starting to worry what happen if she complain me for sexual harassment, even though she not say anything at this moment?    3) How to avoid her for good since I work in the same department with her.    4) What should I say if some fellow colleagues caught me standing so close & flirting her, to avoid getting myself in trouble

20090129051203AApTUNH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What is the hardest spanking you ever got as an adult or child?	I was NEVER spanked as a kid and now I have a huge fetish.  I finally met someone via the internet to give me a real spanking.  The first one hurt a lot and the second one hurt even more and left my behind bruised and very sore.  I need him to spank me to tears though and I know this will hurt a lot.  He's used different things including his hands, paddles, straps, and a hairbrush.  There was one paddle in particular that I couldn't lay still for so he said the next time I will be restrained and I will have to get all of my punishment.  He lectures me at first of what I've done wrong (I really do deserve it, I go out and get drunk and hook up with guys I just met) and then spends an hour or so spanking me with some breaks in between and makes me stand in the corner.  He does comfort me afterwards and lets me know that I am really a very good person that just does some bad things and that once I learn my lesson, I'll feel much better about myself.  I'm scared that it will just hurt too much and I won't be able to take it and that's why he's restraining me.  What do you think?
20090129045945AAyfZH0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it wrong to have another guy spank me if my boyfriend is not into my fetish?	I've been with the same guy for 8 years and he won't give me a really hard spanking.  He'll swat me pretty hard during sex but that's it and that's normal.   I like to be spanked so hard with hands, belt, hairbrush, paddles, etc... that I'm in tears and my behind is bruised (it isn't medically harmful).  I finally met a guy via the internet and met him in a public place and got to know him well.  He's really into spanking women and I finally had my first session and my second and now I'm going to have a third.  He spanks me also for discipline because I am kinda a spoiled brat and I party way too much and I feel that maybe these sessions will be a deterrent and make me a better person.  I'm afraid my bf will see the bruising though because I'm going to see him after this meeting with him.  I love my bf very much otherwise and we have a great relationship including sex.  I just really need to be spanked now and then.  As long as the guy isn't having sex with me, shouldn't he understand?

20090129051245AAhf6Yh	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	He FINALLY approached me! Interested or friendly?	We have been staring at each other for three months now and he has been avoiding me after I approached him which made me think he wasn't interested (we are both shy). Yestereday, when I saw him, he looked liked he was beaming and as I walked past him, he said "Hi, what have you been up to"? I was caught off guard because he's never actually been the first to start a conversation, I didn't have much of a reply.
20090129050026AAN8WR7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he still interested?	Hey,   So a week ago i gave this guy my number and he would usually say "beautiful" or "gorgeous" or "hey sweetie" and would add "xoxo" when he had to go.   So 2 days ago i met up with him and we spent like 2 hours just having a good old chat and we didnt have an awkward moment.   The same night he had to go to bed and he said "night gorgeous, sweet dreams! xoxo"   anyways ... today he messaged me and was like "hey what you doing?" and we started having a bit of a chat via text. But tonight, when he had to go he just said "night! xo"      I know i might be reading into it to much but i cant tell if hes still interested or not!   because when he talks to girls on myspace he usually adds the "xo" at the end .. hmm .. thoughts?
20090129051949AAqbGgN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How comes long distance bf can last a whole week not saying much?	I think talking regular, with PROPER conversation (like once a week, maybe weds for 30min) is all part of package when in a relationship, especially in a kind of distance one - he lives about an hr away). And that NOT just odd texts and random msn chats are enough to sustain it? (we dont hav a schedule coz of different timetables).      Or am I being barmy?? coz I'v come to realize that I need somet more, and that txts can be a tease, coz you can never tell how he's saying somet, and can't get any real assurance frm it, sometimes msn chat will help..if he's not busy 'browsing', coz then conversation can be more fluent.      Anyway, so I am wondering how comes he can be fine without proper convo during th week? and that our wkend visits are enough??..especially as he's actually missing out on things that go on in my life, & im apparently his bestfriend & mean somet to him? so he should be interested to know. am I just being a 'girl' about it?? Or let it go?

Then in yearbook (graphic degisn), the teacher teaches bullshit lessons, i can basically replace him and start getting payed in his spot. Then i have Biology, which is annoying because the teacher thinks im a screw up. I fight with people who try to punk me out, and a best friend is in that class and the teacher thinks im being a "negative" impact on her (total bullshit, she starts talking to me). Then math, which i can live with, but when its so cold outside, and i woke up late on a day im already ticked of cause of things that happened yesterday why should i go to school when there is only 1 subject worth going to? My parents left for work a while ago, so im probably gonna call em and let em know but, it seems im losing interest in school, and i guess this was kinda venting. I'm quite popular in school, and that could be a distraction but i was popular last year too and my grades were 85+. Now my physics is 50%. So how do i get interested in school again.

20061204123905AAA1lvX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does the world need love?	I don't need it. I want to die alone. I might even become a begger, because I have no clue why i'm living, as I'll have no family in the future... no wife or kids. I would have no patience with either of them, and I would probably end up in jail for hitting them. I just hate falling into love because I am dominant and I don't like to be dominated.  I don't know why people love me. I don't want them to. I am a loser and ugly and boring, and I'm suprised I have any friends, and I am trying to make them hate me. I feel I don't need friends in life and it is my life, and I don't want anyone influencing it.I like being a jerk, because I don't like to listen to other people or take crap from other people. I get compliments all the time and I make the other person go away, feeling bad and it makes me feel good. It is nothing to me. What is my problem.. why do I feel like this?

READ DETAILS!?	we went out twice and i still feel the same exact way since the first day i saw him. its different because were so close and we can tell each other anything but when we get on the gf/bf subject  we get to shy to talk about it. we have so many inside jokes and we know not to date anyone else. we get jealous over each other. everyone thinks were perfect for each other. but the reason we broke up was bc he didn't have time and he was stressing but yet he told me everyhting and i'm the only one he can tell anyhting to (expect how he feels about me).we flirt all the time and were always smiling at each other. but if he finds out i'm talking to another guy he asks me who he is and keeps bringing him up.idk what to do but i can't move one and i think he just might be the one. my problem is i'm to shy and so is he also hes immature but i love him. also i'm scared if i let go some other girl is going to take my place. idk what to do. i do not want to move on.

20090129045718AArmXtd	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you deal with this problem...?	I have a friends, well...'friends'. Its starts like this:   World Book Day is coming and my ‘friends’ said we should do Inkheart. I didn;’t want to but their the kind of friends who make you tag along after them. I hate it , and I didn’t have any other people to play with at the time…so I had to do Inkheart.   I didn’t want to do it and I wanted to do Little Red Riding Hood. One of my other actual friends, Katy, had a best friend called Yashee, she fell for the trick and tagged along after them. Katy, saw this and she followed them and got fed up like me – so we became really good friends because the others didn’t treat us like proper friends. So, we hung out and I just withdraw out of Inkheart and they hate me. I  don’t mind to much – but their the rumour kind.

20090129045934AAh6rzi	Family & Relationships;Family	How should I handle my child's attachment issues?	My husband transferred jobs last month so now he's able to be home more often than he used to. I think it's great that he gets to spend more time with our kids. My two year old daughters seem to love it, too. However, my four year old son will not listen to my husband, and won't do as he's told unless I'm the one that says it. It's like my husband doesn't even exist to him.   The other night I had to attend a meeting so I left my husband with the kids. The meeting ran late, and when I got home both of my daughters were asleep in bed, but my son was throwing a fit, saying that he didn't want his dad to tuck him in, he wanted me to. And my husband said that he'd been a bit of a trouble maker while I was gone.   Is my son acting up because he's not used to my husband being around? I've tried talking to him about it, saying that he needs to listen to both me and my husband, but the behavior hasn't changed.    Any advice?

His visitation is every other weekend and every other Thurs. and Sunday. I am going through a divorce and have decided to move out of state to KY which is about a 4 hour drive. I have offered him to keep his every other weekend in which I will drive her to him, but the single visitation days needed to cease. HOWEVER, I have offered to replace them with and extra week in the summer and all of spring break. This evens out.   We have paperwork all drawn up to have a parent coordinator because he refuses any and all communication with me (even concerning our daughter), keeps filing frivolous motions against me and refuses to pay 1/2 of medical bills. He now refuses to sign for this and has told me that he won't.

20061220012320AAaipgD	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Diet dilemma?	I've recently gone on a 'diet'. I eat fruits durin' the day..not unlimited fruits..maybe for example i'll have 1-2 bananas, 2-3 apricots, a mango and a apple through the day and in the evening I'll have a bowl of porridge (quick oats) with prunes and frozen berries or a banana. I go on the treadmill for at least 30 minutes everyday ..sometimes for longer. I have been followin' this 'lifestyle' for the pass 10 days.    I haven't weighed myself yet..but my clothes are definately looser and my stomach's flatter..etc   My skin is glowing..I feel a bit lethargic but okay. I take fish oil capsules and grapeseed extract.      I am going away for 5 days next month and am worried about putting back on the weight that I've lost as I will  not have control of my meals especially if we will be eating out everyday. There is a gym at the hotel which I plan to use.    Has anyone been in the same situation..what did you do?   has anyone lost weight by bingin' one day and eatin healthy for 6 dayz etc

20090129051923AABqLDv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I trust my boyfriend?	I have trust problems with my boyfriend, and I want to overcome them badly. Every once in awhile I question his love for me, despite that he looks at no other girls and takes care of me.      I've noticed I seem to dwell on his past a lot, his past girlfriends... I resent him for doing intimate things with girls he says he didn't love. It just makes me think... well, he does this with me, so how can I be sure? I know it's wrong but it's a disgusting thought in my head that won't go away.      He is my first bf so I have no issues with the "I have been hurt before." He is just so complicated and occasionally gives two different answers to one question, which makes me think he isn't always honest with me. But in his defense he stated that he simply has different personalities for different situations.      After all these months of dating him, I feel I still don't KNOW him.. that I am not used to his different personalities and get confused by it. What should I do to better trust and believe him?

20090129064001AAlSM3G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	LONG post, introverted guy thinks about love.?	I have been introverted for most of my life . I am 21 years old. When a woman shows me "feelings"(interest), when a woman puts herself on the line for me, and when a woman opens up to me, I get very emotional inside, there is a deep spiritual pain that is summoned within.      I can not control it , call it out, I can not find it within me regularly, so I can not face it regularly ,but when its summoned, called out , it hits me like a ton of bricks. It only is summoned in me when I am face to face with a woman that cares about me, a woman that looks me right in my eyes, right then and there, and searches for me, as I really am, a lost boy deep within a cage.      I keep it inside, as I learned to build it into my core , hide it, the only thing that brings it out now is the affection, love , interest from a woman.      I can not face it without embarrassing myself, so I run, I hide , if I was to allow my walls to be taken down, when they can be taken down I would be so vulnerable. An angel lifting the bricks away, only to find something injured , hurt inside , who is going to nurse me back to health ? Who is going to demolish, and then salvage what is left of this human being, some one who has been introverted for most his life?      I would break down and cry right there in public, before the woman, before God, and everyone else if I allowed myself to express that little boy that I am inside, it wouldn't take long for him to catch on, become a man with a little faith in the future , becoming that man, but...I don't want to be embarrassed again, I don't want people to look and say , look how dysfunctional he is, look how out of place with the world that guy is. I dont want people to point , laugh, make fun of me , as they did during my childhood divorce. I got a long way to go to get to the light, and who is going to be there for me !? Who is going to show me the way?      So I get defensive, I get angry, I become scared. I become alone, I fear dying alone, but when I think about it , due to conditioning I really don't fear it at all.      It's that spark of life left in me, the part of me that is still human after all these years, only a woman can bring it out of me, and only when its real, when its happening.      I can not call it out , only a woman can, only when its real, and I don't know how to face it, because if I do I'll break , and no one will be there to catch me when I fall.      No one will understand my pain that is all so real, no one will be able to help me.   I close off to the world and only when I do art, something that I love do people see the real me.      I am closed off, and I have no friends...I'm alone . Only time I can face my problems is when they are current, when I look a woman in her face, and I search within her.Im afraid what she sees, I don't know what is left in there anymore.

Why don't they consider the truth. that the guy just doesn't like them enough to try to please them.

20090129062943AALZxvc	Family & Relationships;Family	Do you think it's fair for a father to?	Do you think that in the situation of a seperation, leading to divorce, with kids that the father actually get half the income tax money? When the mother has all kids everyday, while he chooses to see them approx. 4 days out of the month. Just because he worked more doesn't have anything to do with it. If he couldn't claim the kids there wouldn't really be much money. Well, I have the kids so what do you think is fair. I hope this makes sense.

We have been friends for nearly 5 years and we have never actually gone anywhere all of us together. But my friend is refusing to come now.

20090129063658AApkTcN	Family & Relationships;Family	Step Parent / Boss issues. What should I do?	I am working for my mom and her fiance, who owns a granite company. My moms fiance's 2 sons work there as well. When I was first employed I was put on salary, now I am on time card. The oldest son put up a fuss with them, for me to be put on time card. For some reason or another the 2 sons don't really care for me, and I have never done anything to them.....At first I would make $320 a week, salary paid. Now that I am on time card if I miss a day because I am sick or have other important issues that need to be taken care of I am docked that time, since I am on time card. If the 2 sons miss because of these reasons they get paid for it. And also there is no company benefits, so that means no personal time or sick days. My mom and her fiance also put up a fuss if I am not there by 8am, when the other 2 sons can come when ever they feel like it. Also the 2 boys make at least $1,000 a week or more (each), but I am making $320 a week. This is not fair, but I don't know how to go about getting them to make changes without getting fired/laid off. Please someone help...

Well, I need some disguised ways (non apparent to anyone but him) to show him that I am really interested. I don't want to come on too strong. I can't write a note because I don't know if he likes me that way. So basically, I am asking, in what ways can I show him I'm interested so that he'll ask me out, if of course, he likes me back?       Should I ask him out instead, or does that pressure him to say yes?
20090129061015AAQ5qmR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I take the chance at making my marriage better by rocking the boat?	My marriage is like this:  I am floating down a lovely river in a canoe with a beautiful tiger.  As long as I sit perfectly still we float along happily.  People on the banks say "Gee what a lovely sight.  What a lucky girl to be in the company of such a magnificent animal." I love the tiger and the canoe but occasionally I imagine a new slightly more comfortable position, like resting my foot on the side of the boat. The minute I move a muscle, the tiger attacks. The canoe carried precious cargo so for a long time I couldn't chance making any movement whatsoever.      Now it is just me and my magnificent Tiger in the canoe.  If I want to make an adjustment, even a small one, I chance being eaten alive.  But it is only me who will be eaten.
20090129060817AAmOA4n	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband loves me intensely and his greatest joy in life is loving me, being with me, doing things with me. ?	This is a terrible thing for a wife to put up with.  What's worse, is that we have a substantial age difference and he has gotten old, and less attractive to me, and may retire in a few years.  That will give him even more time to be with me and that's simply not to be tolerated.  I'm thinking that I would have been better off to have married a man my own age.  And if I want to get a divorce and find a younger man, this is the right time for me since I am still young and attractive.  The question is will I suffer from a lot of guilt since that would be a rather shitty thing to do to a man who has given me 25 years and two children?       This is the Yahoo Question my Husband posed to me at breakfast this morning.  He wrote it from his own perspective.  It is what he THINKS I think.      How would YOU respond to this?

Our relationship has gone back to being great that is until bedtime.  She dreads coming to bed, she dreads or questions any affection at all during the day or at bedtime. I would be ok with some sort of affection like maybe kissing my wife or giving a hug but she questions why i am doing this. How can we sit and laugh, play with the kids have a good time after all this but yet any sort of affection or sex is just cold on her part? She says she doesnt want sex...why?  Is she feeling guilty or just figuring out a way to leave me?  What do i do, i love my wife and our relationship but im also a guy and need some affection too?

On the morning of her looking after our daughter I placed a two stick kit kat (chocolate bar for our american friend) on the table ready to eat another time.   I noticed today that there was a screwed up wrapper on the fireplace. It was for a dark chocolate kitkat like the one I had.  I have looked for mine and cannot find it. I asked my partner if he'd had it and he said no. I asked my MIL if she's seen a kitkat anywhere and she said she had one in her handbag and ate that one but hadn't seen any others. Now I Know she doesn't like dark chocolate so would never buy it.      What's going on, why would she lie about it? I am annoyed because I brought her home a big muffin to eat so why would she spit on my kindness by stealing.  If she'd said ooops yeah i couldn't resist it that i would have laughed but to lie about it.   My daughter wouldn't have eaten it because I put is specifically out of her way.      Any advice?

20090129062241AAZ8ijQ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do I tell him that it's the wrong one?	My boyfriend (whom I've been with forever) is currently deployed to Iraq right now. For Christmas, he ordered this beautiful lingerie from Australia for me, and given that I live in a pretty awful neighborhood right now (I moved out near my school), I'm afraid that someone stole the package off the porch :( I told him this once a while ago, and even though his communication resources are extremely limited given that he's in Iraq working upwards of 14 hours a day, he somehow contacted the company who informed him that it shipped out on Jan. 6th. It's still not here, and I'm getting worried and feeling terrible that he spent so much on me and I couldn't even catch the package before it was stolen (hypothetically). Anyway, if you hadn't guessed, I'm a totally broke college student living in an apartment near my school, so I have very little money after paying tuition. I needed a graphing calculator, and it came up in casual conversation during an email session that I was going to ask my old roommate to borrow hers. My bf told me not to buy one under any circumstances, but then I found one for like 30 bucks on Ebay, so he finally confessed to buying me one and he was shipping it overnight. He told me it's the TI-89 Titanium series, which means that it cost him about 140 bucks. Now it's on its way to my place, and he doesn't know that I'm not allowed to use that model in my class (must be TI-83 or 84). After he told me what he was sending me (he called it an early Valentine's day gift), I didn't have the heart to tell him that I won't be allowed to use it. What should I do? I guess I could try to swap it with someone who has an 83 or 84, but that's like giving away 50 bucks without saying a word to my bf. I don't want to tell him because I feel like I'm all like "No, you bought me the wrong thing, buy a different one, the lingerie isn't here, buy me more" (Oh, I had forgotten to mention the first time I told him about the lingerie, he just said if it was stolen he'd buy me another set because he likes to see me in pretty things.)
20090129055749AArM0Wt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did she bop him when she stayed later for work?	Recently my wife was running later than usual after the time she normally is off work.  When she called 1.5 hours late she acted a little weird & had this excuse on where she had been so I didn't say much.  When she came in, she looked like she had been screwed to hell.  I wouldn't normally say that, but that is exactly how she looked.  Hair a mess, clothes all outa whack & makeup also.  She works in a Doc. office so this is a little disturbing.  Anyway.. after she went to bed I looked at her phone & found where when she left work, her boss, the doctor was texting her telling her how horny he was and to wait until everyone had left.  Then another text stating they are all gone now, just come to my side door.  Then the next text was maybe half an hour later in time and stated that it was good as hell like always.  We fought and the Sheriff Dept. had to be called although nothing was physical.  I have since moved out... but she swears it is all innocent.  Now I ask the ladies out there...  What are the odds that any of you would carry on a dialouge with someone of this nature unless that was exactly what it meant.
20090129054521AAF1xP2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	He leaves bruises...?	Okay, my boyfriend and I play and rough-house a lot.  Sometimes it leaves bruises or welts on me.  When it starts to hurt, I let him know and he stops for the most part.  But once in a while, it hurts really bad and then we stop and I get mad because he refuses to apologize.  He says that apologizing makes him feel like he's somehow abusing me.  I tell him abuse is when he does it against my will.  Am I right?  But when I'm left with bruises, and he won't say he's sorry... it makes me feel like he's not sorry for hurting me, even if he didn't mean to.  Ugh.  This sounds so confusing.  Should I not ask him to apologize, since it makes him feel bad?  He says it's my fault for playing with him anyway, because I know he can get rough.  Is that true?
20090129064830AAyv7ni	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you think he is being supportive or he doesnt want to be a part of this?	Okay, so I'm anorexic and I told my best friend that is a guy. At first e was really worried about me and stuff but then I talked to him about it alot and he would always ask me to eat and i would say no. and then one day he said   "Go to your hole and die. faster."   and that really hurt me.   and i'm afraid he doesnt care about me anymore.      but does he or does he just think im draggin this out too far?

20090129055420AA54Wfc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Confused about next step in marriage?	About 2 years ago my husband had an affair. he's gone for long periods of time for his job so he started talking to his ex girlfriend. One thing led to another.  The only reason i found out about this is because her husband found out and told me about it...only then did my husband confess to all of this. I do still love him but I just can't forgive him. I think that the worst part was that he told her that he loved her and that he has always loved her...well what about me?? his wife??   After that i started to push myself away from him and can't love him like I used to. The only reason I can think of to stay is my kids.    Well now he's gone again and i can't help but think of the things in the past. i don't know for sure or not if he's still talking to her, but why would he stop if he still loved her after all these years??   While he's been away i became friends with a man who was going through the same thing...now he's in the middle of a divorce because of it. we connect on so many levels...something that i haven't felt in many years with my husband. i really enjoy his company.    i'm just not sure if i should leave my husband for this man or not?? I honestly don't believe that i could ever truly love my husband like i used to.   I've been a housewife for the past 6 years so I don't have any of my own money coming in, just his paycheck. He has told me in the past that if i ever leave him I will not get the kids. They're my life! I couldn't go without them everyday!   So now what do i do?? Should I stay where I am or take a chance and leave? i'm scared either way...   please...no mean comments. i'd like if mature adults answered please!
20090129054010AAB5oBw	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my friend acting like this?	She is more serious when she's with me, but when we are both around other friends on our own, she always has to make sarcastic remarks and she is generally more funny.

20090129053808AAlvoKl	Family & Relationships;Family	I need help, seriously.  What can I do?	On a recent trip to Africa, my father fell from a ledge and was trampled by a herd of wildebeests.  I felt terrible, and my uncle convinced me that it was my fault, that I was a murderer.  He told me I had to run far away.  I ran away for several years, and then I learned that my uncle was actually evil, and had planned my father's death himself.  By now, however, my uncle had taken control of the whole family.  I'm thinking about going back to fight him and throw him from the same ledge.  Should I do it?

20090129053401AAaoyOZ	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad isn't eating enough!!!!!?	Okay for like the last month and a half my dad's eating has gone way down. Like he doesn't eat breakfast and only a little for lunch and dinner I don't understand! (By a little i mean like a controled portion kind of) And he goes to excercise at the gym like almost every day! What gives?!? I know I shouldn't be worried about this and trying to control him. He's not super skinny but thin for a 50 year old man. I have so much anxiety because of this and i really hate everything. I don't know why he keeps eating so little AND excercising. How should I deal with this situation?????

20090129053445AA6ZKhc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I don't feel like having sex with my wife?	i have been with my wife for about 8 years now and married for 4. for the last couple of years now i just don't feel like making love to her anymore and when we do make love i don't feel like kissing her or do anything really passionate with her body. i just want to lay besides her and me resting my body on the bed and pillow as we have sex. to be honest many times i get more pleasure from simply masturbating. i love my wife but i feel its more like family love - not love of my life love. and we have one kid together who is 4 and and i feel is the reason i am still with her. back to sex - she wants to do it more often and i am embarrassed to tell her about my fetish movies that i think could spice up our sex life - if we do have sex she would like more passion and i just cant bring myself to do it - i feel i am just having sex with her so i can get her off my case for a few days.

He told me later that he still wanted to be friends and that he usually never wanted to be friends with his ex's.   We have hung out since then, but if I bring up the break-up he says that he doesn't want to talk about it.    And here's a little background on the situation: He lost his job about two months ago, and since then he has been depressed. I did everything for him: cooked, cleaned, did laundry. I even paid for his bills. Now his room mate says that he is a completely different person; doing everything for himself and looking for a job and being nice.   Why did he break up with me?

Then when you go out to the shop to buy food - another agent: a woman agent could be standing right next to you in the shop. The checkout woman could be a agent who knows you are going to shop in the store and she could be there to get your fingerprints. Then as you leave the store, they could call up the command centre and tell the guys who are INSIDE your hosue & searching your house, that you are on your way out and that you will be arriving in 8 minutes 46 seconds.   When you arrive back home, everything is tikerty boo - so you put your feet up and have a beer - but they are watching and listening.   Do you feel it as well?

20090129060413AAu1kNt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My Husband doesnt want sex! HELP!?	I just dont know what to do anymore.. Ive been married to my husband for five years now and since March of last year... our sex life has went from a 10 to a 0. We had sex in March of 2008, and went for 9 months with NO SEX until the end of December of 2008! I tried everything in that time period to get him to have sex and he wont have sex with me! He just gives the escuses that he's tired, he has to to work the next day, etc. I've asked if there was another female? He got really  mad that I would even bring that up and wouldnt talk to me for days. I asked if he was turning gay? He got mad again and said no. Now its the end of January and we still havnt sex this month. I got his brother to talk to him and all he gave him was the same reasons he gave me. His brother kept telling him he has to get checked out, its not normal. But he's still the same guy who doesnt want sex. Im 27, he is 31. Im always wanting sex. Heck I have guys who say they will give me sex whenever I want it! Of course I wont cheat on my husband, but still it hurts to know your own husband wont give you sex! Plus here lately he's been staying up to play his damn games on the wii! It really freaking makes me mad he chooses to play a game than have sex. I just dont know what to do anymore.      Anyone have any suggestions? Im at a lost. :(

20090129063850AAKLlD8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you stay if he claled you out your name? ?	My BF called me a "B" in front of my 2 yr old son in an argument. a week later, we're sitting at the dinner table and his 12 yr old 1/2 sister was trying to tease my 2 yr old. He called her a B as well. I didn't punish him bcause I know where it came from and told his dad that he called me a B in front of our son ever again, I would leave him. He has done it twice since, even when I was resisting an argument with him. Where I come from , when someone calls me a "B" , I'm ready to box someone., so he knows how I hate it. Now I am losing all respect for him. SHould I stay or go? I know it doesn't seem like much, but I don't want to have to kick my son's butt one day because he's copyng his father. (who is an alcoholic).
20090129061258AATRsHB	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I talk to my mother after 7 years?	I'm 33 and I haven't spoken to my mother in 7 years.  She kicked me out of my house when I was 18 because I did not like her new boyfriend.  I did not speak to her for 4 years because of that.  We reconciled and had a relationship for 4 years after that.  During those 4 years my wife and I learned that my mothers boyfriend was abusing her. She left him and had to live with us.  While she was living with us she kept going back to him.  That situation and her living with us starting becoming a problem for my wife and I.  My mother finally asked if she should move out and I said it would be best.  Before she was to move out she purposely started a fight calling me names, calling my wife names, accusing my wife of cheating on me.  Part of me thinks she started the fight to make it easier for me to make her leave because she knew it was such a hard decision.  She left that day and I have spoken to her since 2002.  Since then I have bought my first house and have had 2 kids who she hasn't seen.  Since my first kid was born almost 3 years ago she has sent presents and gifts for both of them on birthdays and Christmas.  She learns about the kids from my brother.  She has written two letters to my wife and I explaining people make mistakes and she would do things different but never once admitted she did things wrong or apologized.  Last year with the birth of my second child I started having thoughts of reconciling again and asked my brother if she was still seeing the douche who was abusing her.  He said she has but they are not dating or anything.  That immediately convinced me not to even consider reconciling. I feel all her actions were a result of being with this guy.  I feel if it wasn't for him we wouldn't be in this situation, he practically brainwashed her.        One, I don't want to speak to her because if she is still seeing this guy she hasn't changed for the better.  Two, I don't want my kids to get to know her and then she pulls something and they get hurt because they can't see their grandmother anymore.  Three, I really don't care if I ever talk to her again, being hurt by your own mother twice is enough for me.  Recently I have been getting pressure from my brother, my father and his wife, and too a small point my wife (but she backs any decision i make).  I'm starting to feel like the bad guy.       So after all I have written here, do I, should I, make contact with her again?      Thank you.

Last night we were on the phone and I was quiet cuz I was relaxed (since I hadn't had much sleep a few days before) and he said that we barely talk as much on the phone as we did when we met and started datin'. And that it was bad and we need to do somethin', for example, skatin' or somethin', so that we can have more to talk about. we both dun want this relationship to just last for a month, but it's startin' to sound like it might... HELP!!!      So my questions are:      1) How can I make this relationship work and last long? I dun wanna lose him, he's such a great guy.      2) What kind of things can we do together to "get out more"? Example, skatin'... and that's all I can come up with. =(      again, also if u can mention some date ideas, just so that we can chill and do somethin' BEFORE it ends lo....... :|.
20090129062639AAivnWD	Family & Relationships;Family	Should i tell my boyfriend, all and any issues between me and my childs father?	I love my boyfriend. He is great. I want to be with him. No one else. My sons father and i just divorced last year and every now and again we argue on the text messages to the point where were calling each other out of our names. (Not very often tho) For the most part we get along for our kid, and he has a live in girlfriend who picks up my son from daycare and so forth. I slipped up and told my boyfriend one day, about the recent arguements and he started feeling left out and wondering why i dont tell him and how im wrong and not being 100% with him. Im afraid he will think we have too much drama and leave me. But should i tell my boyfriend when things get heated between my ex and i?

20090129064322AAlvOnT	Family & Relationships;Family	Sister ex.bf bf acting stalker like?what you think?	Her ex.bf who has a gf but after 2.5 yrs still comes around to my sister for sex and even has gone as far as to drive around our house looking for her at times he knows she walks her dogs and searched for her on myspace when he lost her number.Then chooses to just knock on the front door when he had a 50/50 chance she was home alone or he might one of our parents who dont like him. When my sister lives in another town out of his way at least 10-15mins from where he works and 25 mins from where he lives.I'm concerned for my sister who is flattered by her ex.bf who is doing this because it feels stalker like. All she see's is her first love whom she wants back.Even though he has had anger managment problems in the past!

He doesn't do this to other people just me, and he doesn't do it in a patronizing way either. He just always uses my name while he is talking to me. He knows my name to so he doesn't do it so he won't forget my name. I mean nearly after every sentence he says my name.   So, I am just curious as to why someone would do this? Is it just unconscious on his part or conscious and why? Opinion please! :)

He makes a lot more than i do, i am a saver i hardly spend money. He spends money like crazy.  He wants to have a joint account for bills/mortgage and then have our own seperate accounts so he can buy whatever he wants. Like a new 4wheeler or hot tub or boat.  Is that fair that most of my money would go to bils/mortgage and i have hardly any left over. And him buying big purchases that we should agree on and talk about?  Is that a marriage or more like roommates, splitting the bills and buying our own things?

20090129065618AAO6Z3Q	Family & Relationships;Family	Did you/will you tell your parent's when you lose your virginity?	My best friend told her mom the day before she went and had sex, and then told her about it after. She's done college now and she tells her mom basically every time she's with a new guy.    I personally prefer to never let my parent's know ANYTHING. As far as they're concerned, I like to think that they still assume I'm a virgin. I likely won't let it slip for quite awhile.    I personally think it's none of their business but then I remember on That 70's show, Eric and Donna told THEIR parent's too so maybe it's not that weird.       So did you (or if your a virgin, will you) tell your parents when you lose your virginity?
20090129060717AAbFl6L	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Any one been to pre-marital counseling?	Well, our preacher is requiring us to do 5 1/2 hours of premarital counseling, before he will marry us. My question is , What do we need to expect? We already live together, which he is sort of against, but is still going to marry us. With rent and all the bills we decided to just get one house, especially with the economy like it is now. That's besides the point. What type of questions do preachers normally ask.? I know every preacher is different, but maybe you can tell me what type of things you discussed with your preacher as a couple.    I just don't want him to ask personal questions, I really don't think it is his place to know what my Fiance and I do behind closed doors, right!!?? I just would feel totally uncomfortable. I'm a little nervous and I want to be confident, that way i can help my Fiance do the same.      Thanks!!!!

20090128221121AABEPpZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	TO ALL HONEST MARRIED WOMEN?	My partner admitted to me that she had an affair. She said it is over, but they work on the same building though. Whenever they meet at work, she tells me what transpired when they meet. Her reason for the affair was because I refused to see my doctor regarding my erectile dysfunction and lack of attention i have given her. I explained i was so devastated regarding my problem and that was the reason why i distanced myself from her emotionally.   I gave her the choice to be free but she chose to stick it out with me and not to leave me even after death. She also said that she does not love her lover anymore though because of work they see each other in the same building. She says that i am the only one she loves now. We both shed tears whenever we are alone and speaking these things together.   She asked for forgiveness and i have forgiven her. How do i rate her sincerity now that my trust was broken by her. I am slowly rebuilding that trust again. How do i rate her sincerity.   Is she all telling the truth

20090129071704AA3EAtK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Okay a guy has asked me out for a drink...What does he want?	This guy who I used to know from school (but I didn't really know him that well) chatted to me on Facebook the other day and suggested we get together after work or something to have a drink and a chat...I told him maybe and gave him my number but didn't actually set a date, but now he's telling me he's free the next two days and I just don't know what to say...Basically, I just don't think I'm interested in him in that way if you know what I mean, and maybe he justs wants a friendly chat but I can't be sure and I don't want to mislead him...      Back in October I actually met up with another old schoolmate on Facebook and we ended up going out for about six weeks. But I was actually attracted to this guy and we chatted online a lot more beforehand. Anway he broke up with me in Decemeber and I'm still trying to get over him. I'm actually hoping we can get back together someday...So I definately don't want another relationship yet.      On the otherhand I am pretty lonely and I could do with another friend but I don't really know what this guy wants. Anyway I need to reply to him pretty soon so what do you think I should say?

I have a girl that i  have been with for the last year and a have and I still have feelings for an ex that I met 4 years ago and dont know what to do about it. All these years i have felt like me and the girl I was with years ago were meant to be together. Everything between us has always felt right. she has no kids she is very smart and very attractive. Pretty much everything i have always wanted in a women. We didn't go as far as we could in our relationship because of us both trying to get ourselves together, and I have always felt like we have unfinished business. Now, the new girl has two kids and we done have as much in common but she is also attractive and is the best lover i have ever had. The sex is the best I have ever had. So I am very confused because i don't know if I should get back with my old flame or continue on with the new one. I think about the old one all the time always think about being with her. I feel i will  hurt my new girl if i leave her. Help me with this situaition. I have feelings for them both but i want to choose the one that is best for me.

20090129070907AAnEBOA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What should I do I and my marriage need help please?	My husband and I have been having troubles for many years. It all started before we were even married. He is a selfish man who has always put his own feelings and wants before our children or me. He was verbally abusive towards me and showed no consideration towards my feelings when brought up. He took me trying to communicate as me being a nagging wife. After years of being treated as if I was in a one sided marriage I told him I wanted out. He begged me to stay for our children and I did and went to marriage counseling, twice. Now I have given up my career and all my  life goals to be a stay at home mother and I feel stuck.   I have lost myself and I have no marriage.   Today I wrote my husband a letter telling him how I felt. I don’t’ know what to do. I know that in order for our marriage to work I must forgive him but I feel that the only way to forgive him is for me to give it to him for free because he will never show me why I should, thus the one sided marriage. When he knows we have problems he pulls for me to show affection to make him feel that we are ok, but we aren’t. I told him in the letter that this was my last letter or conversation I was going to bring up. What should I do is he a lost cause? I want more than anything for my marriage to work but my spouse  only gives enough effort to get us through the day and to make himself feel secure in our marriage…What does a woman do? Its like I am pulling our entire family on my back and I just can’t do it anymore..

20090129065546AACs2lt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I handle all the heavy chores now that my husband left the family?	Some things like the snow shoveling, heavy lifting, difficult yard work etc, I am really struggling to do by myself.  I am fairly strong and I have been doing it since August alone.  But it is starting to take its toll.      The driveway is full of snow almost daily.  And my arms are killing so bad.  By the time I get home from work at 6:00 and shovel a way into the garage for the car and make dinner and clean up it is like time for bed.      I am so exhausted.  And I miss his help so much.      On top of it I had back surgery last June.  So I am suppose to be careful and I won't be fully healed until next summer.      Anyway, I am very sad that he left all this work for me.  And I dont really think he ever thinks about how much his absence is affecting us and the kids.      So how do I get through this?  He even took the lawn mower to his new place.  So I have to buy a new one in the spring and deal with that too.

20090129080436AALmYBw	Family & Relationships;Family	Having issues with the inlaws?	I know this is a common problem.  I have in-laws that are so overbearing.  They live two streets down from us because they wanted to move closer to us.  They (my mother in law specifically) calls about 7 times a day.  They come over and let themselves in anytime they want.  The problem is my husband does not have a problem with it at all and if I mention anything about it, it causes tension with him.  Do I just grin and bear it?  I don't want to stir the pot but feel I'm entitled to not have them in my life all the time.  I married their son, not them.  I have tried to give hints to my feelings but either she doesn't get the hint or she doesn't care.  And direct approach will cause so many problems... what do I do????

20090129065623AAoWl8c	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are husbands honest about their wives post-pregnancy bodies?	I'm 25 and I've had 2 kids. I weigh 3 lbs more than I did on my wedding day.... BUT I look very different. My belly has a few stretch marks on the lower abdomen plus it is not firm like it used to be. My breasts are COVERED in stretch marks and now that I am done nursing, they have gone south - and I'm afraid it's not just for the winter. I am having a very hard time accepting let alone liking my new body. My husband says he loves me just the way I am and I believe him, but I don't think I'm crazy to think that he would prefer my old body - or even someone else's.

I'm so tired, I try so hard in my marriage...it's just depressing, the only time I'm happy is when I'm sleeping, I'm not suicidal just disenchanted...My first marriage was the same way, she cheated so I left her....got married again cause I believe in marriage and having that special someone, but the second is like the first in that it doesn't seem to matter how hard I try, if I don't feel loved I communicate it but it falls on deaf ears, how pathetic am I :(

20090129073017AA6KmDO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would he flirt again?	A guy liked two girls. He got into a relationship with one of them and hid it from the other one for a while. The other girl found out and was heartbroken. She stopped talking to both of them completely. The guy broke up with the first girl after 2 years. He bumps into the second girl at a party and starts flirting again. Why would he still be flirting with her back after almost 3 years (knowing that he hurt her)?
20090129070107AApkT7p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, Kindly decrypt this short sentence for me... !!!?	I didn't go to the class yesterday (usually I am very punctual). This girl texted me " where are you? I wore a lovely dress today"      I really like this girl and told her this probably a month ago. Her response was something like she wasn't ready for a relationship and I will be better off as a friend.    Should I try to read between the lines or was it just something I should ignore.

20090129090033AAUKRPA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS WHO ARE PLAYERS!!!. is this true?	ok so I know this guy who is into random and casual sex with girls. he pretty much acts nice to girls, has sex with them, them forgets about them. so I guess you could call him a manwhore/player. he always tells me about how hes nice to girls so they will give it up for him and that he lies and sweet talks them to get it. I dont quite understand why he feels the need to tell me about it but whatver    anyways. the funny thing is hes mean to me and teases me and tries to annoy the living crap out of me constantly. I work with him .people think he likes me bcuz of it. however he never admits it. I know he loves it when I get mad at him when he does it bcuz i can see the smile on his face.  however my question is. is that true? is that like reverse psychology. do player guys act nice to girls they just want sex from and then tease act mean and annoy the living crap out of girls they really actually like? hes never tried to get with me or screw me but he just annoys me constantly.

OKAY read first before saying I'm self-fish. I know this may be a bit long but i APPRECIATE all comments. I mainly wrote bout the OPPOSITE of our life hence the length of this Q. I'm going crazy fighting against my heart/mind so please help :(         I live in a big apartment, have money, live a non violent life, happy, calm, relaxing, friendly life. Family are respectful and well mannered and work hard, Im about to graduate from Uni. Anyway I met a guy from another state (2 hours flight from me) and we started to form feeling for each other. We're technically not together but we're reserve and isn't seeing anyone else.      So anyway I started to like him because we have the same dreams, goals and interests in the same field. He spoke about his violent past and I accepted it straight away hence he really like how accepting and mature I am. I've been very patient with him, and never pushed him or forced him to do anything and vice versa but I'd like more attention. Anyway, I've basically said I'd wait for him, vice versa. At one point I missed him so much cus I havent spoke to him for days. Then he told me he had problems that involves alcohol and him nearly being shot by gun. I was shocked! There's no GUN where I live but I straightaway said.."When I move there, MOVE in with me,I dont want you living that life!" because I wanted to take him away from that lifestyle and show him that he deserves better. I want to make him happy and care for him.

Me and my friend are "fcuk friends" and I had the house to myself this morning, so I tried calling him to come over but no one answered. So i decided to stop by. He's on nights but he can run on like no sleep. I have to work at noon so i figured he could sleep in the afternoon. I got there, and he wanted to sleep. I didn't tell him I had to go to work. But I stormed out of there pretty pissed, and now I feel bad. I want to tell him I'm sorry, but I don't want it to sound like we're in a relationship. And I probably shouldn't have just stopped by like that. What should I say? Should I do it through a text cause we're not dating.

He always says we will be together 4ever and he loves me and will take care of me for the rest of my life. Now i hate how he jokes about marriage with his buds and says he never will get married again or marriage why do we have to be married to be each others. i guess i see his point but i want someone to be mine and for me to be his. How do tell him this and let him know if he doesn't want to get married im not gunna sit around wasting time. I know hes the one but i don't want to force him. What can i do!
20090129071739AAMUtdH	Family & Relationships;Friends	Staying at home or leaving for college?	I'm afraid that if I stay home and go to college that I won't have a life. I mean like, waking up, driving to college, going to my classes, coming home doing homework, and probably working. It would be stupid to just drive there later just to hang out looking for a friend or something. Whereas if I'm living on campus, I'd get to meet people in my dorm, hang around people in my classes more, and hang around places on campus, maybe go to a few parties. I'm probably going to a college that I will have a scholarship with and is the cheapest, which is going to be one close by so most likely I will stay home and go. But I'm really scared of having like no life and not really getting to meet people since I will basically just be going and coming back...I guess.    Is there anyone who goes to a community college and does not live on campus, and how is your social life compared to those who live on campus?     Or maybe staying home and going to a close by university would be better?

20090129071901AAaST4L	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just wondering, how do guys minds work?	i feel ridiculous for asking yahoo answers such a ridiculous question, but i figured it would help for real men to give me their opinions instead of my friends who would lie to me to keep me happy.  okay, so i really liked this guy, and i am absolutely positive he liked me as well.  one night we both went to our mutual best friends party and we ended sitting in her room for a good ten minutes in total silence, it was hella awkward.  i made myself totally available and he didn't make a move at all.  after wards i told my friend about how awkward it was and she told me she talked to him about it but she never gave me specifics of the conversation which made me assume that the conversation was no big deal.  well now it's three months later and my fling with said boy has ended, but my friend who's party we attended recently told me that he informed her during the conversation that apparently WAS a big deal that he wanted to kiss me, really bad.  when she asked why he replied with an i don't know.  he had plenty of opportunities to kiss me, so many times not including the party.  also, he hooks up with girls all the time, so i don't understand what made it so hard for him to at least kiss me.  so i guess i'm asking what you guys think, because i need second opinions from total strangers.  and i've ruled out that he just didn't like me, so please don't give that to me as an answer.
20090129001747AAvcF1J	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband is a flake, help (separated)?	Ok well these last few years have been... a roller coaster? Hell? All the above? Nonetheless it's been very different than what I thought my happy marriage should be. From the get go it seemed off. I got pregnant within the first year unexpectedly, finished a term in the military and had the baby then stayed home with our child. Things with hubby kept the downward spiral pattern until he eventually just slowly took over all finances and I never knew what was coming in, going out, etc. Sure I asked but he seemed so convincing and assuring and I was caring for the baby so, meh...  turns out he was a flake with the money and he was perpetually late on EVERYTHING then lied about it over and over even when I would show him the notices I found in the mail. He is barely relational emotionally, mentally and physically. I finally left after he actually outright denied me access to the finances and after I got a call from our car lein holder saying they were very close to reposessing our vehicle. Not to mention rent wasn't paid on time in 4 months and our electricity was turned off once but "it was a mix up and someone in our building left and they accidently flipped our power off instead of theirs" (ha... freakin... ha... and yes I feel like an idiot, too). So I left, let him know, he acknowledged and consented and now I've been away for a number of weeks and he hasn't once showed much of a care that we're gone. Big flake, eh? He's barely getting things in order financially. He's borrowed taken/borrowed money from his parents and neither him or his parents told me. I found out by finally looking at the checking account history that he spend 7-35 dollars a day on EATING OUT and random crap here and there full well knowing we only have one (decent but not great) income and didn't put ANYTHING in to savings but lied that he did and even said he put money away for the baby but I see that he just kept overdrawing the savings account. What gives? Anyone have similar stories? Of course this isn't all of what is going on but I don't want to go on too long (lol). The other things are things like him not acting like a partner, not showing affection, hardly being able to take a joke, doesn't instigate sex, immaturity, etc...

I would run a big risk of being sucked back in if I moved back there.   -I can go to college there too.   -I would have to drive cross country but there is a chance I can get my sister to come out here and have her accompany me on the drive back.

I'm really, really, really confused about this guy that I like....a lot...The problem is I don't know if he likes me or he's annoyed by me or he's just you know...acting all whatever..      Soo, what does it mean when:   1. he would say things like, ‘stop talking to me’, ‘stop bothering me’, ‘stop blocking me’, etc and every time when he would say these things, I would just try to avoid him but then he would be all bugging me and trying to make me laugh(which almost every time he successfully does)    2. he helps me figure things out when I find it hard to understand it    3. he has this habit of hitting areas around my stomach, holding my waist, putting his arm over my shoulder     4. he would let me put my head of his shoulder but shrugged it off after a few moments    5. he won’t borrow me movies but to other people he would, I don’t know why but he just says something like, ‘oh, you’re too young to watch this movie’ or ‘it isn’t nice so I don’t think you should’    6. he takes a few of the blames for me at the shop but I don’t think that really meant anything    7. we fight….a lot; I’ll be piss at something he did or say, he’ll be piss at for whatever reasons he’s piss but after both of us had cooled off, we’ll be okay again    8. sometimes when I’m off at one side of the shop to do some stuff, he would come over to help and walk away after a few minutes     9. he offered to help me understand the subjects I find hard to understand but takes it back after    10. sometimes, when I’m having my lunch break or tea break at work he would come in and join me    11. he would ask very, very weird questions like one time he asked, ‘why are you so hot?’ I didn’t know if he was asking me or just talking to himself because it seems like he was talking to himself    12. sometimes when we chat, I would say hi and he’ll reply with ‘what?’ like he’s annoyed by me or something     13. when I see him at school, he would either pretend he didn’t see me or just run in another direction and when I ask him about it, he says he didn’t saw me      Pls help me!! Guy/Girls i don't mind just give me your opinions or guide or whatever!! And sorry I post such a looong question, believe me I already did cut down at least half of the 'facts'(air quotes in the brain) about him...
20090129070824AASEApx	Family & Relationships;Family	Whats the best way to tackle the moving out situation with parents?	My names Abby and I am 17 years old. My Partner is 32 and i spend more than half the week at our home 15 minutes away from my parents.    It seems silly taking bag fulls of clothes over every time i stay at his/ours. My parents find it difficult as i didn't always let them know exactly when i'm staying until and i understand that this caused complications so have tried to be as open as possible recently which is helping.    I dont want them to think i dont love them or dont want to live with them because i dont like them. This seems to be their way of thinking at the moment. How did readers go about this with their parents? and did they bring their partner to the initial discussion? Thanks.

20090129070919AAy9tXJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What Should I Do To Deserve Her?	O.K. i'm a 15 year old Native American and I really like this girl who is a 16 year old African American. We've been friends for a little over a year now and we just took our relationship to the next level. She's been getting advise from my friend about all kinds of things and just this past weekend I finally opened up to her. She told my friend that she really like the fact that I did because she's been waiting on it for a while. And that she wishes that she didn't have a bf because she don't want to dump him and look like a whore. But she gave me her phone number yesterday and told to call her. How long should I wait? Then theres the fact that my parents don't have any problem with me having African American friends but they say it would be best to stay in our on race. If I where grown it would be a different story but i'm 15 and i live in there house. What should I do? I feel for her more than I have any other girl I've dated (not to say it's love or anything) but i say u can't help who you like or fall in love with.

20090129072120AATOmFi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS!!!...(and girls)... What does this mean?	What does it mean when a guy is kissing his girlfriend, but he is staring at another girl when he is doing it? Actually his girlfriend kissed him.... but he didn't pull away, he just kept his eyes open and was looking at another girl....      Another time: His girlfriend was trying to act flirty and hugged him. But then this other girl started to talk to him, and as soon as he heard her voice he pushed his girlfriend's hands off of him. He started to talk to the other girl and he was smiling warmly ...but I don't know if it was because of this other girl, or because his girlfriend was flirting with him.      What do you think? Should his girlfriend be worried about him and this other girl? Or is nothing weird going on?

20090129090813AAc6mnN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why did my friend suddenly have a drastically different change of heart?	A friendship I had with an acquaintance at university took a lot of cultivating and nurturing. It was new for me to befriend such a strong willed person since I myself am the same. Nevertheless, we had a great time and had a very fun friendship until one day she decided to hate me. She began to spread rumours about me, which was shocking to me to be occurring on a University level. Others have told me that she has become intensely jealous of my grades- but could that be it? She is a little younger than I am, thus perhaps more immature which would explain a lot. Nevertheless these days if I ever cross her in the hall she challenges absolutely every word I say and always tries to put me down with no valid reason or argument. What is going on there?

20090129071912AAFhO1i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do people fall out of love?	I just broke up with my girlfriend (devo). We were together a little over a year. I called it off as she claims she had fallen out of love with me. We have similar interests and personalities, I have always treated her with love and affection, like a queen, had great sex.. but none of this ever made her happy. She says she doesn't understand it. We did grow apart - I don't know why, she started putting everything ahead of me, and I got fed up. I was the best boyfriend I could possibly be - tried to not be routine.. etc but it still faltered. I don't know what went wrong. It hurts like hell, I still love her to bits. So why do people fall out of love for no reason, especially when they have a good relationship together?

(and if did call, is it a good idea to say if im my brother when i ask for him if one of his parents answers? i would do this because i dont think his parents would be up for the idea of a girl calling for him.)   opinions please?   **************************************...   heres the link to the previous question if you wanna know what sunday was like:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...

20090129081454AAubIEe	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do about my son's deadbeat father?	My son is a little over two years old now, and I have been raising him by myself, with the help of my family (who have been wonderful).  I put up with my son's father not coming around for the first couple of months because it was a complicated situation, and honestly I was being dumb and naive. But now, two years down the road, he is pulling the same old strings. He has never so much as gotten my son a birthday card, a christmas card, or literally anything for that matter. He has never done anything for him. The only times he would see his son is when he was sick of me bugging him about it, and it would be maybe once every 2-3 months.  Right now he hasn't seen his son in 6 months, since before his 2nd birthday.  So now he calls me up again, same as usual, wanting to see his son, but I feel like this will always be a neverending cycle, and I do not want to put my son through this.  I feel if he really cared, I gave him enough chances for two years, and he would have done something to show for it. I personally do not want him in my son's life at all at this piont, but I still feel a little guilty for feeling that way. But its not fair to my son to bring this "man" around that he doesn't even recognize in pictures and say its his father!  Please any advice would be helpful! Thank you!

20090129075004AAsjUQN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this guy shallow ?	My 23 yr. old friend set me up with a 57 yr. old banking ceo. He said he only likes Asian women which is what I am.       I feel very awkward romancing someone that old.      He saw my facebook photo and went gaga ! All excited to meet me .       So I told him that this is awkward and that I don't really look like that photo in real life. I told him I'm not very tall or glamorous . I really think he got the wrong idea just by looking at my photo.      So far no response from the "older" man.       Is he being shallow  ? lol

20090129081311AAcmvg7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did me having an abortion change how he looked at me?	A couple of years ago i started seeing my friends boyfriends best friend ,anyway we realy liked each other but hes ex was pregnant at the time but they were not together,The first tine we slept together i fell pregnant.When he found out he was terrified ,he didnt know what to say to me,or how to be with me.I asked him what i should do and all he said was "Its your decision ,you decide,Im against abortions but i understand you cant ruin your life"But that was it he never said what he wanted me to do.I was confused and i thought if i kept it hed hate me,so i had an abortion.Then he started speaking again and he never mentioned it just said to me"i bet you hate me now"and a few weeks later he said "the whole baby thing kills me".Anyway two years later we still speak and he never speaks about it.Do you think he ever thinks about it because i just cant get over it,its on my mind every day!,also these past years hes been on and off with me,ignoring me at times then speaking again,could th whole baby thing have played a part in this?
20090129075407AASjtn4	Family & Relationships;Friends	After 4 years of liking him does he like me back???  Guys and girls welcome to answer?	I thought I'd ask this question mainly for guys because they obviously know how they go on when they like a girl. But girls are welcome to answer too.      Being Jehovah's Witnesses we don't just go up to one another and say, 'Hey I like you, wanna go out with me?' it has to be more subtle, like over a longer period of time.      But anyway, this guy is about 6 years older than me (but I don't think that's something bad because my grandparents have 10 years between them, my aunt is about 5 years younger than her husband and my best friend's sister is about 6 years older than her husband). I've had a crush on this guy for about 4 years.      Last night I went to a congregation meeting, and he had a 10-minute item on the platform about the latest editions of the Watchtower and Awake. I was looking at him almost all the time, even while other brothers and sisters were answering. During the whole of the talk he kept looking over at me almost every, like, 10 seconds or something, and while a few were answering he actually looked over at me instead of the one answering.      Recently he's also been talking to me a little more. It's kinda hard for him to talk to me and vice versa because I'm with the girls and he's with the lads, but when we are like alone looking at the noticeboard or whatever he'll talk to me.      What do you think???

20090129072210AAnfQ3G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think love my ex-best friend?	So when I was younger (kindergarten to grade three) I had one best friend who was a guy. Then he had to move for his Dad's work, but him and his family came home every summer to visit (oh yeah, our parents are friends...). Now, he lives about 20-30 mins away from me. When I knew him before he left, he was really sweet and we always played games where we were bf and gf or something. But ever since he moved back for good, he's been a jerk. I hardly ever see him (like once a year) and we aren't friends anymore. To him I'm just his mom's friend's daughter...      And I know teens should care about his kinda stuff cause it's not like I'm marrying him, but I have really liked him for about 3-4 years and still do.       I know the boy I used to play with is under his new 'trying to be cool' exterior...But I'm not sure it's worth getting close to him again if he doesn't like me back.      What should I do? Forget him? Try to be-friend him again? Ask him to go to the movies with really old friends?      Please help!   Sorry for the long question.

20090129081117AAfKKEx	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Whats up with Candy Buffets?  They seem pretty popular right now?	My cousin did one and everyone (except the children and her young friends- mind you my cousin is 10 years younger then me) though it was odd... Even my aunt was like "why do I want to scoop up jelly beans and drag them home?"  I thought it was juvenile but didn't think much of it because her theme was Mickey Mouse and everyone in her wedding party didn't know what a slip was.....  so after the peep show, most people didn't notice the candy buffet thing.  But they were stuck with a lot of candy because most adults like myself didn't go over and scoop up a sack of candy for the road.  But it seems to be a popular thing on yahoo now......     I guess I am asking WHY?      I just thought it took away from the elegance of the wedding... I personally rather have a well presented piece of candy on my plate then having to scoop it out like your in Bulkys at the mall.

20090129082051AA1kQ81	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I feel guilty for not sitting around with my boyfriend at his mates' house?	My boyfriend enjoys going to his friends' house just to sit around, drink and watch TV. I have no problem with him doing it but I feel guilty when he invites me and I don't want to go.       They're my friends too, I don't mind going out on a night out with them, but I can sit around watching TV in my own house. I find them difficult to talk to in this situation (social anxiety) and when I end up saying nothing at all I feel worse about myself.      I asked if I could see him tonight and he suggested going to their house and then I started back tracking, making the worst excuses ever and he knew it was because I didn't want to go there. He sounds annoyed when I don't want to go, although he says he isn't bothered.      I want him to be happy, but I don't want to waste my evening watching TV I'm not interested in just to make him happy. Am I justified in not going round there or should I for his sake?
20090129081615AAlQAoW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Boyfriend is being distant? What to do?	I don't know what happened are relationship started off great. Now he says that he is not focused on his music and he needs to use his time more constructive and that he is a man and he needs to figure out things on his own. But he wants me to talk to him. I asked him to go to school with me he didn't go. So i just went on my own. He doesn't text me the way he use to, doesn't tell me he loves me like he use to. he might be like i love you more than you know or i so love you. Are sex is different but he tells me are relationship is fine and if he has a problem he will tell me. Then he ask me am I losing interest in him.
20090129082148AAjsYXC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I go out with this other guy?	I just met a guy a month ago that I really like, we are attracted to one another and have great conversation and same interests.  We've only went out a few times though, but so far things are going good, yet too early to tell I guess.  Last week I was out and an attractive man approached me and we talked quite a while and really connected.  He asked for my number and I gave it to him, he called a few days ago and wants to take me to dinner, should I go?  When I am dating, I like to just focus on the person I'm seeing and see what happens, but this guy, I unexpectedly met, really caught my eye.  Part of me looks at it like I could wreck something with the current guy I'm seeing, but part of me looks at it like I should maybe meet this other guy and see if we are compatible, for I could be missing out on an opportunity.  It could be that neither would eventually want to see me, but what if it goes good with both?  Is this what dating is all about?  Opinions, suggestions, and experiences greatly appreciated.

20090129075306AAp3hNO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can someone give me some advice?	I am a male and I am developing the view that sex and masturbation is perverted and thus sexist because women have been oppressed by men for so long. I think that this is so because most men think that women are simply sexual objects for them to use. I think that I should take a vow of abstinence and never masturbate or do anyting of a sexual nature because it degrades women. But I heard that masturbation and sex is physically and mentally healthy, so I don't know. Can anyone give me some advice?

20090129072618AAcFi9I	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can my ex boyfriend take my car from me?	This is the other thing that my ex is trying to do. He bought me a car a year and a half ago, but it is not paid off until 2 more years (at least).      I think the car may even be in his name (which I don't think is looking good for me) but, I am a driver on it.      He is only doing this out of spite. We never signed any pay back document (because he never asked me to pay him) it was what he did for me, I have three kids (he has none) .      Can he take the car??      NOTE:  I had a car, paid for. when he wanted to get me this car, i said , if I give my car up... I could never afford this car, I would never get this car for myself. I would either keep my paid for car or get a used car for under $5,000.       He was insistant. And he did it.  I broke up with him because he was a control freak, obbsesive, jealous of my own kids.

20090129072248AA2WfLp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Incredible story about an affair... what do I do now?	So we have been going at it since before her marrige and through the last year she has been married... She dosn't want to let me go and she isn't filing for divorce either. Everyone in the world knows that I am screwing her so I don't understand how her husband dosn't know. (or dose he?) She gets no financial support from him and he really seem like a dope but she won't let him go. She moved out of his house and lives with her mother who acually aproves of me and wants me around (how fu_ked up is that?) Her husband never ever checks up on her she sleeps at my house almost daily and screws the crap out of me... She says she wants to be with me but feels sorry for her loser husband... She filrts with everyone and he dosn't seem to care about what any one says and she continues to have a relationship with her husband and go away on weekends with him and god knows what else but she also makes sure to mess around with me as well... Her husband acts like he knows nothing (even though ever one on the planet knows) and never checks up... I mean never (isn't that weird).   She trys to show me she cares and just lies about everything all the time... I have a good job and make a lot of money as opossed to her husband but still she dosn't want to leave him... If its just sex she wants then why would she try to get so attached to me... why would a woman live apart from her husband but see him all the time and not make any effort to better her relationship with me? If its just sex she is after then why dosn't she say so and why would she be after me for the past three years... I am sure she can get cock anywhere firstly and am I that amazing in bed that that she so stuck... OK I know I a good but I am that good????? Why do I have feeling that somthing is weird... Whats really going on...??
20090129075833AA7ZWO9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Issues about going to one of those "All Girls Staff" places for sex?	Well me and my friends were driving around bored one night and what we thought was a strip club was a place for sex and custom fantasies. It was a joke at first to check out what the prices and services were but my friends were taken away by the girls that they had there.       Yea I liked a couple of them myself but I couldn't stand the thought of paying for sex or the dangers of it. But another half of me was peer influenced and said yea go ahead and have some fun because being 20, single and a virgin is no longer any fun and here's an opportunity.      So what happens is that they are going to go again another time now they know what that place is all about. I'm split in half about going with them and don't know what to do. Should I go with them just to try it once to see how things are and all that? or stay home and keep wondering about it and keep running into issues of staying the way I am right now?

20090129072710AAIzkcN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Silly fights around the same time each year - repost?	ok, i know he's stressed.. i know he's been working a lot, and misses his kids more because of it. i know he's been having a hard time dealing with his pain in the neck father... i know he's got a lot going on... but lately, he is getting pissy about EVERY little thing...      now, normally, i am good about "picking my battles" with him... i know not everything is worth fighting over... he is not, but usually, its not this big of a deal.. but lately, its been an every night thing.. he always finds SOMETHING insignificant to get angry about with me.. its a bit much. he lets it go by morning, but i cant take it anymore...      i've talked to him, but he keeps saying that he's getting mad because its me who keeps insisting on whatever it is i need to know or do... like, here's an example - 2 nights ago, he said his daughter had a project she needed to work on and since she was going to be home with me that afternoon, i was trying to get more info so i could make sure she was doing it correctly... there was a note sent home about it, but it went to their mothers house... i asked him what she needed to do and when he didnt give me a full answer, i mentioned that there was a note but i thought it was at their moms, and he didnt remember the note and started getting mad cause i wouldnt stop asking questions. i figured he'd say, "ok, i'll talk to their mother in the morning and find out." but no... well, whatever, so i quit, and didnt do the project with her. she could do it at her moms the next day... last night, we fought over who farted.. he kept saying it wasnt him, i said it wasnt me, and he got mad cause i insisted it wasnt me.. it was SO STUPID!      this morning, i said very nicely, "babe, can we please stop fighting about every little thing. we fought over a fart last night!" he says he got pissed cause i was insisting, and it was like he was starting the fight all over again.. if i hadnt shut down and stopped talking, it would have gotten him mad again.. and the weird thing is, last year, at this same exact time, the same thing was happening, we were fighting every night about the stupidest stuff for about 2 weeks... it got really bad.. i'm wondering if its that we really havnt figured out how to live together, and maybe thats the reason for it.. we dont live together, per say, but the nights he has his kids, i stay at his house to bring them to school in the morning (and this is new since he just started working 3 weeks ago..) and the nights he doesnt have them, he stays at my house.. the difference is that for the last year, i stayed at my house when he had the kids... now, asside from when he works, we're together much of the time... we were together a lot before, when we were both out of work, but now, things are a bit different.. i'm not sure what the issue is, or how to rectify it! and no, i'm not leaving him and his kids.. they are my family and life..

20090129082049AAq4mf6	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What problems may arise from eloping?	My fiance and I are thinking about eloping and then having a big reception to celebrate after the honeymoon. The thing is, we dont have much money and if we were to have a wedding we would want a small one but we both have a large circle of close friends and large families. WE dont want to hurt feelings and we want it to be romantic and between us. So my question is for those of you that eloped~ Did you come across any problems? What was your experience?    Also, we are thinking of something out doors, having a photographer and we would be wearing wedding attire. So we will still be able to share our wedding at the reception.   Thanks!

20090129080014AAF8M3S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me or is he just desperate?	Okay, so on msn he says stuff like ' Damn you're so hot' and 'love you bad'. Then he likes to talk about what we would do if we were together. He likes talking dirty to me and I talk dirty back.    At college he is completely different person. He wont talk to me personally, he'll just talk to the people around me and he will hardly ever make eye contact.    Does he do that because he is afraid to give away hints he might like me in-front of friends? Or is it just because he doesn't care for my friendship he just wants me to 'get him in the mood' on msn?      I actually do like him and would want a relationship with him but I think he is just after action from me.      Any opinions welcome (: x

Me and my friend are "fcuk friends" and I had the house to myself this morning, so I tried calling him to come over but no one answered. So i decided to stop by. He's on nights but he can usually run on like no sleep. I have to work at noon so i figured he could sleep in the afternoon. I got there, and he wanted to sleep. I didn't tell him I had to go to work. But I stormed out of there pretty pissed, and now I feel bad. I want to tell him I'm sorry, but I don't want it to sound like we're in a relationship. And I probably shouldn't have just stopped by like that. I'm going to send a text. How does this sound to you?      "I'm sorry about being a btich this morning. I probably shouldn't have surprised you like that. I work at 12 and i thought we could hook up before."      What should I change? Or is it good?

20090129075820AAL2WCZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this girl....?	What should i do with this girl???  Yeah...When i had an induction at one of restaurant after my application has been accepted...Then, i met this girl. So, She & me applying for a position at the same time roughly. She applied for Bar Staff & i apply for F&B attendant. We had only met 3 times.    At the first & second, we really seldom to talk each other, because we are working at the same time...but working in different area then i just pick-up the drinks from the bar...which is she also made some of them.    Then, for the third met, i had to work in the bar-back (working in the same spot), so we quite often had a conversation...the bad-luck is i haven't ask, her mobile-phone number.    Then, after this, i never met her again, because she resign already. The reason is, time is not suitable. Coz, always get the night shift which is she doesnt like it & she just only get one / two shifts a week.    And last met she said "i have to go now" & she also clap my shoulder.    I also had her number, that i got from staffs info book. But, don't know how to contact...esp when she asking, "where did i got her number?" without her permission...    Now the Q is...What should i do???    Ring her? SMS her? if have to do so, what roughly the conversation should begin? Coz, i really have no experience with this kind of things...    Thanks,

As soon as everyone found out she keeps trying to break us up and ruin our relationship. she writes emails to everyone including my boyfriend regarding how much of a "slut" i apparently am. which i'm not. and how scene boys shouldn't date scene girls because they're all sluts? she also wrote my boyfriend a loong email about all the bad things i'd "supposivley" done when we were younger and friends. which none of these things ever happened. A lot of times she also walks right up to my boyfriend and flirts with him, literally in front of my face. i tell her off all the time, but it really hurts to have to go through this. she's pretty much ruining my reputation everywhere. my boyfriend doesn't like her but says eventually she'll find a different guy and move on. it's not that i don't believe him but as much as i tell her off, she starts another stupid email, or makes a huge scene.   can someone please help me with what i should do ?   thankyouuuuu !

20090129081130AAzuNGC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question for Married Women?	I grew up in a home where Dad was boss and I pretty much grew up thinking that is the way things ought to be and I pretty much had this picture in my head that when i got married I should have the quentisential Beaver Cleaver home.    Now Im married and reality has set in and I know that is nowhere near realistic.    My question to you ladies out there is this:  How far is too far to make sure things are equal in our relationship,,, so now its to the point where Im starting to feel " Hen Pecked" and Im not sure if  Im being a doormat or not.  I mean Ill strait up get my a- s reamed and we can go on fighting all day sometimes.   This does not feel right!!!  or am I over reacting and is this normal??    One more question.  Is it fair for my wife to say that if im pissed about something I should talk to her calmly about it when im mad and not when we are arguing about something she is mad about,,,, like im negating her "feelings" by saying,,,," Well,,, you did the other day!"

20090129072108AAZnjfn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I cry over this guy and none of the others?	There is this guy I went to school with. From middle school through high school and we are now at college together too. We talked occasionally before college but not a lot. Now we are dating and it has only been a week and a half. I found out he is leaving in a couple of months for the summer for work. I shouldn't have gotten so upset but I couldn't stop crying. Then he sent me a text that said he needed to talk in person, it's really important, so remind him if he forgets.    Why am I so emotional about this guy? I have never cried over a guy before, there was even one that I dated for over a year and didn't cry over. And what might he mean by that text?

20090129072833AABDub0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does my husband get easily irritated at me over little things?	like earlier today he had on one of his stretchy undershirts. I rubbed my hand down his arm and it felt like he had something up his sleeve. I noticed it was just bunched up some so i just tugged on it just barely (not hardly even enough to notice) to get the bunch out and he was like "will you quit messing with my shirt!!!"    He's also not the best driver sometimes and yesterday when we pulled out an intersection after getting off the interstate i just barely said under my breath "there's another car" and he was like "honey, I don't need you to be my back seat driver!"    I love him like crazy, but is it me? He said I've been moody a lot before, and I've worked on that. But I work all day long and then clean the house AND I'm also going back to school! He, however, sits on his butt all day at home.(is out of a job)   We've only been married almost a year, and I know the first year is rough, but when he does little irritating stuff from time to time I never say anything . if i ask him to help out he huffs and puffs around. But whenever I do a little something that gets on his nerves he blows all to pieces and nags about it for a while. REAL HELP PLEASE!!! ASAP!!!

20090129075340AAFEuZ0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I do the right thing?	Ok, so me and this girl have been meeting up once a week for coffee for the past fortnight.  I really like her, and I think she feels the same way as we flirt quite a bit.  However, when we last met she suggested we go to the cinema next week, which I obviously said yes to, but didn't decide on which day.  She's going to Brussels this weekend, so I text her and asked if she wanted to go on Monday night ... she said she would be too tired from the weekend and also has an interview that day.  So, I asked her if she wanted to get a coffee today but she was at home packing for Brussels and doing essays.      Ultimately, I sent her a text: 'Listen, give me a shout next week if you fancy the cinema.  If I don't hear from you then I won't bother you again' ... I sent her this to let her know that I am interested in her, but am not going to wait around or be played.  Please give me your thoughts and advice, I like this girl so much and really want her to contact me next week.  Thanks!

20090129075956AA2JFh2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am interested in finding out if another guy would do this?	My ex told me to find another guy who would do what he did for me. I am curious..Here is the situation:   I lived with my ex in my home for 4 years. It is a very nice home, in a nice neighborhood. While he lived with me he was able to pay off all his debts and save $20,000. He paid none of the household bills. I paid them all. He worked two weekends a month. The rest of the time was his to do what he wanted, except for 10 months we spent remodeling the house. The work we did was replace flooring, tile, laminate, and hardwood. We remodeled the kitchen, replaced cabinets, cut an opening in a wall, built a custom cabinet to hold the fridge and oven, tiled two bathtub areas and tiled a half bath. The work days started around 10 or 11 and usually ended around 5 or 6.    He believes that no other guy would ever have done all this work  and I agree it was a lot of hard work and appreciate the work he help me do.  But I think 10 months of work is a fair trade for 4 years of free rent, food, utilities, and being able to pay off all his debts and save. Am I being irrational?

I only found out today that she has one but I really like her. I have wanted to ask her out for ages but I am too nervous. I thought she liked me too but she asked him out.    I don't actually know what love is, and if you can have it at my age, but I think it is. I am crazy about her and we have had moments when I think how beautiful she is and how close we are. Sometimes we go to the cinema just me and her! We have never been out before but now I am so upset. In the past months I never have felt so close to a friend before and before I have been to Secondary school I was always jealous when she had boyfriends but I didn't do anything about it (I hated one of her boyfriends, he used to called me names). I don't mind this person she is going out with but now I don't know if I like him or not. I am sitting here wondering whether to tell her whether I like her or to just leave it.    What should I do?

Ok I'm in college and theres this shy girl who really doesnt talk to a lot of people but she has a few friends. She started talking and I can tell she really likes me by the nonverbal communications and how I catch her stairing at me, now I just found out she has a boyfriend back home. When we talk she only mentioned him once. Now I told her that I liked her but I knew she had a boyfriend and everything and she acted so differently to me after that it was actually really awkward. Then she text me saying she was sorry i got that impression and she loves her b/f but i am confused because she did like all the nonverbal signs that a girl likes a guy and would stare. So we agreed on being just friends. Now in class it seems so awkward between us and she hardly talks to me like she used to. If I see her outta class I think she tries to avoid me too. I though we were just goin be friends? Whats goin on here?

I need some creative yet organized ideas to put on my brochure, I want to keep it simple and to the point, but yet catch some attention.       Should I put all the services I offer on the brochure, prices, and what else!? I'm getting a little frustrated with all of it.
20090129081300AACc55g	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My boyfriend was going to marry his ex, but not me?	So here's the storey. Me and my boyfriend have been together for 6 years now, living together for almost 5.  We have a full life together, pets, vehicles, a cabin.  Pretty much anyone who doesn't know us might think we already are married.  The relationship has had it's ups and downs where we had am 8 year age difference between us but we've been going pretty strong over the last couple years.  I get along great with his family and he gets along great with mine.  I truely love him and I do believe he loves me back but here's the sinario.  Before we got together is was with another girl for about 4 years, it was a nasty break up as she wasn't sure what she wanted from him.  I stumbled across a letter he wrote her after the broke up for the last time that pretty much spilled that he loved her and was terribly hurt and if she wanted him back he would marry her tomorrow without question.  Now since he's been with me over the last 6 years the topic has not even come up only in general conversation and he always says no matter who's around that he's never getting married.  It really upsets me knowing that he was completely committed to his ex but  would have married her without question but he never plans to marry me, won't even joke about it.  Do you think he's still holding on to the thought that he was meant to marry his ex and i'm just conveniant right now, but not enough to marry.  I know, it's crazy.

20090129082709AALIif6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do people think I did something wrong?	So I met this guy and we had sex twice and then he didn't call or return my calls for two weeks.  So I didn't know what to think.  When I went out New Years Eve, I met one of his friends.  I told his friend about me & his affair because I wanted to be upfront and honest.  The friend of course went back and told him about our whole conversation.      When I did talk to my homey lover friend finally he was upset that I was talking to his friend and his friend lied and told him that we had sex.  I only talked to his friend for a week and his friend told me that he gave him details our sexual affair.       Why do people think I did something wrong?  They said I shouldn't have ever talked to his friend, but I'm free to do what I want to do right?  He wasn't showing me any attention and at first I thought his friend was a cool guy, but after talking to him for a few days I realized I wasn't interested and left the friend alone.  I'm still seeing my homey lover friend but now he'll never trust me.  Why do people think I did something wrong?

20090129082827AAgOqzR	Family & Relationships;Friends	What Should I Do With A Best Friend Like This?	I've been best friends with this girl for 5 years. And she has always had these moods..like one minute she is fine the next minute she blanks me. Whenever i've got a new top on or i have a new haircut she never says, "you look nice!"...other random people that aren't as close to me as her, say that i look nice. I always compliment her like a good friend should. Today, i wore a new skirt to school and the first thing that she said to me in the morning was, "oh, your wearing a skirt!"-i always wear skirts and she always has a problem with it even thought a lot of our other friends wear a skirt too. After that she stopped talking to me all day. She knows that i'm really upset already because i broke up with my boyfriend/bestfriend-but she still continued to behave in a really moody/rude way. I'm so fed up...i can't be bothered with her moods. Whenever i've tried talking to her about it she just shrugs her shoulders. As we are getting older i'm seeing that her behaviour is really immature and rude. She doesn't even have any respect for the own mother she tells her to shut up and other things and i can tell her mother is really offended. Please help!!!-sorry it's long.

20081031111711AAunWSR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think of this complicated guy situation?	Here is the situation, I'll try not to make it too long a story.      Part One: When I was a senior in high school I kinda dated this guy for a couple months. He and I and all our friends all hung out at the same coffeeshop all the time so before and after we were "dating", we were friends. Now I say kinda dated because it never was official or serious, we were just together all the time and I was his date to things a lot, such as concerts. Did I feel like I was in love with him then, no.      Part 2: He joined the Marines, and I went away to college, never to speak to eachother again. Well thats a lie, he did call me once randomly about a year after he left and tried to get me to visit him in maryland. I didn't go cause I didn't know if it was an obvious booty call or, if he actually just wanted to see me.   I'd say about 7 years have passed now.      Part 3: He recently found me on myspace. We started chatting online. I found out hes married and has 2 kids. However, he's getting divorced. Apparently she has some major psychological issues and doesn't act like a mature responcible mother. Whatever. So then he said he was coming to town next month and I should give him my number. I didn't see the harm cause at this point I feel like, I'm just talking to an old friend, no big deal.   Another detail that might be important to the story is that he then joined the army and has spent time in Iraq, Afganistan and Mosul.   Well, as soon as he got my number he started calling me, a lot. Night after night. I enjoy talking to him as he's pretty quick witted and is funny. But at the same time I'm just a little freaked out.      I feel like I havent seen this guy in forever, I'm sure we're both different people then we used to be. I'm not too keen on his stories about his current wife, and I really don't know what the heck his intentions are.   Should I avoid talking to him?   I feel pretty confused... I don't get why he is hitting on me so persistintly when he's still married and at the moment lives across the country. Wouldn't you kinda be like, umm, what is this?   Maybe he just need an impartial party to talk to? OR a nice girl to talk to (as I'm really nice and understanding, and probably way more mature then his wife..)?   I don't know what to do or think about all this? Any insights?

I masturbate first thing when I wake up in the morning, last thing before I go to sleep at night and several times in between.  I can't imagine getting through a whole school day without an orgasm.  I often have to excuse myself from class to go to the bathroom and make myself come to get some relief.  Am I the only one like this?
20090129082225AAerTgN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Interested in a British man, why doesn't he call me?	Having a long distance "getting to know you" with some flirty undertones with a nice gentleman from England (sorry that is the best way to describe it).  I'm an American girl (smart and attractive). He is over 40 and single and has a very good job that keeps him busy.  We met here in the US and stayed in touch (nothing romantic happened).   He calls when he says he will, but not often.  I"ll call him or he'll call me (or we'll text) once a week or so.  But when we talk it is over an hour.       Someone told me that British men tend to be less "chatty" and won't call as often as American men.  I know all men are different but perhaps there is some truth to this.   Or maybe he just isn't that into me? Do British men tend to want the girl to do the calling?

20090129083034AAIUv82	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he inconsiderate of me or am I making too much of it?	I started snowing here like crazy and the heap of snow in my drive is owerhwelming.  I drive a 4 wheel SUV, so getting out of my drive wasnt terribly hard, although getting back in the drive last nite was a nightmare.     He lives a block away and instead of coming over to make sure I was able to get out, he walked to his female neighbors help to dig her out of the snow.  He said she wouldnt have been able to get her car out if he hadnt helped her.  I think he is trying to strike up something more than digging her out.  Is it me or is he being totally inconsiderate of me?
20090129082258AAzzPqm	Family & Relationships;Friends	So there is this girl who i love very much, and she also says she loves me,?	ive waited about 4 years to get with her, she know very much how i feel about her and she considers me her best friend, i want to be with her so badly. but im afraid that she wont be as commited to me as i am to her, she cheated before on a boyfriend and she's had so many others just up and leave and ive always been there to pick her back up, she never wanted to be with me becuase she thought in the end i might leave her too, but shes the girl of my dreams and i'd be with her till the end if she would let me. I'm really the only guy in her life the she trusts, im just worried that she might be to reckless for me, she's been through a lot and ive been there with her... what should i do, try and be with her and risk loosing a best friend or leave it alone and just stay friends with the one girl ive fallen for?

20090129082243AAjxyLq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wives...would you do these types of things just to make your husband happy...even if it didn't make sense?	My husband and I both work long hours, so we have a pretty equal partnership in housework.  However, it bothers him to death that I sit my plate from dinner beside me and watch TV (we eat dinner on the couch while watching TV) until I get up.  He feels compelled to get it and take it to the kitchen, even though I would take it when I got up.  Then, it bothers him to death that I sometimes leave empty bottles lying around until bedtime, when I pick them up.  It also bothers him that I leave clean and dry laundry in the dryer for a few days.  He can't stand it that I'm not as organized as him and that my stuff isn't always in a clear-cut location.  I am a last-minute person, which has never caused me any trouble, but he wants me to do things more in advance.  Anyhow, he thinks since these things bother him that I should do them for him to show him that I love him.  He equates it to him coming to bed with me when he really wants to play video games.  I think this is ridiculous, which I've told him...as these things don't affect him directly because they get taken care of.  He has yelled at me for not doing these things in the past.  Anyhow, is this normal?  Would you do it?
20090129082953AAoVxOv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Bring new girlfriend to a party?	My ex who i still really love (we're 16/17) broke up with me a few months ago, but we're still like best friends and i get the feeling alot that she still loves me (and so do others) but for some reason she doesn't want to be with me now.... Anyways, we're going to a party and everyone wanted me to bring my new girlfriend so I will. But my ex told me that seeing me with someone else doesn't feel right, but she wants me to be happy and wants to let go.. And she also said it's not that she wants to get back. So i don't wana hurt her cause I care about her.. Would bringing my new girlfriend be so bad? or would it work in my interests?

20090129082749AAZoTPq	Family & Relationships;Family	What would you do/what do you think?	Its a long story! I have a cousin, shes 16 like me, and we grew up together. She lived on a farm so we wouldn't se each other that often but when we did it was like we hadn't been apart. A few years ago she moved up to the city and started going to school here so I got to see her even more which was great. then i moved to her school and we saw each other everyday! We became best friends, we were like twins! we went everywhere together and had sleepovers and laguna beach marathons! I saw her as the sister I never had. We were different though, i liked alternative music and to dress a bit differently and she loved her pop music and shopped at Supre.There was 4 of us us 2 and our 2 friends. I wasn't into the whole drinking/party thing and i kinda knew they wanted to do it. Anyway they ended up going to this girls party and got completely ****** up, i wasn't invited but i heard rumours at school and i was absolutely shocked. anyways **** went down they chose the party chick over me and we had some issues i apologised but it was never they same with the other 3, especially my cousin. we'd walk past each other like we didn't know each other, never said hi or anything. its been a whole year and i finally saw her a few weeks ago. i know she lied and said it was my fault and  that my friends and me ditched her and stuff, but i promised my aunt, mum and myself that i'd be civil and polite and talk to her. well i went to talk to her and she ignored me and was really rude too. like i look at the old fotos and cry and stuff. im just really hurt how this has turned out i would love to talk to her again, i know it wouldn't be the same but i don't know if its worth it, what do you think? what would you do? i really miss her :(

My ex treated me like more of a friend then a girlfriend he never called he never texted me he never answered my calls or texts. He would say that the texts never came through. But later when I would be looking at his phone I would check because I didn't believe him. and sure enough they did come through he just always chose not to answer. Eventually I decided I was done and that I was going to break up with him. But he beat me to it and sent me a text while he was at lunch and I was in class. Then a couple weeks later I found out he was Bi. So I was happy that I got away from him. 2 months later I have the most amazing boyfriend who treats me great. But recently any time someone brings him up or I see him I get very sad.       I don't know what that means... Do I miss him? Or what? Please help?!?

20090129082640AA30wtL	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Have we been together too long for a traditional wedding?	I have been with my boyfriend for 7 years.  I love him with all my heart and we have been putting off the marriage thing because we are young.  Now I am ready and so is he.  I feel foolish having a wedding because we have been together for so long that to most people we are 'married' anyways.  I want to elope but also want to celebrate.  I am not happy with the idea of my family and friends making me feel silly for wanting this.  Please give me any honest answer!  Thanks for your consideration!!!

20090129082832AAaUwO1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A girl that i care about a lot is really confusing me, our relationship has run hot and cold so far but we ?	both admit that we are having strong feelings towards one another  and it makes us both bit nervous, things moved pretty fast.  She told me she has a hard time trusting and will put up a defensive wall.  ive tried to build up trust the best ways i know how, ie answering her calls and being there when she wants to see me.  She went home for the weekend and asked to hang out when she returned.  I agreed but have not heard from her in about 5 days since and i havent called considering she has made no attempt to explain why she blew me off.  Im not sure if i should give her space or send her flowers, the whole thing seems odd.  Ideas??

20090129083149AA0P8Jl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	In love with my wife's (and mine) best friend. Should I tell her?	A little background info first:   My wife and I are both 29 and have been married for almost 4 years now. We have no kids yet but are thinking about it. I still love her very much but the relationship has lost its spark for a couple of years now. Mostly I guess it's the routine of everyday life and the fact that we're both very busy professionally.      We both have the same best friend - this 22 years old single girl. The three of us often do a lot of fun stuff together (nothing remotely sexual, just friends stuff). She's also a co-worker of my wife's so they get to see a lot of each other. I mostly see her on weekends as she often spends them at our house.      Now to the problem at hand:   A few months ago I have started having romantic feelings towards her. I said to myself it's just lust or a simple crush and it should go away. It didn't, and my feelings only grew stronger over time. Now I can't stop thinking about her. I just feel like I'm in love with both her and my wife at the same time.      I'm considering telling her how I feel, hoping that she'll just tell me to get my head straight and help me get over these feelings. On the other hand, I definitely don't want to scare her and jeopardize our friendship or my marriage. And the thing I fear the most is that she might just tell me she feels the same about me, in which case I have absolutely no idea what to do.      On a side note, I would really love to be able to get this off my chest and talk to my wife about it because I'm sure together we could find an answer, but I don't want to hurt her feelings.      Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!
20090129083204AAw8aoe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ladies,how good looking does a guy have to be?	in order for you to talk to him? I hear people say it isnt all about looks.. But, i used to date alot, then in 04, i had a bad breakup and no longer trusted women. Im now 27, and women still don't approach me. I know my looks arent good, and i feel all i need is to be somewhat attractive and the ladies would give me the time of day. Heres my pics, please what can i do to look attractive?, honest answers.. i get told im cute, blah blah. I dont think thats honest cause if it were... women would talk to me..      http://i413.photobucket.com/albums/pp215... 
20090129083226AAYHs9Z	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I am not sure whether to ask my Maid of Honor to step down?	Here is the break down ...I am getting married in 8 months and yes I know there is some time...my Maid of Honor is going through an awful time in her life right now and I feel like to have her focus on my life is selfish of me I asked her about 11 months ago to be in the wedding....background for you:  My maid of honor just graduated from law school passed the bar - broke off her engagement can't find a job and now is facing eviction if she can't find money to pay her rent....with this economy I think it is bad...I asked her previously in august or so before things became so bad ...to contact my mom and the other girls to discuss the shower (all of them live hours away so email is the best form of communication along with phone) and we needed to book the times and dates as many people are coming in from out of town...she told me that she did contact everyone and I came to find out that she never once did so my mom is working with my aunts and the other girls now to make sure everything is set...  this past weekend I asked all the girls to come into town so they could have enough time to pick a dress and make sure it was ordered in time...they all did except for her she told me that she needed to use her grocery money to drive up her (when other girls offer to carpool) and then the rest of the months rent to pay for a dress....I told her that I could cover it for her and that the other girls could drive her ( they do not know anything about her sitation partially because it is between me and her and partially because none of bridesmaid's know each other) ---she never showed...I feel like if I continue to ask her to do stuff its either a big ordeal because of her situation or she is not doing it...  I asked her to look at dresses with me and I drove to her and she never showed up ...I am having trouble finding the dress and I need to soon and she told me maybe I was meant to be miserable like her if I can't find it....    She is not financially or emotionally able to be there for me and I would not expect her to because of everything going in her life and I am trying to be there for her but since she is not I feel like it would be selfish to continue to ask her to do anything for the wedding....I am thinking of asking her to be a guest considering circumstances and to help her focus on her life more....    What do you think ?     Oh the reason I said emotionaly is because my fiance's sister is giving me hell and when she does I usually call her but she told me to suck it up so I am just not talking about and keeping it between me and my fiance...    I am being really awful because I feel like it would be selfish to ask her to do stuff that I know she can't afford and I know I can't cover all of it for her either...    I don't want to ruin the friendship but she is her main concern right now - finding a job making a living and working out the stuff in her life...
20081017163108AAtc2UB	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should my fiance stick up for me?	So my fiance told me tonight that his grandfather was trying to talk him out of marrying me because of my religious beliefs. Basically, this man has never had anything nice to say about me. When my fiance's grandmother passed away 8 months after we started dating and I went to Florida to be with him at the funeral, afterwards his grandfather told my sister in law that he didn't like me because I shouldn't have been there. Then we had a whole thing about the guest list a few months ago where he hung up on me. When my fiance's OTHER grandfather died a couple of months ago, when this grandfather called to give his condolences to the family, he told one of the uncles about my religious beliefs (I have no idea why). Basically, he's never liked me and never will it seems.      My fiance has never said to his grandfather, hey cut it out, she's gonna be my wife and you'll respect her or anything like that. I told him that if he starts with me or any other trouble on my wedding day, that me and/or my dad would have something to say about it and we wouldn't be polite. I just don't get why FH doesn't stick up for me. I know it's his grandfather but I feel like at this point, his grandfather needs a good talking to.      Am I being crazy expecting him to stick up for me a bit or would you feel the same way?
