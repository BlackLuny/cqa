The pandemic credit crisis is not a short episode by any means but given the global effort to mitigate further deterioration is unprecedented (no thanks to dubya of course). Most economists believe we will get through this in 18 months.    Wishing you the best|`|Yhxdn579aa	well first of all i would stop letting big boys play with your money.  do your own investing.  secondly, stop investing in big gambling charades like the stock market.. enough people have lost tons of money since the great depression.. save up and buy a subway franchise or something. |`|AA10971316	First unless the companies associated with the investments have gone bankrupt you have not yet lost anything.  You actually lose when you sell, until then, the value of your investments is down, but they will recover.    If you have time until you need the investments, wait.  Heck, if you bought a solid company at $50 and it is at $37, I'd consider buying more.  Personally I figure I have 20 or 25 years until I am going to retire.  I would start looking for good things to buy if I had available cash .    That said I would think that you might want to consult with a professional.  This might be a financial planner, a broker or your tax person.  If you are all of those things for yourself, then decide how long you have until you need the money, determine what other funds you have available and decide what your strategy will be for both the short and longer term.  The current situation requires that we all CALMLY consider where we are.    As to the advice to listen to the economists or to ignore the so called "big boys", each has its place.  H. Ross Perot asked us if we ever knew a rich economist.  Many of these professionals are guessing too.  We need to listen to the professionals, read the news and make decisions for ourselves.|`|JHwknuY0aa	This is not the best time to enter in the market  This is also not ther best time to exit the market  Wait for 700 billion dollar package by US, 350 billion dollar package by UK and various packages by other countries.

Little by little. Don't invest it all in one trade.    So if the market continues to dip, you're buying more as it goes down.  If you don't have extra cash though, the best thing to do is stay where you are.  Don't liquidate.  History shows that in past crashes, stock/mutual fund values rebounded anyways, inside of a year and a half to two years.    don't sell or get out coz you'll "actualize" the loss.

Its too late, you lost your 24%, but from this point it would be absolutely nuts to keep your money in the market until there is a bull market. The fact is no one knows if the market will go down, up sideways for how much and how long, but its pretty simple to figure out if you are in a bull market or bear market. Take your money out wait for a bull market and then invest well and cut your losses if you invest. Do you really think things will suddenly become "good" next week? Maybe in a year and a half there will be something new fueling the bull market/economy.

No.  Stocks aren't bad either, but people who buy them base their decisions not on the quality or promise of the company; mnay are gambling that the company stock will go up or down and will they make a profit.  Most of these people are hoping the stock price will go down and the company will not fold so that they can get a profir from the stock rising from a low point.  In other words, they are manipulating the market.

Doubtless, health insurance stocks will be affected by any changes in national health care policy.  Any change in banking / fiscal policy will probably affect the mortgage, capital, reinsurance and other markets.  Any change in energy policy will probably affect stocks of oil, natural gas and "green" companies.    But that's more national than international.  To some degree, global stock markets react to the US market.  However, if Obama were to be "protectionist" about Chinese or other manufacturing markets, it might cause a reaction in some global markets.    The same principle applies if McCain were elected, as he has promised change as well.    And we can't stay the way we are....|`|AA12117196	I think most people now assume that Obama will be elected as president.  And there won't be much of a reaction to his election, because it won't be a surprise to anyone.    But US senators and congressmen will also be elected at the same time.  And if the number of Republicans in the Senate falls below 41.  Then this will be a big negative for the US stock markets.      Because according to senate rules, 41 senators can block any legislation they want.  And as long as there are at least 41 Republican senators.  Then the Democrats won't be able to do much without the agreement of the Republicans.      But if the number of Republican senators falls below 41.  Then Democrats will be able to pass all kinds of trade protectionist legislation and all kinds of new regulations and taxes for businesses.  Which stock market investors usually don't like.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	I think that it is hard to say.  People who "gamble" on the stock market base their decisions on how they predict the economy will be, which basically means their ability to make a profit.  Look how well they have been able to predict so far.  Did they predict that some people would take advantage of the system?  They should have, but they thought they could manage it.  They could not.  They may be looking for more regulation because they now see they cannot manage themselves.  It is difficult to say how they will react, but government leaders have been no better at predicting the economy in the long run than investors.  I hope people think it over carefully.|`|1McY2Y6caa	they would fail..... go McCain|`|PBys4M2laa	Like they are.

iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, it would be preferable to some of the Bush McCain idiots. however he is still a conservative, which will make the capitalists happy, and thereby cause the market to rise.

AA10983989	A mutual fund is a form of collective investment that pools money from many investors and invests the money in stocks, bonds, short-term money market instruments, and/or other securities.  In a mutual fund, the fund manager trades the fund's underlying securities, realizing capital gains or loss, and collects the dividend or interest income. The investment proceeds are then passed along to the individual investors. The value of a share of the mutual fund, known as the net asset value (NAV), is calculated daily based on the total value of the fund divided by the number of shares purchased by investors.    Legally known as an "open-end company," a mutual fund is one of three basic types of investment companies available in the United States.|`|AA10386331	they are a group of many stocks and sometimes bonds that make up one fund..... when you invest in a fund you are actually investing in many different companies.    http://mutualfunds.about.com/    http://finance.yahoo.com/funds|`|AA10873605	They collect money from investors like you and me and invest that collective pool.

Its too broad a field to answer here, so best you go to yahoo and search the web.|`|d490f391f86620105b6e618d90c1bcf8aa	Mutual funds are a way of investing with slightly lower risk than stock.  What happens is, whoever is in charge of the mutual funds picks a certain number of stocks (and other types of securities) to invest in.  So, by investing in multiple stocks instead of just one, you're diversifying your portfolio.      For example, if you were to buy shares in Vanguard International Growth, you'd call up Vanguard or go to their website or whatever.  Your money gets pooled with everyone else's who has shares in Vanguard International Growth.  When the securities within that fund (mostly up and coming second world and third world companies and markets) go up or down, the value of your shares in the mutual fund do as well.

The mortgage is higher than $200,000 because of loan fees and other closing costs such as appraisal fees, closing costs, etc.  the seller of the home probably recognizes a gain on the sale of the house, the mortgage company, appraiser, title company, etc. recognize income from the mortgage and sale transaction.  the mortgage company packages the $215,000 mortgage with other mortgage and sells it mortgage package to investors and an investment paying interest income as the mortgage payments are collected.  a brokerage company sells the packaged mortgages and makes income from the sale to investors.    next the investors, banks, individuals, other financial institutions, need to write the investment down because there is with the housing crises, no market for such packaged mortgage investments.  you see a host of individuals and other business have made money alone the way and the end purchaser of the packeged morgtage investments is the loser because of the iliquidity of the investments..    The government now buys the toxix asset investments to get the investments of the books of the financial entities and replace them with cash at the discounted value to avoid the financial entities from going into bankruptcy.    jon some of these packaged mortgage investments, the government is indicating that the discounted purchase price of these packaged mortgage investments will recover and actually over time be worth more than the price the government purchased at.|`|lTnyPZR3aa	money is not lost, value is lost. the same amount of shares, which is what is bought, remains the same|`|bOa1kXUdaa	It doesn't just disappear - the stock market is based on supply and demand, so when a stock goes down, it means a lot of people are selling (on a very basic level).

In your mind, you have $100 because of the promise, but if I don't give you the $100, you will have thought you lost the $100 but you never really had it.      With the stock market, people invested money, the value of the stock went up and then came back down.

Don't worry about your parents, they're old enough to get themselves out of this position. Don't put the blame on yourself if you do end up losing your house. There's nothing you can do to support your parents' finances.

AA11824532	When someone has not worked for some time, it is not unusual for prospective employers to ask what you've been up to.  Were you unable to find work?  Sick?  Touring Europe?  If you can be honest, do so.  As a former HR Director, I appreciated the honesty.  If you need to make something up, tell them you had some personal family priorities that demanded your complete attention; and you didn't think it would be fair to your former employer to keep your job when your mind and presence was needed elsewhere.  You do not have to make up details of a situation that did not exist.  Just be prepared to assure the interviewer that the matter has been resolved and that you are anxious to get back to building that career that you studied so long and hard for.  As far as references, most employers look for a former supervisor to speak with; but everybody sues everybody these days, so unless you have maintained close contact with someone you worked for, you have to dig a little deeper.  Who do you know????  Think hard.  Do you go to church?  Call on your pastor to speak to your general character.  You are still young?  Was there a professor in college who might speak up for you?  A mentor?  A neighbor you have helped out from time to time?  And, when listing whoever you come up with, be sure to ask them in advance so that they will not be caught off guard by a phone call.  Good luck.

AA11548117	If you maxed out your IRA contributions and your 401(k), then you should check out variable annuities. They required at least an initial $5000 investment, unless you choose to invest systematically. They have no limit on how much you can put in.    If you have kid and want this child to go to college some day, you should check your state's 529 plan. Then compare it to other states.|`|2df3fbc91ee2e3152b4eeee0dab7fe84aa	If you've already funded your Roth IRA this year then you can NOT contribute to another IRA (Roth, traditional, or otherwise).   The IRA contribution limits are per taxpayer, per year (regardless of which IRA you choose).    I'd probably just invest using some good tax-effecient mutual funds or ETFs.|`|Kjr67uV5aa	Congrats on making such excellent financial decisions.  Keep it up!    You can invest additional funds in a traditional non-deductible IRA.  You won't be able to deduct the contributions, but the earnings will be tax deferred.  Normally this isn't a great deal, but congress has passed a law removing the income maximum to convert a traditional IRA to a Roth starting in 2010.  So you can save in a non-deductible IRA now, and convert to a Roth in 2010.  You'll have to pay taxes on any earnings when you convert, but that's it.    Annuities are another option if you have a very high income and a strong desire to deduct now.  But they are a bad choice for most people.  Most will be better off with the IRA conversion.|`|AA12220417	Contrarian hit it on the head with his answers.  Although I think he is painting Annuities with a rather broad brush characterizing them as bad.    I don't sell annuities so I ma not lobbying, but just like any other financial tool, they have the point nad place.  Annuities are like a mini IRA in that they are tied up with the same limits, but unlike an IRA have an insurance feature.  This insurance feature makes them non attachable assets in many states and also sheltered from creditors.  that is important. They also bypass probate and go to your heirs tax free.  There is also a stepped up death benefit that gives you protection agains market down turns    The mainstream media jumps all over annuities due to the high costs, but fails to point out the benefits to some of these insurance features.    A couple other ways to invest would be buy a rental property or start a cash value type life insurance policy.  again you are building tax free assets, insurance prodcuts are protected assets, and if you are not needing it, one day you may have others who you need to protect with this coverage and you will have a head start

AA10464818	What the US government offers are loans to start a small business, certification programs for disadvantaged business owners such as minorities that will allow minority-owned businesses  to better compete in the government contracting process.    I suggest you contact the Minority Business Development Agency http://www.mbda.gov/    But if you are thinking of grants (or what others call "free money"), no, grants are not given just because you are a minority women    From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/mostrequesteditems/CO...    --------------------------------------...  "The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."  --------------------------------------...    Even MBDA does not give out grants http://www.mbda.gov/?section_id=3&bucket...    --------------------------------------...

There are grants available through federal and state government programs but they are primarily for research or development in the area of: technology, biotech, homeland security and defense. The objective of the programs is to create jobs, encourage innovation and firm formation.

015f8a3df16872362c89363c34df3ca2aa	Checks are typically mailed directly to the creditors.    BTW: Consolidation is rarely a good idea.|`|AA11493807	I work for a Real Estate Title Company and here is what I see at work. When people refinance their home to payoff debt it depends on the type of debt. Credit cards at my company go back to the borrower (you) to be sent in like a normal payment. I processed a file the other day and the person had 19 consumer credit accounts being paid!!!! The checks are made payable to the credit card companies and you just need to put your account number on the check and mail it in with the payment coupon like the personal check you would have written. You would be surprised how many people do not write their credit card acct  on the check and the card company can not and will not apply it to an account without one so it gets sent back to my company not you!! This causes delays and you get late fees to pay!! Dont whine!! You forgot to write the acct  not us. The Title Company is not provided your credit card account numbers so we are unable to write them on the check for you!! This is for YOUR protection!!!! WRITE YOUR ACCT NUMBER ON THE CHECK!! I'm not screaming at you just emphasizing these points!! Double check the credit card checks BEFORE MAILING THEM because your lender tells the Title Company how to make the checks payable and they use a credit report for that. Sometimes you get a reward card like Best Buy Reward Zone Master Card or United Mileage Visa etc. but the credit report will have that bill listed as HSBC or Chase for example since HSBC handles the Best Buy Reward Zone card and Chase bank handles the United Mileage Visa card account. You may not think you have a HSBC or Chase account but it may be hidden like these examples. IF IN DOUBT CALL THE TITLE COMPANY OR YOUR LENDER BEFORE MAILING BUT MAKE YOUR PAYMENTS ON TIME ANYWAY!! It only helps you to continue to make all your minimum payments until you get the checks from the title company - trust me, I see the results of not doing this everyday!! If your debt is your previous Mortgage it will be sent with a payoff statement to the bank that held your old Mortgage via an overnight courier like FedEx. Sometimes we payoff tax bills too. These checks usually get sent directly to the tax office where the payment should be made by overnight courier. That is the answer for the Title Company I work for. If the consolidation loan is through your personal bank, or any bank for that matter, check with loan officer handling your loan. They should be able to tell you how they handle this issue. I am not sure to be honest with you since I have never worked in a bank nor have taken out a loan for this purpose. Again - pay your bills on time until you see the payment show on your account and call someone with questions. Dont worry about overpaying - the credit card companies will either issue you a refund check or post a credit to your account. You will get the money one way or the other. If you need the cash for other things, call the lender and see if you can request a refund of overpayment - some cards will give you that and some only give you a credit but it cant hurt to ASK!! I hope this has helped you!! Take Care.

Hbc916gTaa	the best way to make sure ALL the bills get paid on time is this:    Now that you know what your monthly bills are estimated to be, be sure and add the totals up and deduct that amount from your paycheck, before you do anything! Do not do any kind of shopping until you make sure your expenses are covered first.    AS far as your roommate goes - share the estimate and require that they do the exact same thing!    "Listen_______, now that we are living on our own ,we need to take this seriously otherwise, we could get into a bad situation here. I plan to deduct our rent and bills out of my paychecks each month before I do anything....I hope you do the same thing too. I really like being here with you, so lets make sure we take care of our priorities first...agreed"    Set up a calendar that both of you can see, and each month when the bills come in, write the amounts due on their respective due dates - that way, it will be a constant reminder of your obligation.    Other that that, you will just need to trust that you and your roommate will be responsible enough not go out an impulse buy stuff that could put you ability to pay these bills in jeopardy.    Good  luck!|`|qoMtNvDqaa	Here's what you do.  At the start of each month make a prioritized list of all your expenses for the next few weeks.  Your dollars go to the highest priority item first and then down the list.  This guarantees that you won't be going out to the movies with electricity money or something like that.  As to your roommate... I hope you got a good one so that the two of you can sit down and work through this process together.  It will be an excellent practice to establish now and it just could make you a millionaire someday!|`|6k2Oq3D5aa	One thing to do, if you get paid twice a month or more frequently is to spread your bills out according to your pay schedule.  So if you make say $500 every two weeks don't stack up all your bills on the first of the month so you have to pay out maybe $800.  This just gets you in trouble because you have to plan out saving money for two weeks.  It's best and easiest if you split your bills to say $400 on the first and $400 on the fifteenth that way you know you'll always have money to pay all your bills right off.    To make sure your roomate pays you just have to trust her to do so.  But, just in case get everything in writing and keep records.  Get her to sign whatever you agree too, split the bills or whatever and keep all your bills and copies of her checks or atleast a reciept for her payments.  This way if she ever doesn't pay the bills you can always take it into small claims court to collect what she rightfully owes you.|`|f714ef26ad8f0b92d25c68a6b4041d5daa	I like to have my utility bills automatically debited from my checking account every month because that way I don't have to think about them.  But you do have to be sure you'll have the money available when they debit your account.    Regarding your roommate:  You should make a schedule of the approximate due dates of all your shared bills each month (gas, electric, phone, cable, etc.).  Each bill will always be due at approximately the same time every month.    Let your roommate know you'll need her half of the bills at least a week before they're due and that you'll let her know her share as soon as the bill arrives so she can budget appropriately.  If several bills are due around the same time each month, you could set up  a date once or twice a month on which she'll pay you.  If you set up a good schedule, there should be no misunderstandings.
qWaYbxcxaa	Short selling    "short selling or "shorting" is the practice of selling a financial instrument that the seller does not own at the time of the sale. Short selling is done with intent of later purchasing the financial instrument at a lower price. Short-sellers attempt to profit from an expected decline in the price of a financial instrument."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(fina...    Short Selling: What Is Short Selling?   http://www.investopedia.com/university/s...|`|ymqWa8GNaa	Your understanding is incorrect.  The trader does not borrow money. The trader borrows shares through his broker.      A normal stock is bought then sold.    A short is stock borrowed, then sold on the open market, then bought back later, to be returned to the lender of the stock shares, with the intent of buying it back at a lower price and pocketing the difference.  Short selling provides a very valuable service to the markets, and maintains liquidity.  It is important for the market to have ample buyers when something needs to be sold, and ample sellers when something needs to be bought.  Take one of those elements away, and a market becomes far less efficient.|`|AA10285719	If you are short selling you are selling the company now at that days price and at a later date purchase it back.  This kind of sums it up:    On Monday you sell 100 shares of ABC for $50.00 (You get $5,000 in your account)    *You now owe you broker/dealer 100 shares*    On Friday you cover your short by buying 100 shares at $25.00 (You have $2500 subtracted)     You keep the gain of $2500.    On the other hand, if the price on that day was $75 a share, you would owe the broker/dealer $2500.|`|rKpstdUcaa	When short selling, a trader will borrow shares from somebody who owns them. He then sells these on the market, in anticipation of a fall in price. If he borrows and then sell 100 shares at 50 each, he receives 5000.     He then waits for the price to fall, if he is successful and the price falls, to say 40, he can buy back 100 shares for 4000, hence making a 1000 profit. He then returns them to the owner. He will have to pay a fee for borrowing the shares from the owner and this is deducted from the profit.    If the price rises, to say 60 he has to pay 6000 to buy back the shares. Hence he loses 1000 and has to pay the fee for borrowing the shares. While the profit is limited to equal to the initial investment, loses are theoretically unlimited.|`|28Pz8nt7aa	Without going into the settlement or margin or borrowing stock bit, it is all very simple. Where a "normal" trade would be buy first and sell later to close the position a short or short sale is done the other way around. Sell first and then buy back to close. You could have a covered short where you have the stock but sell with the intention of buying it back to close. Used when you believe the stock or whatever will go down.   Opposite of long, or going long.|`|48243dfc005351d85785531ce414c986aa	Normally short selling is done on derivative products such as CFDs and spreadbetting.  You will normally shortsell if you foresee that the stock in question is going to drop in price.  Example:    You sell VOD say at 120 and then buys back at three days later at 100. In this particular case you made a profit of 20 because you bought at 100 and sold 120.    Hope this shed some light!!!
HxBhOZjZaa	Its the simple principles of supply and demand.    If a company posts profits then traders will jump at the opportunity to make a profit hence pushing the prices upwards with bid-wars. Same applies if the company posts disappointing results. A selling-war will start because people will want to get out of their position as soon as possible to make the greatest possible profit.    Of course its much more complicated than this. Companies are judged on many fundamentals.|`|OVPYlo1Yaa	The price of shares can never be certain because its up to the buyers and the sellers to decide upon what price they are going to buy and sell their shares therefore when the word spreads that a company is in trouble (like your oil incident) people will look at what affect that incident will have on the company e.g. will it cause it to lose profits and if so then its know surprise that the share price will drop because people aren't going to invest in a company that wont be able to give them a sufficient return on their investment, and the same apply's if a company is doing really well.

For example, they write the terms of a deal in which one party, the sellers, is a bunch of insiders who want to sell their stock to the public in an Initial Public Offering (IPO).  The other party, the buyers,  is the general public, both individuals and institutions, like mutual funds.    The underwriters are the middlemen.  They research the integrity of the sellers, handle legal issues, work with the sellers to register the stock sale with the Securities and Exchange Commission, research the market and set the price of the IPO, and use their marketing influence to make sure the deal is a success.  They also take a financial risk to guarantee the success of the sale.    When the stock gets sold, the underwriters take a portion of the proceeds, by contract with the sellers.  This is the underwriters' fee.    Once all the stock (or other securities, like debentures or bonds) is placed with the public, the underwriters place an ad, called the "tombstone ad"  in major financial newspapers. It dryly states what they sold, how much they sold it for, for whom they sold it, and all the companies involved in underwriting the sale.  It reads like all the names on a tombstone, except all the underwriters' names read like a who's who of companies in the financial world.

4aa2f83dcf9cd2e2d77efe9fc5e1e6b1aa	Ciao.  Beh, bisogna dire che se il mutuo lo chiede soltanto il tuo ragazzo, tu hai gi una certa tutela perch solo lui  obbligato nei confronti della banca..    Infatti, pur contrendo il mutuo soltanto il tuo ragazzo, l'atto di acquisto pu senza dubbio prevedere che la casa venga intestata a entrambi, appunto met per uno, visto che tu contribuisci al pagamento del mutuo con il tuo reddito pur non risultando mutuataria.    E' ovvio che la banca vorr che l'ipoteca da accendere a fronte del mutuo sia iscritta su tutta la casa e quindi anche tu, come comproprietaria, dovrai sottoscrivere lo stesso atto di mutuo, ma solo come terza datrice d'ipoteca, e cio per concedere che anche sulla tua met di casa venga iscritta tale ipoteca.    Sperando poi che non vi lascerete mai, direi che possedere la met della casa ti garantisce abbastanza anche nel caso in cui dovreste separarvi: la rivenderete estinguendo il mutuo con una parte dei soldi ricavati e dividendovi il resto.    Sono sempre a disposizione per chiarimenti.    Ciao ciao|`|6ef4fa92b7d0346356efd39f864dc134aa	quando vai in agenzia potrai chiedere tutto   e loro saprannio risponderti   poi quando fai un atto   viene intestato alla persona no all'unione tra due persone   quindi in caso di separazione sei tutelata    ciao|`|w2Tb0zQvaa	basta sottoscrivere come conproprietari sia il compromesso che il rogito notarile...nn c' alcun problema!

Se il mutuo lo rilasciano a lui, al massimo chi rischia  lui, in quanto tu hai mezza casa intestata ma non ti accolli ufficialmente il debito e lui invece risulter l'unico debitore. Se, per ipotesi, tu decidessi di non pagare pi, la banca in potrebbe rivalersi solo su di lui. Ovviamente anche sulla casa, in quanto, per rilasciarvi il mutuo, iscriveranno una ipoteca per tutta la durata del finanziamento, che dar loro il diritto, in caso di mancato pagamento, di vendere all'asta la casa, per recuperare il soldi che vi ha anticipato.  Ciao!!|`|6yLvSAv0aa	Ovviamente la casa la puoi intestare al 50% a te e 50% il tuo ragazzo. Non  necessario essere sposati ma durante il rogito notarile verr chiesto a chi intestare l'immobile.    Per il mutuo lo pu richiedere anche tutto il tuo ragazzo e considera che verr messa un'ipoteca sull'immobile. Anche se non hai un lavoro fisso non  detto che la banca non vi faccia un mutuo assieme ( non ve lo consiglio poich in caso vi lasciaste ed uno di voi non paga sono casini) per potreste chiedere due mutui separati ( se te lo fanno) altrimenti lo intesta il tuo ragazzo!!    Ti puoi tutelare con la tua parte di abitazione!!    Considere che se siete spostati in comunione dei beni  una conseguenza che l'immobile appartiene ad entrambi ma tutti gli altri casi si decide assieme la quota di propriet dell'immobile!!    Il mutuo e l'acquisto sono due cose separate, sicuramente se il mutuo sar intestato al tuo fidanzato la banca chieder l'ipoteca totale sull'immobile quindi anche il tuo consenso per la tua quota!!    Spero di esserti stato d'aiuto...  Saluti!!
4fbf66f585493bf60d1200311e9b638baa	Do you have a colletaral that you can use against your dept consalidation? Like a house? If you do, look for HELOC -Home equity line of credit - options. You want to have a line of credit and lock it with a fixed rate. If they don't have lock option then you can have a HE Installment Loan which is fixed rate as well. For my area, USBANK is having the lowest rate. It's prime for the line which is 8.25% but loan option is as low as 6.49% for 5 years. You still wanna check with the rates though. Just call banks and compare the rates. One suggestion, until you make your mind about financial institution that you wanna work with, don't let them put your application down. Each inquiry is going to decrease your credit score  point  and it's gonna appear on your credit bureau report. It's never good to have a lot of inquiries in your bureau report. If you don't have a house to use as a colletaral, the other option would be personal loans. Which you even can use your car as a colletaral. Your credit score is a decision making point though. You may try unsecured loans if you don't have any colletaral but interest rates are higher. But still it's better that 20% credit card rates.Right? Good Luck!|`|1eb7a55425439d35c48a44ae05930376aa	A home debt consolidation loan may be your answer or HELCO.  Don't close any of your accounts once they are paid off,it will lower your FICO score.

People go for debt consolidation for many reasons: prolonging the loan period from 5 - 15 years and reducing the interest rate. Consolidation allows you to go for a loan with lower interest rate than the one you are currently paying. Besides it simplifies the loan repayment as you are paying only one lender in place of various payments to different lenders.

q2SzkuaXaa	As a landlord, I've recently been advised by the letting agents to raise the rent slightly, in line with local market conditions.    There are fewer house buyers because it's harder to get a mortgage (credit crunch). House prices are falling because there are fewer buyers. Fewer buyers means more demand for renting. More demand means higher prices.    Once credit becomes easier, rents may fall. But hopefully not too far!    Another factor that might cause rents to fall is if unemployment soars and/or wages fall, as tenants will have less money to spend on housing.    House prices and rents are largely decoupled from each other, because they're really two separate markets. The house market involves landlords and other house owners; the rental market involves landlords and tenants. But once a long-term landlord has bought a house, he's not interested much in whether he could sell it for more or for less, as he's already made his investment; instead, he's interested in how much yield he can get from it, i.e. the rent he can ask. As long as there are plenty of well-off tenants around, and no surplus of rental accommodation, rents will stay high.|`|EPzw6hHKaa	No, they won`t, more people are renting there houses out instead of selling at the moment just to get some extra money, people can`t get mortgages so renting is the only option for some|`|AA11908567	No the landlords won't do it, they want extra money.|`|AA11052660	Well maybe for tenants of newly bought properties, possibly, its down to the individual landlords though.  If they are smart they will price their rent competititively.    If you are an existing tenant however, it is unlikely that the landlord will reduce your rent because, in most cases he will  still be paying the mortgage according to the price at the time at which he bought it (i.e. when house prices were high).  But then again, he may decide that he needs to compete with other prices, and he may reduce the price reluctantly in order to do so.|`|XCHoHCrnaa	Haha, not liklely!!|`|aCdya2qkaa	Lol. good question, I think it will because nowadays people cant afford it.|`|kykmpr0Caa	i wish, everyone is out for as much as they can get now|`|nrOiMLWpaa	Hell to the no!!

(EMAILWIRE.COM, January 30, 2009 ) WASHINGTON  In response to errors showing up on early tax filings, the Internal Revenue Service today urged taxpayers and tax preparers to make sure they properly determine eligibility for the recovery rebate credit before they file their 2008 federal tax returns.    Some individuals who did not get the economic stimulus payment, and a smaller number of those who did, may be eligible for the recovery rebate credit. However, most taxpayers who received the economic stimulus payment last year will not qualify for the recovery rebate credit on their 2008 federal income tax return.    An early sampling of tax returns shows about 15 percent have errors involving the recovery rebate credit. Some tax returns erroneously claim the credit, do not claim the proper amount of recovery rebate credit or mistakenly enter the amount of the stimulus payment they received on the recovery rebate credit line.    To avoid delays in tax refunds, it is critical that taxpayers know the correct amount of the stimulus payment they received last year, if any, to help determine whether they qualify for the recovery rebate credit now.    The amount of the stimulus payment will not be entered directly on the tax return. For people using a paper tax return, the stimulus payment amount will be required when completing a related worksheet. For people using tax software, the stimulus payment amount will be needed as part of the return preparation process.    How to Get the Recovery Rebate Credit Right    The IRS sent taxpayers nearly 119 million stimulus payments last year. There are three ways individuals can find out how much they received:    Check the amount listed on Notice 1378, which the IRS mailed last year to individuals who received the economic stimulus payment.  Go to the How Much Was My Stimulus Payment? tool that is available on the IRS Web site, IRS.gov. This can provide the correct amount in a matter of a few seconds.  Individuals can call the IRS at 1-866-234-2942. After a brief recorded announcement they can select option one to find out the amount of their economic stimulus payment. They will need to provide their filing status, Social Security Number and number of exemptions.  With the amount of last years economic stimulus payment in hand, the taxpayer can then enter the figure on the recovery rebate credit worksheet or in the appropriate location when tax preparation software requests it.    If the taxpayer or preparer is using tax software, the amount of the rebate recovery credit will automatically be calculated and reported properly. If the taxpayer is using the paper method, the rebate recovery credit, as determined through the worksheet, should be reported on Line 70 of Form 1040, Line 42 of Form 1040A or Line 9 of Form 1040EZ.    For most taxpayers, the correct entry for the recovery rebate credit will either be blank or zero.    If there is any question at all as to the amount that should be reported for the recovery rebate credit, the taxpayer or preparer should enter a zero on the appropriate line above, and the IRS will determine whether a recovery rebate credit is due, and, if so, how much.    Some of the major factors that could qualify you for the recovery rebate credit include:    Your financial situation changed dramatically from 2007 to 2008.  You did not file a 2007 tax return.  Your family gained an additional qualifying child in 2008.  You were claimed as a dependent on someone elses return in 2007 but cannot be claimed as dependent by someone else in 2008.  Stimulus Payments Not Taxable; Reports of Extensive Refund Delays False    The IRS has received a number of recurring questions involving stimulus payments and the recovery rebate credit. Here are some important tips to keep in mind:    Taxability. The economic stimulus payment is not taxable and it should not be reported as income on the 2008 Form 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ.    Refund delays. IRS personnel are aware of reports that errors in claiming the recovery rebate credit could delay tax refunds for as much as eight to 12 weeks. These reports are false. As the IRS detects and corrects return errors concerning the recovery rebate credit, refund delays are currently no longer than about one week.    One payment. In addition, the IRS notes taxpayers will receive a single refund that includes any recovery rebate credit to which they are entitled. The IRS will not be issuing separate recovery rebate credit payments.    Refund amounts. The IRS reminds taxpayers they should not use their regular refund from last year in calculating the recovery rebate credit. Some taxpayers may be confusing their regular tax refunds with the economic stimulus payment they received when completing their 2008 tax return.|`|DGFu03Q3aa	Dear A:  The IRS released a memo today saying some returns have to be "validated" and the money will be deposited next Friday.

AA10691226	LOL!!! I've been leading a fully sustainable existence for over 5 years now.    Here's some advice for you newbies:    1) Browse firsthand, buy in secondhand stores only.    2) Learn how to make bean soups and stews. Eat them 2x per week. Don't buy drinks at all. (bottled water, soft drinks, alcohol)    3) Delete the 'etc.' from the spending equation.    Use newly-freed time (shopping, going to movies, golfing and other self-indulgent consumption activities take up lots of time) to go to the library, to volunteer or to get to know family members. What a concept!    To test adherence, weigh the garbage each week. This includes recyclables. It should decrease by at least half in a month's time. Continually decrease the amount of garbage you produce thereafter.     Then you'll know you're actively consuming less.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Fiscally speaking-hide!

AA10305589	It is unlikely you would be able to collect unemployment benefits.      Unemployment is for people who lose a job through no fault of their own.  As you quit, even though the company let you go a week early, the company will most likely contest your claim, and under review you will be denied, as you were only fired because you already quit.    Unemployment is not a stigma on your record.  Many people are laid off due to downsizing or company closings.   Being fired is something different, and you can't collect if you are fired for cause.  So the fact that someone receives unemployment is an asset to their resume, as it in effect proves they were not fired or terminated for any fault of your own.

1P3usILUaa	Its a journey to get your "body clock" turned around into being awake at night vs. the day.  It will take some time to accomplish this as the body is used to being awake in the day time.  The hardest part really isn't staying away on that first night ~ everything is knew and well, we tend to pay attention.  The hard part will be getting enough sleep during the day or early evening before you go to work to sustain being awake at night.    Getting good at Polyphasic sleep (napping) will help in the short run.  Link below.    Aside from that ~ if you are sitting at your work ~ try and get up and move your body at least once an hour for about 10 minutes.  That will really help the most in the long run.    Be well

SIhxrxD3aa	You're right.  Compared to human medical fields, veterinarians don't get paid well at all.  The biggest reason for this is what people are willing to spend on their animals.  Health care costs so much because it can.  People will spend what they have to to stay healthy.  If they need surgery, then they get the surgery.  Pet owners on the other hand can elect euthanasia over surgery or they can try a cheaper alternative and hope it helps.  Vets can't charge more because people aren't willing to pay more.    However, there are specialties that you can pursue that will make you more than average.  Any board certified specialist will make more than the average veterinarian.  Especially surgeons.  Owning your own clinic will make you more than average as well, especially if you take some business courses and know how to run it efficiently.    Veterinarians are probably the highest paid profession that works with animals unless you're a world famous trainer or researcher and are lucky enough to have a show on Animal planet.|`|1P3usILUaa	The best kept secret out there (I think) is that if you do stay with what you passionately love . . . the money will just follow you around.    Most vets are not on salaries as they own their own businesses and therefore reap the benefit of that ~ if you have the business; generally speaking you pay yourself what ever you can afford from the company that you are running.    The society (generally speaking) offers more credit to those working with the human skeleton ~ I've always found that amusing to a degree as a Vet needs to learn 8 skeletons to be graduated and the Family Practitioner only does one :):)    Money is never the reason or the answer ~ stay with what you love and all will be fine.

Is this a part-time job in high school or a first job after graduating from a university.      Every interview I had after graduation had the question: "Where do you see yourself in 5 years."  Which is an easy, yet silly question.  Interviewers usually ask about classes you took.  They will ask why you want to work for them.  What value you will bring to the company?  etc.  They can also ask some off the wall questions to test your reasoning skills.  The standards for these questions are why are manhole covers round?  How many people are golfing in the US right now?  What is the square root of 144?  How many cars did you pass on your drive in?    Again, it all depends on what you are applying for.  If it's a part-time job, it won't be difficult at all so just relax.

Post first whatever it is you want to do or are good at ...  However, You should keep your options open and make a decision after the persons call you instead of not giving them many reasons to call.     Say you are a student and available to work on weekends

1wV2sANcaa	I'm pretty sure a paypal customer service e-mail should have the word "paypal" in there. I would report it to ebay. Don't send anything without payment first.|`|tGKcemlgaa	There have definitely been some PayPal scams out there. I had one that came to my email that I thought was real, but what they were wanting to know sent up a red flag. So definitely make sure it is the real PayPal you are dealing with. I actually contacted PayPal themselves to find out and that's how I found out it was a scam. DO NOT send anything to someone without you having payment first. That's the way it's done online!  Linda
kn868COFaa	If you are new to the world of loans, then all the jargon and terminology can seem very confusing. There are so many different terms to understand, and unless you know some of them you will not find the best loan deal to suit your needs. If you want to know more, then here is a guide to some of the basic loan terms you might need to know.    http://www.worldbestloans.com/    The lower the APR, then the cheaper the loan interest will be. Credit scoring is a method that lenders use to determine your eligibility for a loan. They ask a series of questions about your earnings and financial situation. Each answer you give is scored, and the better your score then the more likely you are to be accepted for a loan.|`|UnlqJgXIaa	What you're thinking about is a "grant" not a loan

You want to buy commodities that you "own".  A house is the normal investment to buy in inflationary times.  The cost of lumber and shingles and labor go up along with Treasury interest rates.  You can also buy gold and silver but that market is biased against the small investor. You can buy an ounce of silver for $10 but you can only sell your ounce for $8..|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	Treasuries are weird in that at any point in time they reflect currently prevailing interest rates.  If market rates go down, the present value of your holding goes up, and vice versa. You can't take advantage of swings in interest rates, which is the only variable in a blue chip bond prior to maturity. You can only speculate in currencies,  and if you do that it doesn't much matter what you invest in.  I'm Canadian and I bought a hefty bunch of US$ denominated bonds when I thought that the rate was favorable. Since then the rate has swung 20% against and for my position. I see Americans being interested in the Canadian Dollar. Farther fields look greener to both of us, I guess.

BXwv4dBvaa	Asking you for a money order?    I would have thought they would send you a money order if they were buying your computer desk.  If this is the case and that's how they want to pay you, a money order is similar to a bank draft.  It is purchased from a bank or financial institution, and you would deposit it in your account the same way you would a cheque.    Sounds a bit sketchy -- to be sure, just tell them that you only accept cash.  There can be a lot of fraud associated with money orders, but I can't see how someone would want to scam you for a computer desk?

Spending down is very common when applying for Medicaid, many people either take out a policy with the funeral home for the burial expenses or they place it into an irrevocable account at the bank so that it is not considered an asset.  Paying for the funeral is an allowable way to spend down, so you should keep the policy so that you have the funds to pay for the funeral, cashing it out is not a smart idea.  I'm assuming that means that you will have to continue to pay back the loan, which then makes you eligible for assistance, otherwise you would not be eligible and could be disqualified for aid.  Keep the policy in force, only cash it out to pay back the loan as an absolute last resort, or you won't have any funds to bury her with.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	CAshing in life insurance for a 75 year old man, is probably a really dumb thing to do.

NEjjNmfyaa	If you don't know a lot, it's best that you start slow and learn as much as you can before starting to invest heavily.  You need to identify your goals and risk tolerance and find investments consistent with that.  Diversifying is supposed to protect you because in theory some investments will drop while others go up, but over the last year almost everything is down which limited the benefits of diversification.  To start learning, maybe go to the library and look for introductory investment books or check out investment magazines (smart money or kiplingers are good) or start surfing the web (yahoo finance is a good place to start since it links to lots of sites).|`|02b0ed9c21dcd20c5f3ee639d39a2a27aa	If you have enough money to invest and not ready to take risk just keep it in any bank in the form of Fixed deposits and can earn interest out of it. This is one of the most secure form of investing. Another one is go for govt securities. You are not mentioned your nationality. If you are in india you can go for PPF, NSC etc. Interest on PPF is not taxable. But there are some limitations of the amount you could invest. There are other schemes also like FD in Companies etc. etc.

lxJoXNZwaa	Yes, that's a good idea.  You could also bathe dogs.  On the flyer put the following:    Does your dog need a walk or a bath?    Then call me and I will get the job done.    Be sure to add on the flyer that you love dogs and that you are responsible    Include you name, phone number, and price for walking dog (and length of time) and price for bath.  How about $5 for a 1/2 hour and $7 for a full hour.    $5 for a bath  To encourage customers to use your services regularly give them a punch or stamp card - that says "after 10 walks/baths get one walk/baths" - you could include your contact information on the card and put it on cardstock paper with a magnet on the back (you can get a roll of magnetic tape at Walmart) this way customers can stick it to their refrigerators.    Best to you in your business!!|`|e7e1924d8971698b40672960f27475f5aa	Flyers are good. Also, what about neighborhood pet stores? Also, turn customers into salespeople -- anyone who refers a new customer gets $1.00 off per dog per walk (or something else compelling).

K45ZTwryaa	American Express has been making across the board reviews and reductions in credit limits and in some cases raising or imposing interest rates for many of its customers.  There does not have to be any change in your credit history for this to have occured as it has adopted more conservative formulas for determining credit limits.    The notice requirements will be governed by your contract with American Express but many online private consumer forums have multiple complaints similar to yours and according to them American Express asserts that it did in fact send a notification letter to them prior to reducing their credit limit and they will probably claim the same in your situation.    Your remedies may also be governed by your contract.  I would not be surprised at all if there is an arbitration clause in your contract.  Arbitration generally tends to be favorable to the party that placed the clause in the contract so if you decide to take action against American Express for any loss of business or damages you should expect an uphill battle.

To collect unemployment you are supposed to be available for full time work and actively seeking full time work.  If you are attending classes, this would impact your availability for work, and your opportunities to be seeking work.     If you do not notify unemployment about your classes, they can require repayment of any claim you collected, once they find out, and be banned from collecting unemployment in the future.    If you are receiving any financial aid, or any assistance tied to your social security number, they will find out.  It would be better to be up front and ask them about your specific circumstances.

Id5HppZLaa	First off, who told you that you need to use form 8879 ?  That is just a signature authorization. You need to consult someone before you do your taxes.
5Gxll9Hkaa	This answer assumes that you are in the USA.    Bankruptcy is intended to provide a fresh start to those who have debts that cannot be repaid.  The Founding Fathers specifically intended this as an alternative to indentured servitude and debtors prisons that were common responses to unrepayable indebtedness in European countries when the USA was founded.      Contemporary bankruptcy law in the USA is complicated, but for most debtors the options are to file bankruptcy under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 of the US bankruptcy code.  (Ch 12 is also available to family farmers and fishermen, and Ch 11 is available to debtors with very high assets and very high debts - basically this Chapter of the bankruptcy code would not be relevant unless you are a millionnaire, or at least were before you had to file bankruptcy).    In Chapter 7, you liquidate all non-exempt assets to pay creditors and the rest of your debts are discharged. In actual practice, only about 4% of all personal Ch. 7 bankruptcies have non-exempt assets that are liquidated to pay creditors.  Most personal possessions and household goods can be exempted, meaning you get to keep them (specific exemptions depend on state law, and vary from state to state).  Many clients filing Ch 7 bankruptcies worry about losing their house or their car.  If your payments on these secured assets are current at the time you file, most people filing Ch 7 can keep the house and the car so long as they are able to contirne making payments, and are willing to reaffirm the loan or mortgage.  If your payments are not current at the time you file, your bankruptcy attorney may advise you to consider filing Ch 13 instead, in which you have the opportunity to catch up on arrears to secured creditors over the next 3-5 years.    In Ch 13, instead of liquidating your assets to pay creditors, you commit some portion of your future earnings over the next 3-5 years to repaying creditors.  What portion of your future earnings is committed to your Ch 13 repayment plan depends on many specifics of your case.  A bankruptcy attorney can give you a good idea of what your monthly payment would probably be after sitting down with you and reviewing your debts, earnings, and ongoing living expenses.    Filing either Ch 13 or Ch 7 will immediately stop all garnishments.  You also may, in some circumstances, be able to recover recently garnished wages if your creditor has garnished more than $600 in the 90 days immediately preceeding bankruptcy.    As soon as you file bankruptcy, your creditors are prohibited from contacting you to try to collect debts.  Basically, the bankruptcy court puts a halt to all collection activities while your finances are sorted out.  This lasts for the entire time you are in bankruptcy, which is typically 5-6 months for Ch 7 and 3-5 years for Ch 13.  At the end of your bankruptcy (either Chapter), any dischargeable debts you still owe will be discharged, meaning you no longer owe them, and former creditors are prohibited from trying to get you to repay them once they have been discharged.    Some debts cannot be discharged, notably: child support obligations, student loans, recent taxes (though older back taxes may be able to be discharged) and criminal penalties imposed as a result of having been found guilty of certain crimes including drunk driving.  But even if some of your debts cannot be discharged, often it is more possible to make payments on those debts after you no longer owe other dischargeable debts.    If you are in debt over your head, make an appointment with a bankruptcy attorney to sit down and discuss your situation.  Most bankruptcy attorneys offer one free or very low cost appointment to meet with you and discuss your financial situation.

4f3GfrN6aa	Lenders will look at your debt to income ratio, and they will not like an outstanding debt.  So clear the debt.    Put off buying a house until you are debt free and have at leat 20% saved for a house deposit.  If you can't do that, you can't really afford a house.  A house is a huge expense and not something to be entered on a whim.    You will need at least 20% deposit so that you don't pay mortgage insurance, which is an extra expense that you get charged to cover the fact that you are a risk to the bank.  It doesn't go towards your loan.  It just goes to an insurance company, so that the bank will take your loan.  It doesn't protect you, only the bank.  So save a big deposit so you don't have to waste even more money.    Clear the debt first.  Then save a house deposit.  Then buy a house.  Don't try to do it all too soon, because you run the risk of getting rejected for a loan (which will make it even harder to get a loan in future, because it goes on your record).  Also, the more debt you have, the easier it is for some minor blip, like an illness, or job loss, to completely ruin your life.  You need to be prepared to have a mortgage, with at least 3 months repayments stashed away to cover you for an emergency.  Don't buy a house until you can actually afford to.  Right now, you can't.  If you try, and something goes wrong, you lose the house.  Don't take the risk.    Best wishes|`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	It is better to PAY OFF debt before thinking about buying a home.    Side Note: If you are getting a big refund, you are having too much withheld.

DAMZKbpDaa	In married filing jointly, you pool you and your spouse's income and expenses, use the joint filing tables and get a joint refund or liability.    Pros: usually ends up with the least tax/most refund.  Cons: both parties are equally liable for the tax.    In married filing separately, you file your own income and expenses, and your spouse does the same on their own form (2 forms).

mwkfirjRaa	There is nothing wrong with the logic, as far as I can tell.  Here is my advice, since you asked, LOL!    Consider taking a somewhat different approach.  Get the 30 year mortgage to keep your payments low in case one of you gets laid off, becomes sick or disabled, or passes away.  (Hopefully, none of those things will happen!)    But, instead of making extra principal payments, put the $500 per month in a federally-insured money market, savings or certificate account earning as close to 5% APY as you can find.  Banks need money right now, and people are afraid to deposit, so they are paying premium rates for deposits.  If you do some shopping around, you should be able to find a rate close to 5% APY.    In 15 years, you will have enough money to pay off the mortgage if you want to.  In the meantime, if you have any kind of financial setback, you have cash in the bank to cover it.  15 years is a long time, and something could happen in that span of time.  If you have a pile of cash available to you, you don't have to worry about losing your home.    Extra payments you make to the mortgage increase your equity, but that is money you can't get back if you need it.  If you lose your job, or your wife loses her job, no lender is likely to give you a home equity loan.|`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	If you take a 30 year mortgage, and make payments that would have been required for a 15 year mortgage, and all other terms are the same, it will be paid off in 15 years and the total interest will be the same as the 15 year loan.    That said, if you are worried about losing a job, you shouldn't buy ANYTHING you can't comfortably afford without the job.

bru2xnlRaa	Any work you do and earn money is a JOB.   Your options are limited. Most businesses want you to be 16 to hire you for gainful employment.     Time to be inventive,   My suggestions to you:    Make up fliers and pass them around in your neighborhood.   Offer to do whatever work it is you want to do, such as :    Computer work, Babysit, Clean Garages, Organize Cupboards, File Papers, Wash Cars, Mow Lawns, Pull Weeds, Tutor the neighbors kids, wash Dogs, Dog sit, Clean the Pool, Assist the elderly, whatever...       Post first whatever it is you want to do or are good at ...  However, You should keep your options open and make a decision after the persons call you instead of not giving them many reasons to call.     Say you are a student and available to work on weekends|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.

4VsUKjQGaa	You are referring to the earned income tax credit.  It was designed to assist working folks who have children and don't make much money.  The exact amounts depend on your filing status and the number of children you have (one or two, extra don't count).   For a married couple with two kids, the credit starts small (if you make 0 - $50) and goes up to about $4,824 if you make between about $12,000 - $18,000 then it starts to go down and gets back to zero if you make over about $41,000.  Those numbers are slightly different if you're filing single or head-of-household.  There are several rules that you have to meet: both you and the children must have social security numbers, they must be related to you in very specific ways--essentially your children, grandchildren or nieces or nephews; they must be under 19 years old (or in school), and they must live with you more than half the year.  Only one taxpayer can claim each child.    If you have no children there is a much smaller EIC if your income is under about $12,000 and you're between 25-65 years old.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	I think you are confused.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	i haven't heard that rumor as of yet,but i know i may hear it soon if you heard right,but i doubt that very much.    yes,that's for someone who has 2 dependents and made less than 42,000 and files HOH or married/joint they get the EIC then.|`|znr8SBiWaa	Those who qualify for the Earned Income Credit could get UP TO $4,700, but it depends on your marital status, your income, and your dependents|`|nqbcJjHyaa	Jessica, I don't know what you are drinking but it has confused you.

K45ZTwryaa	In the United States, the terms paralegal and legal assistant are, for the most part, interchangeable in the law community although legal assistant is somewhat of an antiquated term and I have not seen anyone hold themselves out as a legal assistant on the resumes I have reviewed over the past half decade.  Professional degrees bear the title "paralegal" not "legal assistant" but there is no requirement to have a paralegal degree to work as a paralegal so I am going to collectively refer to the two as "paralegals".  Paralegals assist attorneys in the preparation and organization of legal documents and have basic familiarity with the laws in their practice area to assist them with such documentation.  The depth and breadth of knowledge that a paralegal has of the law varies with the experience of the paralegal and the amount of responsibility that the attorney(s) is willing to delegate to them, but many senior paralegals have a knowledge and understanding of their relative field of law that exceeds that of junior attorneys.  The professional rules guiding the practice of law however require that paralegals must work under the supervision of attorneys as paralegals are not licensed to practice law.    Legal secretaries are secretaries that have enough familiarity with the legal documents to assist attorneys in organizing and keeping their files.  More experienced or capable legal secretaries will sometimes have responsibilites common to those of a paralegal, but generally speaking it is not a requirment for the job.  Although shorthand is a dying skill among secretaries, there are specific legal shorthand symbols that a legal secretary with shorthand skill might know.|`|lRhL5Ec6aa	Usually Paralegals have training in the field, and sometimes even a certificate.  Their role is a lot like a lawyer's role in the sense of writing briefs, researching, writing memos, etc.  They know a lot about the law, but they don't have a license to practice, so they can't sign any legal documents like lawyers can.  Legal secretaries are like any other secretary except they are familiar with legal terms, deadlines, and client confidentiality issues.  Legal assistants are often law students who are interning or training to be a lawyer (or sometimes training to become a paralegal).  Their role varies tremendously with the firm they work for.  It can be more similar to that of the lawyer, paralegal or legal secretary.  A lot of times they research, but some unfortunate souls get stuck in law firms that make they do mundane work, like answering phones or getting coffee.

6ME4BXd7aa	The simple answer is: it doesn't really matter. One of my paralegal friends was an art history major. What's more important is being smart, ambitious and professional. Good grammar and writing skills are very important, and they'll look at that even when hiring for paralegal positions that don't actually involve a lot of writing. Thus a degree in English might be helpful, but almost any of the liberal arts (and probably most social sciences as well) will involve developing your writing skills.    On the other hand, a major in criminal justice - especially at a school with a reputable CJ program - can open a lot of doors for you. I know several paralegals who applied for permanent positions at the places where they interned while they were in school. And since their employers already knew their skills and capabilities, they were hired. So if you live in an area where there is a lot of competition for paralegal jobs, a CJ degree can help you get your foot in the door - just make sure you take advantage of any internship and/or networking opportunities BEFORE you graduate.    But all of that relates to the short-term. You should consider whether you want to work as a paralegal for the rest of your life. If not, what field of study would you be interested in?  Take that into consideration. And if you really have no idea, then I'd recommend the English degree, which will be useful whether you decide to stay a paralegal, move into the business world, or go to law school... or almost anything else.|`|f9crUDTwaa	Call a local law office and ask them for advice .|`|LimJh9Laaa	You can have a BA in any area, but something like English will be better than Physics. :) However, what is most important is experience. Where I live, you cannot get hired without at least 2 years. Even if you have a formal education! I live near several major cities and very few ads want BAs. They want experience and now, more are asking for a formal, ABA-approved education. The approval is very important! I think a BA will set you apart, but it will not be a deciding factor.    I was enrolled in an approved paralegal program,  but I left it. Why? I was advised to find an entry-level job to get experience. Apparently, the fact that I have a BA made me overqualified and also, I lost out on a couple of jobs to people with experience (entry jobs). I was told that without experience, no firm will hire. There were 5 paras in my class, all got their jobs through experience. None had a degree, but they were getting it so they could move on to other jobs. There were several of us with BAs and none of us could find work.    If I were you, I would find an entry-level job now. Continue going to school. Get your experience. Then, try to get a job as a paralegal. If you do, then decide about school. I honestly do not think you will need a BA for all jobs; however, you really should make sure your school's program is ABA-approved. Without an approved school, you will be limited in what jobs you can get. If you decide you like the field, get the BA IF you feel you need it. I would not go for a BA in Paralegal because that is so specific that if you decide to switch fields, it will be more difficult.
kwYxQp0Maa	It has nothing to do with you credit score and if you already paid them off you can't probably pay to get them changed.  If the accounts weren't paid off you could negotiate to have the accounts cleared from you credit report.  Since they are paid up, if you still have a relationship with the creditor they may take the charge off, off you report, It is totally up to the creditor.  If they want to keep your business they may do it, since it doesn't really mean anything to them to change it.|`|1P3usILUaa	If you have made well with all of the liabilities you can write letters to the places that had charges on your credit score to please remove their postings.  Which normally happens in the regular course of events ~ however, they tend to take their time in this.    Things will come together eventually.  Watch your credit score and check in with it at least once a year and now that you know what happened live within means for the future and all will work out well.|`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	I want them to make it back to normal since it was all sorta out of my control.    It was NOT out of your control.  YOU spent money you didn't have, and it bit you in the ***.  You CAN'T erase the charge offs from your credit file.  Until you establish a PATTERN of paying your debts, no REASONABLE bank will give you credit.

Unless you share your ID and passcode, no one can access your account information online.    It is extremely important that you treat your online passcode with the same level of protection as you treat your ATM PIN. Do not share your passcode with anyone unless you want them to have access to your accounts. Memorize your passcode; do not write it down.

AA11284831	In about 12 to 18 months he'll get a bill from the IRS for about $3,650 for the taxes that he actually owes plus the non-existent withholding.  Tack on about an additional $1,000 or so for penalties and interest for late payment.  The IRS may tack on another 20% if they want to play hardball on this one.    If he amends his return by April 15th and pays the $3,650 that should end the issue.  If he doesn't, it's time to drop this dishonest loser.|`|f5f29f78cbffd9771950da5ad0141cafaa	Your boyfriend should file his return. He needs to ask his payer to issue a 1099 misc so he can file his taxes properly. Also, tell your bf to claim any expenses related to his job in order to reduce the amount of taxes he has to pay. He can make a payment arrangement with IRS if he has to pay a large amount in taxes.|`|mwkfirjRaa	The IRS will figure out that there was no withholding.  All of that information gets cross-referenced to his Social Security number.    Within approximately 2-3 years, your boyfriend will get a letter from the IRS notifying him that he owes back taxes and penalties.  The IRS will have received no corresponding payment from the firm as withholding.    Your boyfriend needs to report the income he received as an independent contractor on a Schedule C.  He also has to file a Schedule SE to calculate and pay his self employment tax (which is basically his Social Security tax.).
0uWqjL2raa	you can not claim alimony unless it is clearly stated in your divorce papers. The IRS does not look at it as alomony even if you are helping her out.           IRS TAX TIP 2008-32    If you were recently divorced and are paying or receiving alimony under a divorce decree or agreement, you need to consider the tax implication for your 2007 federal income tax return.    Here are the general guidelines:    Alimony payments received from your spouse or former spouse are taxable to you in the year you receive them. Because no taxes are withheld from alimony payments, you may need to make estimated tax payments or increase the amount withheld from your paycheck.    Alimony payments you make under a divorce or separation instrument are deductible if certain requirements are met. Any payments not required by such a decree or agreement do not qualify as deductible alimony payments.    Child support you pay is never deductible. Child support you receive is not taxable.    If you paid or received alimony you must use Form 1040. You cannot use Form 1040A or Form 1040EZ. If you received alimony, you must give the person who paid the alimony your social security number or you may have to pay a $50 penalty.    For more information, including rules for divorces and separations before 1985, get Publication 504, Divorced or Separated Individuals, available on the IRS Web site at IRS.gov or by calling 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676            Christine EA Master Tax Adviser  Check out my profile    This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as sit applies to the facts that you have provided.|`|AA11284831	Voluntary payments are not alimony.  This is classified as a gift.  If you gave her more than $12k in 2008 (rises to $13k in 2009) you will have to file a Gift Tax return.  She does not pay tax on it since the recipient of a gift never pays tax on gifts received.
y4SUDnpaaa	If you don't report it as fraud you will be liable for all the purchase/cash withdrawals on the card. You said you it is already $200 in arrears and in collections. That means it   has probably been been cancelled by the credit card company. I can't find any logic in doing what you are suggesting. Report the fraud to the credit card company and the three credit depositories before things get worse.|`|0d48b95c977a1e94afbc64b60d0d2d75aa	If it's fraud, you do not have to pay it. Just dispute it. If you have $500 in a savings account, you can convert it into a secured credit card. Most banks can set it up for you. Also make sure they belong to the credit bureau.
