LEypSiRpaa	The crest white strips work great! But they'll make your teeth sensitive. The strips will actually cause you to lose tooth enamel. And once your enamel is gone, you don't get it back. I would suggest using Arm & Hammer's whitening booster.

This is a transparent color that you can use to either enhance your natural color or change it slightly. It will give you more depth and dimension to your color without it being a drastic thing.

WO68RZdIaa	I had always assumed it was an American thing with the start of sleeveless dresses in the early 20th century. But after finding this information online, it seems to have began long before America.<br>  <br>  Text provided by the website 4to40.com<br>  <a href="http://www.4to40.com/Health/index.asp?id=19" rel="nofollow">http://www.4to40.com/Health/index.asp?id...</a><br>  <br>  The recorded history of armpit shaving is a spotty one indeed. The earliest reference we have found was that the ancient Babylonians, more than one thousand years before the birth of Christ, developed depilatories to remove unwanted body hairs.<br>  <br>  Julius Caesar reported that early Britons "had long flowing hairs and shaved every part of their bodies except the head and upper lip", but this quotation may refer only to men. We do know that barbers removed superfluous hair from the eyebrows, nostrils, arms, and legs from male customers around this time.<br>  <br>  The first direct reference to the specific topic at hand is contained in Ovid's Art of Love, written just before the birth of Christ: "Shall I warn you to keep the rank goat out of your armpits? Warn you to keep your legs free of coarse bristling hair?"<br>  <br>  In Chaucer's day (the fourteenth century), the mere sight of any hair was considered erotic. Women were required to wear head coverings; caps were worn indoors and out by woman of all ages.<br>  <br>  These ancient antecedents predict our current duality about body hair on women. On the one hand, underarm hair is considered unsightly and unhygienic, and yet on the other, sexy and natural.<br>  <br>  None of many razor companies or cosmetic historians we contacted could pinpoint when woman first started shaving their armpits. The earliest reports concerned prostitutes during the gold rush days in California. Terri Tongco, among other readers, posited the theory that prostitutes shaved their underarms to prove that they have no body lice, which were rampant in the old West.<br>  <br>  Many older readers able to pinpoint when their mothers and grandmothers started shaving their armpits. Not-so-old historian C.F. "Charley" Eckhardt of Seguin, Texas, is the only person we have found who was actually studied this Frustable:<br>  <br>  My paternal grandmother, born in 1873, and my maternal grandmother, born in 1882, did not shave their armpits. My wife's maternal grandmother (1898), my mother (1914), and my mother-in-law (1921) all did or do.<br>  <br>  Eadweard Muybridge's photographic studies of the nude human figure in motion and Hillaire Belloc's photographs of New Orleans prostitutes, all taken before or immediately after the turn of the century, show hairy armpits, as do nude photos of prostitutes known to have been taken in El Paso, Texas, prior to 1915. In addition, still photographs taken from pornographic photographs of the "French postcard" variety which are documented as having been made in the United States prior to 1915.<br>  <br>  Theatrical motion pictures released about and after 1915, including Cleopatra (starring Theda Bara), the biblical sequences from D.W. Griffith's Intolerance, and several others, shown shaven armpits. Something, then, happened about 1915 that would cause not merely stars but impressionable teenagers (as my wife's grandfather was) but not necessarily older family woman (like my grandmothers) to start shaving their armpits.<br>  <br>  So what caused these women to start shaving their armpits around 1915? Many readers, including Charley Eckhardt, give the "credit" to Mack Sennett:<br>  <br>  The first moviemaker to show the feminine armpit extensively in non-pornographic films was Mack Sennett, in his Bathing Beauty shorts… Sennett's Bathing Beauties had shaven armpits, and they are the first direct evidence we have of the armpit-shaving phenomemon. Whether or not Mack actually said "That look like hell - have 'em shave' is a moot point, though the statement is completely in character with what we know about Sennett.<br>  <br>  We do know that flappers of the Roaring Twenties adopted the leeveless clothing that seemed o daring in the Sennett shorts.<br>  <br>  We heard from several women who were more concerned about why the custom persists rather than how and when it started. Typical was this letter from Kathy Johnson of Madison, Wisconsin:<br>  <br>  I am one of the apparently few U.S. women who has never shaved her armpits or legs. It never made logical sense to me, so why do it? I've heard the argument that shaving those regions is more sanitary. Then why, I volley back, don't men shave their armpits? Why, in fact, doesn't everyone shave their heads if lack of hair is so sanitary? Stunned silence…<br>  <br>  Several psychologists and feminists have speculated that men like the shaven look because it makes women look prepubescent - young, innocent, and unthreatening. Diana Grunig Catalan of Rangely, Colorado, who subscribes to the prepubescent theory, speculate that "American woman, unlike their European counterparts, were not supposed to do anything with all those men they attracted with their revealing clothing. A childlike, helpless look can be a protection as well as an attraction"

TCpTlCTRaa	It's nice that you're being so sensitive as this is a very touchy subject for many women, causing feelings of shame. If her hair hair is becoming thinner in certain areas without excessive shedding she may have androgenetic alopecia. If she has excessive shedding from all over her scalp she may have diffuse hair loss. There are many possible causes of diffuse hair loss including illness so it is important to determine the type and cause of her hair loss. Most female hair loss including androgenetic can be improved. Aromatherapy scalp massage formulas are an excellent remedy for female hair loss. It would probably help her to know that she is not alone. Female hair loss is a widespread problem.|`|SNC58uQvaa	I would go to a doctor A.S.A.P and see if there is something that she could take to help her with her problem.|`|AA11729534	Woman can lose their hair naturally like men do - but most of the time for woman it's due to a hormonal change or damaging the roots of her hair from over use of certain hair products or styling tools.<br>  If you approach her and let her know that you have heard with woman it can be a medical indication that she has a hormone imbalance - she may then see her doctor.  Good luck.|`|9zHKn4Bdaa	Well, like you said, it is VERY hard for women to have hair loss of any kind. Has she every tried using Nioxin products?

Try those and see what happens.|`|Q49EEdzbaa	Tke her out more often on the town where she can actually let her down(that is a figure of speech)from whatever is bothering her. concentrate on  by keeping her mind off of it by doing extra chores around the house that she would normally do take some of the agonizing pressure off her. Give her a spa treatment by putting her feet up massaging them  and a body massage too!|`|pC0YnSFIaa	The same hair restoration products used for men (rogaine) can be used for women as well. Let your wife know that multivitamins aid in hair growth as well (due to biotin) which can also be found in foods high in iron.<br>  Good Luck!|`|AA12096608	Depending on how badly she is loosing her hair or what the doc says about her condition It might be from stress or it can be from lack of vitamins in her diet! Also happens during medical situations. Best thing for a hubby to do is never bring it up and make her feel special at all times to take her mind off the fact that she has the issue in the first place. Another solution is to let her (if she hasn't yet) use the wonderful product line of Nioxin and it helps allot. you can look into for your own research before telling her. there are many varieties to the line from vitamins to scalp therapy, and they have this at many simple hair salons.  Good luck!|`|UvLNxiuyaa	tell hair to Use thickening cleansing agents. <br>  There are many shampoos and conditioners on the market that are geared towards helping an individual thicken her hair and stop hair loss.

You probably won't even feel it after the jewelery is in.<br>  <br>  However, please, PLEASE do not go to Claire's, Piercing Pagoda, Wal-Mart, or any other place that uses a piercing gun. Go to an actual piercing studio. The price will be about the same, and it's a lot safer. Piercing guns cannot be sterilized, and it is virtually impossible to get two symmetrical piercings with a gun. Guns also pierce with the jewlery (which is blunt) rather than a needle, causing a lot of unnecessary pain and tissue trauma.<br>  <br>  I realize that plenty of people get pierced with guns successfully with no trouble afterwards, butt here are also plenty of people that end up with painful, crooked, infected piercings from guns.|`|U56SKlloaa	I was 6 when I had my first piercing done and that didn't hurt (bearing in mind I was the biggest wimp in Britain!)

N3V4ZZI6aa	Hopefully this helps ! (:       MAKE-UP !!       1. Miley Cyrus keeps her skin clean and moisturized. She uses Dove products for her skin. So after you wash your face, put on a light weight concealer.     2. Apply a light pink rose colored blush to the apples of your cheeks.     3. Line the tops of your eyes with black liquid eyeliner in a thin straight line, winging it out at the edges a bit.     4. Take a pencil eyeliner and line the bottom of your eyes, going only halfway.     5. Miley Cyrus varies with her eyeshadow. She wears alot of neutral shades, for example white, brown, and creme. Sometimes she takes a black eyeshadow and and dabs a bit on at the very end of the eyes and smudges to make her eyes look bigger and longer.     6. Mascara on top and bottom lashes.     7. Dust your face with a translucent powder and put on some pink or clear lipgloss and your ready to go!(Miley doesn't always wear lots of makeup, on some days she walks out the door with just mascara and lipgloss, maybe a small amount of eyeliner.)      HAIR !!    Cut hair into long layers. Style into loose waves for the edgy rocker look. This look is achieved by applying volumizing mousse to hair. Blow-dry with a round brush and finish with large hot rollers and a larger barrel curling iron. Finish with hairspray to help hold the style in place.    CLOTHES !!    Look like Miley Cyrus by wearing fun summer dresses paired with cowboy boots. Miley is often seen in jeans and a fun shirt. Try well-fitting jeans, a sparkly top, chunky jewelry and a fun boot or heel. Achieve Miley's style by shopping at Abercrombie, Forever 21, Revolve Clothing or Delia's.|`|u6HndVxaaa	idk why would you want to look like her shes grotesque, seriously! stick your face in blender maybe that would help|`|M3CsxF2jaa	look at her shows dress like her and try to get her weight. go online and do research|`|RbsV1JvSaa	uhhh face transplant? plastic surgery? i dunno how else u can actually LOOK LIKE her.|`|mgM1Ot3Oaa	why would you want to look like her. just be yourself and quit trying to look like ppl|`|7nrhPCf0aa	dress like a slut and get your hair cut & colored like hers|`|Vg43CvEPaa	You are not Miley Cyrus, are you ?

DEGClROKaa	Its expensive but if you straighten it everyday you should definitely get it. You do know its permanent until the hair grows out right? But it will definitely give you more freedom if you get it done. Example more time (takes me 1 hour to straighten my hair), you can just wash your hair and let it air dry and it will be straight. Not worry during the summer if you go for a swim and end up w/ a rats nest on your head.. heh happens to me.. hate it!|`|fV9pB1ttaa	NEVER straighten your hair every day, as it will damage your roots, and that may lead to hair loss. you should really straighten your hair about 3 times a week. heat causes a lot of problem. my hair is naturally curlyish too, but instead of straightening it, I come up with some of my own styles even though i have medium length too. Use plenty of shampoo and conditioner to make your hair nice and soft, and just be careful. Treat your hair a bit before going for the japanesed straightened style. Hope i helped xx
D0Dwnkuhaa	The best way to get rid of them is over time by blotting your face with oil blotting tissues (I use clean and clear) and I heard a method that works is to boil some water, dump it in the sink (with the plug in) and hang a towel over your head and let the steam open your pores and squeeze the blackheads. If you're just gonna plain old squeeze 'em, squeeze them when they're little or else they'll scar and leave craters.

You definitely don't want to damage your hair or fry it <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|AA12096608	if your just trying to cover grays then option number two would be best so you don't make the same mistake twice and also when you start dyeing again try to get the parts that you missed first and let sit for a little more than half of the time process, then take the rest and just run it through all over to blend better. don't go to the salon unless you want to pay an arm & leg for the whole process trust me I'm a stylist and stylist love mistakes like those even though they know there isn't any great solutions they just know it's easy profit no matter what! your hair should be alright as long as you don't over process by leaving it in too long...past the process time on the directions. good luck missy|`|CiKvGL0Saa	go to a salon and have them dye your hair.

bkcvS8L2aa	well i can only say this from watching my brothers grow their hair out. they have wavy-type hair too. and in the beginning it was crazy! all of them grew out their hair and the beginnings are the toughest parts. your hair is used to being cut so it will take some time before you can actually have a style you are happy with.<br>  however, you can do things to tame it depending on what type of hair you have. you can get hair glue and spike it, you can get curling gel to anhance the curls more (i had one brother do this and it looked cool), or get some straitening stuff to make it straighter. bottom line is that your hair will "get used to" being longer and with the weight, should get a little better to manage.|`|lCftCyujaa	not to worry :)<br>  <br>  umm you can thin it out, and straighten it...<br>  if you straighten it make sure to buy silk drops... it helps your hair not to get split ends :)|`|2wRWkjIlaa	if you mean it's just like coming out and sort of flipping up a little at the sides DONT WORRY THATS HOT<br>  if you don't like it though, just go to like Target or something and buy yourself a straightener.<br>  You could also blowdry it if you want... it's a lot harder then straightening though <br>  <br>  <br>  Answer mine?<br>  Pleaseandthanks<3<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219173251AABdOXy&cp=2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|fV9pB1ttaa	If you like the look, keep it, but trim it once and a while. it would make your hair look more neater, and try to brush it every day. to style it, see if you can make some of your own styles using gel, or just ask a hairdresser to style it for you. for your type of hair, try and go for a side fringe if you have one and see what you think!!

If not, talk to your parents and tell them, you will do things around the house for like 10 dollars a week. If that doesn't work, you can get a job also. If your too young, then have a bunch of your friends over, and tell them to all bring clothes they don't really want anymore, and you all can trade around. You take 2 shirts from each friend, you will have enough to last a little while. If you can't do that, your just going to have to wait.     My mom decided when i was 13 she wasn't going to buy me clothes anymore at all. She gives me 10 dollars a week, and i can do anything i want with it.

Here's two... first one which you will probably not like is to make flyer's and try being a babysitter for some quick extra cash... If you don't not want to do that or your  mom wont allow you here's another idea, put your clothes together in a new way! I do this ALL the time, grab an old tee shirt and pair it with a cute vest or jacket, no one will see the front and the wont now its old! Or just take the cute dress you wear with flats and tie it back so it now looks cute with skinny Jeans and a pair of boots! Grab an old pair of jeans and sew them into a new cute pair of " This seasons Abercombie shorts" ( For summer!) and pair them with a cute cami, or use and old headband and wrap it around your waist like a belt! Hope this has helped
A7ovwP94aa	Its all about trial and error there are some drigstore mascaras that are not that good but the same can be said about high end. Although I am a fan of Lancome.    Just try a popular drugstore brand then go back to your fave and then a drugstore one and so forth. Until you acquire a list of fave drugstore mascara's that you find better than your fave.    I love Loreal Telescopic for length, but if you already have length you need to look for volume. Some of the  popular ones at the moment are;    Covergirl Lash Blast  Maybelline Colossall  Clinique Long Pretty  Rimmel Glam Eyes  Collection 2000 Magi Lash    A lot of people like Maybelline Define a Lash but Loreal Telescopic is a better version of that mascara in my opinion. Maybelline great lash is also a favourite - I find it just ok as I have really short sparse lashes so it does not do much for me.|`|N5qx5NUvaa	I definitely get better with the loreal mascaras. I haven't used many sephora mascaras, but I used some MAC ones and they tend to be runny/wattery and have no effect.|`|szR20p73aa	Some drugstore mascaras are ALMOST as good as Sephora mascaras.     I have both the Dior mascara (top seller in sephora) and Cover Girl Lash Blast mascara (top seller also). I find that the Lash Blast is better than the dior one, because it gives me more volume and thickness, whereas the Dior one just lengthens my eyelashes and I already have long lashes.     I would definitely recommend the Cover Girl Lash Blast mascara because it is by far the best and most popular drugstore mascara.|`|0wcF5Sixaa	honestly i dont think its where u get your make up from or wat name brand it is that matters i personally think its the artist that makes a differance i buy make up from all over and have NEVER had a problem wit any of it i have even tried stuff from dollar stores u just gotta know what you doin i think.|`|FklngtvCaa	sometimes yes, sometimes no.  some expensive mascaras can just be  marketed well and sold for a higher price,  when really they're awful quality and can  be made cheaply.    some cheap mascaras are just 'good finds'  and work really well.    drugstore mascara to try:  - l'oreal lash out  - covergirl professional  - rimmel extra super lash    sephora mascara to try:  - clinique high impact  - kiss me|`|MElM0XDCaa	Go with Cover Girl!  It's just as pretty and as functional as Sephora's mascara, plus it's way cheaper.  Cover Girl is usually the first brand to introduce the latest trends in mascara, even before the pricey brands.  With CG, i'd recommend you try Lash Blast or Lash Blast Luxe.  Both mascaras thicken and lengthen, giving you a false eyelash effect.  Then there's CG eyebrights, wich come in four different colors that accent blue, green, brown and hazel eyes (just look for the tube that is meant to accentuate your eye color)    As for Maybelline, you absolutely must go with GreatLash, in the pink and green tube.  This stuff has been a staple in the beauty world for almost 40(!) years (it debuted in 1971).  It has tiny flecks of blue shimmer in the mascara, which can really make your eyes pop.    Bottom line, go with the drugstore brands.  Hope this helps|`|JqDkLWeTaa	define-a-lash works just as good|`|4oWcXL5vaa	Its the same thing!  You dont need to pay hundreds of dollars, the formula is basically the same a sa $6 one.
lU8e0VQFaa	Microdermals are more likely to heal in a hip piercing but they can still reject, ANY piercing can reject, even if pierced properly and with the correct jewelry. Microdermals are just a different way of doing a hip piercing (I suppose by "normal" you mean using surface bars). Most hip piercings reject, it's just a very hard place to pierce, it's high movement, high impact. They CAN permanently heal, however, this takes a lot of vigilance and a little luck. I would say, hope for the best but expect to need it removed at some point.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	microdermals are meant to be permanent. it it is a loop that goes into your skin and and then theres a ball at the top. when it heals it is embedded into your skin. you will need it cut out to be removed. google microdermal hip peircing and dont believe everything you hear.|`|FOeeAiQ0aa	Haha! asking some more?  Corset piercings are the ones that aren't permanent. Microdermals are permanent(unless you want them removed)... and they are the only way you can pierce your hips really(if you were to get a regular hoop your pant waist would irritate or rip them out).
xT024KMsaa	I usually tip any service (food, nails, hair, etc) 15% for normal service. Less is service was poor, and a bit more if it was particularly awesome.|`|TsmqhvZHaa	18-20% is fair. Remember, they have to pay taxes on the service and it is usually more that 10%.

f3vbrZdfaa	Some factors cause dark circles around eyes, such as heredity, lack of sleep, bone structure, sun exposure, medication, nutrition, hormonal changes in women.    Combat dark eye circles:    1. Drink nearly 10 glasses of water everyday  2. Ensure that you get good rest and adequate sleep  3. Eat vegetables and fruits rich in vitamin A.  4. Consume a nutritionally balanced diet  5. Apply slices of raw potato or cucumber over the eyelids for about 15 minutes.  6. Use topical creams that have Vitamin K derivatives.  7. Do facial exercises  You can find some facial exercises at:    http://www.danidaily.com/health-and-fitn...|`|d8jH5lU1aa	Just cut a cucumber ( in a round shape) and place it in you eyes this will really help=]|`|wJuOZA3kaa	Try using tea bags.

P9dEdEDQaa	First of all... to the idiots that said to use hydrogen peroxide... don't listen to them, they obviously don't have piercings. Secondly- to the idiot that said peroxide kills nerves, he/she is just retarded.   Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizer which is why it bubbles when put on a wound. The point of peroxide is to essentially "heal" a wound by removing the bacteria and foreign object(s) that are in the wound and taking the oxygen away. This is obviously a problem with piercings because your new jewelry IS  a foreign object. Using peroxide could cause your piercing to migrate or even worse, reject.   Your piercing at the moment will indeed be sore and possibly infected, however, you do NOT need to take your piercing out just yet. Make sure you clean it with soap and water and RINSE THOROUGHLY. Using sea salt is fine also.. you can apply it with a q-tip to make it easier and to make sure nothing gets caught on it. If however the infection gets worse, immediately take the piercing out and clean the wound 3 times or more daily or seek medical attention if it persists.|`|IMOKF6alaa	Hydrogen Peroxide will kill nerves and damage it more. Use a sea salt water soak. it helps a lot. And do not use alcohol. Use about spoon full of sea salt and mix it with warm water and use a cotton ball. Dip the cotton ball in the mix and hold it on your ear. Do this until it get better also you can get H2Ocean at hot topic it helps too! I hope this helps!|`|SS87lbOCaa	clean it or take it out|`|FOeeAiQ0aa	Ouch... that has happened too me.  I would clean it with hydrogen poracside and pray for the best. Try not to sleep on it for awhile too.  Good luck!|`|AA10626996	yeah , take the piercing out NOW.....     Not to sound mean but if you are going to pierce yourself, make sure you take care of it too.     Use peroxide instead of whatever it is your using. peroxide will bubble up and clean an infection.   Grocery store .. cost pennies.   if you already have a yellowish funk , you have an infection.   Hope I could help

Skipping sizes can cause your ears to bleed, which means you open yourself to infection.  It can cause scar tissue to form, which will hinder or even prevent future stretches  It will make your lobe look like a cats rear end  You can even split your lobe in half.

ai8mtuS6aa	if you want a high and tight then get a high and tight.  it's pretty much in a class of it's own.  if you're looking for a military hair cut that is high but not quite so high and tight, it's what we call a high reg (when getting it cut around a Marine Corps town).  walk into a barber (not a stylist or beauty shop) shop and tell them that you want a high fade.  from skin tight on the sides fading into the top as it is or just with a little bit off the top.  explain it just as i've done for you.  tell them you want it in the ballpark of a high and tight but not so high and not so tight.  the high and tight has a very distinct look to it and i would suggest the  hi fade over the high and tight any day.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	High and Tight is a hairstyle for Soldiers and Marines.

5PBK1Nc6aa	foundation- (i use everyday) lasts about 5-8 months- it really depends.   pigment- i have Vanilla pigment that i use A LOT and i think it could last me another 50 years.     eyeshadow- usually 3 years. the first mac shadow i got actually lasted me around a year- because i used it almost every day.     lipstick- around a year.     and for mac brushes; 239|`|zhzJoZ26aa	One of my favourite brands is MAC, personally I'd skip on their lipglosses, unless you get dazzleglasses, those are personally worth it all the other glosses, only last about 3-6 weeks if you wear it everyday. Now the pigments, they last FOREVER. I've had a few over a year and it's not even near 1/4th done. Their eyeshadows last a good while, but their are better shadows then those ones. Now I love their lipsticks, LOVE. Invest in those, they last a long time. Foundation if you want to spend the money, go ahead it's worth it, but revlon color stay is just as good as studio fix fluid. Fix+ is a must in every MAC collection, you can use it on your hair, face, makeup, clothes.|`|WLZFuBVBaa	My mac eyeshadow last  for 1 1/2 year. lipstick for 1 year. mascara for 6 months foundation for 1 year. mac brush  217 or 224 eyeshadow brush eyeshadow application/blending. 187 for foundation powder or liquid|`|PoOhPuE3aa	Pigments and Eyeshadows last years if they are taken care of, some of my MAC shadows and pigments are from 3 years ago, and still work the same. Lipsticks should be good until they start to smell funky, then they are over do. As for foundation if it starts to look bad, its bad.    The Mac Brush I'd reccomend for face is 187, its good fro applying foundation, blush, powders, bronzers, everything, it's an all in one brush.    As for the eyes a 239 because it's good for everything on your eyes, it good for applying lid color, crease color, high light color, and it's also good fro smudging eyeliner for a smokey eye.    Hope this helps!|`|G2VS9o2raa	they last a long time!  i bought a mac lipstick n blush around 4-5 months ago, and it looks like ive hardly used it  its definately worth it|`|QGU7JAIUaa	You shoulddd!    Ive had my products for ages and there's still most of it left. If you get some of MAC's pigment you wont need to buy another one of that colour ever. Whenever i use quite a bit of it it never seems to go down. Its like a magic pot. I use MAC products mostly every day and they've lasted me a long time. If i had to reccomend one MAC brush i think it would probobly be the 188 brush. I sometimes use it to apply foundation and its good for applying powders such as bronzer, pigment ect.  I would definatley reccomend getting some MAC products. Their really good value for money and i adore their products. Once you've turned to MAC you cant go back !    (:|`|TRM8tJ7laa	The prices aren't too bad for what your getting, the eyeshadow lasts me about 6-8months, the lipgloss about 6 months. And my favorite mac brush would be 222.
505kdpepaa	I have a huge makeup collection and a huge portion of it is M.A.C so I'm trying to think of the things that I haven't found dupes for, things that nobody does better, and things that suit every skin because I have no idea what you look like :o) You can use the website as a guide for colours, but of course the swatches aren't perfect. I'm avoiding anything from the limited collections as a lot of what I love were only limited. There are some lovely shadows in the current Chill collection so they may be worth a glace too. I also notice I've listed three probucts, so you'll have to make a descision. It's only coz I recommed getting two shadows. Aside from brushes and boring things like lotions and cleaners, here's what I can come up with:-    1. Lipstick - Something neutral and natural that you'll love enough to wear all the time. You could get a red or occasional colour, but there's no point in having a fabulous lipstick you won't use when you could have something you love so much and you're able to use often. Have a look at peach shades, light pinks and beige and browns.  My favourites:-  Hue - A very light neutral pink.  Creme d'Nude - A thick creamy neutral pinky tone.  Myth - Like Creme d'Nude but lighter and not as creamy.  Freckletone - Peach  Fresh Brew - Looks like a fresh brew! A very soft brown    2. Lipglass - Underage! My absolute favourite. I love it. It's pink, it's natural, it's subtle and it's a MAC lipglass. Other favourites are C-Thru which is very natural but still opaque, Russian Red (red!) and Revealing, a toffee colour. Be as adverturous as you like with your lipglass, you can wear even a bright red in a light subtle way.    3. Eyeshadow - I say get two. A neutral shade or a highlight and a colour, or a colour and a black that you can use to blend and smoke. Faves:-  Vanilla - Perfect as a highlight.  All That Glitters - Sooo pretty! Pinky-beige.  Expensive Pink - Pink with gold unertones  Sable - My personal favourite. Plumy bronzey shimmer.  Black Tide - Black with silver glitters  Carbon - Matt black.    Of course you can just pick any colour you love. Even a colour like lime green can always be wearable in eyeshadow- If you know what you're doing!    4. Eyeliner:- Fluid line is my fave, but it's a gel liner in a pot and not handy for putting in your handbag. Go with a Liquid Last. They really do last. What ever colour. Point Black is good but it depends on what you like.    5. Prep & Prime Lash:- Primes your eyelashes for mascara. Makes an amazing difference! You won't stop using it once you do. Use it, and you'll only need one coat of your fave mascara to lengthen, thicken and curl.|`|rmcEFak0aa	hjh|`|Byty65f0aa	studio fix foundation powder, (go on the site to sample colours)  paint pot in a neutral colour e.g bare study/groundwork  a neutral eyeshadow  a lipgloss   a lipstick    dont bother with mascaras. they're very crappy. and i dont think many people look at the make of your eyeliner.|`|9BCysAZDaa	a mac pc|`|LYKG72craa	Well, in my M.A.C days, I lived for the ORGINAL Lip Glass, in clear.

3GHXk05saa	Some people have to wash their hair daily. When you do, get a shampoo for oily hair and spend time scrubbing your scalp with your fingertips. The oil comes from the follicles so massaging them releases the oil and the shampoo washes it away. Rinse and repeat if needed.|`|gb4VzNXQaa	I have the same problem and just wash my hair everyday and do a vinegar rinse about once a week to get rid of buildup.  If you want to try the rinse use 1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar(depending on how long and thick your hair is) mixed with one cup of warm water into a large bowl and pour it over your hair into another large bowl then pour again and again until the mixture gets cold and then let your hair air dry.|`|UvLNxiuyaa	here is a very effective remedy :<br>  <br>  Take an empty shampoo bottle.<br>  <br>  Step2<br>  Add some baking soda in and than pour in a bit of your shampoo<br>  <br>  Step3<br>  Now add a bit of water to make a paste.<br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Shake, wet your hair and wash it with the paste<br>  <br>  Step5<br>  Leave on for 15 minutes.

K4Pwd3kfaa	Use a belt to cinch it in at the waist (skinny belt), and use necklaces to your advantage. Just make sure you use chunky jewelry. Thin, delicate, jewelry won't cut it because it won't stand out, it'll just fade away in the dark colours of the T. :)<br>  But in order to get a good cinched-in effect with the belt, you might want to get the T in one size larger than your actual size is. :)<br>  Then a baggy-ish, cropped, jean with some patent, red pumps would complete the look.

1BaeFYnEaa	Corsetry works wonderful on hourglass figures. However, don't overdo the cleavage, because it would look vulgar because of your D cup.

But your hair cant just naturally look like that by how you have it cut. you have to style it and tease it to make it look like that.     watch this video, it might help :     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFpu4d4Sv...|`|bm1rsts7aa	Yeah layer length but also ask what they think would be the best way to style it like that depending on what your hair type is. Because it's obviously not just going to stick up and have so much volume like that naturally.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	just bring the pic, thats an easy cut just side bangs and layers that are shorter towards the crown of the head :)|`|8WHGt9jUaa	say layers, with short layers on top and keep the bottom long and the top layers short. =P|`|tMsCXngvaa	thats amazing i think just bring the pic because its hard to describe|`|czd8Nk9Naa	It's pretty much just lots of layers.

6zA0jR6Saa	wal mart  i get the cutest clothes for me and my fiance there, reasonably priced and good looking    also, look for sales and  clearance racks|`|gjteVB2Daa	Depends if you want quality and cheap or just cheap.  For quality, try antique shops (nice vintage items), resale shops, estate sales, Good Will stores, Federation of the Blind resale stores, etc.  All have nice things that people no longer wanted but were probably expensive in their day and now are priced from $1.00 to $10.00 or so, unless it would be a coat or something like that.  At this time in this economy, many of the good department stores have sales and coupons in the papers for 20% off of the already low sale prices.  I never buy anything unless it is on sale and I have a coupon for more $ off.  These items are usually quality and last for years and then I donate them to the Blind resale or Good Will places and get a deduction off my taxes.|`|vGCetYmAaa	areopostale, and forever 21|`|Za3FTVNzaa	Ebay|`|MhpCLLKWaa	forever21.com is like perfect, is so cheap and they have like a lot of style and pretty clothes, plus accesories, shoes and lingerie!|`|fGMn1OOXaa	go to a clean, decent thrift store. the good ones have nice clothes for really good prices.|`|SS87lbOCaa	platos closet, ebay, or forever21|`|94ce959de02f790ade613a98ca75d820aa	Forever 21, Charlotte Russe, H&M, Marshall's, TJ Maxx, Burlington Coat Factory, Target, Walmart    Kohl's and JCPenney's has good sales    Try consignment shops too.

But I like the turquoise with White sponging or White with Turquoise sponging.  I would only sponge one wall or even maybe two.  One of the walls being one you look at and the one behind the bed.  The window wall should probably stay plain whichever colour you chose.  It you do the solid turquoise maybe a soft matching beige would work for the sponging also.
jez0O0bXaa	Have your stylist use thinning shears on it.  Also a layered cut will help. Use moisturizing products.|`|xgWf3SKxaa	they have these sissers that thin your hair out... shears. also layers make your hair thinner. dont use volumizing anything products . You dont have to straighten your hair|`|vGCetYmAaa	get it layerd alot|`|oBzRrsVlaa	The next time you go to get your hair cut ask them to thin your hair out.  They can cut your hair and thin it out.  I also have really thick hair.  Good Luck|`|X2lesqhRaa	Heres a few tips...  1:Wash your scalp with conditioner, do not use shampoo.You can conditioner wash once or twice a week.  2: Never ever brush your hair, A wide comb or your hands are fine Just steer clear of all brushes.  3:Give your hair time to adjust. It takes 2-4 weeks for your hair to adjust to the no shampoo. It may even look worse at first. Hair is a long-term project and it may take a couple weeks for it to regain its health after being stripped of moisture for years by shampoo  4:Do the final rinse of your hair with cool or cold water. This will decrease frizz and add shine. Leave some conditioner in your hair, especially in dry sections like the ends. It is fine to run your fingers through your hair gently, but do not comb your hair after this point.  5: It's ok to use some products. Look for ones with no alcohol. Use them while your hair is wet only. Dont overload. Steer clear of as many chemicals as you can, try organic substances.  6:Get your hair thinned at a good solan. get layered haircuts. Ask the stylist for tips.  7:My favorite and most effectful. Hair oil you can find it in various international stores. If you only shop at wal-mart and stuff look for baby oil, will work just as good.  8:Use heat protecters before flat ironing wont damage at all.  9:Braid your hair before you sleep will keep the frizz away  10:Just tye it back, its a great times for a new style, but only if it looks good on you.  11: Dont be too afraid of volume Some people would kill for curly, volumized hair.  12: Suggested brands Chi and Bedhead|`|l5zJ1bldaa	layers help make it appear thinner, and more voluminous.  straightening your hair for a long time will flatten it out (and make it seem thinner).  but to get it thin very quickly, just go to your hairdresser and get it thinned. crazy, right?|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Go to the salon, and have them thin your hair out out.|`|g1tidbsmaa	try strighting it and blow drying it 4 a long time|`|RI1o1bvcaa	if you go to salons, and ask for them to thin it out they will do it by running a razor down ur hair (not dangerous) the only problem is that it causes breakage.     I think there also might be some shampoo brands that are for straightening/thinning. You could try those.|`|8WHGt9jUaa	straighten your hair so it can look a little skinnier and don't use volume shampoo.|`|nWjDDzL4aa	I get my hair thinned every other time I go to get my haircut. Next time you go just ask your stylist if she could thin out your hair. It's good, you'll notice a subtle difference. You don't want to get it thinned out every appointment though because your hair will be too thin and you'll have lot's of different length hairs all over the place. Hope you like it!

UCd6blZgaa	first, switch your shampoo. Panteen is great, and Nutragena Triple deep conditining conditiner is the best i've ever had/  So wash your hair with panteen and condition with nutrogena. dry your hair JUST A LITTLE, and then gel and hairspray.  it worked for me,  hope i helped.|`|GcWb7IRdaa	If you straighton your hair say, like 1-2 times a week you won't ruin it as long as you use protective product.

(click girls, then click crazy smooth)    works all the time, the days you don't straighten, I guess just wear in a bun.|`|gNaxbSFXaa	You need to start using a styling mousse that goes on while your hair is damp, then blowdry it how you want it. give it a tiny spritz of hairspray once straightened and it should be tamed for the day ahead.   in the uk i find shockwaves the best products for taming.

9qXHUkf2aa	I don't think they are because although their prices are around average, they don't have a company email. It's a hotmail-based email. They also don't give their address online.  But go to the Ugg Australia website to check. I did that for Whatshebuys.com and some other retailers just to check and make sure that they're authentic.    Uggs generally are the same price everywhere, although eBay occasionally has cheaper ones - but with eBay it's hard to know if you're getting authentic ones. Occasionally Ugg Australia and Ugg distributors have sales, like they just had a few weeks ago, especially with the economy in this state. The easiest and surest thing to do would be to buy in kids sizes if you fit in them (4 Kids = 6 Womens, 5 Kids = 7 Womens, etc) because they're the same and they're around $50 cheaper than the womens sizes. I bought mine from whatshebuys.com because they offered free shipping (fast too!), free gift wrap, and their prices were average - they're also an authorized Ugg dealer too. You can go to local Walking Company stores, Nordstrom, Saks, or Journeys too.    So basically if they're too good to be true, they probably are fake.    Uggs should always be bigger than actual size. I read that in some "how to spot counterfeit Uggs" websites and they all say that if the eBay seller advertises them as small, they're probably fake. Ugg sizing has not changed. Also, the quality is great and they last a LONG time if you don't step in the snow and such, so I'd definitely get Uggs. I got mine in September and they still look pretty new - even though I wore them almost every day up until January!    Hope that helps!!|`|HS44HUrgaa	i got mine off ugcollection, its the only site i trust to order them ^^|`|LMpLbtHVaa	dont go to that one i got them here http://tinyurl.com/2g9mqh|`|EeBpGOQPaa	Hmm..actually i checked it out and it does look legit.  I usually dont encourage buying uggs from websites that are little know like that but that one seems very legit.     Have fun shopping! I love uggs!

Hollister/Aeropostale/Abercrombie&Fitch is just 00, 0, 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8, etc.     For shirts, they don't have a conversion type thing.

I think it is cool if a couple of people go together to get tattoos, but many times busy shops are overrun with the person getting tattooed +guest(s). Not just that, many times I see girls who take their friend along with them back to the tattoo areas and they are all chatty and I think that probably distracts the artist plus it takes away from the opportunity to get to know their customer. <br>  So, if you are cool with flying solo, I think it would probably be appreciated!|`|Ad9GHlh1aa	Don't worry your not a wierdo lol.

To this question, I cannot answer since I am not an actor or a Homosexual.|`|VrFa37q3aa	Well, it depends on the type of foundation like liquid or power or mousse. I'm assuming ur talking about liquid or mousse, cuz with powder you pretty much always use a brush.<br>  <br>  I don't like to apply liquid or mousse foundation with my fingers because it makes it look bad and the natural oils in my skin make my face look oily. Sponge is okay, but i prefer a brush. If you use a brush its easier to make the foundation look even and it goes on evenly. I like to use a fairly large brush, but you can use a small one if you want. Make sure you wash the brush at least once a week with ant-bacterial soap or johnson's baby soap. <br>  <br>  defiantly go for the brush though<br>  <br>  hope i helped, any more ???? email me<br>  <br>  peace

But don't go too light...or you'll spotlight the area you want to conceal and end up with raccoon eyes.  There's a buy1, get1 half off sale going with this item.|`|elifTnkkaa	M.A.C|`|roGXVGFOaa	Revlon ColorStay beats all other brands. It's good quality and inexpensive. You can also use it as a concealer.|`|XYT7jvBdaa	My favorite concealer is between Rimmel Hide-the-Blemish concealer, and MAC Studio Fix. Both cover under eye circles and minor imperfections amazingly well and since they have a creamy consistency, they don't budge throughout the day. <br>  <br>  Are you looking for a liquid foundation? mineral? whipped? cream? For liquid I recommend Revlon ColorStay. It's tons cheaper than high end brands but is just as good. It's got a huge variety of shades and formulas and medium to full coverage. For whipped, I like CoverGirl Tru Blend whipped foundation. For mineral, I strongly recommend Maybelline Mineral Power.|`|i6tyscumaa	I swear by Maybelline Liquid Minerals, it goes on really well and is kind to your skin, plus i like the fact that it's liquid rather than those annoying powdered mineral foundations. It doesn't contain talc or oil like most foundations, resulting in dry or greasy skin. Eurghhh<br>  <br>  As for concealer, you really cannot beat Touche Eclat by YSL. It's expensive, but really worth the money. I got it on special offer so i bought two! seriously, you just whack it on under your eyes and it instantly brightens them and makes you look as if you've had 8 hours sleep even if you've been up all night.<br>  <br>  Try looking for it on ebay, or on discount beauty sites such as www.beautyrocket.com, you might just get lucky!<br>  <br>  Best of Luck! xx|`|o7JfhhLbaa	i fin rimmel lasting mineral foundation the best in bot foundation and concealer.<br>  <br>  i hope i hellped <br>  <br>  x|`|sVrA4AVSaa	bare minerals is what i use. <br>  its mineral so wont clog your pores and you can wear a lot without getting it to look caked on|`|nP2PDlBsaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several products.The review site is pretty good at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and see what everyone recommends.|`|7Htbfh3Caa	it depends on what type of skin you have and wat color it is. do u have dry skin, oily, combonation, or pimply?
KdQiHnebaa	I would go with anti frizzy or bed head. They have really nice products. Infusium conditioner softens uo your hair like magic. They're is also a Tea Tree conditoner like substance.....not sure what brand. They used it on my hair at Supercuts and my hair stayed smooth for a week!!!!!!!!!!!! Hope you find what works for you. Good LUck!!!!!!!! LOL|`|f7SFnIkyaa	I would use frizee's ainty frizz<br>  but i would also have it cut with thinning scissors and have choppy layers put in to make hair thinner.X|`|lFZwChJmaa	Pantene anti-frizz :)<br>  x|`|Mbg9YrSUaa	thin it out with scissors i know it sounds weird but it works<br>  my sister does it all the time she thins it out with scissors but be careful not to cut it off lol =]<br>  i dont know im a guy so... idk hahahaha

Maybe 16|`|afX9FlaEaa	Nope not at all...just remeber im a huge buyer a v secrets bathing suits and sometimes they really dont fit like you think they will...it always looks better online..<br>  for example i bought a bathing suit that looked sexy but the bottoms were cut for a granny!|`|iMaYLGECaa	i think its fine<br>  you see 14 year olds wearing way worse now|`|2v60zG5Faa	it very cut en if u can fill it then go for it x its reely pretty in that bluey color x|`|AGXk7TTWaa	No!

It puts out the wrong impression.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	its fine|`|KkRb3paPaa	i hate bikinis(i need a flat stomach and slim thighs to wear one), but it's not bad. but i heard that red makes people pay attention to you, so maybe you want to get the one in the picture|`|axheoEN4aa	no, it's fine =]|`|bljBwqCaaa	naahh go for it|`|JoAfcy4Caa	it would look better on someone older- u should wear a costume maybe not a bikini sorry
AA12032352	Your one year old tattoo isn't going to be damaged by anything that doesn't damage the rest of you skin.....period.|`|cb8d9061f02810c2cced8d65c11335bdaa	Well...now that would make you think about what you are putting on your skin wouldn't it??? Wow..<br>  <br>  If you want a shave cream that is botanically based and you don't have to worry about what you are putting on your skin I gladly recommend one that I use and love. It is from a company called Arbonne. They call it a shave gel, but it is actually more like a lotion and I get such a great shave on my legs with it. It seems a bit pricey, but last about 5 months because you have to use so little amount. I had ran out and decided to go get my old brand at the drugstore, I won't do that again. You can find it in the online catalog in the mens section.

xBr2Ztgbaa	Stay black, but add streaks of a bright color, like red or blue. That would give you a punk look, if that's what you want.|`|vwuMTm7Saa	Keep it black.|`|K3XJ4S0Eaa	keep :)|`|p1ZMXLpBaa	keep it black, it looks really good that way.<br>  Maybe get a little bit of a platinum blonde under layer around the bangs, that looks kind of fringy. but it does look really cute already.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	I'd keep it black but maybe add some bright true red in peek-a-boo pieces underneath. That would look awesome! (-:|`|1PkOPxHfaa	Keep it black but maybe add some bright red just at the tips|`|IA5SuFkdaa	keep it black and streaks of blonde and hot pink would look really cute!|`|SGjSk5WTaa	What about the black you have in it with some red lights and maybe a little bit of blonde throughout. That would look awesome in there!|`|6BcQ438zaa	same color,<br>  with some blonde added in<br>  that will be hott<br>  it will be spring soon<br>  you should keep your hair up to date w/the seasons|`|RDZzKsflaa	Keep it black, but maybe get a blonde slice in the side, like on the bottom layer of hair.<br>  <br>  Great cut though, love it!|`|CNZn1qhJaa	Any color or a mix of colors would look great.|`|K4J6f1e0aa	Keep it black =]|`|6NotwZCyaa	light brown or leave it black|`|QqeGsBauaa	light brown would look cute... why not ask a hairdresser?|`|G9yWk0xBaa	OMG i ove your  haor keep it the same dnt change a thing|`|IP4ym3Ynaa	first off your really pretty. second i would say probs dark red. i dont know the name. or blonde which i dont like but would look alright to say the least. but yeah dark red the best. you just look like that kind of girl|`|BQc7PK9Haa	Hello there  I have an idea. Not sure about your hairstyle? <br>  Use this site that you can upload your photograph and look at various hairstyles and hair colors - <a href="http://www.yourhairstyles.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourhairstyles.info/</a>|`|Z6CJApzJaa	I would put Red streaks more on the top and less on the bottom. But I like it black also.|`|KdQiHnebaa	I truly like the black. Maybe you should get some highlights such as red or pink or coconut or caramel. Nice haircut. Hope u find what you like!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol|`|f7SFnIkyaa	I would put a deep red on with it, or a purple. To liven it up.<br>  But its a very good cut ! Thumbs up!|`|BhZanzuOaa	I say keep it black but then get some dark purple or red high lights or something like that|`|NBMqCkHQaa	In this moment I'm your best friend : Keep it black ..... So listen to your friend^^ ....if you really have to have something more just add a few Highlights but not more|`|vJGeOvQxaa	maybe dirty blonde?<br>  <br>  brown or light brown<br>  <br>  i love brown hair<br>  <br>  and brown hair will suit you the best i think...|`|nCDKKrvraa	keep it black...it looks fine|`|1OujK62Vaa	bright red|`|sBJtxJG9aa	white streaks on the underneath part of your hair
7CTvtek0aa	No you look good, my only suggestion is tone down the eyeliner a little bit.  Those ghetto prom pictures are hilarious!|`|UpJbXh7Vaa	Yes. You look weird with the line on the bottom. You are supposed to put it on the top. And you should smudge it so it doesn't look so harsh.|`|EDJ8heifaa	No not at all.  The only make up you are wearing too much of is your eye makeup.  It takes away from the nice qualities of your face.  Because it is so dark, it kind of washes out the color in your face.  You're pretty but you'd look amazing with a little less eye makeup.|`|i6tyscumaa	i wouldn't say you wear too much make up, i just think that heavy black line really distracts from your natural beauty, i think you should apply it much thinner. If you can't bear to go without the thick black liner, apply it to the top lid instead, like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.celebritybeautybuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/lauren-conrad-wing-liner.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.celebritybeautybuzz.com/wp-co...</a><br>  <br>  you could also flick it out for a more dramatic look:<br>  <a href="http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd248/Glossypinkblog/012420081702174158.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd248...</a><br>  <br>  your skin is absolutely flawless as well.<br>  <br>  Personally, i don't think you need to wear make up at all! Lucky thing :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck ! xxx|`|yOkXWCnLaa	No! You really don't know what to much make up is.<br>  <br>  For that you will need to wear eyeshadow(preferably exotic ones-<br>  <br>  You just look like you like black eyeliner .=P<br>  <br>  Thats simple make up.|`|M627my7Baa	It's not "too much makeup" but it's not flattering.  Just forget lining the bottom lid, shape your eyebrows a bit, and put the liner on the top lid. It's a small change that will make a big difference!|`|RcBkUBsfaa	no......<br>  maybe you should wear a little more foundation and some blush|`|XYT7jvBdaa	No, it doesn't look like too much. But I wear a lot more than that on a daily basis. Your eyeliner looks badly applied however. Try using less of it, because the amount you currently use just kind of hides the shape of your eyes rather than emphasize it.|`|jrPJBVlCaa	no you just look like you like eyeliner..<br>  its a bit heavy<br>  <br>  but its not ridiculous.<br>  <br>  <br>  wanna answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqGeNj_HcmvhKbUe4qIKl_vsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220102118AAd7ZWT">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|o7JfhhLbaa	i dont think you wear to much face mak-up but your eye make you could use being toned down a little dont put sooo much on the bottom.<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|AA11318212	Too much eyeliner.

BAPj9JW3aa	you have to be 18.|`|vrX6Gvj6aa	Okay, so Abercrombie and Fitch won't hire until you are eighteen.<br>  <br>  but! Hollister will pay you to walk around their store wearing their clothes (this is modeling, but not picture modeling) if you are at least 14 years old. same age rule for pictures.<br>  <br>  taking pics would get easier if you are with an agency :)<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|XxDZTyiNaa	the employees are not the ones who choose models and would have no clue how to answer your questions.  if you are serious about modeling you will have to take what you can get for a while.  get some photos taken by a good photographer, get an agent...you are not going to walk off the street and into a hollister ad.  good luck!|`|Tu7Ec3tDaa	i would think 18-27????? but i'm no model expert..=\|`|PN7XMglOaa	18

ZtrCkv81aa	I really liked Herbal Essence, the smell is great and your hair looks healthy. But really, if your hair is wavy its hard for a shampoo and a conditioner to make it completely straight. Yes if you stop using it, it will go back to your normal texture.|`|jmhkrc4gaa	It dosn't really work.<br>  Sorry, I find, the only way to actually make your hair striaght, is to use a flat iron,<br>  It could reduce the wave's.<br>  But not do much, Most likely at least.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	It doesn't make your hair straight, You would have to have some harsh chemicals to break that bond.|`|JyGFPMPqaa	It doesn't really work that well. Believe me I tryed it. They just say dangerously straight so people will buy it. Nothing except for a straightner will really straighten your hair.|`|yUpHZwTMaa	it doesnt really work like that... make sure you straighten your hair after it dries and everything.. My sister bought it a while back and it didnt do anything.. .but when she straightend her hair it wasnt as frizzy and there werent any fly-aways|`|nbtZ4ixoaa	it doesn't straighten but it does de-frizz really well :)<br>  the only way you can actually get straight hair is with straightens or proffesional treatments :)<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|Ad4D3mLEaa	it doesn't really do anything, they just write that on the bottle so people will buy it, its pretty much normal shampoo/conditioner|`|Ys0kV4O8aa	It doesn't work. No shampoos will work to straighten hair. Get it chemically straightened at a salon for long lasting results that last even through washing, or get a pair of good straighteners.

D0Dwnkuhaa	If you use Nair then it won't grow back as stubbly. What I do is I would shave regular first, like with a blade, and when the stubbly's grow in, nair it. It might work, but it's a theory of mine.|`|jKA8SovQaa	well, shaving yes makes hair not only stubby, but grow thicker,but not really darker, and some new hairs will devolp , and it's hard to shave stubbles.and yes i agree waxing hurts very much, the most effective way to get every single hair not to grow back is laser my sister got laser hair removal on her legs for 150 per sessions for 7 sessions it's worth it.|`|WaIt54N9aa	Shaving does make the hair grow darker and thicker.|`|6Ss31wyBaa	yes it does|`|i01egybJaa	No, it doesn't make it more stubbly.

ZzwPJyRSaa	I work for Proactiv, so I get asked about the toner all the time. It does have limited moisturizing properties, but primarily the Witch Hazel controls oil and the Alpha Hydroxy acids increase cell turnover. <br>  <br>  Too much oil and too many dead skin cells are what plugs up your pores, and when the dark, moist environment of a plugged pore is created, the propionibacterium Acnes bacterium gets in there and throws a party and invites all his friends, and that's what actually makes a reddened, painful pimple. The Benzoyl Peroxide is what kills hat bacterium, but the toner helps assure that there's no place for it to live to begin with. :D If you're worried about dryness (since you said the toner doesn't moisturize you), feel free to follow your Repair Lotion with an oil-free moisturizer that's non-comedogenic. I sometimes use a heavier moisturizer at night, since I wash it off in the morning. I hope this helped!|`|5iDp1uVMaa	the toner isnt supposed to moisterize, it clears out your pores and keeps dirt out of them.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	yup|`|mT9HXhheaa	it helps alittle<br>  but clean and clear works better

9gMQAWBNaa	No it will not, your body and face are still growing. They will continue to grow for many years, at this point there is little you can do about your face or body. As far as face sculpting, this sounds like a lie, do not listen to lies from people who simply want to charge you money. Learn to think for yourself. Go to the library and get a book on jaw/mouth exercises for free, those old exercises are probably the ones they are trying to sell now.|`|vrX6Gvj6aa	okay, you are thirteen buddy!<br>  <br>  your face will "sclupt" itself eventually.<br>  <br>  like when you're a sophomore...<br>  <br>  so chillax...<br>  <br>  and no. they don't work.|`|MLqtSzaMaa	I have never heard of that<br>  But if it is an actual thing<br>  See a doc first!

UYnZtJ2daa	Honestly, in times like these with how the economy is...there is going to be a decrease in people splurging in tattoos...which can also lead to less openings for a position as a tattoo artist. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I would love to be a piercer and maybe one day I can be one...but I'm getting my degree in art (sculpture) first...because no matter what my degree is in, I'll have a degree and it can help me a lot more than not having a degree. <br>  <br>  My suggestion is to get a degree and keep this goal in mind for after college. But that's me. I'm a totally different person from you and if you feel that isn't the right road for you then start putting together your portfolio so when you graduate, you can search for someone willing to take you as an apprentice.|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	You can do both. Going to college will make sure you have something to fall back on in case your dream doesn't work out. Plus, learning new things is a great way to open creative doors - it will make you a better artist.|`|bljBwqCaaa	if you want something badly enough, and are determined to succeed then i would suggest you do what YOU want to do. it's your life, and not your parents. <br>  <br>  the way i see it, it's better to have tried and failed than to spend your life wishing you'd tried. plus, you could go to college anytime.|`|pyHF4eYJaa	Remember, if you learn to tattoo you could always open your own shop. Don't just assume you have to work for someone else. But college is cool too. Or you could do both. Do college part time/online degree while you learn how to tattoo. This would be the safest choice covering all your angles.|`|vWCkmJjiaa	TATTOOS ALL THE WAY! If thats what you want to do, go for it! 1.Tattoos are awesome, 2. Youre parents arent your masters, 3. If you really want to do something, no one should be able to stop you. Make sure you have a backup plan tho, In case tattooing doesnt work out for you. Hope that helped! ^^|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Do both. It can't hurt to have something to fall back on (the degree), and while you're in college you might be able to hang around a tat parlor and make some new connections, maybe find a part time apprenticeship.|`|qNOeBcvraa	i was a tattoo shop secretary for a while... it was sooo fun and the tattoo artists made wads of cash everyday. if i could draw   thats exactly what i would do!!!|`|YhhHUPCSaa	You follow what YOU want to do.

F5WwtQaEaa	This should be fun. I love taking things from my closet that aren't punk at all and then twisting them up.<br>  <br>  Just wear it simply as it is, with some sort of fishnet arm warmers. Wear some long knee-high socks, striped or otherwise, that match your dress. Put on some short matching Converse or a shoe of the type!<br>  <br>  Although your outfit may not look to edgy, make your face look edgy as it can. Wear a lot of eyeliner and dark makeup with funky hair. That way you'll get a lot of people noticing you: nice innocent dress with dark makeup. It gives you a lot of personality, as odd as that may sound.|`|eTBfsjCUaa	Haha do not listen to the person that said to wear black hose....<br>  Wear some black flip flops or maybe some black or neutral wedges.

For slim women it is also attractive to show off your thin waist by drawing attention to it with your gown choice. You can do this with an ornament, belt or wrap.<br>  <br>  <br>  Petite Body Type: A clean dress without that much fabric looks nice on a petite figure. Showing leg tends to make you look taller. Avoid ball gowns and large or long skirts. Don't have too many large accessories, but do add a pair of Alisha Hill shoes with very high heels. They look great and can add a little height.<br>  <br>  i hope you look great for your big night!
wKbRwH3haa	I don't think this has anything to do with hair removal cream, I suffer from this myself and had never used removed hair using cream.  I would be intrigued to know if there is any other cause for this, but I found waxing my underarms helped in the longer term, the darkness appeared to be shadows from hair being produced under the skin.  A course of under arm waxes seemed to improve my skin tone.  I know how embarrassing this can be and I hope you manage to improve it.  If waxing does not help and it is impacting on your self esteem you should see a doctor.  I would also advise against using deodorants that  are heavily perfumed, I use a sanex roll on, this is much kinder to my skin and gives it a more even tone and complexion, thus less darkening.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	i have that to i guess use fading creams and stop wearing cheap deordorant|`|WAkQVEJaaa	call the doctor

It's hard to know what bleach will do to your hair. There's not a guarantee it will end up a certain color. Personally I would keep my hair the way it is and just go with some highlights instead.

On most calculators, you obtain the log (or ln) of a number by <br>  <br>  entering the number, then <br>  pressing the log (or ln) button. <br>  <br>  Example 1: log 5.43 x 1010 = 10.73479983...... (way too many significant figures)<br>  <br>  Example 2: log 2.7 x 10-8 = -7.568636236...... (too many sig. figs.) <br>  So, let's look at the logarithm more closely and figure out how to determine the correct number of significant figures it should have. <br>  <br>  For any log, the number to the left of the decimal point is called the characteristic, and the number to the right of the decimal point is called the mantissa. The characteristic only locates the decimal point of the number, so it is usually not included when determining the number of significant figures. The mantissa has as many significant figures as the number whose log was found. So in the above examples: <br>  <br>  Example 1: log 5.43 x 1010 = 10.735 <br>  The number has 3 significant figures, but its log ends up with 5 significant figures, since the mantissa has 3 and the characteristic has 2.<br>  <br>  Example 2: log 2.7 x 10-8 = -7.57 <br>  The number has 2 significant figures, but its log ends up with 3 significant figures. <br>  Natural logarithms work in the same way: <br>  <br>  Example 3: ln 3.95 x 106 = 15.18922614... = 15.189 <br>  Application to pH problems:<br>  <br>  <br>  pH = -log (hydrogen ion concentration) = -log [H+]<br>  Example 4: What is the pH of an aqueous solution when the concentration of hydrogen ion is 5.0 x 10-4 M? <br>  pH = -log [H+] = -log (5.0 x 10-4) = - (-3.30) = 3.30 <br>  <br>  FINDING ANTILOGARITHMS (also called Inverse Logarithm) <br>  <br>  Sometimes we know the logarithm (or ln) of a number and must work backwards to find the number itself. This is called finding the antilogarithm or inverse logarithm of the number. To do this using most simple scientific calculators, <br>  <br>  enter the number, <br>  press the inverse (inv) or shift button, then <br>  press the log (or ln) button. It might also be labeled the 10x (or ex) button.<br>  <br>  Example 5: log x = 4.203; so, x = inverse log of 4.203 = 15958.79147..... (too many significant figures) <br>  There are three significant figures in the mantissa of the log, so the number has 3 significant figures. The answer to the correct number of significant figures is 1.60 x 104.<br>  <br>  Example 6: log x = -15.3; <br>  so, x = inv log (-15.3) = 5.011872336... x 10-16 = 5 x 10-16 (1 significant figure) <br>  Natural logarithms work in the same way: <br>  <br>  Example 7: ln x = 2.56; so, x = inv ln (2.56) = 12.93581732... = 13 (2 sig. fig.) <br>  Application to pH problems:<br>  <br>  <br>  pH = -log (hydrogen ion concentration) = -log [H+]<br>  Example 8: What is the concentration of the hydrogen ion concentration in an aqueous solution with pH = 13.22? <br>  <br>  pH = -log [H+] = 13.22 <br>  log [H+] = -13.22 <br>  [H+] = inv log (-13.22) <br>  [H+] = 6.0 x 10-14 M (2 sig. fig.)<br>  CALCULATIONS INVOLVING LOGARITHMS <br>  <br>  Because logarithms are exponents, mathematical operations involving them follow the same rules as those for exponents. <br>  <br>  To find the logarithm of a number other than a power of 10, you need to use your scientific calculator or pull out a logarithm table (if they still exist). On most calculators, you obtain the log (or ln) of a number by <br>  <br>  entering the number, then <br>  pressing the log (or ln) button. <br>  <br>  Example 1: log 5.43 x 1010 = 10.73479983...... (way too many significant figures)<br>  <br>  Example 2: log 2.7 x 10-8 = -7.568636236...... (too many sig. figs.) <br>  So, let's look at the logarithm more closely and figure out how to determine the correct number of significant figures it should have. <br>  <br>  For any log, the number to the left of the decimal point is called the characteristic, and the number to the right of the decimal point is called the mantissa. The characteristic only locates the decimal point of the number, so it is usually not included when determining the number of significant figures. The mantissa has as many significant figures as the number whose log was found. So in the above examples: <br>  <br>  Example 1: log 5.43 x 1010 = 10.735 <br>  The number has 3 significant figures, but its log ends up with 5 significant figures, since the mantissa has 3 and the characteristic has 2.<br>  <br>  Example 2: log 2.7 x 10-8 = -7.57 <br>  The number has 2 significant figures, but its log ends up with 3 significant figures. <br>  Natural logarithms work in the same way: <br>  <br>  Example 3: ln 3.95 x 106 = 15.18922614... = 15.189 <br>  Application to pH problems:<br>  <br>  <br>  pH = -log (hydrogen ion concentration) = -log [H+]<br>  Example 4: What is the pH of an aqueous solution when the concentration of hydrogen ion is 5.0 x 10-4 M? <br>  pH = -log [H+] = -log (5.0 x 10-4) = - (-3.30) = 3.30 <br>  <br>  FINDING ANTILOGARITHMS (also called Inverse Logarithm) <br>  <br>  Sometimes we know the logarithm (or ln) of a number and must work backwards to find the number itself. This is called finding the antilogarithm or inverse logarithm of the numbe

lOhB1JKRaa	I get most of my ideas from the stores models. As well as i trade with my friends, like i ask them to pick out an outfit online and i do the same for them.

Classy mixed with new teen trends I find is great if you're interested.  Try going to different department stores for inspiration too, because there are always tons of varieties of clothes at places like Dillard's and Kohl's (i love Apt 9 clothes!).  Accessories at Target or Walmart are really cheap and truly make outfits as well!  Accessorizing may seem like an expensive habit, but when you bargain shop, you'll be happy you did because accesories can make the outfit so much better!!  Good luck :)|`|7ip5nUrcaa	A lot of my ideas come to me, but looking in magazines is where my ideas start. So, maybe I'm looking in a magazine and see Victoria Beckham wearing skinny jeans, and on the next page I see Katie Holmes wearing Gladiators.

For example a baggy top isn't the nicest looking thing, but then you can put a big chunky belt around your waist and the top could look amazing!<br>  Why not experiment with your style on www.polyvore.com ?<br>  It's really good for generating style ideas(:|`|Gfth6v21aa	Absolutely everywhere-my friends, magazines(teen vogue especially),<br>  but i dont set my whole fashion on a certain group-i buy what i like and it seems to fit my personal style.

But they don't have to be expensive, some simple bracelets or a scarf/hat can completely set an outfit off.|`|COCVO3gcaa	accessories are a great way to express yourself further with an outfit.

Next, blow dry it upside down for a bit with a diffuser, and let it air dry the rest of the way.|`|UvLNxiuyaa	In this case you're probably going to need to use hot rollers. After applying the hot rollers to your entire head and allowing them to set, lightly brush the resulting curls and spray with hair spray to hold.

e8Nz2jiraa	You are very beautiful. You will not be able to do runway modeling but you could do some commercial modeling and NYC is a great place to get started. You should get a portfolio made though because your pics look really fuzzy. You need a proffessional and then go to some shoots and audition for commercial modeling. AND YOU ARENT FAT!!!!!!! So dont let anyone tell you that you are.|`|iPje1iyGaa	The photos you have aren't really of good quality, but that doesn't really matter.  To be a model (even a print model) there are height requirements.  <br>  <br>  Runway expects 5'7'' and print expects 5'5''.  This is not to say that you can't model, just pointing out how extremely difficult it will be to get into the business.  For example, I'm 5'8'' and model and I have had agencies tell me they don't want me because I'm too short.<br>  <br>  As far as measurements go, most companies make a generic size to put on models for print.  They want their models somewhere in the range of 34-24-34 (bust, waist, hips) for a "normal" model and a size 12-16 for plus size (but you must be toned and in shape).<br>  <br>  Of course, you'll never know if you don't try.  Just keep in mind that the modeling world is harsh and even the most gorgeously thin and tall models get torn to pieces.|`|hHE471dmaa	you could be a model but only a print model because you are way to short do runway. To get started you would need to make a portfolio of different pictures of yourself showing a range of expression and genres, you would then need to go to a model agency such as elite or ford then see if you get booked and take it from there good luck :)|`|2wRWkjIlaa	you are pretty.... but I don't think you could be a normal model... if you could be a model at all you would have to be a plus size model... you have a large bust and what look like big thighs and a little bit of a tummy... plus sized models in my opinion are waaay prettier then normal models becuase they look real<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer mine?<br>  Pleaseandthanks<3<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219173251AABdOXy&cp=2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|ArS9av0Eaa	in some pictures you are really pretty and have a "model" look. but in other pictures you look kind of normal and just a bit over weight.|`|OV0P8N7kaa	also consider all thats involed in this career, like selling your soul for fame|`|DySUxIn4aa	Ok I'm going to be honest with you..

There were girls who were 5'7, 120 pounds, and absoulutely stunning, yet they were advised to lose weight, or get this lifted, and that tucked. It wasn't worth it. So don't take any rejection to heart.<br>  <br>  But don't let this talk of rejection get you down!

uLHyDOm1aa	i have to admit that is amazing hair,<br>  (been a big fan of the kooks here)<br>  to get poker straight hair curly permanantly the only way is to get a perm. You can always use straighteners to straighten it whenever you feel like a day-of-change but the straightness wont be permanant then.<br>  or if you just want to curl it yourself (non permanantly) you MUST use hair protection first. or after a bit your hair becomes very dry, brittle and burnt. (trust me been there done that!) <br>  curling tongs come in completely diffirent sizes, for curls like lukes you will need a medium or large barrel.<br>  But the best way to start a style like that is blow drying your hair.<br>  then use the heat protection spary, you should comb it through and split your hair into four sections. <br>  grab a section of your hair and wrap it around the curling tongs. hold it there for about 10-15 seconds and releas it. If it didnt work so well (as it can be very hard to curl naturally straight hair - trust me - try it again as it may take a few times. but dont over-do it, some hair just doesnt curl. anyway, carry on curling each section. after curling each section pin it up with a clip (yes this sounds pretty camp but if you want THE result then - ) to the top of your head. after all the sctions are curled and pinned up, unclip them and tip your head upsidedown. tip your head back up and use an anti-frizz serum (only a small amount rubbed into your hands) and smooth your hands through your hair, been careful not to crush the curls. For a lasting look (and this will sound very camp but its a great way to keep it lasting) use hair spray.<br>  <br>  if your hair just didnt curl, the other option is to use a scrunching gel (which you can get guy-versions of) and on wet hair scrunch it into your hair and blow dry for a simple, lasting look. but this wont have the same result as lukes. the curls will look smaller, tighter and more 'done' then relaxed like his.<br>  <br>  hope i helped out x|`|de0Yg53baa	You could always just get a perm. thats what i did (im a girl though) but i really love his hair! i think that would look awesome. and if you're wanting to wear it like that on a regular basis you'll definently want to go with the perm. i just curled my hair today and it took FOREVER! :)

9XGTjIqMaa	I would go with the fair color but its hard to tell by a picture... may be the medium will look okay once you recieve it<br>  <br>  try to buy your make up at the store and when you're buying foundation do the Jaw-Line Test:<br>  <br>  Pick three shades to try: one that looks about right, a lighter color, and one that is slightly darker. Test foundation along your jaw line by swiping each color with a wedge sponge. Do not test on your hand and definitely not on the inside of your wrist because these areas are slightly different in color. View it under different light settings to make sure none of them look weird when the light changes. The shade that disappears or perfectly matches your skin is the one!<br>  <br>  Also, concealer is supposed to be one shade lighter than your skin tone because it has more pigments to help cover imperfections :)<br>  <br>  hope that helped doll|`|D7QdvWYDaa	God you have such beautiful blue eyes!

6fb91692ad9efab55b64e2cfb1453ba4aa	There is a good chance you will. If so I can make one suggestion base on personal experience. Shave it bald! I've always thought I was an average looking guy. Not ugly but no Mr. Universe either. I got tired of looking at the appearing horseshoe on my head and shaved it all off. My wife loves it! And you would not believe the women that hit on me now. There is something about bald men women just see to love. I'd never cheat on my wife but I will admit that it makes me feel good to walk in somewhere for lunch and have a woman offer to buy me a drink. Being bald rules and if offered the chance right now to have all my hair back like I had as a teenager (Curly and down to my butt) I wouldn't take it!|`|1f2727e7f86de6e63428d45b88b7a7c3aa	you will probly go bald when you are older.|`|34a588f6a5e57ec3386a1a87ea0ea8c3aa	They say you have the same hair genes as your mother's maternal grandfather.

I've heard wonderful things about the Proactive line. I have just recently tried a new product from the Philosophy line called Purity that works very well too, it is just an all around good face wash.|`|de342bcbc5870827d0412d6d829ef3dcaa	My daughter had bad acne& the doc. gave her pills that made it worse. So I got a alo-vera plant. You need a fair size one with big leaves. Cut a leaf off the plant & cut it open & rub the inside of it all over the acne. Do this at night before bed as it makes the skin yellow. In the morning wash it off with plain worm water.You can re-use the leaf ,wrap it up &keep it in the frig.After a few times throw it out & cut a new one.After a few weeks you should see a difference.Try it, it works. I wish you all the best.|`|AA12221780	It might but if you really want good black and whitehead prevention use this product PROACTIV SOLUTION,<br>   IT REALLY WORKS!!!! if you want to find out more about it go to "proactiv.com" good luck!!

All in all your son will eventually get the right hair cut that's right for him.

Tilt your head to the side so the hair does not fall on top of that ear.  After you have rinsed out the shampoo/conditioner that is the best time to put some soap on your piercing and clean it.  You won't have to twist the jewelry, just massage the soap around it and rinse it off well.  This way if there was any shampoo that got on it, it will be off as well! :)|`|VsLSJ65Paa	of coarse wash your hair! Just be careful to not irritate your new piercing too much in the beginning.

AeCBVmN8aa	I have been a nail tech for 7 years and this is what you should do.<br>  <br>  1. Always keep them clean under neath <br>  2. if you want to take them off let them grow out and get homework done ( when the acrylic is filed down to your natural nail so that it looks like your own) it usually takes about 4-6 weeks for them to come off depending on nail growth rate and how long the tip is. <br>  3. if you don't want to do "homework then have them removed by a pro. they will take them off gently and give you a manicure too. <br>  <br>  when acrylic binds to your natural nail it will lift the "skin" of the nail so when you get a manicure it helps that "skin" adhear again. <br>  <br>  My advise to anyone...<br>  if you already have nice nails and you don't bite them then stick to manicures. Acrylic ruins your natural nail. I tell all my clients that if they have nice nail i will not put acrylic on them. <br>  however if your a nail biter, you will probably start tearing them off your self anyways and this can harm your nail. you can google acrylic nail disorders on the internet and you will see what can happen if they are not taking cared of properly|`|4P0Gmsa8aa	if u dont plan on filling them, get them off when they start growing, otherwise they look nasty. make sure u dont get food or dirtunderneath them. its gross. so wash ur hands, scrub ur nails...i say every other month or two, get a new set,|`|TyeuvRJzaa	Its Not that Difficult;Yes get them done every 2 weeks,&Then You have to take them Off by the third Refilling,& put new Ones.<br>  <br>  Make sure the place you Do your nails is a CleanPlace|`|aZXnW6AUaa	place them in a clean place|`|eQVvnq7Haa	i used to get mine, down but always ripped them off. you will too, trust me.

Ask what age your dad and brothers first got their hair filled in there at. Be patient as they say, as getting upset over it won't hurry it along. I also would not be anxious to shave then once it fills in. I have heard that shaving can make it come in more though as it grows back thicker. It's like getting one's hair trimmed often makes the hair grow faster somehow.<br>  <br>  Germans are not that hairy typically and mixed with the Filipino should maybe decrease those odds I would think then instead.?<br>  <br>  I think you have a typo btw, it shows 3 of your mothers can grow a beard..that just sounds wrong on every level even if you mean brothers.|`|p8rxpA98aa	Maybe if u keep shaving it with a razor, it'll start to grow....|`|GBSO1Efraa	There is nothing at all you can do but wait until it grows in.

However you have to buy refills that cost an extra ￡4 for like 30 pads.|`|A1PLJKhUaa	It's absolutely crap, don't bother.

But overall I didn't think it was worth it. I've switched to Neutragena black head scrub and it's way better. Makes my skin feel good after i use it. And I use a light face lotion and I think it's the best my skin has ever felt or looked.|`|qO3w1Iq7aa	I live in the US and here it costs about $12. 2 of my friends used it and it dried out there face pretty bad!|`|AA11818569	dont buy it, absolutely crap, better of with face masks

tUjCJIaTaa	Why dont you search in google?<br>  <br>  And I kindof made a puffbal skirt out of a wide full skirt by feeding some elasticated strips throught the hem of the skirt. It really complicated try watching goks fashion fix the latest series thats where I got this idea from.
tFoSy2YRaa	Look on Figleaves, Bravissimo and Le Mystere. The next size up is an F, FF, G, and so on.<br>  Also I feel like a right b*tch for saying this, but if you are 42, that's quite big, aren't you something like a US size 16? If you're smaller than that you should wear a smaller back size, if you are that size losing weight is always an option.|`|wVJ4PJJXaa	You may not need to change the cup size, but the band size.  If you go to a store like Victoria's Secret, Macy's, Nordstrom you can have a sales employee measure you professionally. That would be your best bet, that way you can find a bra that fits your comfortably, supports the girls, and makes you look your best.|`|maqCRmehaa	The next cup size up would be a 42(E-F) (depends on if it is american or european or UK sizing).  You can actually find that size pretty easily at barenecessities.com, figleaves.com and herroom.com.  I am a fan of barenecessities, personally.  You can shop by bra size and they have a nice selection of really pretty bras for larger sizes.  They also have a great return policy so you can order the same bra in a few different sizes and just send back what you don't want within 60 days.<br>  <br>  Make sure your bra is really snug around the band on the loosest hook and that the fabric piece between the cups lays flat against your chest.  The straps should only support <10% of the weight.  The band should sit in a straight line across your back and should not ride up.  If you can fit more than 2-3 fingers under the band while it is buckled on the loosest hook, it is too big.  A lot of women with larger breasts end up basically hanging their boobs from their shoulders by the straps because they can't find cup sizes that fit.  I would recommend ordering some bras in a band size smaller (and a cup size bigger) too and see what fits/supports you the best (40F or 40G as well as 42 F).  Be sure to take note whether the bra says "european" or UK sizing as there will be a size conversion chart to go between american bra sizes and those sizes.  The Uk brand Freya is amazing and I have found that all eupropean bras are better made and fit so much better than american-made bras.  The cup sizes go up by smaller increments too so you can get a better fit.  When your breasts are properly supported they should sit in between your elbow and shoulder height-wise.  Hope this was helpful.<br>  <br>  Also try this website for fitting tips and photos: www.myintimacy.com  and if you live near one of their stores it will be a life altering change for your breasts to get a professional fitting there!!|`|VrdJpxqKaa	WOW thats Huge! I think the next size is an F and I dont think they sell them at normal manufactures so therefore; you might have to order online or custom...also,I might consider saving for a breast reduction surgery..depending on where you go it can be 2,000-8,000. Good luck-=)|`|qGS4oR11aa	brest reduction|`|QJslTCUBaa	do they make bra's that big?|`|wKbRwH3haa	It really depends on whether your back size is bigger or cup size or both?

4P0Gmsa8aa	of course it all depends on your style, but i'd say leggings...(and im just basing this answer on MY style..k?) black, gray, and brown. uhmm...some cute dresses/shirts. (long shirts to wear with leggings, and dresses for spring) cute flats, chucks, vans, and keds. a few scarfs, random colors. a couple sweaters..zip ups and hoodies. a whole bunch of camis. layers is a must. some plain shirts, and some not so plain ones...variety!! some sunglasses. some skinny jeans. every color. some hair clips...and make up!!!! oh yeah, and perfume|`|FNk35vR6aa	I would say get a bunch of undershirts/camisoles in different colors. My favorite place to get them is express. I know they sell them for cheaper at places like forever 21 and old navy though. I like these because can match different outfits (add color to a sweater etc). If you are even looking for jeans, invest in a nicer pair of jeans (I'm a bit of a jean snob I'll buy Sevens and Citizens) but if you can't afford them just really try to buy ones that fit you well and don't just look trendy (because you'll probably get bored with them soon).<br>  Also, personally I like having some cardigan sweaters because they are useful now and in the spring time they can act like a light jacket. I personally like buying plainer shirts because then I'm more likely to keep them longer because they don't have a crazy pattern. If you get plain clothes in solid colors you can dress it up with fun jewelry and patterned scarves! Also, a nice belt if you can will really add to the outfit.<br>  Just have fun and take your time, try not to impulse shop because you might end up with a bunch of clothes you don't really want/need. good luck!|`|rf6MSng5aa	Shirts/Tanks/Spaghetti Straps/Jackets<br>  Jeans/Shorts/Skits/Leggings<br>  Accessories - Hair clips/Necklaces/Bracelets/<br>  Shoes - Boots/Heels/Flats/Shoes<br>  <br>  When you get to the mall, you'll know exactly what to buy. :)|`|w53DmsHWaa	Jeans, light and dark wash<br>  <br>  a couple of white cotton t-shirts that are form fitting<br>  <br>  and some sun dresses and sandals <br>  you should also think about getting convers theyre super cofortable and go with almost everything.|`|o17D9AXBaa	there arent any essential things that you need to have, just wear the kinds of clothes you like and that show your age without being too $lutty.<br>  <br>  ps. i like H&M :)|`|yUpHZwTMaa	i loooove sundresses..  <br>  jeans, like nice dressy jeans, because they look good with everything<br>  <br>  i love shirts from charolette russe...  but they have great shirts!<br>  and most of their shoes, and purses..|`|3Mi2jyJPaa	skirts mini ones and maybe a good lookin shirt|`|e2kh8PJWaa	dont wear highheels|`|JOmImho0aa	if you are looking for a whole new wardrobe start out with something trendy, but inexpensive wet seal has some great things and sometimes they are like buy one get one free.<br>  <br>  forever 21 has some cute stuff too, and on the sale racks you can find some hott stuf for less that 10 dollrs!<br>  <br>  of course the department stores have some things you might be interested in. everytime i go 2 the mall i make sure 2 hit macys, jcpenny, and dillards<br>  <br>  also, aeropostale is a popular store and it has some really great comfy/casual stuff for cheaper that other stores.<br>  <br>  good luck on branching out!<br>  <br>  ps- a good wardrobe definitely includes cute cadigans, comfy tees, nice blouses, well fitting jeans(i hear bui yah kah has the best ones), couple of hot skirts, and of course u cant finish w/o jewelry.

d185f39553435f17970e180ddffe3d53aa	Unfortunately lower back tattoo's on women have gotten a bad wrap, and now anyone that sees a lower back tattoo will automatically think, oh look, tramp stamp.  Also, tattoo's are addictive.  I swore that I would only get one, now I have both arms sleeved and have started on my legs, lol.  Get what you want, and I applaud you for coming up with your own design that means something to you.  But to answer your question, if your lower back is where you want it than get it done and screw what other people think.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I know a girl who has the "stamp" .. and she's the total opposite of a slut.

0fQYHgr0aa	The clean and clear is a good way to go. You need to stick with things that have salicylic acid and/or benzoyl peroxide. The break out around your chin is hormonal. Always try to use cool water when washing your face so that the pores stay closed. Not sure if you do or not but using an exfoliator will also cause you to break out. you should only exfoliate one a week if that. good luck....i hate acne!|`|RBDScB7Daa	proactive, neutrogena face wash.|`|XzvEOV9Gaa	O.k you must have changed your skincare routine maybe there was a lot of chemicals acids and who knows what in your skincare routine that are absent now and your skin became addicted almost to these chemicals and those chemicals is what made your skin clear and now that there not there they are giving you spots so basically i would keep a good skincare routine except use other products like simple or stuff that has less chemicals in it so your skin will clear up and not because of chemicals that's what happened to me now i use simple skincare st.ives etc these are great they use lots of Natural stuff in them hope this helps thanks please pick me for best answer|`|8WqK8JSUaa	Use Karakol Creme.<br>  It works sooo good.<br>  I tried it the first day and i already had results. :)<br>  I just started using it yesterday, but i know alot of friends and family that have used the product and they love it..<br>  <br>  Honestly You Should Really Try It :)<br>  Good Luck|`|4Mbvh3RVaa	I agree that you should use products that contain benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. There is a Regimen on the acne.org website that works really great. I have trouble with acne myself and am currently using that regimen and it is working really great!<br>  <br>  The regimen includes a kit including a very mild cleanser, then after that applying benzoyl peroxide, and they even provide you with a moisturizer that keeps your skin from drying out and breaking out.<br>  <br>  So go to the website and try it out! It costs about $34.02 + S&H for a 2 months supply. It is money that will be well worth it because these products really work.
ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	They are damaging to your hair, as are most extensions. They should be applied by a professional at a salon and can last up to 3 months, depending on how fast your hair grows out. It takes work to get them out, though... Lots of heat which is damaging on its own, let alone in combination with glue and chemicals. <br>  <br>  I would stick with the clip-ins. The Jessica Simpson line is a really good one and would cost about the same as getting glue-ins, except you'd be able to use the clip-ins over and over again (so long as you keep the same hair color).|`|xdyM3IVmaa	I have done glue-in extensions countless times, and they have not damaged my hair at ALL (and know, my hair has been fried from over-processing, going from dyed black to platinum blonde). I have always done them myself with latex glue (which is easier on your hair). If you pull on them constantly, they are bound to do some damage, but if you are good to them, wash and condition regularly, you should have no problems. A lot of people who do glue-in extensions think they're losing a lot of hair when they take them out, but the reality is that the hairball of natural hair you get afterwards is because of natural shedding during the time you wore the extensions. When they are glued to your hair, the hair that naturally sheds is caught in the glue as well, and can't come out until you remove the extensions. <br>  <br>  Mine last around 4-5 weeks generally. I swim and work out and shower daily, so they're not too horribly affected by it. <br>  <br>  With good bond remover, they are easy and painless to take out. They slide right out of your hair. Getting the glue remenants out can be the hard part for someone who's never done it before. But a good 3-4 shampoos directly after removal will get rid of all the glue and oil remenants and leave your hair in great shape (I use an oil-based remover, which deep conditions, too. lol).|`|xPkNM9cOaa	Yes, glue-in extentions are damaging.  It is very easy to apply but very hard to get off.  Even when you take the track out, the glue is left in your hair and it is very difficult to take out.  You have to use alot of oil to get the glue out.  I hope this helps|`|yI7SIzA7aa	It is all a matter of opinion! If they are put in professionally and not worn for very long, they should be fine if your hair is healthy. If your hair is damaged already and you do them yourself, you could be asking for trouble.

dWabjPVQaa	i cant see the pic, but here's an idea:<br>  dye the bottom 1/4 inch of your hair pink and see if the color works for you. if not, cut it (its only 1/4 of an inch) and try with a dif color. keep doing this til u find the color you like. them dye the streak.<br>  make sure you keep your hair healthy when you dye it!<br>  ps: if your hair is dark, you may need to bleach the strand of hair. bleaching is awful for your hair, but if you really want the streak, do it. <br>  pps: you should also bleach the bottom when your testing to see the exact color.<br>  hope this helps!|`|EV4W2AXFaa	can't see the picture|`|lGclixPuaa	The links don't work, sorry.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220104108AAysVGx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Your pic isn't coming up.

kCdISEGqaa	Just like every other trend, I think the biomechanical tattoos will come and go.  Even though the trends occur, there is always a staple of tattoos that stick, those are the traditional Americana style tattoos.  I try not to look too far ahead, I just take the trends as they come.  Not to offend anyone, but hopefully it's not tribal again!!!|`|1M90Aoytaa	tattooing is an ancient art - in many ways its unchanged for many years and is oth tribal and ancient so i dont think it will change - the process may change, such as needles etc but i dont think it will change much|`|g54tGcRvaa	Hmmm...

C0HZ8ZB4aa	I'm not a fan of flash either. I just couldn't imagine walking into a studio and picking something off the wall. It's too impersonal and unimaginative for me. But that's just me. There are plenty of people in this world who are 'against' tattoos in general and would take away people's right to be tattooed at all if they could. I hate those judgemental pricks. And if I applied this judgement to people getting flash, I'd be just as bad. At the end of the day - everybody is a winner. The flash artist can continue to make money by selling their drawings. The tattoo artist continues to make easy money. The person who gets the tattoo walks away happy. Just because they're of a different opinion to me doesn't make them in the wrong. Anybody who is of legal age, saves up the money and can sit through the pain deserves a tattoo. But I just think that most of us wouldn't consider someone who just had a couple of bits of flash that they thought about that day to be a real member of the 'tattoo culture' as it were. They're just a different type of person, and they often (perhaps not always) don't have a real appreciation of tattooing as an artform like most of us do. But it doesn't matter. They're not hurting anyone. So let them get on with it.|`|UYnZtJ2daa	Has anyone that is largely anti-flash actually looked at some good flash at places? I don't know about ya'll, but while I've seen boring simple flashes that are like small tattoos, but I've also seen some larger more original flashes. Things that I would maybe take inspiration from and tweak some things. <br>  <br>  Also, what people get tattooed on them doesn't bother me. It's not my body.|`|rOj4B5QNaa	I hate flash for myself, but some people love it.  I also am not a fan of little tattoos, and prefer pieces but some people want something little.  To each their own!  As long as no one's making me get it I could care less what others put on themselves, and as far as artists go, they aren't artists just tattooists if they only do flash and no custom work.  To me you have to earn the right to be called a tattoo artist and that means being able to freehand someone's idea or concept.  I had my arm drawn on for 2 hours the other day to start my outline for my half sleeve and the only thing that he had to reference was a flower book so I could know the names of the flowers that he was putting on me.  It's going to be a wicked piece and I'm glad I chose the artist I did! :)|`|eN5xA6RKaa	i think it should stay. it gives people ideas. i look at flash and then tweek whats on there and change things and then i get my design tattooed on me..it helps visually because it give people ideas. im not a fan of getting straight flash tattood on me, but i do think it aids people in deciding what they want. and some people want plain simple things that are on flash, i see nothing wrong with it.|`|d185f39553435f17970e180ddffe3d53aa	In my opinion all flash should be destroyed.  I totally agree with you, if you and your artist can't come up with something original than you shouldnt be getting a tattoo.|`|6zblh7Tiaa	To each their own I guess, Flash and unimaginative, unoriginal people keep tattoo artists in business.|`|oE0ApHqPaa	While I'm not a fan of walking into a shop and picking something off of a wall, I don't think that we should take that right away from anyone.  I know lots of people who have flash tattoos that turned out nice and that they love, and I also know people who have used flash as a jumping off point for a custom piece.  Great artists make flash sets, too, and I think vintage flash has a value all its own.<br>  <br>  Who are you to say who deserves to mark their own bodies or not?  No one likes an elitist, so try to be more open-minded.|`|clInlnIqaa	I just don't like seeing all those tattoos that are so overdone. Especially when girls get the same thing just because they are cute. I'm not a fan of any of those. But a Marines friend of mine has the praying hands with holding his dogtags.

LrsGIkJQaa	Seriously, don't get a relaxer unless you really have to. I relax my hair because it's thick and frizzy as opposed to curly. If your hair's like the picture then you don't need a relaxer.<br>  <br>  Get a hairdryer with a comb attachment (you can also buy separate attachments that are universal and so fit most hairdryers - do a Google search). After you've washed your hair blow dry it using the comb attachment and a little hair serum. Afterwards use hair straighteners. Very simple - and it definitely shouldn't take you two hours - more like half an hour if that. Try it first and then see if you really want to risk ruining your hair with a relaxer.<br>  <br>  If you're really set on getting a relaxer don't go for a cheap one. Too many hairdresser's relax hair and they don't have a clue what they're doing. Plus relaxers can cause a lot of damage to your hair. <br>  <br>  Sorry. I haven't really answered your question. I just think curly hair is gorgeous and pretty easy to straighten yourself without the use of chemicals. And this way you still have the option of going curly if you want to.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	I'll give you my opinion from experience with mine and my daughters who have curly hair like yours. If you get a professional relaxer on your hair, you'll have have to keep it up or you will have curly roots and straight ends. It's real awkward when it grows out! I wouldn't recommend it at all. It's very hard on your hair. I would embrace your lovely curly hair. My daughters now love their hair because they are pretty much wash and ware.

I consider them smart and timeless.|`|K4Pwd3kfaa	What do you mean, "Is it preppy or is it better???". Ralph Lauren is both "preppy" and "chic" but the word that I use to describe Ralph Lauren is class! And of coarse he's a far cry from Abercrombie, Hollister, and AE. He's practically what MADE "preppy"! Everyone else except for J.Crew and Tommy Hilfiger is just a much cheaper, cheesier, copy of the true designers for preppy/classy clothing. Many things are different about those stores vs. Ralph Lauren, J. Crew, Tommy Hilfiger, etc.<br>  One example is, have you ever seen J.Crew plaster they're name on they're tops??? No. Another ex. is, do you see Ralph Lauren destroyed jeans??? If you have they're fraud. Hollister, Abercrombie, and AE also don't carry equestrian wear...but Ralph Lauren does! Do you get what I'm saying??? I just don't get how people even put RL in the same category as those other stores...it makes no sense.<br>  Anyway, I hope that I clarified that topic pretty thoroughly. :)

JbSebJJYaa	DO NOT USE LEMON JUICE !<br>  <br>  Buy Shimmer Lights Shampoo. It's a purple shampoo that helps tone and brighten blonde hair (: It works amazingly.<br>  <br>  Also get a really good conditioner so it's shiny. The color will also look different (:<br>  <br>  Good Luck !<br>  <br>  - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Lemon juice will dry it out even more.<br>  <br>  Use a good quality blonde shampoo and conditioner - and you can have it done again fairly quickly, but have a good conditioning treatment done at the same time.|`|AA11461724	you can try touch of sun, or sun in ... they're both a liquid spray that you spray on your hair and sit in the sun or blowdry your hair dry and it lightens us your hair some. sitting in the sun works best, if you have a sunny day. it's like the same thing the sun does during the summer, only in one day. the more you use it, the lighter your hair gets. you can spray it all over your hair or just work it through a few selected pieces for a highlighted affect. it's great for blonde hair 'cause it makes darker hair brassy.|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	Don't do lemon juice + sunlight. The sun will completely dry out your hair. In fact, color-treated hair should always use shampoos and conditioners with UV protection in them, as well as hair product with UV protection. <br>  <br>  Either use specially formulated shampoos to lighten hair (which can be purchased at Sally's) or try spray-on highlights (available at Walgreens).|`|593f5a959e494d93b72266dbf2f2bd3faa	camel piss-it's used in parts of north africa and it's organic|`|VwEUO6reaa	lemon juice and sunlight|`|YZtzjq0Oaa	lemon juice. <br>  wait for a really sunny day, ask your mate to help squezze loads onto your hair, and bathe in the sun all day :) remember sun lotion and sunglasses lol.

EDJ8heifaa	Stay out of the sun.  Fair skinned people are usually born with it, due to heredity.  If you are dark skinned the only way to become whiter is by harsh chemicals and that's not a good idea... example: Michael Jackson.  But if you are caucasion and you want to be whiter, just stay out of the sun.  If you want soft skin, use body lotion with Shea butter on a daily basis.|`|roGXVGFOaa	There are certain creams that whiten the skin.|`|JbSebJJYaa	Just stay out of the sun and always protect your skin. Exfoliate !!|`|v4I9Azddaa	lotion your skin

AA11461724	if your hair is already blonde, you shouldn't use bleach, it's too damaging unless you know what you're doing. but if you want to go really light, you have to do some sort of bleaching. here are your options. if you want more natural looking blonde without bleaching, loreal superior preference makes three shades of blonde hair dye that lift your natural color up to three levels. other brands can only lift hair two levels. they are called "les blondissimes" extra blonding color: extra light ash blonde, extra light natural blonde and extra light beige blonde. they're great 'cause they're for blondes only. you can find them here, to see what the boxes look like: <a href="http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/default.aspx#page=top{nav|media:_blank|overlay:productdetail//objectid+HCo12_38//|diagnostic:_blank|main:brandpage:superiorpreference|userdata//d+d//}" rel="nofollow">http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/de...</a><br>  if you want to really lighten up your hair, clairol makes a product collection called "born blonde". they are bleaching kits to acheive the most natural looking blonde in one step. there's one for lighter blonde, darker blonde and light brown and one for dark brown to black. don't use the one for dark brown to black, it would make your hair white since your hair is already blonde. you can choose from either of the first two: <a href="http://www.clairol.com/niceneasy/born_blonde/product.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.clairol.com/niceneasy/born_bl...</a><br>  those are great and give natural looking ultra light blonde shades without the harsh damage of traditional bleach. good luck blondie!|`|JbSebJJYaa	Neither to be honest. If box colors and bleach kits were amazing and great for your hair, then there would be no need for hair stylist and professional products ! Trust me. I've seen TONS and TONS of damage and bad hair color from at home trials.<br>  <br>  <br>  Go to a salon and get a few highlights first then add more if you like it the next month ! Be beautiful !<br>  <br>  - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|iPje1iyGaa	If you want semi-permanent (washout) try Clairol Natural Instincts.<br>  <br>  If you want permanent try Garnier Nutrisse.  It smells the best and doesn't damage your hair as bad as others do.|`|07daae5d5130f8149c2e2d0943a85afaaa	Don't mess around with your hair go to a reputable hair salon.|`|wUv7Ohpzaa	This is a situation that is encountered on a daily bases in the salon, Clients wanting to change their hair colour and we the hairdresser's being concerned about the health and integrity of the hair.<br>  <br>  To answer your question; colouring your hair is less damaging then when your hair is bleached. But as your hair is already a darker shade of blond and your desired colour is only 2-3 shades lighter than what you have colour has the ability to lift up to 4 shades. <br>  <br>  Just be careful when selecting your colour, try to stay away from ash tones and go for more of the N tones.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	All hair color damages the hair(Semi-permanent, by the way, Only goes darker.), especially Bleach, Personally, I suggest going to a Salon and using Salon Color(For me, It's better then 'homemade' color.)..|`|dzbblpjgaa	Most hair colour change products will contain both peroxide and ammonia. I know there are claims for more gentle products but not fully convinced about the safety. Semi permanents are safer but not effective for what you want. There is no way out Blonds have to bleach.<br>  <br>  Not sure how much flower and herb extracts work on blond hair. Callomine flowers are thought to brighten the hair. It would be more natural to use products that contain these and health shops have lighter shades although I have only used brown on mine. These products work and do not ruin the structure of the hair. I do use more conditioner but my hair is dry anyway. My scalp is also less irritated by the herbal content of these less well known brands. I think it is called Herbal Life. <br>  <br>  Trying to do it yourself it can be difficult to gauge the shade without a strand test. This is ok if your hair is the same tone all over. Best seek professional advice. :)

And if you are already self conscious about it then you need to get them so you don't feel that way anymore.|`|PQRcItmdaa	No, I don't think it's necessary.

S08ntp1Yaa	You can try a purple shampoo that you can pick up at a beauty supply store.  I'm pretty sure the name of it is Shimmering Lights but someone in the store should be able to point you to it.  The purple in the shampoo cancels out the yellow.|`|dzbblpjgaa	You could try swim shampoo and conditioner for removing chlorine. Blond hair responds to this and can tinge green after treatment and swimming. Give it a go! Also seek advice so it does not happen again, maybe through a good hairdresser.

05dab6b724bf30953a1e211121d9f440aa	Try not to wash your hair every day since this causes the hair to become oily faster. Also try not to comb it when it`s wet because it will break and fall. There are several products that stimulate hair growth but if this is genetic you will need a treatment that consists of shampoo and you will probably need to use it constantly. It may also be a dermatological condition in which case a doctor may be able to prescribe a treatment that will permanently stop your hair from falling. Dandruff can also appear as a result of allergies. For instance this is the case with me. It is not actually dandruff but a reaction of the scalp t certain outside factors. I am allergic to dust and if there is too much dust outside my head will start to itch and I will see small bits of what may look like dandruff. I saw a specialist and he gave me an anti-allergic treatment and now I feel fine. These sort of treatments consist of a single pill that you ingest once a day. However if the cause of you problem is an allergy you should have other symptoms, like dry caught in the evening or itchy skin. <br>  I recommend you go to a doctor first of all because allergies progress with age.|`|608edcf75591e304db08269de91c6d6eaa	do u hav dandruff pbm|`|78e33750c6d52d4978956a12d10dc0acaa	don't use the shampoos daily<br>  keep ur hair clean<br>  don't be tension|`|f10ebdaf0188ca166507aae70c628222aa	are you male? is your mothers father bald? did he go bald early?, if so its just going to happen, if not, go to a doctor and have him check you out, tense emotions cant help.

d1f3edbbc9b3e33cef699645f4c1a23caa	For years I've had the same problem.  I thought, because I had oily, bumpy skin, that surely the answer had to be to use stronger and stronger products to dry my skin out and harsher and harsher exfoliating scrubs to scrape the bumps away.  It never worked.  In fact, it just got gradually worse.  Then one day I decided to try going in the other direction.  I switched to a gentle cleanser (Aveeno positively radiant), a gentle astringent (Oil of Olay), and a light moisturizer.  I washed twice a day (morning and night), used the astringent in the morning, and moisturized before bed, and it actually got better and the bumps smoothed out and went away.  I still have occasional flare-ups with stress, but the change in products basically fixed the problem for me.|`|a9d93d730fc69765c9edb6475254d30eaa	Oily Skin Treatment <br>  <a href="http://skin-care-tipz.blogspot.com/2006/09/oily-skin-treatment.html" rel="nofollow">http://skin-care-tipz.blogspot.com/2006/...</a>|`|AA10558463	check the links below for natural homemade beauty tips to:Skincare/ Acne cure/Blemishes<br>  <a href="http://geebal.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://geebal.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Read...Free Beauty tips on....natural and homemade methods to:<br>  Skincare/Acne cure/Blemishes/Whiteheads/Blackheads/   <br>  Wrinkles/Freckles/Steaming/<br>  Haircare/Dandruff/Hairloss/Hairremoval...  <br>  Henna on hair/Splitends/Oilyhair/Dryhair  <br>  Nailcare/Manicure/Pedicure    <br>  Eye care/Darkcircles/Puffiness/eyebags  <br>  <a href="http://geebal.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://geebal.blogspot.com</a>  <br>  <br>  Free beauty tips on Makeup/Hairstyles & photo gallery/   <br>  hair highlighting/Weight loss etc...   <br>  <a href="http://geebal.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://geebal.blogspot.com</a>|`|bdd831e963d46e3743f39e7201a0fdccaa	neutrogena have really good products.

I trust the second study more than the first. To help you better understand what all these numbers really mean, please read all my post. <br>  <br>  By age, the averages found were:<br>  <br>  <br>  First Study<br>  Age....... Size <br>  12....... 4.1" (104 mm)<br>  13....... 5.1" (130 mm)<br>  14....... 6.0" (152 mm)<br>  15....... 6.1" (155 mm)<br>  16....... 6.3" (160 mm)<br>  17....... 6.5" (165 mm)<br>  18....... 6.4" (163 mm)<br>  19....... 6.2" (157 mm)<br>  20....... 6.2" (157 mm)<br>  <br>  Second Study<br>  Age....... **Erect Length (inches & centimeters)<br>  11....... 3.0" (3 and 0/16ths") 7.5 cm<br>  12....... 3.8" (3 and 13/16ths") 9.6 cm<br>  13....... 4.8" (4 and 13/16ths") 12.3 cm<br>  14....... 5.4" (5 and 6/16ths") 13.6 cm<br>  15....... 5.6" (5 and 10/16ths") 14.3 cm<br>  16....... 5.7" (5 and 11/16ths") 14.5 cm<br>  17....... 5.8" (5 and 13/16ths") 14.8 cm<br>  18....... 5.8" (5 and 13/16ths") 14.8 cm<br>  19+....... 5.9" (5 and 14/16ths") 14.9 cm<br>  ** Some inch rulers use sixteenths (16th) increments rather than tenths. <br>  Top numbers are inches and tenths noted in decimal. Bottom numbers are inches and sixteenths noted in 16ths". You need to count how many lines there are between each inch on your ruler to determine if it measures by tenths or 16ths.<br>  <br>  Conclusions: <br>  The average adult penis size is about 6.2 inches or (157mm). It is interesting that in this study, penis size 'peaks' at age 17. Since penises do not get smaller as a male approaches age 21, it can be concluded that boys aged 16, 17, and 18 are most likely to exaggerate the size of their penises.<br>  <br>  Penis growth among teens differs widely. For a young male, trying to interpret a table of averages is not necessarily easy nor beneficial. Young men who read this may try to make comparisons with themselves and this table. I advise any concerned teen (or concerned parent) to use this table only as "average reference". Remember, when an "average measurement" is listed, that means approximately 50% of all young men are shorter than this number (and about 50% are larger). Less than 1% of males are exactly average. That means less than 1 out of 100 men will match the average number exactly. Beware that averages are actually known as "statistical means" and they are typically used in the context of medicine and statistical sciences rather than personal counseling. Nevertheless, the table can still be used as a good reference for average penis growth over time.<br>  <br>  The table above is a collection of measurements from doctors and pediatric physicians. They do not measure the boys' penises while they have erections. The length of the erect penis can be determined by stretching the flaccid penis from the tip as far out as it will comfortably extend. It is then measured from the tip to the base while flaccid (and still extended). The measurement is then taken for the medical records of boys who have had developmental concerns, urogenital diseases, or penis injuries. It does not take long for a group of physicians to determine averages and normal variations when they see hundreds of patients per year.

The face makeup has a lot of oil because that makes it cheaper to manufacture. I suggest using neutrogena tinted oil-free moisturizers to clear up your face first, and then start using an oil-free powder. Personally, I think Loreal has a great compact powder foundation.

All of its products are hypo-allergenic and non-comedogenic (tested against allergies and won't clog pores).<br>  At Sephora, there's a lot more selection, but it's important to look for the same qualities. Look for products that have more natural ingredients, as opposed to a bunch of crazy chemicals.<br>  Also make sure to find a sensitive skin moisturizer that you like. Put it on first, so not as much makeup can irritate your skin. Try Aveeno Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer.

Pantene is full of silicon.. that is why at first, your hair feels great.... over time, as you continue to use it, it coats your hair so much that it is sealing the hair, and no moisture can get in to keep it healthy, and it eventually gets so dry that your hair snaps off... basically, Pantene WRECKS your hair.

I have a friend who made herself sick by doing this thinking she could become healthier! Trimming your hair stimulates growth. Also go to your local beauty supply store and where the brushes and combs are you should see a round plastic brush. (really cheap!) you should use this to stimulate your scalp when you wash your hair.Blowdrying while using products that increase volume will help.              with making your hair thicker.

This style can be sleek and sexy, you can leave a thin strand in the front and spiral curl it with your curling iron.   To get a good bun take the ponytail and open it right in the middle so that you will have that little hole in the center then wrap one side around and then the otherside.  pin each side with hairpins or a nice hair clip or just wrap a nice scrunchie around it to hold it secure.  make the ponytail tight enough to hold down the poof but not so tight that you are uncomfortable all night. <br>  <br>  You can also try to pin it up in a french roll...get the brush and mousse or gel and slick it up, roll it and pin it. Also a sexy style if done right.<br>  <br>  LASTLY...GET YOU SOME NICE HATS FOR OCCASSIONS LIKE THIS.

Do not towel dry your hair; use the hair dryer on medium setting to dry for the first few minutes and then on high and straighten it out. Use some hair shine as you finish straightening. This will work flawlessly with any occasion. <br>  <br>  If you have no time at all to do all the above then depending on how long or short your hair, the other trick with frizzy hair is to use some anti-frizz/shine and pull the hair tightly back from the face using some decorative clasp. Hope this helps|`|e8bb2aec69c61ff4e03ab84535ae81f7aa	I used to do this:<br>  Wash hair or shower before I leave.  Dry hair with towel my sqeezing water out.  Apply baby hair detagler and comb hair.

Please don't take these tips lightly. They are very important . The only thing they require is your time and commitment.<br>  <br>  - Massage your scalp with your fingertips (not your nails) daily to stimulate and promote circulation to your scalp and reduce excess fallout. Invert your head while you shampoo & massage your scalp. This helps promote blood circulation to the head.<br>  <br>  - Essential oils & tea . To stimulate scalp circulation, massage the scalp with rosemary essential oil or rinse hair with tea made from sage.<br>  <br>  - Comb or brush your hair and scalp gently in the morning and at night. This helps break up hardened oils (sebum) that are clogging your hair follicles. Doing this alone has produced new hair growth. Do not over do combing or brushing.<br>  <br>  - keep a distance from dryer's heat. When using blow dryers, always keep the heat a good distance from your scalp and hair. Avoid heating the scalp and hair excessively. Excessive heat will increase hair loss, and excess fallout.<br>  <br>  - Avoid getting hair creams, lotions, styling gels and sprays directly on the scalp as they will clog your hair follicles. Use a light hold spray if you must.<br>  <br>  - After swimming in a pool, shampoo your hair as soon as possible to remove any chlorine residue. Chlorine is extremely damaging to the hair and scalp.<br>  <br>  - Avoid over-exposing your hair and scalp to the wind and sun. Good hair care over a long period really makes a difference!<br>  <br>  - Avoid tight hats and caps as they contribute to poor circulation, depriving the hair of proper nutrition and stunting new hair growth. The sweat, dirt and grime around the rim inhibit follicle health and contribute to build-up.<br>  <br>  - Always consult your health care provider for extreme causes of excess fallout and thinning. A medical condition or medication could be causing hair loss side-effects.<br>  <br>  - Strive for balance and harmony in both your personal and professional lifestyle. High stress factors can cause your body to react by fluctuating hormone levels. This in turn causes excessive oil secretion (sebum) which results in hair loss.<br>  <br>  - Pregnancy, nursing, menopause, and even birth control medication can cause constant changing factors on your nutritional needs and hormonal levels which contribute to hair loss and excess fallout.<br>  <br>  - Avoid "crash and fad" diets. Proper nutritious meals along with vitamin and mineral supplements are a key factor for healthy hair and skin.<br>  <br>  - Good hair care starts with awareness. These hair care tips, if followed consistently, will reduce excess fallout, hair loss, and promote new hair growth.<br>  <br>  - Reduce hair loss effects by increasing your intake of vitamin C found in fresh fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruit and juices, parsley, broccoli, green peppers and black currants. Take a vitamin B complex everyday or brewers yeast. Increase your intake of protein found in meat, fish, liver, wheat germ, dried cooked beans and peas, tofu, cheese, milk and eggs.<br>  <br>  - Take dietary supplements such as Vitamin B6, zinc & saw palmetto. Supplements are useful when you can't get enough from natural food sources.<br>  <br>  - The Chinese believe that hair is nourished by the blood, and therefore influenced by the kidney & liver. Treatment is aimed at these organs using fleece flower root, wolfberry fruit or mulberry fruit.<br>  <br>  - Eliminate stress or else it can be disastrous to your precious hair!<br>  <br>  - Get enough sleep. Sleeping well is essential for the health of your hair as well as for the rest of your body.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There are ways you can help stop the grease from appearing but you have to work at it.<br>  <br>  Do not wash everyday. The cleaner your hair is the more it can seep into your glands and harder it is to get rid of. When you do wash make sure you are washing with a cleaning shampoo and scrubbing the build up off. Take in mind that you also have to have a ph-balanced mild shampoo and lite scrubbing is recommended. Try to avoid conditioner at the roots, apply in the middle or on the ends.<br>  <br>  Try to avoid oil in your daily food intake. And do eat more vegetables. You could visit your doctor but only after you check and consider your diet, drugs, alcohol, and your fatty food intake. Let's face it we see what McDonalds can do to your heart in a month, can you image your hair. You would be dripping everywhere.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's time to change your shampoo. Ask your stylist what she or he would recommend. Avoid using shine products at all costs. Keep away from two-in-one shampoos and conditioners and any frizz serums.<br>  <br>  To fix at the moment, rub a little Talcum Powder on your dried hair at the roots. Just make sure you wash it out. I wish they would event that magic product, but this will help until they do.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Here are 10 tips for to keep your hair strong, smooth, shiny and beautiful!<br>  <br>  1. Keep your diet balanced, and eat protein and calcium rich foods. Stay away from junk foods! This is essential for healthy hair.<br>  <br>  2. Foods and supplements to nourish your hair:<br>  <br>  <br>  * Beans<br>  * Yogurt<br>  * Almonds<br>  * Vitamin B<br>  * Fish<br>  * And of course, the magic potion for beauty - WATER<br>  <br>  3. Before washing your hair, comb it well to make sure all knots has been loosened from your hair.<br>  <br>  4. Before applying shampoo, use warm water (35 to 38 degrees Celsius) to run through your hair to rinse and wet it thoroughly.<br>  <br>  5. When applying shampoo or conditioner, don't use your fingernails to scrape through your hair. Instead, use your palm and fingertips to massage your scalp and hair gently, in circular motions. This will help the circulation and also help to keep your hair shiny and smooth.<br>  <br>  6. After rinsing away all the shampoo, run water over your hair for at least another half a minute (3 minutes is best) to ensure there are no remains of shampoo remaining in your hair, since this will cause a great deal of damage to your scalp.<br>  <br>  7. When applying hair treatment products, do so just after you have washed your hair, so that your hair can absorb all the good stuff while it is half wet. This will be the best time for it to absorb nourishment.<br>  <br>  8. NEVER go to bed with your hair wet! Hair that is half wet is most easily broken, and if you sleep during this time, your hair will be rubbing against each other, damaging your hair in the most terrible way.<br>  <br>  9. Too much pressure may lead to hair loss! Relax... try some good relaxation methods such as soaking in a nice scented bath, listening to music, and eating healthy comfort foods such as strawberries and grapes.<br>  <br>  10. Perming and coloring seriously damages your hair. Avoid it as much as possible. Also, when using hair setting products such as gel or putty, use as little as possible, because they hurt your scalp and hair. Wash them out thoroughly afterwards with a shampoo specially created for removing styling products.|`|42eaf0d5ee34980f3eaade1723a4a352aa	try a different shampoo, and parhaps a bit of conditioner<br>  and don't use a hair-dryer|`|9f4845d19b3fb43f6f9336906ff839d6aa	I would ask around a few hairdressers and also post this question on a parenting site. <br>  <br>  Don't use a hairdryer on it unless you absolutely have to and don't put in tight bobbles which will split it more. Also don't overbrush it. She's still very little and her hair will more than likely grow thicker over time.|`|5d1b5d2da4ad051e9ec52d09fffb9e1eaa	The first step to curing split ends is prevention. Don't brush your hair too often, and when you do, be sure to use brushes and combs with smooth, wide-set teeth. Avoid nylon bristles, as these are particularly hard on your hair. And no matter what, don't brush wet hair. If it is tangled, comb your hair gently with a wide-toothed comb or with your fingers from the ends up, one section at a time. <br>  <br>  Elastic bands - even the covered ones - and hair clips, are other culprits of hair breakage and damage. If you put your hair in a ponytail, use a scrunchie. When wearing clips, take care not to catch hair in the fasteners. <br>  <br>  Of course, the best way to banish split ends is to have your hair cut regularly. In the meantime, be careful not to overcondition it, or you'll end up with hair plastered flat against your head. To avoid this, use a treatment for split ends, a leave-in conditioner with a light hold, or a pomade just on the tips - all these can help to temporarily seal the splits.|`|697211b960de24acb8c8c6a3218303f1aa	Yes, use conditioner & rinse hair with cold water before drying (incl towel drying) as this makes the hair shaft stronger.<br>  <br>  Please don't use garnier fructis, hairdressers have told me that it's really bad for hair.<br>  <br>  Also check that the hairdresser isn't razor cutting the hair as this causes splitting.|`|b313ee34af5d92b5a53b093fff095249aa	Get some nutrients into her hair.. womens' glossies usually have lots of natural ways of doing this .. <br>  <br>  Don't forget the roots.<br>  <br>  Also check her diet - that she's eating healthily.|`|b80b7551e7f7de43f61aead3a910f182aa	you need to use a shampoo with more oil in it.

AA12319961	You can. Three different ways. The first one show here... <a href="http://www.modeknit.com/blog/buttonloops.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.modeknit.com/blog/buttonloops...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.timmelfabrics.com/robyn5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.timmelfabrics.com/robyn5.jpg</a><br>  To do this you can use a matching ribbon to make the loops and stitch them on the inside of the sweaters edge. They should be sandwiched inbetween the sweater and some seam or bias tape for better support, you'll need to stitch that tape down while the loops are basted or pinned onto it. If you know how to knit you could make your own edging with loops similar to the first pic.<br>  <br>  The second way, and I don't recommend it as the knit work may fall apart. But...cut button holes into one side like a regular button down shirt. You'll have to hand stitch them so the knit work won't come apart, use the whip stitch. Then sew your bottons on the other placket.<br>  <br>  The third way is the easiest...add snaps. There's not holes required and they'll be only visible on the inside.|`|AA12054896	You can put a frog on it.<br>  <br>  See here for a picture :-) <br>  <a href="http://buttons4u.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=FR088&Category_Code=pin" rel="nofollow">http://buttons4u.com/Merchant2/merchant....</a>

Go to your piercer and ask what you can do. I would recommend frequent sea salt soaks and maybe buying some ointment. Nothing that would infect your piercing though. Maybe it's a zit? If not, ask a piercer. I wouldn't trust some people answering your question. It's just a bunch of people trying to get 10 points for a correct answer. They might be making things up or preaching. So, like I said, please call a piercer you know and trust.

Honestly, it depends on your hair. If it is really curly, you will need a straightner with real ceramic plates. If it is a little wavy, the Conair will work. Make sure you put some good protectant on your hair prior to straightening and don't do it very often because it will fry your hair (they all will).|`|152be81b1c6f315e2c5487961b126cf1aa	they work really good......be happy|`|4289167734ea9bac6a1320f4ffec08e5aa	they work fine...|`|695bc8c279781b82d31a2b3c67231e88aa	its good it works awsome on my hair lol :)|`|b3c9e0793dad8f800a7150392ed5f514aa	Yes, I have more than one Conair Straightener, actually.

3a61a0d532ce2a9c875f1ccff7345507aa	Aveeno has a daily moisturizer with UVA/UVB sunscreen SPF 30.  It's oil-free, hypoallergenic, and noncomedogenic, so it shouldn't make you brake out.<br>  <br>  Here's an article about sunscreen from webmd:<br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/content/article/65/72707.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/content/article/65/...</a>|`|e2dfd7eb65d0d2120a4565407a8c2ee7aa	You've got several questions here. So I'll answer them one at a time.<br>  <br>  Yes, you are getting the SPF 15 protection from your moisturizer, even though your foundation has an SPF of 6. <br>  And that should be enough if you aren't in the sun for extended periods of time, I assume walking from class to class isn't taking more than 15-20 minutes- not long enough for serious sun exposure. <br>  You shouldn't need to change your product for a higher SPF.<br>  And you don't need to re-apply SPF during the day. That rule is when you are outdoors for more than 3 hours or so at a time. Or when you're sweating heavily, or when you're getting wet (like at the beach or pool.) <br>  <br>  There are many different products made for the face, with a higher SPF. So they are oil-free, won't clog pores, won't cause break-outs, but still moisturize and protect. However, all of the ones I'm aware of are not found in your local drug store. They come from department store cosmetics counters, beauty supply stores, and other speciality retailers, and are a bit more expensive.<br>  <br>  But honestly, you shouldn't need a higher SPF, or repeat applications.|`|6b7f7930c22ec2d4f2d0a43cb8e75ee9aa	<a href="http://ngupta.qbeautyzone.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ngupta.qbeautyzone.com/</a>

179c1bb908324ff275fe30f56a1d7f4faa	Go to any cosmetics counter at a high-end department store; they will do a free makeover for you and give you suggestions.  Keep in mind that you may have "caramel/golden" tones in your skin (summer) versus "dark/blue" hints" your skin (winter). Either necessitates specific color selections that complement your skin tone. Ask the cosmetics person what they think about which tones you have; this should clue the cosmetics person in, instead of their picking the "newest, best" color that may not be the best for you. <br>  <br>  You don't have to buy anything after the makeover, but maybe there will be a lip liner or eye shadow that you like, that is inexpensive. It's a nice gesture for the cosmetic's persons time.<br>  <br>  Then, remembering the colors go to a less-expensive location and buy products there.<br>  <br>  It is really difficult to tell which colors work for you without your mentioning the tones that you have.<br>  <br>  In general, for eye shadow, orange/gold or autumn colors work well with a warm toned person; blues or pinks work well with a winter toned person. Use a good lip liner for your lips; however it should blend with whatever lip stick you choose. You'll have to go to the cosmetics counter and try it out !|`|86c5565c8ee0f4587596378f92fdd2beaa	marron and darker colors. i notcied lately that peach is becoming alot more popular.|`|1358dc444d9a0be01ec4fc4e02c3a498aa	U should always put on the light colors u could find like for eyes u should try light brown and lip color should be like same thing or lighter!!!

If your skin has a olive(greenish) or cool/gray undertone: you can do frosty colors like silver and pink just dont overdo it or you'll look ashy.

For example:<br>  if this is your horizontal row of curlers:<br>  < > < > < ><br>  make each one face the opposite direction of the one next to it. <br>  if that makes sense...its kinda hard to explain, but youll get the hang of it]<br>  <br>  this process takes me about half an hour to roll it (but my hair falls to the middle of my back) and about the same in the morning when i get ready for school. its a huge hit and youll get loose,    y curls that look just like the pros!|`|e47fb0e52f018795215efee2ec67cd33aa	Here a few different ones.<br>  <br>  1.when hair is wet, scrunch it using gell, moouse, and hairspary.<br>  Side part it, keep it neat no loose hair, and put it in a low poy tail!<br>  <br>  2.the top crown and even less then that, considered just the bangs any lenth comb in front of you, section off!<br>  Now put the rest of you hair up in a haigh pony tail!<br>  now whats called a poof hold you bangs back with bobby pins, but leave it neat but poofy!<br>  <br>  good luck!

People with curly hair should NOT make it straight. All you do is ruin it. Then you have to cut it off real short and start over. Go to a professional stylist and ask them what products you should use. They will show you how to use it and how to manage your hair.|`|901163e6338cf8b612f35ae66da057baaa	Don't keep straightening it with a blow dryer.  Don't rely on products.<br>  <br>  Here's 2 great tips:<br>  <br>  1)  For a few days, as an experiment, try "washing" your hair without shampoo.  Use a favorite conditioner instead.  Use vigorous motion to clean your hair and scalp with your fingertips with the conditioner in your wet hair in the shower.  Then rinse and possibly repeat.  (Shampoos, even those that say they are gentle, will often exacerbate dry hair.)  You could still use shampoo once a week.  Sometimes I go for weeks using conditioner and warm water and vigorous motion and the longer I go without using shampoo, the more soft my hair is.<br>  <br>  2)  To help with the curliness, try this:<br>  <br>        a)  With clean, dry hair, comb out the knots, then sprits hair lightly all over with a conditioning sprits (I love Focus 21 Sea Plasma--available only through an Internet search by mail).  <br>  <br>         b)  Re-comb hair through a bit to distribute the moisture.  <br>  <br>         c)  Bend at the waist and comb your hair upside down for a minute.  <br>  <br>          d)  Grab your hair into a ponytail while you are still bent over holdng your head upside down.  Imagine you are a Unicorn and that's about the angle you are looking for with the ponytail on top of your head--NOT at a 90 degree angle from the top of your head (as in the days of the 1960's with the orange juice cans).  The hair should be pointed in a direction of about 45 degrees off the top of your hairline.  Do not use a rubber band to secure the hair as this will leave an unsightly dent in your hair all day.  Instead, move on to the next step.<br>  <br>           e)  Stand up holding onto the ponytail, maintaining the Unicorn direction.  Then, beginning at the end of your ponytail, roll hair tightly backwards around a rolled-up kitchen towel (I fold a thick kitchen towel in half lengthwise, then roll it up into a tight roll.  If you have thin kitchen towels and long hair, it may take 2 kitchen towels rolled up together). If you have layered hair, some pieces may fall out of the ponytail, that's okay if there are only a few.  This may take some practice to minimize this effect.  <br>  <br>       f)  Once you have rolled the roller as close to your head as possible, tightly, clip the roll to your head on each side at a 45 degree angle with 2 extra large butterfly hair clips, making sure to clip some of the hair next to your scalp as well as the edges of the roller/towel to hold it in place. <br>  <br>       g)  You won't look like a Unicorn, but you will probably look like an alien trying to communicate with your distant planet.  Do not answer the door if the doorbell rings, as the UPS guy will run for his life!<br>  <br>       h)   After about 30-60 minutes, gently unroll your hair and let it fall.  It may still be a bit moist, so gently comb it with a wide-tooth comb with minimal fuss and allow it to dry the remainder of the way naturally.  You will eventually determine the right amount of moisture to use for your hair.  You want it to be almost completely dry when you take out the roller.<br>  <br>  This secret Unicorn ANGLE of this method ensures that your hair will CASCADE in a very flattering way when you take out the roller.  It also ensures that there are no marks or dents in your hair from the roller.  You should have straight hair all day, unless it rains.<br>  <br>  Although silicone-based anti-frizz serums are effective to straighten hair when blow drying, I find they work against my goal when I include them with this particular rolling method.<br>  <br>  Now you will have a NEW problem:  the jealousy of other females...sorry!|`|AA10567427	cut it|`|AA11029082	I think you should cut it a little longer than shoulder cut to start of fresh.

0e2af3c0f8ef9113605eb069f26db7c4aa	Most men's cowboy boots have a reasonably sized calf part.  I'm sure if you just buy a boot that fits his shoe size, the calf thing won't be a problem unless he has preposterously large calves.  Just be sure the boots you buy don't run small or large.  I would suggest going to a store so you can ask a salesperson this question.  Is it a big 12 or a little 12?  Also, you would be better off seeing the actual boots before you buy, because, frankly, some are of poor quality relative to price, and some are very good for the cost.  The best thing would be for him to try them on, but as you're getting them as a gift, this probably won't work.  Don't worry about the calf part.  And also, if your dad hasn't worn cowboy boots before, tell them they shouldn't feel like regular boots or shoes.  They take a little getting used to, but after a while, they get very comfortable.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.

617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	Okay, nobody's actually giving you answers ....<br>  <br>  I like to mix oatmeal (raw) with strawberries and a bit of banana.  That is very moisturizing and DEFINITELY smoothing.  You don't need exact proportions.  About 1/2 cup of oatmeal, half a banana, and maybe two strawberries.  If that's a little thick add some honey or another strawberry.  If it's a little thin add some more oatmeal.  Refrigerating it first makes it feel wonderful!<br>  <br>  It doesn't really leave it feeling *cleaner* than before, though.  For that I mix a little sugar or salt with some olive oil beforehand and use it as a gentle scrub.  Then the mask goes on and stays as long as I like (I usually do it while I'm in a bubble bath).

The term mukluk is often used for any soft boot designed for cold weather and modern designs are often similar to high-top athletic shoes. The word "mukluk" is of Yupik origin, from maklak, the Bearded Seal, while "kamik" is an Inuit word.<br>  <br>  Another type of boot, sometimes called an Inuit boot, originating in Greenland and the eastern part of Alaska, are made by binding them with animal cartilage and have a centre seam running down to the foot of the boot.<br>  <br>  Mukluks weigh little and allow hunters to move very quietly. They may be adorned with pompons and beads and may be lined with furs such as rabbit.<br>  <br>  Modern mukluks based on the traditional design have become an upmarket fashion item in the United States and Europe. Notable wearers of mukluks include supermodel Kate Moss and movie actress Gwyneth Paltrow.<br>  <br>  Another kind of mukluk is knitted with a soft leather sole. These are worn primarily by ballet dancers in place of leg/foot warmers.|`|AA10423675	Yes they can be wore outside.Just make sure to take care of em and theyll last forever!And get a good water proofer to put on em also.Good luck.|`|db9b7d47d447d5e3d79f7e5aea199db5aa	Yes, but I sprayed the suede part of mine with a waterproof isolation spray for shoes.

Many things factor into the total equation.  The length of your hair, the texture, your age and lifestyle requirements all play a part in the best style which should be keyed towards you. <br>  <br>  There are good general guidelines that you can follow but the best solution is to find a style that works best for you and all your beauty needs.<br>  <br>  If your face is definitely round according to the above criteria, the best hairstyles generally include:<br>  <br>  1.  Layered rather than straight or heavy bangs.<br>  <br>  2.  Short styles which provide instant height at the crown.<br>  <br>  3.  Styles that add length under the chin towards the top of the shoulders such as shags.<br>  <br>  4.  Styles that keep the sides of your hair short or closer to the face. <br>  <br>  5.  Curls around the crown, but never near the cheeks, to create height.  Keep the sides of your hair short with a curly style.<br>  <br>  6.  Long to very long styles with bangs and a graduated shag or layers so that the face and the neck are given a slenderizing shape.|`|0e70e5b668a71696f4c7d10b472a7f8daa	i have a somewhat round face, too and what's worked for me is long layers and long side bangs. i like to use a flatiron to kind of curl the layers around my face slightly inward. . .just don't do anything too short (especially if you have thick hair) because it'll make your face look too round.|`|AA11967365	Long layers on sides and curl-brush onto your cheeks - it makes your face look thinner and it works for me!!!:)|`|b3c9e0793dad8f800a7150392ed5f514aa	Hi, here is a site for you that includes the best hairstyles/cuts for round shaped, faces.

DONT CUT YOUR HAIR SHORT. i could not tell you how many people decide to go for a short hair cut look when they are a teenager and then come back and say they miss there long hair. sure, a short-cut may look cute, but not many girls can pull it off. long hair is sexy, and you can do more things with it like the jessica simpson curls or anything like that. also, guys much rather prefer girls with long hair. so keep it the same length, or go for some layers.<br>  i also would suggest side bangs, they look good with round faces. <br>  hope it helps ! :]

c6ebe357519ace6e71836544a66fad55aa	Hola Palillo y saludos desde la isla del encanto Puerto Rico!<br>  <br>  Para aclarar la piel puedes utilizar una crema llamada "mantequilla de cocoa"... otros le llaman "mantequilla de cacao", "cocoa butter" o crema de cacao. Viene en crema, aceite y jabón, es natural y no irrita la piel. Es muy importante que cuando la utilices no tomes sol porque puede manchar mas tu piel, así que puedes utilizarla de noche.<br>  También puedes comprar una crema suave de piel sensitiva para quitar manchas y a?adirle pastillas de vitamina E que también es muy buena para quitar las manchas en la piel. <br>  Para no manchar mas tu piel evita tomar sol, usa desodorantes sin color ni alcohol, no utilices productos con acidos como el limon, la naranja, los blanqueadores con peroxido o algun quimico fuerte porque te pueden irritar la piel y trata de no rascarte el área si te pica la piel.<br>  <br>  Mucha suerte y pasa un buen día!|`|1307148f28b29f06a0ca0b577a3a80ddaa	es muy bueno el bicarbonato de sodio o soda en polvo....es buenisiiiiiimo te lo recomiendo..! pues aplicarlo en tus axilas antes de dormir si quieres..suerte.|`|462e6d51c98e52db013924ee4ddc013aaa	usa limon pero solo dentro de tu kasa y despues retiralo si no te mancha mas|`|9d6aeccd537d21951949b2143bd11badaa	usa crema <br>  aclarante|`|d471ddd7d6ec6bc5a2b272c2cf96732eaa	Lo mejor que puedes hacer es hablar con ellas, así puedes aclararlo todo.|`|c3ebd0e31e7b999560697f0f638177edaa	ponte limon...es enserio...t dejara suave y kn el paso del tiempo c aklara|`|cad82e6ea3f0f343c7fd638db26bf18caa	jabón y estropajo|`|1790f6d58d8a3b98aca7f65ab368b9f5aa	hay lociones para eso, pero como tenes la piel sencible te recomiendo q uses limon varias veces al dia.

However, there was one drawback: since the original StriVectin SD formula was designed as a stretch-mark reducer, it contained aromatic agents (such as peppermint) which caused some users' eyes to water when applied to the delicate skin in the orbital eye area...the eyelid and the area directly below the eye. Because of the effectiveness of StriVectin SD at reducing the appearance of fine lines and facial wrinkles, Klein-Becker USA? was asked to prepare a formula that could be applied to the orbital eye area. StriVectin SD Eye Cream consists of the same active compounds contained in the original StriVectin-SD formula, but without the aromatic compounds, and enhanced with soothing agents to help protect the delicate skin around the eyes...it even helps reduce the appearance of dark circles! StriVectin SD Eye Cream is a multi-action orbital eye area perfector enriched with Striadril, an active ingredient containing patented pentapeptides that help to significantly improve the appearance of fine lines by aiding the build up of collagen. Unlike many other anti-aging treatments, Striadril is more stable (longer shelf life), better tolerated (causes less irritation), safer, and more effective.<br>  <br>  <br>  Helps reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and dark circles around the eye<br>  Includes additional soothing agents for the delicate skin around the eye<br>  Same active formula as the original StriVectin SD without aromatic oils <br>  cost about  $ 58.00 on ebay it might be found for less...<br>  all these are great<br>  <br>  I also use Jafras wrinkle treatment patches...they are great before going out... these are all the best i have found<br>  <br>  But one thing I forgot to mention Diet exercise water sleep all are big factors in skin looking its best.|`|91214d9d648252671010ecf1235ceff4aa	The New York Times, as well as many others, recently ran an article (see link below) claiming that the expensive skin creams are no more effective than the ordinary brands.<br>  <br>  The key to wrinkle prevention is sunscreen but insofar as the treatment, different products have different results, so research thoroughly.|`|AA10210050	Not really.

SPF 15 at the very least, but SPF 30 or 45 is best. <br>  <br>  I have had amazing success with Arbonne. I resisted the hype when my sister first started selling and hyping it to me. However, I forgot to pack my usual moisturizer on a trip and ended up using hers. I immediately noticed that my skin felt far less dry and more supple. I've now been using it for two and a half months and agree - it's amazing and worth the price. For whatever reason, it's also helped reduce my occasional outbreaks of adult acne too.<br>  <br>  I use the NutriC line of night cream products. I still find the day line to be too heavy for my skin, but if you live in a dry climate or in the extreme winter cold, would probably be good.<br>  <br>  Also, take my sister's advice, which I did, look for it first on Ebay. can probably get it for cheaper unless you're willing to invest in the whole skin care line from an Arbonne rep. <br>  <br>  Not available in stores.

3857203601e6d96be569acb3c9870a45aa	Curvatura del pene: Como su propio nombre indica, se trata de una malformación congénita o adquirida que dobla o curva el pene hacia arriba o abajo, a la izquierda o a la derecha cuando está en erección. <br>  <br>  Curvatura congénita: El ni?o ya nace con la curvatura del pene o a lo largo de su crecimiento y debido a una falta homogénea de desarrollo, el pene va curvándose. La curvatura congénita mas frecuente es la ventral o pene combo. Cuando esta curvatura es superior a los 45 grados puede imposibilitar una normal relación sexual, ya que se hace difícil, cuando no imposible, la penetración. Además el factor de preocupación aumenta ya que existe la posibilidad de que el paciente no tenga relaciones sexuales por vergüenza por el efecto anatómico.<br>  <br>  Curvatura adquirida o enfermedad de La Peyronie: Es una enfermedad que produce curvaturas de pene o cambios en la anatomía y pérdida, en la mayoría de los casos, de la capacidad de penetración y/o erección. Los síntomas son: dolor en la erección, curvatura del pene, perdida en la calidad de erección, acortamiento del pene y un peque?o bulto que puede apreciarse bajo la piel del pene. En ocasiones, el flujo sanguíneo al pene puede quedar restringido por las cicatrices, haciendo que la cabeza del pene quede completamente floja. Cuando sucede esto, es difícil o imposible conseguir una penetración. Por lo común, la enfermedad de La Peyronie la suele padecer el hombre entre los 40 y 65 a?os. Es una patología que puede estar asociada a diabetes o como consecuencia de sondajes uretrales, traumatismos, roturas de pene...|`|11341a28e8a24a02c7578045e95eeb6caa	se debe a un problema, por lo general corregible con masajes de la forma adecuada, que se debe que ai celulas que son mas "resisstentes" y ams furtes q otras....por lo general de un lado......<br>  <br>  en fin<br>  <br>  aiox|`|462e6d51c98e52db013924ee4ddc013aaa	Epaa k paso Amigo k pasooooo es pura kasualidad o le kontaron jajajajajajaja|`|6386e6d53079f9d35764f437ba13b82aaa	Ni hablar de lo que se dobla cuando esta flaccido, pero el que se doble al estar erecto tiene que ver con la anatomia del mismo, osea con su forma.

Try Ego Boost by BedHead. It smoothes, protects, and seals hair, mending split ends. You put it in the ends of your hair and it will also help stop your ends from splitting.<br>  <br>  dandruff i dont know much about, but i know they make dandruff shampoos like Head and Shoulders as well as Salson Blue. However you might wanna talk to your doctor or dermatologist they might have something prescription you could take. <br>  <br>  as for frizzy hair, get shampoo and conditioner that helps with frizzy hair. for example the Curls Rock line by BedHead is awesome and you dont need to have curly hair for it to work well. (use both the shampoo and conditioner) then theres a light leave-in moisturizer made my catwalk called Fast-Fixx which works wonders. you spray it in wet hair and it detangles as well as makes your frizz disappear and leaves your hair feeling very soft and looking really shiny. i have horribly frizzy hair and since i discovered Fast-Fixx I haven't had to use any other products at all, and i used to have to use tons of different products. it doesnt leave your hair greasy at all either, and its so lightweight that it doesnt cause any product build-up. theres also a creme called Afterparty by BedHead that you can put in wet or dry hair that really helps eliminate frizz, even when its humid outside or raining. <br>  <br>  all these products can be found in professional salons and are guaranteed, so if they dont work out you have six months to return them for a full refund. I swear by Tigi products...the BedHead and Catwalk products. I hope I was able to help!!!<br>  Anna|`|eed9686552eb9a77eae6451b088fa946aa	for frizzy hair i use texture works well.

Podrás reducir tres centímetros del contorno del muslo en tres semanas si tomas en cuenta los siguientes consejos.<br>  <br>  <br>  Claves <br>  <br>  - Con respecto a la sal, cuídate de embutidos, ahumados, mariscos de concha, platos precocidos, empanadas, pizzas y quesos. Evita las aguas minerales ricas en sodio y bebe mucho té e infusiones, también ten cuidado con los diuréticos (pueden resultar peligrosos para la salud). <br>  <br>  - Consume Proteínas. La proporción óptima para que resulten eficaces es de un gramo por cada kilo que peses, 100g de carne proporcionan 20g de proteínas frente a los 8g que aportan 100g de queso fresco.<br>  Es importante que sepas que la falta de proteínas por la noche provoca la persistencia de la celulitis. Cena carnes blancas y aves. <br>  <br>  -Bebe al menos un litro y medio de agua al día para evitar que te hinches, la mejor recomendación es un vaso al levantarse, medio litro por la ma?ana y el resto a lo largo de la tarde. <br>  <br>  <br>  La "cura" del puré <br>  <br>  La primera semana, empieza todos los días de plan de choque que hay que repetir a lo largo del a?o para drenar los excesos de los fines de semana. <br>  <br>  Hay que adoptar la regla de tres tazones de puré de verduras, 300g de proteínas (huevo y carne) y 300g de de queso blanco con 20% de materia grasa. El puré aporta agua, vitaminas y fibra contra el estre?imiento y es un excelente "quita hambre" natural. <br>  <br>  Prepáralo así: dos litros de agua, medio kilo de calabacitas, otro medio de poros enteros, medio de ejotes, un diente de ajo, una cebolla peque?a, una pizca de perejil y sal. Lava las verduras, pícalas junto con el ajo, la cebolla y el perejil. Introdúcelos en la olla a presión, cubre con agua fría, a?ade la sal y deja que se cuezan durante 20 minutos, luego pasa por la batidora y a?ade agua. <br>  <br>  - Evita la sal durante la primera semana. Por la ma?ana, en ayunas, bebe un vaso de agua tibia con jugo de limón para estimular las secreciones digestivas. <br>  <br>  - Opta por un desayuno tipo: Una taza de café, té o leche descremada, dos rebanadas de pan integral o 30g de hojuelas de avena, 100g de queso sin grasa o un huevo duro. <br>  <br>  - La gimnasia anticelulítica, es imprescindible practicarla, ya que no basta sólo con el régimen para acabar con ella. Las hormonas determinan las zonas y la forma en que se acumula la grasa, la actividad física permite tonificar las caderas y los muslos; a largo plazo, la acción conjunta de esta actividad y la dieta, influye en la manera en que el cuerpo almacena la grasa. <br>  <br>  - En casa o en el gimnasio, hay que hacer ejercicios abdominales y de glúteos todos los días para obtener resultados. <br>  <br>  - En la alberca, los aquaeróbics, bici y stepping son menos duros en el agua. También los masajes suelen ser muy eficaces.|`|bfab7ac0d58274cc8de3dae2a900085daa	Es el acomulamiento de grasa en las costados de las piernas que hacen ver que las caderas se vean mas anchas|`|8ed23d91d96306dbf34f3c63145164bcaa	Las Chaparreras son unos bordes que tienen algunas mujeres al lado de las caderas. <br>  <br>  Es un tipo de figura que tienen algunas mujeres y existen ejercicios que las disminuyen sin embargo no desaparecen. <br>  <br>  Es como ser bajita o alta es ya tu tipo de  complexion.|`|u07ddjZxaa	yo creo k son agrurras

Hay quienes lucen bien con los rizos y otros que se ven fatales, y lo mismo pasa con los de cabello lacio, por lo que es recomendable que antes de proceder a rizarse o alaciarse, consultaran con algún experto en la materia.|`|1ck3uwvXaa	a mi me gusta mas ondulado o rizado, lacio se ven como espantapajaros, a menos que usen gel.|`|6c5481de2d58ba9d388c54e963322a66aa	si el chico es lindo no importa el pelo.. pero a mi la sensación que me da en general es que los chicos con cabellos lacios tienen más apariencia de chetos y un poquito metrosexuales xD, mientras que los enrulados son más naturales.<br>  A mi me gusta más enrulados, pero cada quien con su gusto. besotes wapa =)|`|OmRKtAQRaa	ami me gustan con el cabello rizado no se lo encuentro mas chulo pero también el cabello no muy largo ya largo no me gusta pero el cabello lacio no me gusta mucho|`|CDphNvwYaa	estaba convencida que me gustaban los chicos con el cabello rizado... pero me enamore de uno que tiene el pelo reeeeeeee lacio, el secreto esta en como lo peinan, si lo tienen cuidado, pero tampoco que dejen de mirarnos por mirarse en el espejo no????<br>  Suerte! saludos|`|CHpDsK1raa	dependa la cara, pero prefiero el lacio<br>  en los hombres (sin ser superficial)|`|IbJ8W4vOaa	rizado se me hace mejor|`|4617497a38b3fcbb24ba80f82371a452aa	a mi los gre?uditos no me gustan, pero puedo cambiar de opinoin, si hay estilos pero una cosa es que lo tengan largo y no se lo cuiden.|`|462e6d51c98e52db013924ee4ddc013aaa	el rizado me encantan las chicas kon los rizoz definidos
JhldfgNlaa	hola, la ropa tipica es linda sobre todo por que represena la cosmogonia e ideologia de los pueblos, yo me dedico a el dise?o de ropa en alta costura y si vieras las cosas hermosas que se pueden hacer, como tu las llevas sueleser muy casual pero si necesitas algo para ir a una fiesta grande y lucir guapisima sin parecer que te saliste del pueblito sino que por el contrario portas con demasiado buen gusto la moda autoctona yo te podria ayudar, sino simplemente sigue gozando las maravillas que las mujeres artesanas de todo el mundo hacen. indumenti2006@yahoo.com.mx|`|876f2887a549afbce19386a92fdc95b2aa	La que a vos te guste, por supuesto.  Y siempre que no sea ridícula, convengamos.  La ropa es una de las cosas que más marca nuestra personalidad, así que no te prives de usar lo que a vos te guste.  <br>  Suerte!!!|`|WU0Nj65raa	La ropa típica o folklórica no es clásica. A mi entender, es también algo que se pone de moda. <br>  Los looks ''etnicos'' (como le llaman a la ropa típica de regiones ajenas a Europa y EEUU)  son tomados de regiones super dispares y englobadas bajo una etiqueta única. <br>  Por ejemplo, en momentos en que estuvo de moda el look ''oriental'', en prácticamente ninguna ocasión se hizo una distinción o explicación funcional de la faja que sostiene el kimono, o de las túnicas que usamos todas, sin saber si eran árabes o indúes.<br>  Mi punto es que hoy por hoy hay una línea muy delgada entre lo que es la ropa tradicional y la de moda: los dise?adores copian y pegan ideas de todos lados, creando un pastiche que todas compramos y usamos luego.|`|42972405bc5929716e6504bc6827799caa	mi estilo es mas bien tipico y trato de no llamar la atencion. saludos.|`|d80fd993e0444da4c3c4686d0bcf9641aa	Me parece que es una ropa preciosa.   También a mi me encanta.|`|12f8bc7689290526fe0cc4ff06364813aa	Me imagino q con ropa típika te referiras a la q suelen usar los hippis (Ropa de India/ Bolivia.... la tradicionales). Si es asi, te respondo q si, esa ropa me fascina, me gusta muchisimo, desde muy chika, pero si bien tengo ropa asi, no la suelo usar, ya q no me keda bien, por el tipo de cuerpo q tengo, y ademas sale mas cara q la ropa clasica o de moda. Antes me solia vestir con ropa típika, pero ya no, no me gusta como me keda, y prefiero usar lo clasico combinado con ropa de moda.|`|5150c179f0ff85e0280f7d4310e5d444aa	Mi estilo podría llamarse... "casual", que es un término bastante nuevo y me vino de perillas para definir.<br>  Nada "duro" o estereotipado. Cuando algo se pone de moda y me gusta lo adopto, pero en general me gustan los jeans, las polleras largas, pocas joyas (mejor accesorios étnicos) me gusta gustar como a cualquier mujer pero no "enviar se?ales" falsas. Prefiero una cosa sencilla de buen corte y género que resalte mi cuerpo y no a la ropa misma.|`|60e41e781e4fe0684fa8ca97041a0efeaa	segun la tipica me aburre|`|6a87be4eb3c1ebd9da4ca7808f2fafd6aa	Siempre insisto en que uno debe ponerse la ropa  con la cual se sienta cómoda y lo identifique, a mi igualmente me gustan ciertas cosas étnicas especialmente en los accesorios, así que  me parece totalmente lógico, es más eso habla de la personalidad de cada uno y de su estilo propio. Mucha suerte!!!!

b06d2752947c332133b3d703ba6e1c3faa	That's where mine came from. I'm very fair skinned, and the few parts that have never seen the sun don't have freckles. The parts that see the most, mainly my arms, are covered. I really thought they'd go away if I started using sunblock but I still have some on my stomach and it's not seen the sun in a few years now so I guess not.|`|6ac013da2dceabac6383ebdee4f828c0aa	The sun definately plays a part. <br>  <br>  One of my grandmas was a redhead with freckles, very prone to sunburn, and my other grandma had black hair and olive skin that never burned.  I have traits from both of them:  I tan very well but am light-skinned with red highlights in my dark brown hair.  I've never had freckles, but the last couple of years I've noticed them developing on my arms!  Are you light complected?  I honestly don't mind the freckles, but I don't want any more!  I put body lotion with sunscreen on each morning in the spring and summer and it helps.|`|JYXnWWRmaa	well when you have freckles that means you have an extra amount of melanine in your body. soo i would not say that you have skin damage, but i would continue to put on sunblock. you see i am a green bean ( mexican and irish), and i have freckles all over, but i also have rally fare skin so when i get sunburned i can get new freckles depending on the amount of melanine in that particular area.|`|qF1J9Fhraa	It sounds like its sun spots, which are dark, almost freckle like, but usually most are hidden deep under the skin and are only visual with certian light. If some are noticable, a lot of spas do sun spot treatments, which you can get a sun spot cured for about $10 or a whole face for about $100 to $200. Its worth it if there are only a few noticable ones. Ask a laser clinic if you cant find a spa that does this in your area. And research sun spots through google, youll get a lot more information
yzbG8823aa	you have fine hair then. Use shampoo for fine hair 1-2 times a week only. more then that and your hair will look like a fluffy bucket. You can use pomade which is much better then gel.|`|7f19c0f439cebb5ca1b853418ebc22efaa	try using a shampoo just for mens hair.|`|b3a1e3b3c88160d93c3eedea5b897e6baa	Use conditioner as a styling product, instead of gel!!  (Anyone is fine...whatevers in the shower....the moisture from the conditioner, will tame the fluffiness, and not make it dry.<br>  Trick of the trade!!<br>  Good Luck<br>  Ps:  Your hair will feel incredible, every time you wash it....I guarentee it!

Because I once used it but I after 3 days .. i started having allergies.. like white spot on my face. But it really depends, maybe because my skin is just sensitive. My mom used it, and I think it really works. But if you are on philippines right now, the best thing to use if you want to lighen your skin is the "magic cream". It does really work.. and you should try it.|`|VdMeohKsaa	hi there!am a filipina and is using likas papaya soap for years now.it works for me.i was able to see result in 1month of continuous use of the product.you should use it twice a day, and leave it for 5-10minutes before rinsing it off.i also use it in my face.it works for me i guess coz my friends asks me what soap im using.you should give it a try too.|`|yzbG8823aa	depends on your skin tone. should take 2 weeks to notice results. use sunscreen btw
