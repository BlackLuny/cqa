CQA4HAdmaa	Remain calm and don't freak out. You should call Apple Support and see if they can resolve your problem. If that doesn't work, you should make an appointment with an Apple Genius. He/She can look at your iPod in person and let you know what the problem is. <br>  <br>  For now my suggestion is: Again, try to Restore from Disk Mode. If that doesn't work you may need a repair. Do the reset, then after the screen flickers to the gray Apple logo; let go of both buttons and then quickly press and hold the center and play/pause buttons. You should see a black check mark on the iPod screen. Plug it in and restore.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, try putting it on charge for a few hours<br>  <br>  Because you have the latest iPod model, I don't think you need a hardware repair. However, if after meeting with the Genius, if you need service and your iPod is out of warranty; you can either perform the repairs yourself after buying the parts or send your Classic to an after market repair company like Rapid Repair and have it fixed up <a href="http://www.rapidrepair.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rapidrepair.com/</a><br>  <br>  If the problem is with your hard drive, instead of adding an 80GB, you can upgrade and have a 120GB upgraded drive and put in a new battery. If Apple can't figure it out or giving you crap, this company find the problem and resolve it. If all you need is a hard drive, you can buy it yourself and install it. It's easy and there are videos how to do it yourself<br>  <br>  There are parts suppliers that will sell you MK1231GAL ($120) for $100-$120 or you can get an 80GB for about $60-$80. <br>  <br>  Once you get it fixed, it will be as good as new/better.<br>  <br>  I have a 30GB 5.5 Gen Video iPod made in 2005. I prefer the 5.5 Gen firmware over the classic, but will soon upgrade my hard drive and add a better battery than what Apple provides in their Classic. Because the 30G 5.5 gen and 80gb Classic are the same size, the hard drive, screens, cases, click wheels and battery parts can all be shared.<br>  <br>  Video iPod should last for a long time as parts are always plentiful.<br>  <br>  The red X on the Classic seemed to be a problem with that model.|`|fGRuRzrlaa	hey, using that site, i found that you need to restore it.<br>  <br>  put you ipod into disk mode (reboot it (hold the center button + the menu button) then as soon as it turns off, switch your fingers to the center button and the pause/play button.<br>  it should come up and say disk mode, then use iTunes to restore.<br>  <br>  the cause should be a software/firmware/os failure|`|7cCY6Iehaa	This means your iPod crashed, most likely the hard drive.<br>  Same thing happened to me a couple months back,<br>  It's heartbreaking D:<br>  what Gen. iPod is this?<br>  Oh and, did you try www.apple.com/support/ipod?

Be aware that by doing the esn change to an older phone, sometime you lose features that you have gotten used to.

I've heard wonderful things about it.|`|1F6KJt0oaa	I agree with Shorty check out Dpreview.  I want to add though that you may want to expand your horizons a bit.  There are some other good entry level cameras in the price ranges you are talking about with these that would be as good or better for what you want to do.  Nikon has some but I always recommend my personal favorite Pentax.  Since you don't have a film camera system or older DSLR you aren't already married to one system or the other.  I like Pentax because you can use any of their lenses with the camera (M series and M42 mounts have some limitations but nothing major) and some of the older lenses are pretty cheap but are really good quality glass.  I will also just say that if it were  me choosing between the cameras you have listed I would go XSi with little reservation.  I actually like those cameras pretty well.  I have played with and XTi and liked it the XSi is an update of that camera so I imagine I would like it just as well but with more features and better resolution.

xTioPxaVaa	I've heard some great sounding solid state amps (Roland JC-120), and I heard some tube amps that sound like you plugged your guitar into a wood chipper.<br>  <br>  It really comes down to what style of music you want to play, and what sounds good to you.  I'd say that 80% of the guitarists (semi pro and pro level) play tube amps (and conversely, probably 80% of bass players use solid state).<br>  <br>  And yes, while the majority of guitarists use tubes, there are a few notable exeptions:<br>  <br>  B.B. King - his favorite amp for the past few decades is an old Gibson L-5 solid state.<br>  <br>  Ty Tabor (King's X) - He had what I consider his best tones on the first 3 albums.  He was very secretive about his rig.  It finally came out that he used a preamp out of a Gibson amp, throug his effects, and then to a PA amp.  Solid state all the way.<br>  <br>  The Edge (U2) -  Uses a multiple amp set up, and usually has a Roland JC-120 and a small solid state Randall amp in the mix.<br>  <br>  The other thing to consider...there will be maintainance costs associated with a tube amp.  They do wear out after a while and must be replaced.  How often depends on how often and how loud you play.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention anything about what I consider the third type of amp, and that's the digital modeling amp.  It's not tube, but it's not a linear amp either.  The signal gets digitized, and the tone and distortion is derived in software.  And I know that most tube purists will tell you that they wouldn't touch one of these amps if you gave it to them.  But, I'll share this and then shut up about that debate.<br>  <br>  Kendrick Amplifiers is a small boutique amp manufacturer and repair/mod company north of Austin.  It's owned by a guy named Gerald Weber.  Gerald builts some really amazing (and expensive) amps, and can fix anything out there that glows.  More than once, he's sat 10 feet from me at a club gig while I'm playing a Line 6 Vetta, and more than once he's shaken his head and stated he didn't know how they did it but he would swear there's a tube in that amp somewhere.  I think part of it is Gerald is being nice, but when I hear that amp on playback, I have to shake my head a little as well.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that you need to go out, plug in, and listen to as many amps as you can.  Don't get too hung up on what's behind the panel.  It you like what you hear, and it's in your budget, then you're good.<br>  <br>  For tube types, I'm really liking the tubes that Electro-Harmonix is selling these days.  I haven't tried their 6V6, but their preamp tubes are very good.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Ken gave you some great advice. I had been a professional drummer for over 16 years before I decided to learn guitar. From being in bands so long I knew the type of sound I wanted but didn't know much about amps in general. I took one of my veteran guitar player friends to the music store with me, had him plug in with my Tele and play every amp there in my price range. I listened to all with no preconceptions about tube vs. solid state vs. modeling, etc. When all was said and done the Fender Hot Rod Deluxe (tube amp) sounded better to me than anything else. I find that I do prefer tube amps personally, but not everyone will. I have since gotten into smaller amps since I still play at home mostly. I picked up a 5 watt Epiphone Valve Jr. and had the BitMo Trio mod and tube upgrades performed. Also pickup up an Orange Tiny Terror 15 watt mini stack. Both of those amps are great for lower watt amps in my opinion. You can pick up the Epiphone for around $250 and the Tiny Terror for just under $1000. The one mistake I did make is that even though the Hot Rod Deluxe sounded great in the store it was too loud for home practice which is why I bought the other two amps. Just something to keep in mind. It is hard to find an amp that is appropriate for both practicing and gigging in a larger club so think about what you want out of this amp before purchasing.|`|m5WpvVRhaa	It should not even be a debate, tube amps, without a doubt produce harmonics transistors will never produce and therefore you get a much better quality sound.<br>  <br>  Transistor amps are, for the most part, consumer grade electronics. They are less expensive to maintain and convenient.<br>  <br>  Tube amps are more expensive to maintain, but you get a much better quality sound. However, your audience will dictate which sound equipment you should use.

I91lFgTdaa	There are lots of ways to hook all of this together. The most simplest way is to first hook up HDMI from the DVD, DVD/VCR to the Reciver which requires 2 HDMI cables and plug them into the DVD Input on the back of the Receiver. Then take 2 other HDMI cables plug them into the Receiver that says Output and plug them to the HDMI input you want into the TV. Then plug all power cables into you power center then take the power cable from you power center and plug it into the wall. <br>  <br>  Also you can do this will Regular AV cables but that you not match you system and get the performance you want.|`|AA11017655	Wait a minute.  You have a $1400 receiver, a $2000 TV, and they didn't hook it up for you?  At least pay the store the extra $100 or so to hook it up if you don't know how.<br>  <br>  Your receiver's manual can be found at <a href="http://us.marantz.com/DFU_SR7002_SR8002_final_eng.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://us.marantz.com/DFU_SR7002_SR8002_...</a><br>  The connections chapter begins on page 31.<br>  <br>  Your TV's manual can be found at <a href="http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/200805/20080507184833593_BP68-00658A_01L02_0422.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/conten...</a><br>  The connections chapter begins on page 10<br>  <br>  Your receiver has 4 HDMI inputs.  Get HDMI cables to connect all your components and use your receiver to switch between them.  If your cable box doesn't have an HDMI out port, then you'll want to use component cables if the cable box supports them.<br>  <br>  If all your components don't have HDMI ports, I'd upgrade them.  No point in having a $3000 home theater system with crappy components.  You should be able to swap out your cable box for a newer one for free or for a nominal charge if the new box comes with a DVR.<br>  <br>  At any rate, I assume you already have the cable box connected to the cable company's feed.  If your surge protector has a cable protection connection, then disconnect the cable from the cable box, connect the cable to the F-Connector in, and run another cable back to the cable box's F-Connector out.  Plug the cable box's power cord into the surge protector.  Connect an HDMI cable from the cable box to the Marantz's HDMI 1 input.  Connect another HDMI cable from the Marantz's HDMI out to one of the Samsung's HDMI in ports.  Your TV has 3 DVI inputs, and you can connect your PC to one if your video card has DVI or HDMI out.<br>  <br>  Connect the Samsung's power cord to the surge protector.  Turn the cable box, the receiver, and the TV on, to make sure that everything is working properly.  Now turn everything off.<br>  <br>  If your speakers aren't connected to your receiver yet, now would be a good time to do so.  Usually speaker wire is color coded silver and copper.  Make sure you connect the same color on each end of the speaker wire to the same polarity, + or -.  It doesn't matter which color you use for + or -, just make sure if you use copper for + on the Marantz, you connect copper to the + on the speaker on the other end.  It won't hurt the speakers if you screw this up, it just won't sound good.<br>  <br>  Now test the speakers.  Try your various surround sound options on your Marantz to make sure all the speakers are connected and operational.<br>  <br>  Now connect the DVD player to the receiver.  If you have an HDMI connection on the back of the DVD player, connect this to HDMI in 2.  All upconverting DVD players have HDMI ports, so this should be easy.  Connect the DVD player's power cord to the surge protector.  Test all your components to make sure you haven't accidentally disconnected something.<br>  <br>  As for your DVD/VCR, that probably doesn't have HDMI unless it's really new.  If you're not recording anything, and just using it for playback, then just run some RCA audio video cables from the back of the DVD/VCR to the Marantz's video in ports.  If you want to record, then you have several options.  You could just run RCA cables from the Video out port to the Video in ports on the DVD/VCR.  Or you could disconnect the cable from the cable box and plug it into your VCR's antenna in connection and run another cable back to the cable box.  This would allow you to watch over the air tv and record cable.<br>  <br>  However, most people, once they use a DVR, throw out their VCR.  I strongly recommend you get a DVR if you don't already have one.  I also strongly recommend a Blu-ray player, to get the full benefit of your 1080P screen.  Another cool thing about Blu-ray players is that most of them have USB ports so you can play downloaded movies or MP3s from a USB flash drive or hard drive.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your system.  I'm jealous.
r8HAHhgkaa	its new so it tends to be a little stiff from the factory (aka mine was too) after a few days or so mine loosened up so i would say it should be fine. most stores have a t least a 20 day return period so wait it out, do some gaming and return it if it still bugs you. good luck|`|1WgOj89kaa	Yes, new ones are stiff, just keep for a few days and it should be fine then|`|AA11493088	I remember thinking the exact same thing when i got mine but it turns out i was not used to it,you're fine.|`|JDJjWxheaa	Open and see .

Xxviy63Paa	Not sure if they added SD support. It used to be you had to tweak some things before installing, and they seriously discouraged it too. It's made for the HD resolutions and that's what it supports. It's a commercial company and it's not gonna bother with anyone who doesn't like the product as-is.<br>  <br>  Thus you're much better off with Ubuntu. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.psubuntu.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.psubuntu.com</a><br>  <br>  the ps3 installs come tailor-made with tv-size resolutions (576x384, usually, or worse) so that you will only have to put the disc in and answer the install setup questions. Gutsy works great on ps3. If Hardy is working good yet, install that. Intrepid probably doesn't work so great on ps3 and Hardy is the current long-term support release, so it's the one to have if possible. If not, I know Gutsy works, I use it on my ps3. <br>   <br>  when I first installed ps3 linux, it was on an sdtv, and it does work. You may want to resize the windows though. It's a bit dismaying how quickly the screen gets cluttered up with stuff. But it all works, except video you'll have to shrink it to fit probably.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Yes, the PS3 Has LINUX support|`|TXt0oDKnaa	yes you can but i think its harder because you have to type certain command lines but fortunatly theres lots of tutorial on utube|`|6KlNjzbxaa	yes you can, but the words on the screen will be blurry or fuzzy.

AA11234615	If you want to buy something from the iTunes store, you need an account. You will need to set this up with a username (usually your email address) and a password (usually the same you use to access iTunes, if you do that already) and submit credit card details.

tjg7hLbMaa	I am really concerned that you say you have no signal from your wireless carrier. If you had at least some signal I would suggest some sort of amplifier/booster system but I'm not sure how effective it would be if you don't have any signal whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Here's a website about different boosters available: <a href="http://www.alternativewireless.com/improving-cell-phone-reception/better-cellular-signal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alternativewireless.com/impro...</a><br>  <br>  An alternative would be to see if your company offers a UMA service (using a GSM/UMA compatible phone over wireless Internet). All that would be required is a high speed Internet service (which may be an issue for you in the mountains), a compatible phone and a subscription. <br>  <br>  The company I work for offers it for $15/month (unlimited local talk while you're using your wifi connection) or $20/month (unlimited local and long distance in Canada/US).<br>  <br>  Using a UMA service would allow you to still make and receive calls while you are at home (although non-voice service like texting would not be able to get through because you have no signal).<br>  <br>  Another alternative: Perhaps it's just the company you are using that does not have service in your area. Different companies put up towers in different locations. Do you know someone who is on another carrier? Have they been able to get signal at your house? It may be worth it to switch companies (you can take your number to another company and sign up for their services without having to change your number).

tjg7hLbMaa	Downsides:<br>  <br>  - It isn't unlocked (and the person is just selling it as such) leaving you with a phone that you need to get unlocked somewhere or go through the hassle of a return. (which can be a problem if the person selling is in another country)<br>  <br>  - The phone may not have a manufacturers warranty (it could be already damaged by water or be a refurbished phone).<br>  <br>  - Your mobile phone company will not support your phone whatsoever. You will need to figure out how to do things on your own. <br>  <br>  - Services may not be guaranteed. The company that I work for does not guarantee any Internet packages charging the person correctly (or even using any of the services) because it's not a phone purchased from us. (Just on a positive note, services appear to be working fine at this point and charging customers correctly.)<br>  <br>  - You'll need to program in your voice messaging number, Internet settings, text settings, MMS settings (if you're planning on using any or all of those services).<br>  <br>  You've just asked for the downsides so I'll leave it at that. There are some positive things too (mainly cost and the ability to own a phone that 2938423984 of your friends don't already have)|`|aZxbMKRCaa	you are locked into a company's plan for a certain number of months eg 12, 24<br>  <br>  i wouldn't do it if i were you.|`|ipRPrvzxaa	they might have water damage and could cr@p out within a month<br>  also, if it was originally a phone for verizon, and you have ATT, it will not work as well on ATT's waves.

AtLdnZd5aa	i would suggest that you go ahead and pay the few extra dollars, because i have a wii and the controllers aren't very durable. a bunch of them have a problem with the connection on the bottom of the wiimote so that warranty will probably come in handy. i don't think the issue is in the wiimote itself, i believe that it is at the end of the cords from the nun-chuck and classic controllers. but the system itself has fewer glitches than any other newer generation consoles. oh and i know that doesn't exactly answer your question however i hope it helps you to save some money.|`|jKc7aDCwaa	Remotes, sensor bars and other controllers are region free. Games, however, are NOT. There's 3 regions: NTSC-U (USA), NTSC-J (Japan) and PAL (Europe and rest of the world.) A PAL game will not run on a NTSC-U (or J) Wii, and vice versa. <br>  <br>  And if you want to be able to use batteries with other devices, some people recommend the regular AA rechargables but at a cost of convenience of just slipping the remote into a charging stand. I personally have 2 dual charging stand for my remotes, and I like the ease of use, and I've played for 6 or more hours at a time, perhaps longer on a single charge. A bit pricey, but if you play your Wii fairly often, I think they're worth it. (and no, there's no regions for the battery pack or chargers, either.)|`|Fe1Z7fpbaa	the remotes, sensor bar etc are region- free.<br>  games and wiis have regions- japan, europe, and US  i think. japan area games wont work in a europe or US wii<br>  <br>  yes, the charging stand and battery pack is well worth it!!<br>  you save hundreds of pounds/ $$$$$ from batteries!!!<br>  <br>  one last tip: if you want accesories and equipment that works...<br>  DONT BUY THEM OF EBAY, WHATEVER YOU DO!!!!<br>  people lie about whether they work, and will overprice them ALOT.<br>  buy nintendo trademark things, or things which say: compatible with wii on the box..but they dont always fit properly either. id go for nintendo products. theyre worth the extra money!!!<br>  <br>  hope i helped!!!<br>  clo<br>  xx

6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	All digital cameras, including compacts are capable of fast to very fast shutter speeds. Instead, you may be referring to Shutter Lag (the time it takes for the camera to take the shot after you press the button). A camera which suffers from shutter lag, can make it very frustrating when trying to capture movement, such as kids etc. <br>  <br>  However, you DO need a faster shutter speed to freeze movement, so you could use the Sports setting or as with many Canon compacts, you have a 'Kids & Pets' setting, which is designed to capture kids and pets, which generally don't stay still for long.<br>  <br>  You can also buy some compact cameras which allow you to select your preferred shutter speed and/or aperture (look for manual modes such as aperture and shutter priority).<br>  <br>  Many compact digital cameras are quite speedy these days (especially when shooting in bright, outdoor lighting) and have little shutter lag (though, some are still terribly slow). But, shooting in very low light can be very slow because the camera may struggle to lock in the focus.<br>  <br>  To lessen shutter lag, you should half press the shutter button to lock in the focus...hold it there, recompose if you want or follow your subject...and then wait for the right moment to press the button all the way down. <br>  <br>  For fast performance and VERY good image quality, I recommend Canon, but not their most budget priced models.<br>  <br>  Have a look at the link below. It shows the shutter lag of various camera models. Most cameras should be perfectly fine...but, be sure to avoid those nearer the bottom of the list (you can see how terribly slow they are). <br>  <br>  But, when selecting a camera be sure to check what's it image quality is like, because this is the most important thing when selecting a camera.<br>  <br>  good luck...

They are garbage. You will actually increase the chance of RRoD. They were made popular by peoples fears of their Xbox overheating. They provide no benefit. I have had my elite for a year now and it has been left on for many 16+hour days. Sometimes much longer. I have never had a single problem with it. The newer systems have better chips and they use less power. Less power means it will run cooler. I think they use about 15% less power then the launch systems, as indicated by the lower wattage rating on the power brick. Just for the record all 3 Xbox 360's they make now have the exact same internal parts. The new Arcades are the same as the Elites except you get a bigger HDD and a couple extra accessories and it is black.|`|r8HAHhgkaa	it is just as likely to get the RROD. there is nothing to do to prevent it. All xbox 360s ship with a free game called death clock. it starts ticking the moment you get your 360 and ends when it gets the RROD. The thing is the new ones (after 2007) are much less prone. However it still happens. lets hope microsoft  fixes it.|`|QoWi0hzWaa	i belive that sytem can prevent it better then the other systems|`|mDBHMJPjaa	iv heard the Elite and the 360 halo edition can not get RROD. if they can you can prevent it by buying a cooler for ur 360 at gamestop for no more than 20$.|`|q0VxNQSRaa	hey man. yes there is get a inner cooler and try not to leave system on if ur not playing it.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	ALL xboxs can get RROD. but elite can prevent it better than any other systems. <br>  to prevent it?<br>  just do like what you would do to other xboxs<br>  keep it ventilated|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	First off all Xbox's can get RRoD. The newer models are less likely due to hardware upgrades that where made. <br>  <br>  Second be very careful about getting an inter cooler like so many people have said. At the very least never buy a nykos Intercooler. MS states themselves that you should not use it. You are 50% more likely to get RRoD if you use it.<br>  <br>  Third better then using an intercooler install all your games to the HD and run them off the system. You system will not get has hot and and a bonus runs quieter.<br>  <br>  Thats your best bet. The rest is really up to luck. Like I have a release date Xbox and never have had a problem. Hell just yesterday I got addicted to Fall Out 3 and played for 14 hours nonstop and didnt have a problem.

HDjYAecIaa	To answer you second question first, they are the same cameras, just different coloured bodies. This sometimes happens when one colour is not very popular so the retailer offers an extra discount.<br>  <br>  Your first question is more difficult because you have a very tight budget and the answer really depends on your expections and what you want to photograph. If I may put it this way, I would not recommend anyone I know buy one of those cameras - they are really in the "toy" category. Can you find just ￡10 more - ￡49.98? If so, the Fuji A850 would be a much better buy from Amazon with free postage here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001DHN394/ref=s9_k2a_c5_t2?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=1VGQJKDHRJ3BWN7E5WJQ&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=463374953&pf_rd_i=468294" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001D...</a><br>  <br>  Or for ￡42.98 including postage you can get a refurbished Fuji A820 from the fuji store although the guarantee is only 6 months.<br>  <br>  <a href="https://secure.fujifilm.co.uk/shop/consumer/digital/digital-cameras/fun-and-easy/a820" rel="nofollow">https://secure.fujifilm.co.uk/shop/consu...</a><br>  <br>  Either of these Fujis are in a different league to the Hitachi.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|xYFsqRWsaa	no way, its 5mp, most phones are better quality, and the lens doesnt move in and out meaning it has no optical zoom, only digital (just like cropping pics on computer) zooming will gretaly reduce images quality|`|AA11141136	Check out this web site; you can learn a lot about what to buy.|`|cViFUALzaa	no way, this is a very low quality camera, it may be branded hitachi, but its actually a vivitar. when you shop for a camera, dont just look for megapixel,but also for lens quality, glass lens is superior to plastic lens, and glass lenses from known lens manufacturers like zeizz or nikon, will be superior to no brand lenses. consider a low end Nikon l11 instead, its close to the price and the quality is much better.

WY7NKvA0aa	well, like a couple of them said, it really depends on what was said, and also how much you trust the person that said it. but it's important to realize that you can't hear tones or see actions in a text message and the person who said that could easily, easily be lying. of course if it is something unimportant then i would just assume the person is telling the truth. but i would talk in person or at LEAST on the phone for big things.<br>  also, going back to knowing the person you're texting...anyone can be anyone through a text message. you could say anything you wanted no matter how far away from the truth it really is...i wouldn't judge someone based on what i know of them through texting.|`|CCHz9Qd9aa	what do you mean by true..? it's not good for breakups or any important info but it's great for casual conversation.|`|Spmm7bIuaa	it depends on what the information being sent to you. but it's not really the ideal way of sending a delicate or important message|`|E3SJNlIUaa	It really depends on the person, and what do you mean by true?|`|2xveInVWaa	i don't really believe in chain messages|`|WyjRm10jaa	it true..<br>  the effect show..

UtHnh0aHaa	I would not recommend either for sustained use. <br>  <br>  However, I would suggest an heated barney for the body and lenses. If you pack your rig in the insulated heated bag after allowing only outside air to permeate the bag, the relative humidity inside the bag will be dry and the same volume content as the colder air. Even through constant in and out, the lenses will not fog if you follow this trick.<br>  <br>  By keeping the rig above freezing, you batteries will not suffer efficiency loss or any other than normal degradation. Your film will be a lot happier in another compartment of the barney as well. A bag may seem to be a hassle but well worth it once you understand how to work with it.|`|9mTctb7jaa	batteries work by chemical reaction. those reactions slow down when cold. the method used in cold shooting is to keep the equipment warm until ready to shoot. I recommend the alkalines, they have more weight/mass than NiMH and therefore will be slower to cool down. Also alkalines have a higher operating output voltage, which gives them more "headroom" to keep the camera electronics working.
AA10567651	it really depends where you live. In the south east it really well reception, because a company from the south east merged with AT&T.

Regular batteries aren't likely to explode, just the rechargable ones. <br>  Either the speakers are drawing too much power from the batteries (design issue) or you need to use some other battery type that can handle it better.

yFDUecOPaa	TV system is different in USA and Europe.<br>  <br>  However, if you're planning on moving and have an LCD TV you may not be completely out of luck.<br>  <br>  There are a few things to consider:<br>  * TV Signal: European television is broadcast using the PAL standard and US TV is NTSC. The TV tuner in a European TV won't work in the US and vice versa.<br>  <br>  * Refresh rate: European TV signals typically have a 50hz refresh rate while US is 60hz.<br>  <br>  * Resolution: European standard definition is 576 interlaces lines while US resolution is 480i.<br>  <br>  If, however, you are really attached to your TV and it's a modern, high definition TV, you can always use a computer to do the translation for you. When connected to the HDMI or RGB ports on the back of a modern TV a computer will be able to output the right signal. Put in a TV tuner card for whatever region and you're good to go.<br>  <br>  I moved from the US to Ireland and took my US TV with me. I needed a power transformer to get the right voltage for the TV, but the TV was able to take either a 60Hz signal from my US Xbox or a 50Hz signal from my European Xbox. I bought a media center PC with a PAL tuner card to record TV. When I moved back to the US I took out the PAL card and inserted an NTSC card and I was good to go again.|`|SqvU8U2Waa	not to mention the power plugs are different.|`|QQDaVwb0aa	No, USA use the NTSC standard, Europe use PAL, it's quite common now for TV's to support both standards.|`|becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	No, completely different.<br>  <br>  US uses NTSC and ATSC<br>  Europe uses PAL/SECAM and DVB-T/S

j5Apt8hWaa	First unlike P&S cameras where you can change camera brands every year if you want, DSLR cameras are just part of a system.<br>  <br>  Since you already have a Nikon system started, changing over to a Canon will just cost you a lot more money.<br>  <br>  Actually you can buy a AF-S 50 mm f/1.4 lens for your current camera and be money ahead and you will still be able to use the other lenses in your Nikon system.  Eventually you will by upgrading (three to five years) and with the advances in technology by then the new DSLR's well have many more features at a very small price.<br>  <br>  Nikon D90, live view (you will never use it ... holding a two pound camera at arm's length is just asking for camera movement causing blur, unless you are planning on attaching it to a telescope or microscope), geo-tagging, and HD video.  You can look for these features in a few years for nearer $450.  I am sure you don't have all your photo technique established yet, so just spending money on a new camera body before you do will not put you ahead in the learning curve ... it is not the camera the makes the amazing images, it is you, using any fully adjustable camera.  You just have to be patient.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Digital-SLR/25446/D90.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/...</a><br>  <br>  Canon XSi<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=16307#ModelFeaturesAct" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a>|`|AA12133586	the only one that has a live view right now is the nikon d90 which is around 1100|`|d55HYaktaa	Canon 1000D (Canon XS) with the Canon 50mm f/1.8.<br>  <br>  This lens is not very good.... cannot be compared to the Nikon 50mm f/1.8, but for that price... you cannot go wrong!<br>  <br>  The 5 aperture blades generates poor bokeh, and the built quality is like the kit zoom lens.

RyvKws7Laa	DLP and Plasma technologies are as close to the CRT as you'll find.  They are near instant refresh, so handle fast motion great.  So for that regard they are about the same really.<br>  <br>  LCD has motion blur problems with fast motion.  Its also called ghosting because there is a ghost trail behind the fast moving object (as it can't refresh as quick as the object is moving on camera/screen).  You can counter this by getting higher end LCDs that have 120Hz refresh rates (better but still not great) or 240Hz refresh rate (supposedly very good, but wait till you see the price, ouch).<br>  <br>  Plasma will give you top notch picture and top notch motion processing.  The only thing you need be concerned with is conditioning the TV.  Modern Plasmas don't experience the burn-in problems that they used to a few years ago.  But the TVs do need to be properly taken care off.  For the first 100-200 hours of operation crank the brightness and contrast (picture) settings way down.  Then optimize and enjoy the pleasure of plasma.  Also, avoid tilting it ever.  Always keep it upright (so if you have to move it, don't tilt it).<br>  <br>  DLP - can be a great picture.  And the TV components are likely never going to die on you.  There's always a saying that if you buy a DLP it will be the last TV you ever buy.  You do need to replace the bulbs and clean the air filters though.  Both you can do yourself.  The air filters should be cleaned every month or two.  The bulbs will last for various lengths (depends on the bulb, how much TV you watch, etc., just like light bulb).  It could last 1-2 years or it could last you 5 years.  They are about $250 a piece, so factor that long term expense into your budget/math.<br>  <br>  But DLP is a dying technology.  Only Samsung and Mitsubishi really make it anymore (I would stick with Samsung myself).  How long they keep doing it though is another matter.  The bulbs will be purchasable for years and years I'm sure though.  Just something you might want to consider.<br>  <br>  for the TV watching scenario you're describing, I would lean towards Plasma for the combination of picture quality and where the technology is at.  The good Plasmas can be run 24/7 365 for like 30+ years before they die.  So its not like you're getting a TV that will need to be replaced in 10 years or something.  It should last you as long as you'll need.  I would stick with Pioneer Kuro Elite, Pioneer Kuro, or Panasonic Viera though.  The Pioneers are super expensive, but are coming down in price now that Pioneer announced its leaving the TV business.  Panasonic Viera's are top notch though and more affordable.|`|yFDUecOPaa	It all depends on the lighting conditions of your room and, of course, on how much you're willing to spend. :)<br>  <br>  A safe place to start for high-speed content is LCD with a high refresh rate (120Hz). <br>  <br>  To get more specific it would be good to know the size of screen you desire and the price range you're looking at.

Dd86GCZlaa	I use to work at Cingular so I have tried almost all of those phones. <br>  <br>  1. Samsung D407..reception was not good, a pretty basic phone with the push to talk cability that you will probably not use.<br>  2. Samsung C417..its a slim phone however I own this one and it is the worst phone ever. I never ever ever have reception even if i have full bars...i have to go outside a lot to use my phone and i live right next to a tower. I even have exchanged it and have the same luck. <br>  3. Samsung a707..my absolute favorite!! the graphics are amazing, you can download music to it like an ipod but not through itunes, it takes a micro sd card so you can store your pics and junk to it so you wont lose it if you switch phones! i demo'd this phone for a bit and the reception was amazing! the best ever in my house.<br>  4. samsung d801..not familiar with the 801 but the D807 is a GREAT phone! its basically the a707..they both have the micro sc option, both have 1.3 mp cams, but the 807 is more compact, the a707 is a very long phone! my bf has the 807 and LOVES it..its been almost a year that he's had it, and no problems...also he has never had a prob with reception. we can be sitting right next to each other and he'll be talking like he's on a landline and i'll be up and down and around trying to find the right spot to talk without dropping my call. stupid c417:)<br>  5. stay away from all LGs--horrible reception, horrible graphics..horrible phones<br>  6. same<br>  7. same<br>  8. sony ericsson w300i--we didnt carry this one in the store..but we had many problems with other sonys..the screen would freeze or randomly shut off<br>  9. sony ericsson z525a--i also used to own this one, traded it for the c417 when i worked there. i had the 520a before the 525a...as you can see i kept trading it...it was a bad phone with many phone malfunctions for reasons stated in #8.<br>  10. motorola v365--also a push to talk phone..this one is good for contruction workers, it had a rubber coating around the phone like the motorola v551/v557's had. its a VERY FAT phone. you can not go from a razr to the v365<br>  11. Cingular 3125--great phone, its the upgrade to the 2125 which i had the opportunity to demo. the 2125 had some freezing problems that we did not see in the 3125. only get this one if you plan on using email or internet explorer on your phone. otherwise the samsung a707/d807 will do the trick<br>  <br>  overall my opinion is to go for the samsung a707 or d807. you can get the a707 in black, red, or blue the d807 comes in black and you MIGHT still be able to find it in red. if you buy your phone from cingular.com OR a COMPANY OWNED cingular you have 30 days to try out the phone and you can exchange once for a different phone from the original purchase date.

Z53MWyWXaa	do you know if your phone has an international plan? because if not, then that is the reason why your text messages don't work. try this; have whoever you are trying to talk to text you first from china, and then just reply to their message. if your text message goes through, then you'll know that your phone allows international texts. if not, i suggest calling sprint's customer service and setting up international capability with your phone.<br>  and another piece of information; i am a sprint customer myself, and personally, i must say that sprint service is definetely not one of the best. i have by misunderstanding and false billing, had to pay over $3,000 over the last 6 months and am now filing a lawsuit against the company. hopefully this scenario never happens to you. i hope my advice was in someway helpful, and i wish you luck in solving this issue.|`|URLxTUYCaa	maybe you should check with someone from sprint to see if you are doing it right or if theres a certain way to do it since it's international

tjg7hLbMaa	I wouldn't bother using an iPhone for those basic features. The iPhone is made for technical people and may be confusing for your mother.<br>  <br>  One option would be the Jitterbug, which is designed for Senior Citizens. Only issue with the Jitterbug phone is that it does not have a camera and they seem to be only available through the Jitterbug service (which seems to be a pay as you go type system or very low user) which may not be good if your mother uses her phone frequently.<br>  <br>  The phones that are out on the market that are geared towards seniors tend to have basic features only. Unfortunately the basic features only part generally excludes a camera.<br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to take your mother to a store and have her play around with some of the models. Often the stores/kiosks have live models that you can try out (by putting your own SIM card into it or allows you to make local calls only) to test out the volume or using the keypads.|`|f9f7ae4f899136d8207ae54974ede247aa	Depends on the person I guess.

However, you may want to check with your provider to find out the rates because data packages generally don't cover out of country data. Some companies offer out of country data/voice options but they tend to be quite expensive.<br>  <br>  If you're going to be in China for a period of time you may want to look into getting service there in order to cut down the costs and looking for an unlocked iPhone to use.

fpoWJnEbaa	Without having to read into detail, Bluetooth is a feature that most cell phones have where you can connect a wireless headset to your phone and speak through it instead of holding the phone. Unlike most other headsets, it is not physically connected to your phone making it much easier to use. Many people keep them on while driving, etc. and it actually looks like they're talking to themselves... kind of funny. But anyway, newer models of some cars have Bluetooth features where when your cell phone rings, it connects to your car and you can speak on the phone with no headset attached at all. It just depends on which kind of Bluetooth device you have connected to your phone.<br>  To answer the rest of your question, no it is not internet and it works within a certain amount of space between the device and your phone.|`|4cMuedpWaa	Here's all the info you need:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth</a>|`|14S2PmqEaa	Basically bluetooth on a cell phone allows you to connect a wireless device to your phone for example, a wireless headset.

On mine it's definitely the connection from the wire to the PC. I bought a new cable on eBay and it worked for a few days, but then I started having the same problems again.

mRR4CuRYaa	To answer the question in your title, no, the D40 does NOT have the dust removal feature.<br>  <br>  Secondly, if your not considering going pro or at least advanced amateur, go with a nice point and shoot. A dSLR might be a bit too much for you and they become really complicated (and expensive!) For example, to achieve the "zoom" of your point and shoot, you may have to buy several lenses (or one REALLY expensive one) to achieve the same length of zoom.<br>  <br>  With that said, the quality of photos is substantially different with the P&S. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. Some of my best pictures were taken with a Kodak point and shoot.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4f549f8d17db19138ebc8a7b0a7234fdaa	DSLR is the way to go get a Nikon D60 it kicks butt over all point and shoots and is easy to operate. if you don't get one now you"ll be like me and have a nice point and shoot that you never use cause bought a DSLR later<br>  <br>  FYI D-60 has dust sensor D-40 doesn't|`|qIR9DB9Haa	You buy a DSLR because you are prepared to spend money and invest time into learning how to use them, and because if you do both of those things then you will have greater flexibility and more control than you ever would with a point and shoot.

Reason being...if you just had 1342 picutures on that card you want a FULL format... a Quick format is really not a full delete...but  just a delete of the card status info.  It will take some time to finish depending on your card size...but this is good preventive maintenance.  One of the main reasons people get card error and corrupt memory cards is because they dont format often. <br>  Dont listen to this uninformed answer below who said just use delete all.

tjg7hLbMaa	If you're putting your SIM card into the phone it will be using your service and not anyone elses.<br>  <br>  When companies lock phones they generally install company software on it. That's why you may be seeing Verizon branding on the phone despite using the T-Mobile service. It doesn't mean you're using Verizon, it just means that the branding is Verizon. As a note, you may need to enter in settings for the T-mobile service if you're planning on using internet/sms/mms on the phone since the Verizon information should block you from using those services.<br>  <br>  The same thing happened to me with an unlocked Fido phone on Rogers service (in Canada).|`|k1kfAwfPaa	i don't think you can, the storm was specifcally made for verizon|`|epdHit4yaa	go to <a href="http://www.globalunlock.com/phones/public/cart/buynow/3069" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalunlock.com/phones/publi...</a> to unlock your blackberry storm

fwdsp3dVaa	It's really up to you and what you really want!    Plasma's have the best picture quality...period!!!    LCD's are best for sizes 40" or less but lack picture quality of Plasma's...period!    Before you get a bunch of people saying that LCD is god and Plasma's are junk...check out this website and see for yourself: http://www.plasma-lcd-facts.co.uk/|`|YrdUWtSCaa	LCD hands down.  Better picture quality.. Lasts longer.. and easier/cheaper to work on.    Plasma television technology is based loosely on the fluorescent light bulb.    LCD television ADVANTAGES over Plasma include:     1. No burn-in of static images.     2. Cooler running temperature.     3. No high altitude use issues.     4. Increased image brightness over Plasma.     5. Lighter weight (when comparing same screen sizes) than Plasma counterparts.     6. Longer display life used to be a factor, but now LCD and Plasma sets both have at least 60,000 hour or higher lifespans.     DISADVANTAGES of LCD vs Plasma televisions include:     1. Lower contrast ratio, not as good rendering deep blacks.     2. Not as good at tracking motion (fast moving objects may exhibit lag artifacts) - However, this is improving with the recent implementation of 120Hz screen refresh rates in higher-end LCD sets.     3. Not as common in large screen sizes above 42-inches as Plasma. However, the number is growing fast, with 46 and 47-inch screen sizes becoming more common, and some LCD sets having a screen size as large as 65-inches now available to the general public.     4. Although LCD televisions do not suffer from burn-in susceptibility, it is possible that individual pixels on an LCD televisions can burn out, causing small, visible, black or white dots to appear on the screen. Individual pixels cannot be repaired, the whole screen would need to be replaced at that point, if the individual pixel burnout becomes annoying to you.     5. LCD televisions are typically more expensive than equivalent-sized Plasma televisions (although this is changing), especially when comparing EDTV Plasmas to HDTV-LCD Televisions.|`|3Mnhvbrwaa	That TV is a piece of crap dude.  Although newer plasmas don't have the burn-in problem, they still have higher failure rates than LCDs.  Keep looking.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	While I'm sure the picture is ok, understand you are buying a entry level panel, some might say bottom of the barrel.    Yes plasma can burn in with static images. If you game for hours on end, images that don't move like health bars/meters, radar etc can stay on the panel and not come off.     However, panels made in 2009 are very resistant to this, and plasma panels include features to combat burn in or image retention.    As for picture quality, that crown still belongs to plasma. Google plasma vs LCD shoot-outs and in depth tests. Lots of LCD fanboys make claims, but can't back it up with any source or website.    But in the end, it boils down to what you want and what you can afford.    Plasma has better true contrast ratios.  Wider color gamut  no lag time  no drop in resolution with motion like LCD  better blacks  no shift in brightness or color when viewed off angle    reliability between the two is a toss up    I don't see weight as a advantage for LCD. If a 42 inch plasma weighs 15 pounds more than a 42 inch LCD, what's the downside? Do you plan on moving 10 times a year?    Power consumption gets exaggerated big time. Go here http://www.crutchfield.com/p_13342PZ85/P...     Scroll down, Crutchfield does their own tests for power based on having this plamsa on for 6 hours a day for a month. Cost is estimated at just over 3 dollars. So what if LCD was half that? A buck fifty, is that worth even thinking about?    This panel also has a 480hz refresh, something I don't think LCD can even do. I'm beginning to think LCD has no real, meaninful advantage in picture quality over plasma.    I think it's really price now. if you have two panels, one LCD one plasma both 42 inches, and the plasma just happens to be 400 bucks more, picture quality doesn't matter. Most people don't make that much and will opt for the cheaper set.     Before you go for the cheap dynex, remember how long do you plan on keeping this set. For a long time I suspect. Get something better, that way you'll never look at the picture, feeling like you settled for less.    If you go LCD, you can do better. Sony, Samsung, and Sharp are top tier LCD panels. If you can't afford those, look at LG, Vizio, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, heck even Philips.      Skip the dynex, olevia, polaroid and the like, when sets like this are even lucky enough to get reviewed and tested, they do poorly.  Good luck    http://www.plasmatvbuyingguide.com/

hSwqfaF1aa	A little history on how I came onto the eternity.  My AT&T contract had just expired and I needed a new phone. I had just recently cracked the outer display on my samsung sync a707. I cracked it while I was working on a some equipment at work. So at the time I startred my research it was around Nov. 10th.  Eternity hadn't arrived then. My decision came down to 2 phones; the Rugby or the Moto V9x.  I wasn't all that enthused by either, really.  I was thinking about the Rugby because of its promised durability and toughness(I didn't want to crack another phone); it felt solid holding onto it but boring to own. The V9x had more features than the rugby making it a little more exciting to own, but it appeared to be more fragile and it was a motorola phone.  I had the razr v3 and hated it and quickly bought a samsung a707 which I was content with. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I couldn't make up my mind. I kept stopping at AT&T stores to compare. On the Nov 18th I see this new phone Eternity pop up on a dealer website. For a New Phone and the fact that I wasnt a new customer but a only an upgrade customer. I surprised to see that I can own it for only $49. I just had to check it out so I went to the biggest At&t store hoping to have a look at it. They just got it in.  Played around with it and fell in love with it. Yea, it's got a big breakable screen on it.  So do I rather enjoy the eternity phone and take extra precautions or do I go the safe and boring route with the rugby.  I really wanted the iphone but the extra money and data plan was too much so this was the closest thing to the iphone and with the reviews I was reading perhaps just as good as the iphone. So I bought the Eternity! So I am just going to have to be careful with it.  The phone insurance is just too high plus repaired phones often just don't work right sometimes. All I can say after playing around with this ohone for 3 days now....I made the right choice.  I am loving more that I would the rugby and the V9x that's for sure.  It's not perfect but with a few software upgrades and some badly needed phone holder accessories, It will come pretty close to perfection in my eyes.  Thanks Samsung! For lighting up the poor choice of phone models that AT&T currently offers.|`|DUMYQ3Sgaa	ok well i just don't like touch screen phones at all i love my blackberry curve so much it is the best phone for texting on

AA11017655	HDMI is the highest quality connection from your XBox 360 to your television.  You need an HD TV with an HDMI port available and an HDMI cable.  The HDMI cable supplies both audio and video, so you only need one cable, but stores usually overcharge for HDMI cables.  You can get a cheaper HDMI cable at Meritline or at Monoprice or you could search on Amazon.<br>  <br>  See the link below for instructions on how to connect HDMI from your system to your HD TV.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	means high definition media input<br>  which means that the picture produced is clearer than the other standard red, white and yellow cables. ok, it has a plug at the back|`|gjweuOcVaa	HDMI is a connection between a device like a game console or blu-ray player, and a TV. It is the current highest quality signal, better than even Component (which was the best at one point). Basically, it is so high quality because it is digital, so no analog-signal loss. Also, I believe it runs at like 1080p which is a high resolution for TV, and the p is for progressive scan, which is a better quality picture than interlaced.<br>  <br>  HDMI is worthless to you if you don't have a TV that supports it. Most modern LCD screens support HDMI.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I should mention that "high def" is just a buzz word, though it still might be accurate of the poster below me to say it is the current "standard". However, DVI-D provides the same function (although only video) transferring a digital video signal to an LCD monitor, at much MUCH higher resolutions. PCs are very rarely surpassed by TV screens in definition, and this is not one of those cases. :)|`|r8HAHhgkaa	High Definition Multimedia Interface is what it stands for. it is a digital cable that can transmit an HD picture and high definition sound all from one cable. it has become the standard for all things related to HD. One important thing. since an HDMI cable is digital the signal is either there or its not. there is NO need to spend gobs of money on monster HDMI cables. a cheap cable is fine as long as it transmits the signal. you will not notice any difference at all between the two.|`|8146e347ad7537c819ea87c18358a194aa	HDMI stands for High Definition Media Interface xbox elites have them. to read more go here<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI</a>|`|1WgOj89kaa	It is a cable that carries a high quality video signal, providing high def gaming for 360 and PS3.|`|tcI2NPlaaa	HDMI cables are what you use to hook up your 360 to your TV if it is high definition. (HDTV) They serve as a audio/video cable which transmits compressed digital data. (Basically making it so you can hear and see the game you are trying to play). HDMI cables can be quite pricey, but the are not the only option. All 360s come with AV cables. (Xbox 360 Arcade, Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 Elite) The Xbox 360 Elite is the only one that comes with AV and HDMI included. Do not waste your money on a HDMI cable if you have a SDTV (Standard Definition). If you don't have a HDTV, you might want to consider investing in one with these awesome next generation consoles and their graphic capabilities to experience gaming to the fullest. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped!|`|RGBPyaegaa	If you use HDMI for your xBox 360 connection (from your console to TV) you will get theabsolutee best picture. HDMI is the best for picture if your TV supports it. I am not sure about all the xboxs but I know the elite (black) has it.
tjg7hLbMaa	Your best bet is to charge it fully while the phone is off (about 12 hours) then use it until it runs out of juice (and turns off by itself). Re-charge it fully again and repeat the cycle another time. This will build up a tolerance in the battery. You can repeat that cycle a few times whenever you notice your battery life is getting shorter.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this is ONLY for NiCad or NiMH batteries. You can find out what kind of battery you have by looking at the battery information or in your manual.<br>  <br>  Newer technology (Lithium Ion) batteries do not have the memory effect that was a common problem a couple years ago with the older technology but you should still allow it to completely drain every once and awhile and do a full charge so that the amount of life left in the battery can be accurately read by your phone.<br>  <br>  Another tip for prolonging your battery life (and the life of your phone) is to ensure you store it at room temperature. Continual exposure to really hot or extremely cold heat can change how effective your battery functions.|`|OtMP9g9Daa	Listen to Crysanna,I totally agree with her. Charge for minimum first time for NiCd or NiHM for 8hours or until the power or meter LED turns off or says full. that only charges 80% of the battery no matter how long you plug it for. then discharge fully through normal use.<br>  <br>  Charge fully and discharge fully for three cycles.Also,important for devices that can use both mains and battery such as laptop.If you are using the mains,remove the battery or you damage battery or shorten life.|`|e11c1c5fe03d18dd9d5a6aa3a65daf65aa	Hey.<br>  It is very important that you do not switch the phone on. Charge the battery to the max for the very first time otherwise you will shorten you battery life forever. In your instruction manual, it will state how long your battery takes to be fully charged. This has happened to my iPod as well. Good luck.|`|IIWdgw4laa	You want to let the phone discharge as much as you could because you can thoroughly charge your phone.<br>  <br>  There is no difference in the battery life when you unplug and replug your charger so No worries.<br>  <br>  Make sure to let the phone die completely and then you may let the battery charge full.|`|wRCKf1Mzaa	Just charge it when the battery is really close to dying.  Or just charge it until it says it's fully charged.

cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	start with a used acoustic one  or an electric new or old|`|AA10702882	Yeah, your first guitar doesn't need to be sweet. In fact, when you're beginning, you probably wouldn't appreciate it to it's fullest anyway. You should start with a cheap acoustic, a nylon if you're into classical and Spanish guitar, or a steel string for more contemporary tunes. Not a big deal either way, but steel string is more fun and has more variety. Secondly, if you get an electric, a cheap one is your best bet (unless, of course, you have wealthy parents who buy you whatever.... ='P).   Good luck!|`|rEZ2QGa0aa	ive been playing guitar for 2 years dude.    my first guitar came in a starter pack from argos    it wasnt that expensive, 130 i think. and it came with all you need to get started.    http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/pa...    argos website dude. check it out.    hope that helps

UtHnh0aHaa	Jim W's answer is accurate.<br>  The software to be burned to a CD can be downloaded as an ISO image. Burn this ISO image file directly on the CD.<br>  <br>  When you run this, it will upgrade the actual programme coding on the eeprom in your DVD player according to your desires.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11017655	Firmware is the software that the manufacturer programs the player with.  If you go to Samsung's website, they'll give you specific instructions for upgrading the firmware.  Usually what's involved is downloading the firmware, unzipping the files, burning them to a CD and loading the CD in the DVD player.<br>  <br>  See the link below for Samsung's details.
tjg7hLbMaa	Generally the cost is associated with the reception of the text message and not if you open it or not.<br>  <br>  Think of it like a mail man delivering mail.

The mail man has done his job.<br>  <br>  Your service provider has done it's job (delivering the message to you) and has charged for it's delivery.|`|k1kfAwfPaa	it doesn't cost anything if you dont open it
AA11593071	Your monster power surge is colored coded.|`|AA12133586	buy several surge protector.. then you should be fine<br>  <br>  I hook up my TV, Blu-ray, cable box,receiver, Wii, playstation, and xbox 360 together with two power surge.. it worst when it come to computer, which is the computer, printer, cable modem, wireless router, phone, lcd monitor, my light, and phone charger|`|AA11017655	It depends on what connections you have.  How many HDMI ports does your TV have?  Does your receiver have HDMI ports?<br>  <br>  The easiest way to hook everything up is to connect everything with RCA cables, but this won't give the best performance.<br>  <br>  Generally, the best performance connectors are:<br>  1 - HDMI (audio and video)<br>  2- Digital audio (TOSLink or CoAx cables)<br>  3- Component Video<br>  4- Composite Video (RCA cables)<br>  5- F-Connectors (like you used to use from your VCR to your TV)<br>  <br>  If your TV has enough HDMI ports, you would be best off connecting the Cable box to the TV with one HDMI cable, the DVD players with 2 other HDMI cables.  Then connect the digital audio outs from your cable box and your DVD players to your receiver with the correct digital cables.<br>  <br>  If you don't have enough HDMI ports, you'll have to decide which connectors are best for you.<br>  <br>  If your TV has audio out, you can also connect that to the receiver, and just connect the DVD players and the cable box to the TV.  Otherwise you'll have to connect the individual audio and video cables from the DVD players and the cable box to the TV and the receiver.<br>  <br>  So as the earlier poster pointed out, it all depends on which models you have and which cables you have.  Both the TV and the receiver should have connection guides that show everything.  If you can't find all your manuals, most manufacturers have manuals you can download from their websites, and most also have on-line tutorials on connecting your components.<br>  <br>  As for the power surge protector, that's easy.  Just connect all the power cords into the surge protector, and plug the surge protector into the wall outlet.|`|r8HAHhgkaa	this question is way too complicated to explain here. i need to know lots of info about your system to tell you that. (what kind of cables are you using, etc.)

gX7c2mKWaa	Well rar files are a package that has a file/files in it, and it shrink the size of the original file/files.<br>  You can't change a rar file into mp3 files unless you have a sound file in the rar file. Rar and mp3 have no connection.
fGRuRzrlaa	moving a playlist is a little complicated...you have to edit the .txt file that you get when you export<br>  <br>  when you open it, it will have directories of where the songs are located, and you have to edit these so that they match where the files are on the other computer, the main difference will be the user, or something similar.<br>  <br>  then, you put the .txt file on the other computer.<br>  <br>  in itunes, click file, then go to library, and click import playlist<br>  point that to your .txt file, and it should work.<br>  <br>  it isn't that hard, but you have to set the new locations for the songs perfectly.<br>  <br>  also, the music has to be place on the other computer, and added to itunes before this can be done
py0DpCh4aa	At the cheapest phone Being under $10 (before taxes of course) and $80/year for service, Tracfone is THE cheapest service avaliable.<br>  It's not a lot of minutes though, at 20 minutes a month.

FKzZTtw2aa	it has no expiration.
UtHnh0aHaa	A little knowledge is dangerous here.<br>  <br>  If you have the correct in circuit programmer interface and the software, you can actually change the RISC and algorithm coding enough to stop the unit from functioning. This style of software access is limitted to year 3 or 4 firmware programmers.<br>  <br>  If you have an old unit, you could experiment with the software to read the RISC code. I would advise against experimenting with your primary unit and risk screwing it up so it doesn't work at all. These highly trained specialists earn $90 to $400 per hour to apply their trade.
Sru8JnBBaa	It will pick up any available networks automatically. When you try to use an application that uses internet, it will either connect to an unsecured network, or prompt you to enter a password to sign in to a secured network. If you're talking about using wi-fi in your home, make sure you have a router, that your network is secure, and then enter the password on you iPod Touch, when prompted to do so.     As far as the song issue goes, I'm not sure why you're having difficulty, unless it's because your file names are too long.    If you're still having trouble, call your nearest Apple store, put it on speakerphone, and wait in the queue for the next available store rep. They are usually pretty good at walking you through things. Good luck!

b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	what are you hooking it up with?  If you are using HDMI, make sure that the dedicated sound dongle is not plugged in, and make sure your TV supports sound over HDMI    if you are using normal cables, make sure the cables are plugged in right and the sound is set up properly in your TV menu|`|5vg8tC26aa	Are you plugging the red and white plugs into the HDMI port? that may be your problem
pZGLhV2Waa	Honestly both are great beginner cameras. You say that you checked Flikr and the Nikon looks better. That has got to do with the person using the camera more so than anything else and then it would be the  lenses they were using. The lens you use will be the biggest determiner of the quality of the pictures you take. A cheap lens on an $8,000 camera you will get poor results. If you put a top quality lens on a cheap camera you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the good camera and the cheap camera.Both cameras will give you professional quality results if you know how to use them.     Have you gone to a camera store and played with them yet? Before you buy any camera you should do this. One will feel better in your hands than the other. Remember also that you are buying into a system of lenses and flashes. Lenses are not interchangeable between brands so if you decide later to switch brands it can be very expensive. Most lenses cost as much or more than the camera. So be absolutely sure you like the brand you choose.    You can't go wrong with either brand though. They both make top quality cameras. 90% of professionals use one brand or the other.|`|LPCfOtiKaa	They are both great cameras. One of the questions you need to ask is which system you want to buy into. What are you planning on photographing? Does Nikon or Canon offer the appropriate accessories for that? When you buy a camera you have to buy all the lenses and such from the same company.  Personally, I like Canon lenses muuuch better than Nikon, well I like most things Canon.   What you should do is go to a camera retailer and try them out. Which one feels better in your hands? Which one is of a preferable weight? Does the course your buying the camera for specify what camera to buy or what specifications the camera needs to have?  The Rebel having 4 more mega-pixels than the D40 shouldn't be that big of deal unless you plan on printing out enormously huge posters.     Count one for Canon.|`|th7r2OD0aa	the canon is far better and i like it much more
V8wUAVdyaa	The Touch Pro isn't compatible with sim cards..sorry. I belive AT&T has a phone that is very similar to it though and it would have a sim card.
b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	well, i don't know why you would have HDMI cables, because the launch 360's did not have HDMI support.    All the accessories will still work, and the regular component cables will work.  The Arcade (not called core anymore) has HDMI support.|`|iu2pBEb2aa	Yes, the HDMI cables will work.|`|ORlv0RWRaa	Yeah.

HekFanRvaa	can u tell me what port you have in the back? does it have port for optical/toslink cable?    Does it also have pro-logic II function?    The easiest way is if you have optical cable input in your home theater, just buy one. It will automatically give you 5.1 audio.    If it doesn't have optical port, then use the regular AV cable and connect the white and red cable to your home theater. Then put your home player in Aux mode and choose Pro-logic II mode. Pro-logic will give you 5.1 surround sound effect.    EDIT.. you need to look for an input jack on your home theater to hook up the PS3 audio cable direct on to it. I'm asking for optical port (input) on home theater not on TV. to hook up sound on to your home theater all you need is simply hook up the output cable of the PS3 (the red & white scart cables) to the aux input of your home theater. If you don't understand that.. there's no way you can do it.|`|sbNnnPewaa	optical sound cable from ps3 to surround sound  hdmi cable from ps3 to hdtv  sorted    EDIT use normal leads for ur tv to ps3 ...i just read ur tv isnt hd.......use optical cable for sound if your ss supports it|`|tKWwZpOAaa	Im pretty sure the PS3 has a digital audio out on the back, if you have a decent stereo there should be a digital input. If not try the RCA plugs, they should just go into the back of your dvd reciever. Also make sure what ever your playing supports 5.1.|`|cUxnKzNzaa	hmmmmm.....maybe u need a new tv....not exactly sure....sry

Because even if you did manage to find out who they are, it doesn't make them any less dangerous.  If all else fails, see if your carrier can block that phone number or change your phone number.  Most carriers will do it for free in those situations, as long as it doesn't keep happening every month.|`|JoU7WTadaa	You can find the carrier they use with the Telephone Investigator's Research System (<a href="http://tirs.us/)." rel="nofollow">http://tirs.us/).</a> But you can't find their name or address unless you pay for it, just their carrier and the town they live in. But it's a start, but a better idea would probably be the cops. The popo. The fuzz. The MAN. City hall. The Smokies. W/e you wanna call them, this is a legal issue, and if you have proof, like a recording or something, you could probably go to court if it's a serious problem.

1gqrH9Ykaa	Well, most of my apps are free, but I'll give it a try. :]<br>  <br>  For useful: I like the WeatherBug app, because unlike the already built in Weather app, it gives you wind speeds and chill, as well as the temperature and many other things. :]<br>  <br>  For entertainment: I have a FlipBook Lite app which I think is cool, but them again I'm into weird things. ;D The name of it pretty much says it all :]<br>  <br>  Games, I have a game called Topple, which is kinda sorta similar to Tetris, but not really. You stack these blocks as high as you can, and try to reach certain heights for your points. It sounds lame but you should give it a try. :]<br>  If you're into first-person shooters, obviously iPod Touches wouldn't exactly be the best, but iSniper is pretty decent.<br>  <br>  If none of these really suit you, I'd suggest that in the app store, looking around the "What's Hot" section or better yet, the "Top Paid Apps" and "Top Free Apps" at the right margin. Those are usually pretty good. And they change all the time so you'll be able to visit it often for more new cool things! :D

And spend 20-30 bucks on a DVD player that will work fine. <br>  <br>  Check out the TVs on the first few pages of this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26rs%3D172659%26ref%255F%3Dsr%255Fnr%255Fp%255Fn%255Ffeature%255Fbrowse-b%255F2%26bbn%3D172659%26qid%3D1235117842%26rnid%3D550060011%26rh%3Dn%253A1065836%252Cn%253A172659%252Cp%255Fn%255Ffeature%255Fthree%255Fbrowse-bin%253A724227011%252Cp%255Fn%255Fsize%255Fbrowse-bin%253A1232881011%252Cp%255Fn%255Ffeature%255Fbrowse-bin%253A550063011&tag=link03e-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a><br>  <br>  I'd bet that you are going to get a better deal on a TV that you will really enjoy than you would buying that Westinghouse from Target/Best Buy/Costco/wherever.<br>  <br>  This is my opinion, and that doesn't mean much. Educate yourself on some of the technologies if you haven't already, and/or at the very least read some reviews before you make a purchase. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope I have helped.
jKc7aDCwaa	Yes, it has one player just fine. Might want to check the review, though, didn't fare very well...
1vaLDDg0aa	I found your question looking for the same answer myself.  MLB.TV does not mention watching live games on any type of smartphone.  It just says that it's compatible with PC or MAC.  It's pricey, but you can get slingbox and connect it to your home cable system (cheapest one is $179.99), then pay for the mobile software, which is $30.  That's a pretty large investment to watch baseball.  I think I would rather listen to the audio, which is available in some cell phone plans.  I am purchasing MLB.TV anyway, so I will be trying it on my Blackberry.  Can't hurt.  I really hope someone has a better answer than me.
VMVW3E7Aaa	I assume you're interested in video, rather than still pictures, right?<br>  You really can't expect some tiny little P&S to do both of them, and to do them well.<br>  <br>  So, if video is your thing, you need a camcorder.<br>  Do some research, learn what all the terms mean, and read lots of reviews. You can only make a good purchasing decision when you know what you're talking about.<br>  <br>  As to editing - Pinnacle Studio is both terrible and brilliant. The bad part is that it is so often buggy. I have had countless problems with it, and I know of many other people who have had them, too. On the other hand, when it works, it is by far the best.<br>  <br>  Next good idea would be to get Adobe Premiere Elements. It is the scaled down version of a big professional editing program. Premiere Elements is often sold bundled with Photoshop Elements, another handy program to have. <br>  <br>  Should you really become a professional eventually, the move up to the full version of Premiere will be easier for you.
wRIaKxsAaa	The best pay as you go service would probably be Virgin Mobile.

You can just use it as a regular phone on your plan.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why you would purchase an iPhone and not use it for what it's designed for (internet, etc). Save yourself the money and just get a regular phone.|`|zX8QN7rQaa	1. you HAVE to get the data plan (internet) with the iPhone. it's 30 dollars a month for that. if you want to get one without the internet, get a iTouch, which isn't a phone.<br>  2. it depends.
lJAaBmlyaa	The phone is called the memoir!|`|DjlKqGDCaa	i haven't sceen it but it sounds amazing. i have the iphone so i doubt i will get that one. but it really sounds cool, but not as hot as the iphone lol. but i have tmobile. its cool. :)
1F6KJt0oaa	True matrix metering is superior but if you know how to work center-weighted and how to adjust for discrepancies in changes in light in your scene then it will be fine.  If your batteries are dead you won't have any meter to go off of anyway so I am assuming you are familiar and fairly comfortable with sunny 16 concepts.  Even with a handheld backup you will run into the same problem with the temperatures being too cold for the batteries.  There is another problem.  Shooting film in that cold weather can decrease the films sensitivity.  I am not sure -5 is cold enough to render the film useless but it will definitely slow down the films chemical reactions.  10C should be fine.  The times where it would be -5 would most likely be around 4:30 to 6am so you probably won't be doing a lot of shooting then anyway.  Hopefully it will be warmer by 7-10 (10 being a stretch light-wise) and definitely should be warmer between 3-7 (3 being a stretch light-wise). Quality of light between 10 and 3 won't be much for shooting anyway.  It might be too dark at 7pm but I think it is getting to a point where at least here there is still just enough to play with a little bit.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps some.  I would say go with the camera you are most comfortable with handling and the lighter rig.  If it is too cold for batteries then you are pushing too cold for film and you should be adjusting exposure for the cold anyway.  Also if you do shoot when it is too cold for the batteries then it won't matter if you have a superior meter (especially if the camera won't operate anyway).  Dig.  Kind of an even trade off so which ever one will be most comfortable to carry is the one that will be best most likely.
d381leKpaa	yea, if you liked you 360 at all, look at this, it's a comparison on how much better the PS3 is. The PS3 can also be programmed to be a fully functional PC, if you download linux (it's even free!) or you can buy Microsoft Vista or something... But anyways here you go<br>  <br>  For One, the PS3 will last the longest for the next gen consoles that are out now:<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 was made in 2005, they've already made a different version of it (Elite) so soon they'll have the next 360, more likely the 720, probably in 2010-2012 that's not very long 1-3 years of play<br>  Wii- was poorly designed in 2006. They'll have to make the Wii 2 sometime soon, probably 2010-2012 as well.<br>  Playstation 3- was made in the same year as the Wii, 2006. Sony designed it though to last for 10 years! Meaning it will still be around and popular in 2016.<br>  <br>  The PS3 amazing. It has better reliability, can be turned into a PC and download Windows XP or Vista, or for free download Linux. For everything that it has, it is much cheaper then the Xbox 360, consider the following.<br>  With the PS3, you get:<br>  -A Blue-Ray player, and one of the best ones out so far. It is also considered new technology. If you don't have Blue-Ray players to start out with when buying the PS3, it also has a DVD upconverter, meaning that you can play normal DVD's with better quality picture.<br>  -The PS3 also features PSN( the (P)lay(S)tation (N)etwork). It's free to use, and download demo's such as Warhawk, and Home. Unlike Xbox Live, it doesn't cost $80 for the first year bundle, and $50 for each following year.<br>  -The PS3 has exlusives like no other console, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.—in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time)<br>  -For the money, you get 80GB of space, and only 60GB on the Xbox 360, USB mini drives can also be used from the 2.0 USB ports in the front of the PS3. It also has an easily removable HDD.<br>  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi<br>  -Web browser, just like a PC's<br>  <br>  On the Xbox 360's you get a 1 in 3 failure rate. Even though Microsoft knows of this problem, they don't even think about the red rings of death while shipping it out to unsuspecting customers<br>  <br>  So here’s a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  Console(there will be a $100 decrease in April 2009) $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $55<br>  Total: $415<br>  <br>  Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)<br>  <br>  Xbox 360:<br>  Console $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $60<br>  Xbox Live $80<br>  Wi-Fi $100<br>  Total: $660<br>  <br>  As you can see, the PS3 is cheaper by far and plus, The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So that means much better graphics in the future when they can get a grip on the PS3's power.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360’s potential. And they look about the same. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. It’s just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.<br>  <br>  So pretty much, the PS3 wins hands down. It's the best system people have seen yet! The PS3 will also progress in the future, like it's downgraded because it was so good that other people couldn't afford it. So anyways hope I helped!|`|9AR6B4ELaa	duh. computer beats every gaming console|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	NO!<br>  <br>  If gaming is 4th on priorities and you're planning on a laptop/pc go with the laptop/pc.  the PS3 is only for the most hardcore of gamers. You can't do the things on a PS3 that you can do on your PC. I'm pretty sure the PS3 can't print you out a good formatted report on whatever subject you study ;)<br>  <br>  If gaming is your top priority, yeah, a PS3 or either one of the other consoles would serve you very well.|`|EOzxtPrSaa	ps3 can do lots of stuff like going online,play music and dvds and downloading games,  but a laptop or computer can do much more and has faster hardware. <br>  so i would say if you want to play games buy the ps3 but if you want to do other stuff buy a laptop|`|1WgOj89kaa	Yes, the PS3 Has an internet browser, has free online play, you can access your email and play top notch games. It is the closest thing to a computer that a games console has ever been. Excellent value for money|`|AszV7QWvaa	If you get a keyboard and mouse for your ps3 then ya, I'd say it's worth it.  I have a ps3 and it's fantastic... I use it for movies, games, internet and talking to people|`|2N44SULSaa	Every machine is design for an ultimate use. What do you want to do in the first place?<br>  Ultimate gaming console: XBOX - The number one rule of enjoying the xbox is the online gaming.<br>  Ultimate MMO gaming: PC - Try Warhammer or WOW and you will never eat, sleep, go out of house.<br>  Ultimate mobility: LAPTOP/Smartphones/iPhone<br>  Ultimate party gaming in a house: Wii<br>  Ultimate blue-ray player: PS3 (cheapest in the market)<br>  It's like comparing apples and oranges. It really depends on what you want to get out of what you buy.|`|AA10567651	ARE YOU CRAZY?<br>  a computer can do tons more than a ps3. A ps3 only has processing power. You can do work on a ps3. If you just want a console for the next 10 years, sure get a ps3, but you can do tons with a pc. And if you already dont have another pc then you wont be able to do anything. That means you wont be able to connect online or do anything, but play games. <br>  <br>  If you can mod consoles then it would be ok to get a ps3, but in that case, you should rather get a pc, Because once you mod you void the warranty and if it breaks.... you've lost a bit of money...|`|6KlNjzbxaa	well the only downside is the ps3 cant play PC games.<br>  other then that it can act as a computer,i recommend ubuntu as the operating system.

This makes them reliable and very able (FAX can be used for legal documents with a signature for this very reason)<br>  <br>  Online services that provide for computer users are an additional expense and are required to buffer of mirror the transmission until verification of reception. This depends totally upon the reliability of the service provider and the condition and management of his server. The only advantage to online is you can receive fax anywhere with a laptop and printer buffer or print-to-file utility. This includes shared facilities such as internet cafes.<br>  <br>  If you are investing in a fax number, then in my mind there is only one answer - a fax machine. You computer can always be configured as a backup if your machine ever fails but the one I have also has a service contract (expensive but adds to the reliability factor).<br>  <br>  If your plan is a shared line using a ring director, be sure to get one with a built in answering machine or and output jack to connect one.|`|zoptablFaa	I would go with online faxing.
