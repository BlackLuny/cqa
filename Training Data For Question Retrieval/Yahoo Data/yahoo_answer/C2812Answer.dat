AA11944397	It's going to depend a lot on your geographical area.  Some really good 'sit-down' restaurants are Applebee's, Outback Steakhouse, Lonestar, Olive Garden, but I dont know if those restaurants exist outside of Nebraska.|`|5xnSgTYnaa	I like to eat at El Torito for a nice sit down meal (mexican food)<br>  <br>  Rubios is very good but it is more of a quick meal (mexican food)<br>  <br>  Claim Jumper has good steaks, baked potatotes and things like that, good sit down place<br>  <br>  Souplantation has basically everything to eat but not to romantic if that is what you are looking for|`|Sp1DkZfgaa	um i like olive garden, uncle julios, etc.. they are really good places to eat!|`|uFDvCo3haa	hooters|`|wwRasDZLaa	Outback Steakhouse, Olive Garden, etc. are in many states.  They have friendly service so it's easy to think that they are local businesses (I had the same idea til I travelled and found em all over the US).  Let me suggest Boston Market-- good American food and everyone can find something they like.  But as others have said, if you tell us your state or city, we might be able to give better suggestions.|`|5C7wKDcRaa	Need a geographical area to be specific.
GfG6wupTaa	All fast food is unhealthy.|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	I can only ear half- i save the rest for later.|`|6PNuFgTJaa	What matters is what you put in it.|`|AA10426969	It depends on the kind of sub.<br>  <br>  Anything with a bunch of meats and cheese is probably bad. Also, get good add-ons such as: Tomato, lettuce, spinach, peppers. Stay away from bad add-ons like: mayonaisse, oil, honey mustard, etc. The Italian bread is a good choice, the cheddar bread is a bad choice.<br>  <br>  Most of Quizno's subs are quite bad for you, but they have one or two subs that are clearly marked and better for you than most of Subway's offerings.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	They have the nutritional information all over the store.  Look at the napkins.  If it is only for the 6 inch then just double it.|`|04F4149yaa	They are a good place and I like their food. Who cares. It's 5$ for a foot long sandwhich. Not everybody can afford expensive crap these days.|`|pg5AHNcdaa	Not healthy or unhealthy. Healthier than many alternatives. But not the most nutitious option.|`|7n523JW1aa	It all depends what you put on it. If your putting a whole bunch of mayo with a chicken sandwich, just because it has chicken doesn't mean it healthy. Hope I made sense.|`|FL2nfCSXaa	well ofcourse it depends on what type of sub you get, and you arent going to eat the whole footlong in one sitting, are you?|`|DQlZIzAFaa	It's better than a burger and fries. And it depends on the sub and your definition of "healthy." Avoid mayo and extra cheese.|`|1ygEsN8Naa	It is much healthier then McDonald's, Wendy's and BK.  It all depends on your ht, wt, and metabolism.|`|A5D62Ycbaa	Depends what you put on it.  As far as fast food goes Subway can be healthy and its fresh, choose one of the less than 6g fat version (12g on a foot)|`|lqG3SQ40aa	well it depends on what's in it but I usually get the foot long eat half one day and then eat the other the next day.|`|EGiIcGOiaa	its still a FOOTLONGG of BREAD|`|0m8ZVd9Uaa	w/e you put in there..like if you put cheese and mayo, and stuff then thats bad.<br>  <br>  i get a sub with teriyaki chicken and i just put vegetables...i dont like cheese or mustard and stuff|`|pA1M2HSoaa	depends on what you put in it. the footlongs r really good i usually split them with my mom. but i guess its a lot healthier than mcdonalds and stuff|`|zPYapfm5aa	Subway is not very healthy at all<br>  Quiznos has healthy subs
k4f7HG8waa	If you live in a major metropolitan area, you can access a site called Foodler to see if there's delivery to your address.  <br>  <br>  It's simple: you enter your address, and get a list of all places delivering to your address right at that time!  This online service also allows you to look through menus, indicates customers' favorites and ratings.  You can order through the site also. <br>  <br>  If Foodler does not handle the area where you live, try the yellow pages, or if there's no delivery service, see if you can place an order for pick-up. Then at least you can eat at home.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, especially if you're on a farm 20 miles from the nearest city.  :)|`|wwRasDZLaa	Thank you for implying that we are psychic and that we can figure out which city you are in.  Just go to your yellow pages and call some places and ask if they deliver to your home address.  OTOH, why are you voluntarily ordering Chinese food? I thought that Chinese food was something that you ordered if there were some old Chinese ppl (Chinese from China or Taiwan) staying in your home.  Serve em a meal without rice and they'll make faces and complain.|`|uFDvCo3haa	idk
Om9CFRpsaa	Prune Restaurant - Amazing quality food, decent prices. Look-up the website.|`|accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	There is one restaurant that has been around for quite awhile and it gets great write ups, but for some reason it just isn't that well known.  I have taken quite a number of people there and every one has been taken by the place and amazed that the prices are so reasonable for the quality.<br>  You can get out of there for $100 or under.<br>  The place is called Capsuto Frere and it is located on Watts Street, which is way downtown, I guess it is Tribeca.  It's sort of around the entrance/exit to the Hudson Tunnel.<br>  If you are driving there is no problem parking.<br>  The food is Lebenese/French.  The specialty is their souflees, and if it's for a birthday I suggest that you order one of the special ones that they suggest at the beginning of the meal.  They do have some ready made ones, but the specially made ones are so much better.<br>  <br>  Also, actually, not that far away is another restaurant I highly recommend.  It is called<br>  City Hall.  It also is not that expensive.  I don't think it has as beautiful and special an atmosphere, but if you don't like French food, this place is totally American.  The food and service is fantastic.  I certainly can say I love this restaurant.  I got married there, well, re-married, 3 years ago, and everyone expected to have the usual food you get at a catered affair, the rubber chicken.  Not here.  Every piece of food was gone by the time the platters were taken away.<br>  <br>  Either of these places would work very well for a wonderful dinner out.|`|rLiyrhCdaa	Little Italy is an area in lower manhattan that contains many little shops and some the worlds best Italian food. Very romantic and very clean. After you eat you can just roam around. I'm the same age as you guys and that's were i would probably want to be taken.<br>  <br>  There is one place in particular that my family loves. La Mela. Traditional, Delicious Italian food. Here is  the thing: although i see many couples in there, its not awfully romantic. <br>  <br>  If you want it to be uber romantic go to il Palazzo. <br>  <br>  hope i helped :)<br>  <br>  i disagree with the poster below, its not cheesy and at this time of year it isnt very cheesy either. <br>  <br>  if you go to the village, i would seggeust sushi sumba. its very  very good.|`|ywEIQEPkaa	Don't bother with Little Italy... it's touristy and a little cheesy. I'd suggest you go to somewhere in the West Village. It's a great place to walk around at night, and has lots of restaurants and bars. Sushi Samba is a great place that melds Japanese and South American. I think the first commenter seems like she knows what she's saying. One great Italian place is Jolie, in Brooklyn. I took my girlfriend there for Valentine's Day... it's low-key and has great food.
rGvlPAMJaa	To cut costs as well as waste.|`|pueeMH6gaa	I think what happens is if someone doesn't eat the big piece of cheese bread or they just eat a portion, the kitchen staff cuts it into four pieces and serves it to the next customer.  If someone unfortunate enough to work there can confirm this, I'd appreciate it.
EcdelIHtaa	i take it out and put it on the side of my plate|`|VJYAE4G0aa	I spit it into a napkin|`|kAD0umZNaa	Not quite. I would maybe put a napkin to my mouth and "spit" into it but not just spit it out or reach in and grab it.
a483f583d86fba2438befda90e113a8caa	That would depend on how you intend to cook same. Fry? Broil ? Microwave ? Whatever method you prefer, be sure the meat is cooked(no red color inside) . Meat at center should be @ 160 degrees. Also wash hands w/ soap and hot water after handling raw meat.

EyZGCZqyaa	I think it depends on the manager, really.<br>  We have 2-10's, 3-10's [kids in school], 12-8's...<br>  <br>  I work at a 24-hour store, though. I suppose that has something to do with them all ending in 10 o'clock.|`|EGiIcGOiaa	I would liek to know too|`|a8RdiGkUaa	when I worked at Dunkins there was a 12-5 shift and then a 5-10 shift on the weekends and weekdays it was 2:30 - 6 and 6-10
tzrLDbHWaa	All depends on how many people you have and what you get, can be anywhere from $10-20 a person for dinner, more if you have alcohol, appetizers and dessert.<br>  <br>  Applebees has decent food, but you really don't get good deals there for your money.  I mean, you'll pay the same as you will for a meal at Outback, Olive Garden, or Red Lobster, but they give you nothing but your meal.  Unless you get one of those 3 course meal specials they sometimes have (which, if you do, they are very small appetizers and desserts), you get nothing before your meal.  Most places will give you a soup or salad, and at least bread.  Last time I was there someone I was with ordered a salad, and they pretty much had to beg for bread with it, and they got one slice of bread at that.  Most other places will at least give you bread to snack on while waiting for your meal, if not a choice of soup or salad.  Places like Applebees and Fridays end up being poor choices for the money in my opinion, as, if you're in the mood for meat, Outback is a much better option, siimilarly priced, and you'll get better food.|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	Applebees.com has an online menu and Ebay has coupons and gift cards pretty reasonable|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Usually I spend about $15-$18 when I go the Applebees.|`|dPgP28Aiaa	Depends on what you get. Usually somewhere between 10-20 dollars per person.|`|CnM2U1bXaa	for one person like 12-15 bucks. maybe 10|`|CEKZsoFRaa	about 30 bucks a couple|`|lhhgXNxRaa	The dish usually costs about 10-20 dollars, but now they have a special 2 entrees plus an appetizer for $20.<br>  <a href="http://www.applebees.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.applebees.com/</a><br>  It's a pretty good deal, I tried it already.|`|paCHaDWVaa	I think it's just like every other typical dine in restaurant (chili's, outback, olive garden). It's not as cheap as fast food, but you can't expect to only spend a couple bucks when you go in there.|`|HJrTuihcaa	<a href="http://www.carside.net/menu_popup.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carside.net/menu_popup.htm</a><br>  <br>  that's their menu with pricing. scroll down for their whole menu.|`|YIbELNRBaa	Depends on how much you get. Appetizers, Drinks, Main Course, Desert... 30-40 per person if your getting a couple things.|`|T28jJrr5aa	almost everything that makes you full is<br>  over $13|`|EWR01atlaa	depends on what your eating. It's not cheap but it's not expensive either. Probably 15 to ---- whatever your eating|`|d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	About $20 per person if you add drinks. If not, about $13.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	About $13-15 for a meal.|`|G5umwRBkaa	not much. you can eat (2 people) for $20 , including an appetizer and 2 big meals. or individual meals are between 6.99 and liek 12.99<br>  <br>  you can eat a lot of different things past 9pm for $4 because its really for people who want to come in late and drink.<br>  <br>  it's fairly prices. not as expensive as chilles or olive garden but just as good and nice|`|fa3db0f254c65d60df56a24161efe96faa	if you are smart you can probally get a meal at applebees for 12$ You simply get water, and a $10 meal that will fill you up. $2 tip will do. Thats what i do, since i am on a strict budget. If you are not worried about eating on a budget then you can have an enjoyable time for about $20|`|rUk58ywKaa	Too much for what they offer.  Their prices are borderline high, but their food is only average.  It would be a great place if their prices were about 25% lower or their quality was about 25% higher.|`|DiTV5O4maa	about 10-15 bucks a meal. really good food, actually.|`|ON0L9DVvaa	$25 per couple and up.  Generic, but good food.|`|ztvj00Xhaa	at least $15 per person
lFpQCpPAaa	Nandon'ts! My ex once took me on a date there. Can you tell why he's my ex?|`|XmD61yBpaa	if u dont like chicken forgfet it|`|EpCuEvvdaa	i love nandos<br>  <br>  chicken and peri peri cjips yum yum <br>  good choice of chicken and some veggie stuff<br>  <br>  frozen yogurt is lovely <br>  <br>  u must be mad not to like it beats mc donalds and pizza hut any day <br>  <br>  x|`|CzeKDSpwaa	Oh Nandos for sure!<br>  <br>  I love the olives.  I love chillies and I love chicken.<br>  <br>  It's the ultimate fast food for me & so, so reasonably priced.<br>  <br>  I don't eat it much, but it's a really nice treat!  I only wish they made a point of using at the very least, freedom food approved chicken.  I'm sure it won't be too long before that change happens.|`|0VHolTVEaa	Personally i prefer frangos. Its the same concept as nandos but tastier chicken, chips, and sauces. Both are only ideal for chicken lovers|`|ODvnyAdlaa	NANDOS! i love it, extra hot for me x|`|VkVyuq5baa	I would rather eat SH!T|`|sOTfj1lSaa	Nando's any day....<br>  <br>  Great food, reasonably priced and a nice ambient atmosphere.<br>  <br>  The chicken is to die for and the chips are Lovely with the Peri Peri coating. You also have as many top up (nonalcoholic) beverages as you want, now that can't be bad!!!<br>  <br>  Go on give it a whirl....|`|AA10997025	I liked the steak sandwich, with a slice of cheese and extra hot, but for the last few occassions the meat has been touch, and fatty, and because of which have not had Nandos for some time.  Rice is like cheap packet rice too.|`|A5D62Ycbaa	I like Nandos.<br>  I like to go with friends and we have lots of different sides and salads, a bit of a picnic!  The red pepper dip starter is delish|`|WSc0juqTaa	Yeah, Im with you, it doesn't float my boat.  will eat it if I have too but I find the chilli to over powering and the food bland otherwise.|`|eXwnWqROaa	FRANKY AND BENNYS|`|yJRXcPQ4aa	1 2 3 4 5|`|c6FrTkFRaa	Nandos!!<br>  they have great veggie stuff too!

8btT9z0gaa	There are a few places.  A couple I know off hand are <br>  <br>  Tokyo Hibachi <br>  (215) 751-9993<br>  1613 Walnut Street, 2/F, Philadelphia, PA<br>  "Very nice hibachi restaurant <br>  or<br>  Hibachi Japanese Steak House <br>  (215) 592-7100<br>  325 N Columbus Blvd, Philadelphia, PA<br>  I hope this helps. <br>  P.S. Happy Birthday!!!!!!!!!!|`|UM0AciUmaa	Happy Birthday...Morimotos Restaurant on Chestnut Street is awesome!  It is Japanese and Morimoto is an Iron Chef from Foodnetwork.  It has interesting and modern atmosphere and is Asian Fusion.  Lunch is less expensive, but Hibachi is what you might like.  Have a great time!! :)|`|T3b1Mq3saa	Continental on Chestnut St.
Sah5tjD8aa	The Outback Crab Shack west of town on the river is super.  I highly recommend the boiled dinner.  The shellfish are superior.  The atmosphere is totally informal.  Ate there last week.  They are open again, and the flood damage is totally repaired.
HbQmDGb6aa	Generally speaking, a restaurant's closing time means the kitchen's closing time. They won't take a food order past 10, but you are free to stay as long as you take to finish. Keep etiquette and common curtesy in mind, though, and don't linger past your time. Do not rush, especially since getting there at 9:30 is well before the closing time, but don't stay and chat til 11:30. <br>  <br>  I used to work at a place that "closed" at 8:30 -the customers usually stayed til 10:30 or 11, ordering drinks etc. When the place is dead and only one party is left, it is much better form to take notice and your leave. It's inconsiderate to the waitstaff, who can't leave or finish closing up, until you do, to stay way too long. But again - you are the customer, enjoy your meal, do not rush yourself. Just read the body language of the waitstaff if you think you're overstaying your welcome :)|`|tzrLDbHWaa	They should.  I mean, most restaurants I know that close at 10 stop letting people in at 10, but should still serve you as long as you're there in time.  You can call the specific restaurant and ask them how they do it, but I'd guarentee that any restaurant would serve you at 9:30 since thats more than enough time to take your order and have your food cooked and served, and most likely eaten by the time they close.|`|MJvL013yaa	It is kind of rude to overstay. I mean, any other business doesn't wait around for you (Kohls, JC Pennys) The staff wants to go home too, and they have a LOT to do after you leave.<br>  <br>  EDIT> Yesterday I was stuck for 2 hours after my shift. I had to cancel a date with my daughter (dinner & a movie).|`|1668e512ad95a12828036de52cff9631aa	if you show up a half hour before the place closes, be prepared for crappy service and maybe some undesirable substances in your food.|`|UtvBfdR3aa	They will but it is really rude of you to take your time at that point... if you are in and out then great.|`|AA10804824	Of course, but don't be rude about it. How late do you stay at your job past quitting time?|`|Qmn0IfSGaa	They have to your are a customer. When I worked at a resturant we closed on sundays at 1;00pm and I had a table of 12 come in 5 mintues before close. I couldn't tell them no they are a paying customer, and I got a sweet tip. Don't be scared to go in, and if they are rude call the manager, trust me they'll take care of it. But also considering leave you server a decent tip, if you are they after close.|`|3RUJfTiRaa	Definitely they will wait for you to complete. I used to go Saravana Bhavan in Connaught Place, New Delhi, the usual timing is 8 AM to 11 PM. And the service is very good. No need of time worrying.

This will definitely tick off the people who are working there though. Because at the end of the day they are ready to go home.|`|2NWseSSaaa	nice restaurant's will|`|oNG5BxvXaa	yes. i worked at one and sometimes we didnt close until an hour afterward

JfVxCDb7aa	they'll stretch the truth to fit what they<br>  <br>  think the public wants too hear.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, its advertising at its best.  State what you think will help you, and leave out the details that wont.<br>  <br>  Personally, I never really understood the reasoning behind those commercials.  I mean, they make it sound like Cod is vastly superior to other fish, whereas its not all that much different than haddock or some other types of fish.  Its not like they're advertising Maine lobster or anything, but I guess the way they put it, it makes it sound like its the absolute best fish you can get.|`|2zDvIGmvaa	i actually hate that commercial<br>  it makes me think of all of the fish that are dying for us to eat.<br>  it would make me even sadder if it was an endangered species or something, but im glad its not. phew.|`|qVgr5OBeaa	Yeah, I know what you are talking about.<br>  It is extremely sad.<br>  I think we need to have much more respect for another<br>  living creature that is giving its life for us live.|`|AA10920990	I had the same feeling.

z7MPaUELaa	When I was 15 I started working at Dunkin Donuts and that's what started my love of coffee. Unfortunately it's doesn't wake me up.<br>  <br>  I started drinking it because it was free. Light and sweet, yum!<br>  <br>  Now if I have a cup it's just for the taste of the coffee. I add a little milk or cream and sometimes a little sugar.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend needs it to wake up. He drinks it black. <br>  <br>  If your mom's coffee was bitter then it was either brewed badly or old. Many things affect the taste of the coffee. You need good water, good coffee beans and a good coffee maker. Bunn machines are the best. Dunkin Donuts coffee beans are great but Folgers is pretty good too.|`|W8R6g5hEaa	Hello, I love Starbucks, I go at least twice a day if not three times. I started drinking coffee when I started working alot and going to school. It is very good depending on where you get it from. I add sugar and cream to mine. I can' do black. It helps wake me up in the early more and get through my day. I get my caffiene in as well especially during the cold months. I drink alot. Once summer is here, its iced coffee with cream and sugar and bottled water. You aqurie the taste. I remember the days I could not drink a cup of starbucks but now I do it everyday.|`|cMRphaJfaa	Seriously, I started drinking coffee when I was 6 yrs old..My grandma would let me have all I wanted, but my mom said it would stunt my growth(which it didnt)..I love the smell of fresh brewed coffee anytime of day...I guess Im addicted to the stuff and most say its an acquired taste...But I just love it..You should try it with some of the coffee flavors and you may find that you like it...<br>  I know when I get up at 3 am everyday for work, I need something to get me going and there's nothing better than a hot cup of coffee to do that for me.<br>  Maxwell House is my drink of choice...Folgers is my 2nd....|`|fkOdl1CJaa	I started drinking a week ago.

The addiction became even stronger while waiting tables, because I often had to close restaurants, then open them again, with only a couple of hours of sleep between shifts.  When waiting tables, one is allowed only to drink tea, or coffee or water.  Sodas are generally forbidden.  <br>  <br>  In the words of a really underrated comedy team from the 1980s...some late-night show...I don't remember their names...<br>  <br>  "It's cheap, it's legal, it's an incredible buzz!"|`|I1w0HfQbaa	I would never recommend buying coffee at Starbuck's because the stuff is excesively expensive.

Try buying coffee at supermarkets, department stores and the flea markets.

HoHHpwDlaa	hey :]<br>  <br>  i dont know about this place from experience (cause i'm in texas)..<br>  <br>  1) but if it's a hookah bar (with no alcoholic drinks being served), then everyone has to be 18. With drinking, then yes, 21. <br>  <br>  2) Usual hookah bars charge anywhere from 5-15 dollars for one hookah. and food just depends on what they serve. check it out. call them. <br>  <br>  3) Honestly it just depends on what kinds of hookahs they have. I've seen hookahs with 6 hoses... but i kinda doubt that they would have that.<br>  In any case, i've gone with 5 other people and shared a 1 hose. If you're really anal about it, get a 2 hose, that should take care of about 8 people. keep in mind, the more hoses on the hookah, the more expensive. <br>  <br>  yeah, i understand what you mean about being money conscious. Just keep it simple. Go out to eat beforehand, something nice, but cheap. Then meet up at the hookah bar and order two 2 hose hookahs. Maybe even 3 if you're having A LOT of people go over. And drinks? make them pay for their own drinks. <br>  <br>  And look around these places. do they have comfy chairs? Annoying atmosphere? Music? Lighting? Check these places out thoroughly before you go. and if anything, SMOKE AT LEAST ONCE AT BOTH PLACES. every place uses different shishas, some even make their own. some are good, some are bad.  and PLEEASSEE check out the service. you dont want to have your party ruined by neglectful waiters with snotty attitudes. I've had my fair share of mean servers. <br>  <br>  I guess what i'm saying is, call them. check out the prices. Go over and look around. Is everyone going to fit? Smoke a bowl. Have fun with it!<br>  <br>  Hope i helped at least a little!
bBBcbFmWaa	A 2nd interview is a great sign. The two forms of ID are for tax and immigration paperwork and are a good sign that you have the job. You might get to meet co-workers and have an opportunity to ask last minute questions of each other -- that may be why it is an "interview." <br>  <br>  My first job was at Subway. Making the sandwiches was OK, but preparing the cold cuts and such was a little icky for me, but  my store manager rotated tasks or my coworkers and I would swap jobs between ourselves. At lunch it got crazy busy, but with the Subway assembly line, it went quickly.<br>  <br>  I didn't like smelling like salad after work, but it was much better than smoke or fried grease. It was a pretty good job. I got a free sub on the days that I worked, and I still eat there now. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UB7pWWHeaa	i worked there and i did actually come home smelling like bread or some weird thing. you don't get any discount, when i worked there it was only if you worked more than 4 hrs you can get a free 6''. it was a pretty easy and fun job, nothing special.|`|pueeMH6gaa	As an employee, you will be treated like garbage and you will be expected to make garbage (the sandwiches).

WfVsKW9Xaa	Quando as cebolas s?o cortadas, as suas células s?o quebradas. As células das cebolas têm duas sec??es, uma com enzimas chamadas alinases e outra com sulfuretos (sulfóxidos de aminoácidos). As enzimas decomp?em os sulfuretos produzindo ácido sulfénico. O ácido sulfénico é instável e decomp?e-se num gás volátil chamado sin-propanetial-S-óxido. O gás dissipa-se pelo ar e eventualmente chega aos olhos, onde vai reagir com a água para formar uma solu??o muito fraca de ácido sulfúrico. O ácido sulfúrico irrita as termina??es nervosas do olho, fazendo-os arder. Em resposta a esta irrita??o, as glandulas lacrimais entram em ac??o para diluir e lavar a irrita??o. é provável que tenha por hábito esfregar os olhos, mas n?o podia fazer pior uma vez que terá sumo de cebola nas m?os. N?o obstante, s?o estes compostos voláteis que d?o o sabor característico à cebola, e o aroma agradável quando cozinhada. Para reduzir a liberta??o do gás recomendas-se descascar a cebola debaixo de água corrente, ou mesmo debaixo de água, embora esta medida seja pouco prática ou ecológica. Molhar as m?os e a cebola antes de a cortar vai reduzir o efeito do gás, porquanto algum do gás vai reagir com a água das m?os ou da cebola (e n?o com a humidade dos seus olhos). O cheiro das m?os poderá ser eliminado com lim?o. Também ajuda respirar profundamente pela boca, uma vez que grande parte do gás será inalado e menos ficará disponível para reagir com os olhos. Uma faca bem afiada danifica menos células da cebola, libertando-se menos gás — logo menos irrita??o. Cebolas frias tiradas do frigorífico provocar?o menos irrita??o uma vez que as baixas temperaturas inibem a difus?o das enzimas e do gás. Outras pessoas preferem arrefecer a faca por 2 minutos no frigorífico antes de cortar as cebolas para diminuir as lágrimas. Diferentes espécies de cebolas libertar?o quantidades diferentes de ácidos, portanto a irrita??o que provocam também será diferente.<br>  <br>  beijoss!!!|`|a94cf32cbccc9ec332bcc25492b34847aa	O vegetal libera um gás que irrita os olhos e gera o aguaceiro<br>  <br>  - Quando a gente corta a cebola, algumas células do vegetal se rompem e deixam escapar uma série de compostos.

Em contato com a água dos olhos, eles reagem e formam um ácido que irrita o globo ocular. Aí, para se livrar do inc?modo, o organismo contra-ataca, produzindo um rio de lágrimas. Para evitar o aguaceiro, vale cortar as cebolas ao lado de um ventilador, evitando que os gases cheguem perto da vis?o, ou ainda molhá-las para que o ácido se forme antes de chegar aos olhos. Mas com uma m?ozinha da ciência, esse martírio pode acabar. Em outubro de 2002, cientistas japoneses descobriram uma enzima na cebola que estaria envolvida na produ??o do tal gás irritante. O desafio é produzir um vegetal geneticamente modificado, sem essa enzima.

Se o restaurante fosse no sul do Brasil, ainda dava pra pensar no assunto, pois lá existe uma col?nia alem? muito grande.<br>  N?o sou o dono da verdade, ent?o porque o seu pai, antes de botar dinheiro num negócio t?o arriscado, n?o faz antes uma pesquisa de mercado, muita gente se engana, quando pensa que o ramo de comida é fácil de se dar bem, a realidade é outra, este é o ramo de negócio mais difícil de se dar bem, além de muito trabalhoso, falo por experiência familiar e por ter trabalhado no ramo quando era adolescente.<br>  Pra terminar, qualquer negócio que se pense em abrir, primeiro coisa a fazer, pesquisar muito, testar muito, consultar pessoas do ramo. Um abra?o e sorte na vida.|`|pbiBf7tNaa	boa tarde<br>  simmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!! <br>  vai dar certo eu adoro comidas alem?s<br>  é uma delicia<br>  vou ficar com os dedos cruzados torcendo que ele consiga<br>  beijos tenha uma ótima semana e boa sorte|`|378fd2ffc1a2b824f673eff650aa9152aa	Quem sabe|`|380e2cbee4e654344facbb6940e654b1aa	se for comida caracteristica mesmo alem?, acho que n?o vai ter sucesso, no inicio talvez, por ser novidade e uma boa propaganda, eu conhe?o cidades alem?s aqui no RS e os restaurantes deles aqui nas cidades de origem alem?s n?o tem muito sucesso n?o.|`|AA12005596	Me convida pra inaugura??o (quero comer de gra?a hein!!!).
