I need a wristlet cuz a big bag just takes up space for me, and since I'm a small person a wristlet like that looks good for me. It's tiny and I can watch it better and it still holds all my stuff.      On the other hand, I do need a pair of shades because it's difficult and dangerous when I drive with the sun in my eyes. But then again, I'm also near-sighted, so I might have to get prescription UV lends for the frames which will cost more. And I normally don't wear sunglasses since I'd have to take off my regular glasses anyway.      Buying brand name $hit seems overrated and useless, but if its something I can make good use of and is of good quality, I don't mind spending the extra bucks.      Which is more worth it?

20090304224457AARa2yw	Beauty & Style;Hair	How to reduce the static in my 28 month olds hair?	I have also asked this in the toddler section but I will try here also.  Every day I spray her hair with water even though she hates it, and comb it out. I pull the top half of it into a pony tail and leave the bottom, I can't pull all of it because its not long enough yet. She still has a layer of hair that has not come in yet. By the time we get to daycare her hair is so full of static that it all stands straight up, as if someone rubbed it with a balloon. Is there a product I can put in her hair that is safe for her age and will reduce the static without it looking dirty? I've tried detangling spray, it doesn't work. She is 28 months old.   We are not talking about little bumps in the pony tail, it is hair actually standing straight up

20090304223907AAidKxy	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair DISASTER!!!! HELP!!!! Lol?	Okay so in October of last year I dyed my hair black (which is my natural color). I did it to dye over the blonde and hot pink streaks.      Now we are in March and I want it light brown and blonde on the bottom =]      Sooo I went to Sallys and bought some Quick Blue bleach and bleached the bottom half then added a blonde toner... it'll take another try but I think after I bleach/tone it again I'll get the blonde color I want.      Now as for the top, I did a strand test first, and it looked okay, all my hair took the color, not just the roots. Well wut I forgot was that I picked hair out from the middle and back where my hair is shorter (I have a long bob) and so when I looked at the strand, it looked fine. NOW when I dyed all my hair... its a mess!!! There's about 4 inches of medium golden brown hair ("roots") and the rest is super dark, just a little lighter than black!!!!      I refuse to walk around this way, so what I plan to do is bleach the whole top of my head lol, then re-deposit the brown dye.       My question is, since I JUST dyed it today (iON prof. hair dye), what can I expect tomorrow when I bleach it? Will it take? Will my hair fall out????      :-/

20090305000124AA0xP8p	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Why do my eyebrow hairs change direction when squinting?	On the bottom of my brow I have these normal looking hairs. When I have a normal straight face the hairs are normal going upward, but when I squint several of those hairs actually point downward towards my eyes. Like they completely change the direction they point in. I have noticed this with other parts of my body too. For example when I don't shave for a couple days the facial hair closest to my lips move with different mouth expressions. What is going on here? It feels really freaky to squint and see hairs slowly move as I do so. I have ocd and i cannot explain why but it bothers me so much. I have tried plucking those hairs, but it was stupid because they are part of my eyebrow that needs to be there. I have tried trimming but they still move just as much, only they are shorter hairs instead...

The strap is long and is worn across the shoulder. The bag is usually made out of a soft material like cotton and the bags vary in size, but on average are about the size of an average canvas tote.      I would really love a plain black bag like this. Preferably with a zipper, but I have no idea what to search for. I've been trying. Can anyone help me out?

What will the social impact be? I've researched the procedure and the after-care, and it seems simple enough. It's not something I'll rush into. Just so you know, I am a teen. I'm not doing it because of peer pressure, it's because I consider them beautiful. Please don't give me the old "how will you feel about it when you're fifty?" argument. Nose piercings are one of the fastest to close up after healing over- in only a matter of months. This is not on whim, I've considered it for a few years.       Please, your opinions!

20090305013727AAUQJKh	Beauty & Style;Hair	Help I hate my new haircut!?	I have really thin straight hair so I thought getting a long blunt fringe with an angled cut (just below my shoulders) would look trendy and make it look like I had hair that wasn't thin and oily. It looked good for the first 2 days, but then I had to blow dry and straighten it, and I can't get it anything like the hairdresser did it!      It looks way too thick all over, I can't get the front bits to come down to a point and the back bits to sit on my shoulder like she showed me! And to make things worse I asked for my colour to match my natural darker roots, which are light brown. But she coloured it dark brown and I now look like a boofy emily the strange, which is not the intended result! I know it's semi pemanent so I am hoping it will wash out... if anyone knows of ANYTHING I can do that might make this cut look like it was supposed to look, or get the horrid colour out quicker I would be totally grateful!

Last week I met a man when I was out and we have had a couple of dates since and things are going well, but every time I have seen him I have been wearing my wig. Its getting near the point where he wants to stay over and have more causal dates like just coming over to watch a film etc I now have a major issue!!       I cant wear this wig indefinatly but how am I going to bring the subject up with him that the long hair on my head isnt actually attached to my scalp. he is white so its not like he is going to have grown up with black women and be aware of the wild and wacky things we do to our hair!! What should I do should I tell him or just call it off with him and next time be more honest from the start?? It's really stressing me out as my hair is a major sensitive subject!!

20090305003520AAV4Rf3	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Professional Tattoo/Piercing Interview Help?	Hey!   I'm currently attending High School and at the moment I am studying in year 12. At this time I am trying to complete a HSC Assessment Task, for my Community and Family Studies course. The assessment task is a IRP or Independent Research Project. For my IRP topic I choose to do Body Modification. Focusing on general body modification, and the laws involved when getting anytype of modification. I was wondering if one of the fellow Tattoo Artists or Body Piercers could do a interview? Just fill out these questions below would be a huge help thanks!      1. So before I start bombarding you with questions on body modification, could I please get your name, and your age, and where you work?      2. Do you personally have any type of body modification? If so what?      3. So how long have you been interested in body modification? Was there anything that sparked this interest or was it just always there?       4. How long have you been doing your work professional?       5. What level of education did you require to get into this profession?      6. You must get loads of customers everyday. On average what age group and gender do you see the most getting a body modification?      7. What type of body modification is most common?       8. What type of body modification is least common?      9. What was the strangest request you’ve gotten?       10. Now moving that to the side, how do you feel about the new laws on body modification? Do you agree that individuals under the age of eighteen must have their parents with them when getting a body modification?      11. Do you believe that society is pushing the law too far, or that we should just follow what they lay upon us?

I'm 17 and today I got my librett pierced...well I was telling my friend who got his lip pierced and he was all like horrified saying the piercer did it wrong.

So I sat in a chair and she got these clamp forcep things and put it on my bottom lip. Then she asked me if I wanted it high or low and I said I didn't know. So she said she would put in in a usual place. Then she reached over and grabbed a needle out of the drawer and put it through. It really, really hurt and I thought they weren't suppose to? When I explain all this to my friend he said I was meant to get moutwash, and she shouldv'e marked out the pierce place and everything, but she didn't do any of that! She wore gloves but that was it. And I looked this place up on the net and rang them and they said they have the best hygene standard around and use all really good stuff so I did do my homework but now it sounds like she did it wrong? Now it's all swollen and my whole chin is red and it hurts to move my mouth. And on the inside of my lip the stud back is all caught under the skin. Please help, I don't know what to do and I'm in so much pain.

20090305033012AAZUVOa	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Why don't they sell plus sizes in stores?	Look, I'm a curvy lady and I'm not a stick. I will never be a stick. I'm not built for that. I can't understand why they don't sell size 15's in American Eagle or Aeropostale. It irritates me because I know that there are other teenage girls like myself out there who see really cute stuff in clothes that they don't even make the sizes for and we have to buy online, pay shipping and handling and everything and wait three to five business days for the damned things to arrive! IMO that's sort of discriminating against curvy or 'chubby' women and teens. I'm just curious as to why we can't just buy them in the store like the stick people.
