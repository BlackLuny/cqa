1EN9ngsbaa	It wasn't that bad.  I once made a terrible video that in a year, got 20 views.  Don't worry.  Although I can understand that you would want more.  So maybe you should take some of this advice:<br>  <br>  You should try to be really good with tags. I mean, dont just put in "fireworks, explosion" if your video is about fireworks. Try to use all types of things, like "fireworks, Explosion, colorful, pattern, night, time, dark fire, launch, sparks" stuff like that.<br>  <br>  And it would also help to have a great title. Something like "Fourth of July Fireworks" probaly wont rack in alot of views. Something like "Fireworks are pretty..." would probaly get more, but not as many as "I LIGHT THINGS ON FIRE!" Just make sure not to lie to your viewers, but if you really do lit the fireworks off, that would be an appropriate title.<br>  <br>  Another great thing to do it to have a great thumbnail. I disagree throughly with people who put something like a women with her shirt almost off as the thumbnail, because most of the time that has nothing to do with the video. Most of the time they just times it there so it would flash for a second, then continue on with the video. What YOU should do is if your video is about fireworks, and you names it "I LIGHT THINGS ON FIRE!" then maybe the middle frame should be you with a lighter on next to your face. Something to get viewers to go "ot oh, what is that guy going to do?" Just make sure that that lighter part is legitinmetly about your video.<br>  <br>  One of the best things to do is to make your video a response to a very popular video, or to a new video that might not have alot of views yet, but their subscriber count is high. <br>  <br>  For example, if you make a video talking about some bizzare news story, and sXephil, A popular youtuber, mentions the same story in his video, make it a video response to it. With a good thumbnail, it should rack in the viewers. Or if your video is a video about how to do something, like make something, or a trick on the computer, make your video a repsonse to one of householdhacker new video.<br>  <br>  If you do want to have an extra boost in your video veiws, you could use an atuo refrsher. mind you, THIS IS AGAINST THE YOUTUBE RULES. if youtube catches you, you could get suspened or even banned. to download a atuop refresher, click here: <a href="http://www.download.com/AutoRefresher-fo..." rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/AutoRefresher-fo...</a><br>  <br>  There is a quick and easy way to get more channel views though, and this IS legal, it is for now anyways. they might soon change that. but you can download a channel refrsher if you want. to learn more about it, watch this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKwFC_aZk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKwFC_aZk...</a><br>  <br>  It also helps to have external links from youtube.

Everytime you can post it without whoring yourself, DO IT|`|WlXyYovFaa	One person helped me to get views.<br>  She told me that other will view ur video only if its already have some views.And truely I started seeing views after she provided me 1000000 views.<br>  She brought more the 1000000 views to my video.<br>  And told me that if I want more she can provide that too.<br>  Only thing is that she work for money.<br>  Her email id is get.youtube.expert@gmail.com|`|oRmq0qhUaa	I like it...

43XA0LIraa	Yes.<br>  <br>  A frame grabber is an electronic device that captures individual, digital still frames from an analog video signal or a digital video stream.<br>  <br>  A framebuffer is a video output device that drives a video display from a memory buffer containing a complete frame of data. The information in the buffer typically consists of color values for every pixel (point that can be displayed) on the screen. Color values are commonly stored in 1-bit monochrome, 4-bit palettized, 8-bit palettized, 16-bit highcolor and 24-bit truecolor formats. An additional alpha channel is sometimes used to retain information about pixel transparency. The total amount of the memory required to drive the framebuffer depends on the resolution of the output signal, and on the color depth and palette size.

You pretty much use it when you go onto My Computer etc. What I suggest doing is setting Opera as your default browser ( Right Click Start Menu --> Properties --> Default Browser --> Opera) and completely ignore IE 7. You should also clear IE 7's cache, temp files etc by download software such as CCleaner for a clean sweep or just use IE 7's inbuilt one for a rough clean.<br>  Hope this helped :D|`|R3yUkaCSaa	no u can not it is impossible the monkey told me so.|`|2CiPsRGhaa	No, Microsoft Internet Explorer is tightly integrated with Microsoft Windows. Microsoft wants ("hopes" is a better word) IE to be the only web browser you will ever use so it comes included with Windows. Microsoft did not intend IE to be totally uninstalled and you can't totally uninstall it manually.<br>  <br>  If you see "Windows Internet Explorer 7" in your Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel and you try to click on the Remove button, all that will do is downgrade your IE to version 6. In other words, you will still have IE no matter what, just an earlier version of it.<br>  <br>  Your only choice is to simply ignore it.|`|8wyowipRaa	Since you already have Opera web browser, all you have to do is go into your Control Panel and select Uninstall A Program.

E5mFWOqqaa	If you want a decent recommendation, you need a budget. If you are expecting the laptop to last through college, you should avoid buying anything under about $650-minimum. <br>  <br>  Lenovo and HP have the best build quality in the business. You can get a good laptop from either one with 3-4GB RAM and a 250 or 320GB hard drive for about $750, if you look hard enough.<br>  <br>  Avoid anything from Dell or Acer (Acer also owns Gateway and eMachines, so don't be fooled by either of those brands). They're the crappiest in terms of build quality- it's about even with the quality of their tech support (and I've used just about every major laptop vendor's tech support at one point or another). These companies use a low price to attract people, but don't use quality parts, which kills the quality of the product.<br>  <br>  If you need any further help, do feel free to message me.

TRLsiqZOaa	I'd stop calling yourself a hacker if I were you. Don't pretend to be something you're not. <br>  <br>  Anyway, you're IP address is assigned by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) such as Road Runner or whatever. If you're trying to browse anonymously, I recomend a simple proxy server that you can route web traffic through by configuring your web-browser.<br>  <br>  If it's more that just anonymouse web browsing you're wanting to do, and I'm guessing it is since you're a "hacker", you'll need a more elaborate solution. <br>  <br>  What you need is The Onion Router, a.k.a. TOR. Read all you can about this, learn how to use it, and then install it. Perhaps a portable installation package with Firefox, and be sure to configure your programs to work with TOR. It's not fullproof, but it's close, and nothing is 100% full proof. <br>  <br>  Good luck my n00b grasshopper|`|pDxFOekIaa	i thought your IP address belonged to your ISP.  nothibng to do with your system|`|e621ca26fe7601dde0c793fb09f05e78aa	you can do it by doing this<br>  1- go into start - all programs - accesroies - communications - and sellect  network connections<br>  2- a network connections window will pop out <br>  3- you will then see your network connnections. <br>  4- look for the network connection that you want to change the ip address (only look for more if there is more than one nework connection.) <br>  5- and click on repair <br>  6- it will automaticly get you a new ip address BUT it will put all your network connection down temporarely for about 1 to 3 min until says thats it is done

You need a Dell OEM disk with the same O/S (probably XP Home).<br>  Put the disk into the CD rom, boot to the cd rom and allow it to format the computer and install the O/S.

You are usually tracked by your MAC address.<br>  <br>  A MAC address is a number that identifies your computer when it is sending information across the internet or through a server. The MAC address is a part of your NIC (Network Interface Card). Your network interface card is what you plug your Ethernet cable into on your computer or if you use wireless it is what receives your internet connection.<br>  <br>  A MAC address is also known as a Physical address, the FBI uses it to investigate internet related cases. You can try to cover it with programs but your NIC card will always have it's original address. Another reason that it has it's own "unique" code is so when packets are sent and received there is no error in the transmission of data as this is used to direct where data is sent. Packets are each labeled with this number if your computer has that mac address it will receive the packets if not then your computer will discard the packet.<br>  <br>  If you wish to know more about this I would advise reading Mike Meyer's Managing and Troubleshooting Networks|`|IbxhRebgaa	As Chi Rho and Caspur said, you could use proxies.

nmlznwRTaa	It looks like the only difference is the screen size and the hard drive space.  Its now really up to you if you want an 18.4 in screen or a 16.4 in screen.  A good way to look at it is, will this be at home or are you going to be carrying it around a lot.  If you carry it around I recommend the smaller one since its easier to carry and its lighter.  If your going to leave it at one place most of the time then go for the bigger screen since you are playing games.  If you don't mind the hassle of lugging it around, get the bigger screen, you are playing games after all.

6Djqii7Xaa	What VPN are you using?<br>  <br>  If you are using Windows and their VPN, then when you connect to the VPN, it automatically changes what are called the routing tables. I believe the default is that it no longer use your local gateway to access the internet, but to use the gateway at the server end instead. Any existing sessions you have with services that are not asynchronous in nature will no longer exist. Thus Skype bite the dust. If the network on the server side is not set up properly, you may not be able to access the internet from that gateway. So you can perhaps access the stuff on the server network, but not anything beyond that.<br>  <br>  Using remote desktop does not cause the routing tables on your machine to change, so you don't have the same kind of issues with that.<br>  <br>  You can try going into the VPN connection properties and turn off the "use the remote gateway" option and see if that helps. If you are not using the stock Windows VPN, I cannot tell you what to do there.<br>  <br>  For Windows, go to Control Panel, Network Connections. Right click the VPN connection and select Properties. Click on the Networking tab.<br>  <br>  Select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) from the list, then click the Properties button. Then click the Advanced button. On the general tab, there should be a checkbox "Use default gateway on remote networ". Un check the box, then OK your way back out.

RjwyRrxtaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

Out of those three I would suggest HP though. For those who are not adapted to Apple/Mac it can be hard to understand. Dell prices their products cheap but their components are trash. Their products are built with very cheap parts and tend to last a short period of time. HP I don't much care for but out of the three it's a mid grade product made with better parts than dell but also usually more expensive.<br>  <br>  I rebuild computers myself and when I have the money I upgrade my own computers.|`|sSEy6KYiaa	Apple because they are about 5 years ahead of everybody else in the industry.

It's really sad that Apple is willing to charge damn near $2000 or more for one of their computers.  It's highway robbery and since most people don't use these unless they are into graphic design (which they are superior in) it holds no value to other people who either game or program.<br>  <br>  Dell: Dell used to be the best when it came down to personalization.  They also had an excellent customer service reputation.  Their PCs are ok at best.  You dish out money to get a good computer and that's where Dell falls a bit.  Most of their PCs are a bit too pricey and recently Dell outsources their CS to India because they're cheap and rather save money than help customers now.<br>  <br>  HP: No.  Stay away.  HPs over the years I have had to repair these monstrosites were the epitome of garbage.  They breakdown easily since they have a lack of a decent cooling system.  Their parts are mediocre at best and forget about the service.  I'd rather talk to someone in India than get help there.  It should never be in anyone's wishlist for anything.<br>  <br>  If it was out of those 3 companies, I'd rank it like this:<br>  <br>  1) Apple, 2) Dell, 0) HP<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a good PC, build your own.  For laptops: Lenovo (IBM), or Toshiba (which I own 2).  Far better than most, especially that crap HP.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	I just bought Dell XPS laptop because all I've ever had are Dells.  I had everything top of the line in it.  So far the disk drive has totally stopped working.  Then one day the computer just died.  I called their help desk and they charged me a couple hundred bucks and then walked me through stuff that didn't work.  They said they'd call back in 20 minutes (BTW, these were OBVIOUSLY not people in the US).  After waiting for them to call after 3 hours I finally called them back and got somebody else.  This person was able to remote into my computer.  They wasted another three hours running a zillion virus scans.  At exactly 5PM the guy said he would call me back tomorrow.  He said 10AM.  I said okay.  The next morning I stayed home and waited.  At 11:30 I called them back and ended up having to go through the whole stupid press 1, press 2,, etc again.  I finally hung up and sent a "nice" note to Dell.  Bottom line.  I will NEVER buy a Dell again.  Their customer services is obviously extremely outsourced and didn't seem to know how to do anything other than try to run virus scan after virus scan.  My disk drive still doesn't work.  My computer will turn on but shuts down for no reason.  I'm taking it to a real place for repairs this weekend.  They refunded a portion of my money but told me the entire refund could take several weeks.|`|TXKKOa1Jaa	Apple because, they're faster, lighter, more portable, and can have many apps downloadable.|`|47I8LVjXaa	I like dell because I get a discount on there product because of where I work so|`|taBbKvRwaa	Apple is a great product.|`|HOS6vlgraa	Apple.<br>  <br>  Dell are okay~<br>  HP is just fail.|`|tIDNEwdMaa	A list of common lies and misinformation and plain old stupidity against the Macintosh platform:<br>  <br>  1) Macs are more expensive than PC's<br>    a) Macs have a useful life about twice that of PC's.   A Mac user will be replacing his computer half as often as a PC user.  Do the math.  Macs are cheaper than PC's.<br>    b) How many times have you bought a PC with the idea of going somewhere to buy the hardware necessary to upgrade it?  The only thing I add when I bring a new Mac home is memory, which I get cheaper from someone other than Apple.  Do the math.  Macs are cheaper than PC's.<br>  <br>  2) "Everyone" uses Windows.<br>    a) Gee.  Isn't that nice.<br>    b) If "Everyone" uses Windows, why are we having this conversation?<br>    c) Just because it is "popular" does nor mean it is a good thing.  Hula Hoops, pet rocks, Tomakachi, etc were all popular at one time.  Popular does have a long standing and is not a standard by which to judge the usefulness of a product.<br>  <br>  3) Windows is better for gaming than Macs.<br>    a) True, but if the people who keep saying this truly stood by the logic of what is the better system from games, they would instead say something like, "don't listen to those idiots who say Macs suck at games.  Get yourself a game console like PS2 or Xbox.  A game console is better at games than Windows."  But they aren't saying that are they?  What good is their advice is they can't stand by it themselves?<br>  <br>  4) There isn't enough software for the Mac.<br>  a) With the exception of games (read #3), there is no type of software application available for Windows that is not available for the Mac.  While you may not find a Macintosh version of an application made by the same company for some products, you will still find selects for the same task.<br>  b) Volume?  Yes, there is a large number of selections for Windows than for the Mac, but walk down the aisle and see how much of that selection is crap and/or outdated (and discounted) software.  Take that software out of the pictures and the gap narrows considerably.<br>  <br>  5) There isn't enough hardware for the Mac.<br>  a) Like the software misinformation, hardware selection for the Mac is lesser in number, but not as it is for software.  Hardware is not OS specific.  It is driver controlled.  A couple weeks of coded and testing will create a driver for the Mac OS.  Most companies are willing to take the time and expense of doing this.  Based on my experience, it is the crap hardware that usually does not have Mac drivers.  This is because the manufacturer knows that crap hardware does not have a future among Mac users.  We won't buy it.<br>  <br>  6) Macs are gay!<br>  a) This is so sophomoric, it's hard t respond to.  Why take advice from someone who would think this is an intelligent argument?  'nuff said.<br>  <br>  7) Software written for Windows will not run on a Mac.<br>  a) Software written the Mac will no run in Windows.  I guess by this logic, you can't buy a computer at all.<br>  b) Well, not exactly.  While there is no [legal] way to run the Mac OS in Windows, you can use Boot Camp or Parallels to run Windows on a Mac, which means you can run Windows software on a Mac.  But this is not a good reason to get a Mac, as getting away from Windows is one of the reasons to use a Mac.<br>  <br>  8) Windows 7 is coming out soon and will be better than Vista.<br>  a) Windows 7 is essentially an improved version of Vista.  Microsoft decided to remove the Vista name plate to increase sales.  If it doesn't say Vista, then it isn't Vista.  Buyers will think it is better.<br>  b) Only Windows ME was worse than what it replaced.  While Windows 7 is likely to be better than Vista.  This does not mean that it will be better than Mac OS.  This argument compares Windows to Windows, not Windows to the Mac.  What value does this argument have?<br>  <br>  9) Mac are for multimedia.<br>  a) Yes, there are.<br>  b) Macs are for web browsing, video editing, photo editing, audio editing, word processing, blogging, email, home work, writing, research, and everything else you might want to do with a home computer.<br>  <br>  10) Macs are for idiots.<br>  a) Let me translate:  "Macs are easier to use than PC's, so that must be designed for stupid people, right?"  Tom Hanks, Stephen Speilberg, Buss Aldin, Martha Stewart, the late Bris Yelsin, Malcom Forbes, Jr, Richard Dawkins, Tom Clancy, Scott Adams, Trent Reznor, The Rolling Stones, Bono, Conan O'Brien, Jerry Seinfeld, Rush Limbaugh, Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, and Tim Allen, must all be idiots.  But I'm sure that anyone can compile a list of smart people who use Windows.  The intelligence of the user is not correlated with their choice of computer.  This argument is either driving by the low intelligence of the person saying it, or but "sure grapes".<br>  <br>  11) You can't upgrade a Mac.<br>  a) I have no idea where this lie comes from.  Yes, you can upgrade a Mac.  Thing is, why would you need to upgrade your Mac?  With the possible exception of Memory, the Mac come fully loaded.  And for most people, the Mac comes with enough Memo|`|MIR3eC5kaa	hp makes great quality laptops! i have one that is 7 years old and i still use games on it . hp uses higher quality materials and they have better gaming laptops too and thy are at a good price.

I love my Mac, I'm able to do anything and everything I want to do (photoshop, audio recording, create really nice looking DVDs, all sorts of other fun things) with my apple. One of the things I love about Apple is the software that comes standard with every computer. Things like garageband (audio editing software), iDVD, iPhoto, and many others are very powerful tools that are free when you buy a mac. <br>  <br>  Macs also aren't prone to spyware/virus infections the way PCs are. In fact, one of the reasons I finally switched to a Mac was my frustration with keeping my computer "healthy". I got sick of having to maintain my computer, and I wanted something that just works. My mac fit this bill perfectly.<br>  <br>  Also, even though I know you said not to mention this, the screen on my Macbook Pro is VERY sharp, it makes pictures, movies, and basically everything look much nicer than any PC notebook screen I've ever seen. <br>  <br>  (An aside: new intel-based Macs can also run windows using a program called "Boot Camp", a free download from the Apple website.)<br>  <br>  That being said, Macs are much more expensive than Dells. You can get a lot of computer for not much money when buying Dell, or PC in general. To be honest, a lot of what you're paying for in a Mac is the chic factor. Macs are hip, and Apple knows this. This isn't to say they aren't worth the money, I feel the money I spent on my Mac was well worth it. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. feel free to send me a message if you have any more questions.|`|YUEnTxG0aa	APPLE. it is the greatest decision you will ever make in your life.<br>  I am 14 and I have a new generation Macbook for school (yes, very lucky).

If you dont want a macintosh computer and would rather stick with windows you should steer away from dell, if a dell computer breaks down they are hard to fix because you have to buy the exact same part that broke and it very hard to get replacements, whereas HP is a very reliable computer brand that really never breaks down.<br>  <br>  For more help with computer go to: <a href="http://computertipsnow.com" rel="nofollow">http://computertipsnow.com</a>|`|UIgDmhnIaa	apple!|`|f85459126cfd7c5ea3b1362df9d88d56aa	It will depend on what you're going to use it for.<br>  <br>  Apples (MAC) handle graphics MUCH better than the others.

RjwyRrxtaa	There are a several reasons why your computer is freezing/slow. First question is when the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  Go to:<a href="http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectiveregistrycleaner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...</a> get one to free scan your pc<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.<br>  <br>  3.

Hard drive failure - usually a failed hard drive will not boot, but can often be seen when hooked up as a slave.<br>  So when you get your new hard drive up and running, you can copy D drive from your old to your new. You haven’t lost anything.<br>  <br>  2. Virus. Normally virus are programmed to infect C drive. If you get a bad virus all that has to be done is format the C drive partition then re install you OS and programs from disks.<br>  You haven’t lost your personal stuff because its on D drive.<br>  <br>  3. Scanning your C drive for virus or spyware. These malware programs live on C drive. It is not necessary to scan D drive. It is a lot quicker to scan a small partition than a large hard drive.<br>  <br>  Now you can see the above is compromised by the fact that programs get updates and lots of programs are installed from the net. Therefore if you had to wipe out C drive it be hard to get it back to how it was.<br>  To remedy this we use Norton Ghost to image C drive and store the Image on D drive.<br>  (Vista requires a version 10 or newer of Ghost).<br>  <br>  If you get a bad virus you just use the Ghost disk to boot up on, then copy the image stored on D drive back over C drive.<br>  It takes less than 30 mins to rebuild C drive.<br>  Also you may have this running on say a 250 gig HDD, and it fails.  You buy a new 400 gig HDD and install both into you computer, the failed one as a slave.<br>  Using the ghost disk to boot up on, you partition the 400 C drive to 30 gig (XP)and the remaining to D drive.  Then you repack C drive from the image.  Then Copy your old D drive files to your new one. In a time of less than 1 hour and it’s all running.  The image loads all the drivers, OS everything.<br>  <br>  Then you update new images of C drive every few months so that the one stored on D drive is not to far out of date.<br>  <br>  On XP and Vista you create C drive to a maximum of (XP 30 gig, Vista 40 Gig) It doesn’t need to be any bigger,  so don’t make C drive to big as you will not use it.<br>  All drives including external hdd should be in NTFS type file system.<br>  Type DISKPART in windows help file<br>  also Disk manager.<br>  click the desktop, hit Fn1 key.<br>  <br>  Vista:<br>  <a href="http://www.lytebyte.com/2007/02/19/how-to-partition-in-windows-vista-extend-and-shrink/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lytebyte.com/2007/02/19/how-t...</a><br>  <br>  This is another point of view that is very interesting, where you would make C drive 10 gig (XP) or 15 gig(Vista) , make D drive for your programs (same size) then the rest as H or F drive for your files.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u_DHseKdu0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u_DHseKd...</a>|`|PSVy9ZCpaa	Seagate, western digital, maxtor drives all come with a setup program that will allow you to Clone your existing drive to the new drive, if you choose.

Wf8PbTraaa	its private so i can't see...but the simple answer would be to get rid of some of your codes.|`|6p5IK0kcaa	id get rid of some of the codes, love the profile pic too
UqjhzivJaa	If it's been continually doing that and getting worse, it's a pretty clear sign that the monitor is and/or was dying.<br>  Most likely you're looking at needing to replace the screen.
BlA60kDVaa	It needs drivers.  This is basically some software/set of instructions that tells your computer how to use this new external hardware device.<br>  <br>  Google the make and model of your USB Flash Drive and get the drivers for it.|`|Xe94coYQaa	What does recogised mean?
2CiPsRGhaa	If you must use your school's network, then the only way around this is to request your school's network administrator for permission to access Facebook.<br>  <br>  Another way around this is to get your own Internet access, then no one can stop you. If you can only use your school's network, then you're at the mercy of your school. If you attempt to hack your school's network to bypass this, you may get disciplined or expelled.

8Yd3UO0Baa	Depends on your service provider, etc. For many people it does and that's quite normal.|`|IbxhRebgaa	If you have a dynamic IP address, then yes, it's supposed to change occasionally. It doesn't have to be very often, however. My IP has only changed twice in the past year.<br>  <br>  You almost certainly have a dynamic IP address. Nearly all residential connections are dynamic. Most of the time, you have to pay extra and/or ask your ISP for a static IP address. Most people have no use for a static IP.|`|QPB6e3lVaa	Your IP address many times is served up by a DHCP server, the server has a limited number of addresses, so when you turn your computer off it may give your address to someone else. When you turn your computer on again the server will automatically give you a new one. It does not change anything.|`|LVx6UZxSaa	if you use DHCP your IP is suppose to change, by default you will be assigned a dynamic IP (dynamic IPs changes, static does not)|`|ULw1777caa	Depends what service you have.  Your ISP controls it.  DSL always changes when the modem is reset, cable is static.  If you have a router, that IP will never change unless you reset it in the router.
WMXPzMQJaa	Having 4gb of ram on vista 32 bit will neither help nor hurt your performance. It will just be recognized as 3.5 gb.|`|eTLG23N4aa	If your computer performs well i wouldn't slash my wrists over what that Index tells you in Vista. Any Company that creates an operating system with as many problems as Vista surely can't know totally everything about your computer. It's just a guide anyway.|`|RQwFq0Fwaa	4gb ram...you need a very faster processor for 4gb ram...my processor is 3ghz to run 2gb ram....i could add more but it wouldnt make any difference to gaming|`|7nimzIDsaa	Nope ratings aren't accurate, 4gb of rams will do more good than 2gb (the 1:1 ratio with your cpu is not a proven concept). <br>  <br>  It is possible to configure the ram timings via bios. And since you have done overclocking, i'll expect you to know your stuff. Having said so buying the right rams for overclocking is crucial (not as in the brand), some rams can't be overclock or only support a certain range of clockspeed and ram timings. Be sure to run an instance of superPi and validate the results to see if your rams return any error during the calculation process.|`|HjaByteraa	yeah it does make a big diff the latency in the vista score.  my ram is 2gb 400 mhz but cas of 3 and overclocked to 450 mhz i have 5.9 vista score.  my friend has 4 gb 800mhz but cas 5, and she has 4.9 vista score.

Some people prefer Macs, some don't. Macs tend to be more expensive. They may be simpler to use. This leads some people to say Macs are for dummies. They aren't. Macs may do some things better than a Windows pc but, also, you can do some things on a Windows pc that you can't do on a Mac. <br>  <br>  Some people will also say Macs are immune to viruses. That probably shows their ignorance. For one thing, very few harmful viruses are created any more, even for Windows. Other malware is very prevalent and Macs most certainly *aren't* immune, see:<br>  <a href="http://www.sophos.com/pressoffice/news/articles/2006/02/macosxleap.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sophos.com/pressoffice/news/a...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/26/more_mac_malware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/26/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/21/stealthier_mac_attacks" rel="nofollow">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/21/...</a>|`|OHXDloIdaa	If you want to play a game that requires more graphics than chess, a windows maching wins.

rNA6x4r2aa	A virus is neither cool nor is it something you want to use as a prank. If you want to prank someone, find something that is not illegal.|`|wUqeZl3Saa	Once you release the virus for your "prank" how will you stop it? Before you try to rationalize the idea with all sorts of ways that might stop it, Remember that once it is released, anyone with enough skill could modify it to do things not intended in the original design.<br>  <br>  That is the first question I ask everyone who finds out I'm an old hacker and they want a virus program to give to so and so, their ex, etc. Most simply don't know and the rest simply state "I never thought of that". I will not teach you how to write a virus program nor will I write one for you.<br>  <br>  Invariably, I'm often the one they call to clean up the mess after the virus program rips them a new one. While that may be good for me, it is senseless that I should even have to clean up any mess. I have found unique malware that anti-virus software couldn't detect. It is people like me who find and report these little problems to anti-virus companies.<br>  <br>  The really short answer is you don't make a virus ever. These days with the speed of the internet, a well written virus would spread very quickly. You would never be sure you stopped it.<br>  <br>  If you want to pull a prank on someone, do something that is harmless and will be funny when they find out. Change their desktop picture to a nice soft bunny with a caption " Ultimate Haxor" or something. No I won't tell you how to do that either. There are plenty of other pranks you can pull on people that won't ever get loose and infect half the internet.<br>  <br>  Given your understanding of a virus, you have a lot to learn.<br>  <br>  Shadow Wolf|`|6kC9me0baa	Open the command prompt and type HELP<br>  Hit enter, that'll you give a list of commands.

zorYTX59aa	There are virtually three very different things you can do<br>  to try and find a video that you have watched previously.<br>  Your results may appear either: 1) in alphabetical order, <br>  2) in chronological order or 3) in photo "thumbnail" form:<br>  <br>  ALPHABETICALLY (tons of results):<br>  highlight your entire URL address bar, then simply type<br>  in the word "youtube". From those results, you will see:<br>  -- every YouTube URL that you typed<br>  -- every YouTube channel you visited <br>  -- every video URL that you watched <br>  (although in ugly YouTube code: eg, ?v=Ab1Cd2Ef3Gh).<br>  <br>  CHRONOLOGICALLY (many results):<br>  simply click on your internet browser's "History" button<br>  or tap "CTRL" and the letter "H" on your keyboard, and<br>  you will get a daily list of every website which you have<br>  viewed. YouTube will be mixed in with the others but at<br>  least it will be much easier to find what you are looking<br>  for, because everything will be shown in "plain" English.<br>  And because every YouTube video has its own website,<br>  you'll also be able to see the full title of each video.<br>  <br>  PHOTO THUMBNAIL (few results):<br>  at the top right of just about every YouTube page is the <br>  word "QuickList". Click on that, and then once you are<br>  on the new page, click on "History" immediately below <br>  the highlighted grey bar. You will see thumbnails of the <br>  most recent videos you have viewed, but only the most <br>  recent. That is because every time that you open / exit <br>  YouTube, everything vanishes, and starts all over again. <br>  <br>  Believe it or not, you can see your YouTube "QuickList"<br>  and "viewing history" from right here within Yahoo.

Before jumping to conclusions try checking wires and jumpers.<br>  <br>  Other suspect might be CPU. Do you hear a beep at the beginning? sometimes laptops have sound codes and no beep could also mean there is a problem with the CPU. Some newer CPU shut themselves off if there isn't proper cooling so see if all the fans are connected, ports are cleaned, and thermal grease is applied properly to CPU heat sink.<br>  <br>  Since your graphics isn't discrete then you can't replace graphics without replacing the mother board.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	If you want to learn programming don't start by learning languages, start by learning programming.  (Try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0130224189/ref=pd_bbs_sr_olp_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212765521&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0...</a> - it's the best book on proigramming I've ever found, and I've been teaching programming for 30 years.)<br>  <br>  Once you understand programming, pick a few easy (and free) languages, like VB or php and start applying what you learned.  (If you know programming, all you have to learn is syntax for a new language.  If you just learn languages, you're learning a whole new subject for each language.  length(myString) and myString.length look like completely different things to you.)  Oh, you'll have to learn object oriented programming too (an entirely different subject) but languages aren't programming, they're tools to do programming in.  Learn programming first.  If you know how to build a house, learning "hammer" is easy.  If you don't, building a house with a hammer is very difficult.<br>  <br>  I started as an electrical engineer and taught myself programming.  I've been supporting a family with it for 35 years.  Can you do it without a degree?  Sure, but a degree gets you in the door.  (That's all it does, though - a degree with a 4.0 GPA and no ability to program won't get you the job, where being an ace programmer and having no degree might.)|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	You can learn from books.  You don't need a degree, although credentials always help.<br>  <br>  Programming requires a certain type of personality.  If you have that type, you'll like it; if you don't, you'll hate it.  Programming jobs are not lucrative or secure enough to justify doing it if you don't like it, but if you like it, it's a reasonable way to earn a living.<br>  <br>  With no experience, your best bet is to take some sort of formal training so that you'll have a piece of paper you can wave at potential employers.  You don't need formal training just to learn to program, but it looks good on your resume.<br>  <br>  Programming is a lot like composing music.  The difference is that people compose songs for their aesthetic value, whereas people write programs for their practical value.  The same principles apply for both. You have a fixed, predefined set of tools with which to work, and you have an objective, and you use the tools to create something that reaches the objective.  There are many, many ways to reach that objective, so the final solution you create depends on your own personality and skill.<br>  <br>  Ask five composers to score a motion picture, and you'll get five completely different types of music, all of which will attain the same objective.  Ask five programmers to write an accounting program, and you'll get five completely different programs, with totally different look and feel, but they'll all attain the same objective.|`|LVx6UZxSaa	look into the programming classes and certifications that CompTIA and Cicso offer|`|Bj7IULS4aa	I use these<br>  <br>  <a href="http://xoax.net/" rel="nofollow">http://xoax.net/</a>|`|VgwgV5zsaa	You can learn on your own but you will have better luck with at least a AS degree.  <br>  It's not that hard to learn, most languages have API's where you can check the actual use of a method or function.  <br>  <br>  Best advice, enroll in some classes.  Pick a language you want, any of the C's, C+/C++/C#, and VB's are pretty typical, even Java works.  Then create your own scripts sticking with one language and small scripts to start.<br>  <br>  Java isn't so good at processing but can be used on multiple platforms. <br>  <br>  Same for the C language but is a VERY common coding language<br>  <br>  VB is exclusive to the Microsoft Windows OS and is very powerful.|`|jLe6GDu8aa	I've been programming for 5 years now and started college a year ago (I'm only 19). I started out with web development and taught myself PHP and MySQL. <br>  <br>  What do you want to get into programming for? A hobbyist or a professional programmer working for a company? If you want to become a hobbyist, school is not for you. School is expensive and kind of a pain to keep up with. If you're looking at becoming a hobbyist, buy some books, get some online tutorials, and go to the following website (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Express/VB/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/Express/VB/)</a> and download the following programs:<br>  - Microsoft Visual Basic<br>  - Microsoft Visual C# Express Edition<br>  - Microsoft Visual C++ Express Edition<br>  <br>  Learn the basics to programming. Make some simple programs in Visual Basic and see how you like it, or get into some basic website and learn HTML and Javascript like I did. Buy a good server and you can also learn to code in ASP.net or PHP.<br>  If you want to try game development programming, which is very fun and cool but extremely hard for a beginner, try the XNA studio Framework from Microsoft (there are plenty of tutorials that explain how to set it up):<br>  <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-US/" rel="nofollow">http://creators.xna.com/en-US/</a><br>  <br>  If you want to become a professional at programming and want a career in it though, I recommend you go to school. Before starting college, I tried getting many jobs, mainly freelancing online and such, and I got turned away alot. Companies will throw out your resume if you don't have any college experience and freelance jobs get exported to other countries where Indians work dirt cheap. For example, I charged a low $150.00 for a comment script someone wanted and a guy in India did it for $39.00. Freelancing is not a good source of steady income.<br>  <br>  If you want to become a professional, enroll in a college. I'm in a community college, and although it's not University standard, I'm in for a major in Enterprise Programming, learning Java, VB.net, the web languages, and Database along with some server programming. Going to college will teach you the standards and rules to programming. You will get books that teach you things from the bare bone basics to make 3D game applets in Java.<br>  Of course, in the real world, there are tons of different forms of programming out there. From server side programs, to software developers, to game programmers, there are tons of different categories and branches of programming out there. Figure out which one most suits you and focus on learning it.<br>  <br>  In addition to a career, it's important to learn as many languages as possible and go beyond learning what your college teaches you. Many colleges do not teach things like Unix, PHP, MySQL, Apache, Linux, and many other programming languages, databases, and platforms that many companies use. More companies use Microsoft products more than anything, but you should have a background in the others.<br>  <br>  I've typed alot already, but I always like to help those who are getting into my industry. I love programming and there is alot of competition in it. Before considering school or any forms of education, try learning some things on your own and see if you like it. It is difficult and if you are not interested, it can be near impossible to learn.|`|7jCDiK91aa	To get a quick start and help you decide if programming is for you, I would recommend starting off with Java.  Java is an object oriented programing language similar to C++ and C#.  Although the syntax is more similar to C#.  <br>  <br>  The thing that Java has over the others is more free software and more free online resources.<br>  <br>  Here is a link the the Java Tutorial web site.

For example:<br>  <?php<br>  if ($context['user']['is_admin'])<br>  {<br>  echo 'Stuff only the admin can see';<br>  }<br>  ?><br>  <br>  To display the user's username and a logout link, or a register link if they're a guest, I've used something like this in the past:<br>  <?php<br>          if ($context['user']['is_guest'])<br>          {<br>                  ssi_login("http://" . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);<br>                  echo 'Not a member yet? Please <a href="', $scripturl, '?action=register">register</a>!';<br>          }<br>          else<br>          {<br>                  ssi_welcome();<br>                  echo ' ';<br>                  ssi_logout("http://" . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);<br>                  echo '<br><br>';<br>          }<br>  ?> <br>  <br>  I'm assuming you know PHP, so should understand the code snippets I've posted. Look at the ssi_examples.php file that comes with SMF, it has some more examples of stuff you can do. Also just digging through Subs.php and Load.php (among other files in the "Sources" directory) should be able to help you. Try print_r($context['user']) to see all the information you can show about the user. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck with your site =]

wUqeZl3Saa	I wrote one of these in a few hours and even added a Hello Kitty theme for my niece. It was a spur of the moment thing when my sister was taking a class in VB and had to write a much simpler calculator program. I did it to show that even a much more complex calculator wasn't that hard or even complex..<br>  <br>  With all the buttons, it means you have the interface figured out and you have a more or less normal looking basic calculator with a 3 or 4 button memory. Next you have to think about how a calculator acts. There are 2 memories in a calculator usually designated X and Y. You'll want to make the internal calculator memories single precision.<br>  <br>  When you press a number key, what happens? It simply adds the number to the right side of the display. So the first part you need to do is write a subroutine or function that  appends numbers every time you hit a number key. You will probably also want to make the clear button reset the display to zero. Once you get the display so that you can enter and clear numbers up to about 7 digits, you can move on to the math functions.<br>  <br>  For the math functions, you always enter a number, press an operation button (add/subt/mult/div), and enter a second number followed by more operations or an equals button. Start with the add button and make it add numbers by pressing the correct buttons. Leave room in your function or subroutine for the other operations. Once you sort that out, then make it subtract , multiply and divide. Remember the X and Y memories. The first is the current display and the later is the last   number or result memory.<br>  <br>  The memory is similar to some of the calculator functions except they don't change anything except the memory or the current number in the display in the case of MR. MC clears memory, M+ adds the current display to memory, M- subtracts. MR should copy the memory to the current display.<br>  <br>  My version of the calculator complete with a special Hello Kitty button only took 165 lines. It actually took longer finding HK art that I could use for the button than it took to write the program.<br>  <br>  Shadow Wolf

However I do prefer XP for various games and photo storage.  Windows Movie Maker works better on Vista than XP.  So what I did was divide my hard-drive into two sections - I have XP on one side and Vista on the other. This now enables me to draw files from either side whenever I wish - so I have the best of both systems at my fingertips. One system doesn't interfere with the other. I had picked up a virus on Vista 6 months ago and normally my computer would not be useable, but I was able to still use XP until my computer guru rectified the problem.

6YufKn6Faa	The Nvidia Geforce 8600GT is an old card now. Its equivalent is the Nvidia Geforce 9500GT.     The Radeon HD 4670 is indeed the better card of the two.     The Minimum power requirement 400 Watts for the Radeon 4670 HD. I reccommend you to have a 450-500 Watt Power Supply.     You'll need 20+ AMPs on the 12V Rail(s) (Total- Combined Amp of all the 12V Rails must have 20+ A) of your Power Supply (Some Power Supplies have only one 12V Rail, others have multiple 12V Rails). To check the 12V rails, Check the diagram on the side of the Power Supply, Example is:   http://www.newegg.com/Product/ShowImage....    Hope that helps.

When you start to see these things (they're called artifacts), you need to turn your clocks down. <br>  <br>  I agree, to some extent, that you should limit yourself on the overclock. As you may or may not know, when you overclock any part of a computer, you are lessening the amount of time that part will last. But I overclock my CPU, graphics card, and RAM, so I'm not going to say to never overclock... it's fun, right?<br>  <br>  Also, your memory clock seems really low. Unless you meant to type '1420' then you probably need to turn that up. 420 for the memory clock is WAY too low.|`|AA10266684	That is a nice Video Card don't overclock it cuz den it won't last as long.|`|k5KuYkkKaa	For the small gain on your core clock, you sure lost a lot on the memory clock.

j0z7YWbeaa	I'd say it depends on what you are going to school for?    If you are going to deal with anything graphics, video, web design, etc. then get a desktop.  You will need as much ram and disk space as you can get for all the projects.    If you are going into something administrative, business, science, research, health, etc. then get a laptop.  It doesn't require much processing power to build presentations or reports.|`|RXTpaW4vaa	desktop|`|kprAXbh1aa	You should get a laptop. You can bring them with you to class or anywhere you want to go.

(Plus WiFi is offered almost everywhere now for free) Hope this helps!|`|9iWvr0yyaa	Have you considered getting a desktop and a netbook?    Don't worry this won't cost you any more.    A desktop is great because it can hold all your music,movies etc and a decent one should have the power to do everything you need.  If  you shopped around I GUARANTEE that you would find a deal that would allow you get a top of the range  desktop of the same or higher spec than the one you mentioned for about $900.     A netbook is awesome because you can bring them around without having to lug a heavy laptop into school with you.  Most netbooks way well under 1kg and have ample space (120gb) and power (1.6ghz &1gb ram)  for doing day to day school stuff.  You wont be able to do much web design or video editing done on one but their great for writing essays etc.   A decent one (like the awesome acer aspire one that I'm using now) wont set you back more than $280 if you look around and find a good deal.    I think I just made your choice a LOT easier! :-)|`|pGF6Xdghaa	It's all in what you like really.  I personally though think a laptop is better..

Why? - compressing components into a tiny space(laptops) makes them more likely to fail from heat build-up etc. (Likewise with stereos).  Desktop will therefore last longer.

This way, I can keep my desktop in my apartment for gaming, media (hooked up to an HDTV), and whatnot, but I can bring my little laptop to class, library, study groups, etc. The files on them are automatically synced with Windows Live Sync.     Remember, laptops with the kind of power you're talking about are big and have bad battery life, and you can't upgrade them like a desktop. You can easily get this setup for about $1200 (assuming you build your own desktop), and have the best of both worlds.

nV3CTelWaa	Twitter is a social networking and micro-blogging service that allows its users to send and read other users' updates (otherwise known as tweets), which are text-based posts of up to 140 characters in length.    Updates are displayed on the user's profile page and delivered to other users who have signed up to receive them. Senders can restrict delivery to those in their circle of friends (delivery to everyone being the default). Users can receive updates via the Twitter website, SMS, RSS, or through applications such as TwitterMobile, Tweetie, Twinkle, Twitterrific, Feedalizr, Facebook, and Twidget, a widget application. Four gateway numbers are currently available for SMS: short codes for the United States, Canada, and India, and a United Kingdom-based number for international use. Several third parties offer posting and receiving updates via email. Twitter had by one measure over 3 million accounts and, by another, well over 5 million visitors in September 2008, a fivefold increase in a month      http://www.lostartofblogging.com/twitter...    http://www.socialdesire.com/2008/01/24/2...      http://quotably.com/      http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/...|`|c59aa0746b771ce4755726e1da6772d1aa	I know how you feel!

Instead of sending a dozen e-mails or text messages, you send one message to your Twitter account, and the service distributes it to all your friends. Members use Twitter to organize impromptu gatherings, carry on a group conversation or just send a quick update to let people know what's going on."    Twitter has been around for some time; now that pseudo-celebs such as Richard Bacon have started banging on about it, it is gaining more notoriety.|`|hqlx5KDFaa	just like facebook status updates!!!  instead they are called tweets.

There is nothing that important that you have to bypass the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences; that you really don't want to. It's honestly not worth the repercussions involved.  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time.  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.|`|oZydD2rsaa	Here's a free proxy created today:     http://arecool.info/1a/    -Unblock ANY Website  -watch youtube videos  -download up to 100 MB  -hide you IP and stay anonymous  -Fast and hosted on a dedicated server    I get new proxies here everyday:  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxie...

DCXk0bVLaa	Brand wise I haven't had any problems with any brand I've used.  If you're using CD-R discs you should be able to burn them.    To check if there's something on it open explorer with the disc in the drive and click the drive letter.  If the right pane shows nothing it is a blank disc.  If the pane shows eg: Track 01 with a 1KB file size it is a music file (wav format). The 1KB is not the size of the music file but an info file for the player. You can't copy and paste these files from a burned disc to make a copy, the disc has to be ripped to the drive.  If the pane shows a file name (if you named it) eg: This Song with an mp3 or wma extension and a 5 Mb file size it is self explanatory. If you didn't name the file it will show as Track 01.    Files burned in the wav format (music/audio files) will play on any CD player. Limited to approx 20 songs per disc but high quality.  Files burned in mp3 format will only play on more current CD players or computers. You can get up to 200 + songs per disc but at lower quality.  If I put one of these in my old CD player the readout states "data disc inserted" and won't play.    I use a burning app called Deepburner Free although there are plenty of others to choose from.    If you choose to burn a (music/audio) CD from wav format limit the burn speed to no more than 24x to minimize errors during the burn process.    To burn:  http://www.deepburner.com/?r=download    To rip: (can convert most common files types also)  http://www.freerip.com/    If you convert a wav file to mp3 it drastically reduces the file size but I'd advise not converting to a bitrate lower than 128 kbps as a good trade off between file size and quality. A bitrate of 96 kbps might just be passable.  Audio information is lost when converting to mp3 so the quality will not be improved if you then convert back to wav but will enable it to be played on all CD players.    Got carried away. This started out as a brief answer but if any of it helps - job done.|`|bkYgzs7Waa	If its a blank CD then it would'nt have a song on, would it?  You gotta look at the format of the song.  Is it MP3 or WMA?  Most CD players now play MP3 format.  Check your CD player. It can be the way your computers burning them.  It could be jacked up.|`|d0231dcc170bb0de07aee5020b49aeeaaa	If it is blank then there is nothing for your player to play and if it has a song on it it is not blank, so check to see if your player can read CD-R or CD+R if it can then next time you burn a disc make sur it is in music format and not MP3.|`|ye1tS9a2aa	the old cd players will not play copied cds, next time you buy a cd player, look to see if it can record onto a blank cd|`|m01ijLFUaa	You might need to download a free disc burner off the internet - i did that and it was so much easier.

IE has a setting to retain history for x number of days (under Tools| Internet Options|General tab. option to "Keep pages in history")  3rd party browsers can also be set to delete history every time they are closed, or even every time they are started.|`|XkXqp2aAaa	no, but there are technical ways around this.

6GdeuiCgaa	Well, an internal one is inside your computer, so you'd have to remove the old one and connect the new one. I've done that on desktops but not on notebooks, so I don't know how hard that'd be.    An external one will sit next to your computer (like an external hard drive!), connect via USB, and will either plug into the wall or have a second USB for power.|`|J73L2Dyraa	Well a internal is one that will go internally in your laptop and external is one that is in enclosure that plugs into a usb port. i personally like the external because i can use it on all me computers when i need to where the internal dvd burner can only work in your laptop alone but both work the same.|`|aSjdL4heaa	Either should work with your laptop, assuming your laptop has USB-2 ports.

XJSOToRGaa	2 things to try, though generally speaking a magnet on top of a harddrive will end the matter in a very ugly way (essentially it will pull the platter in the HD onto the pin that reads it and scrape the hell out of the platters).    1. If you have another computer, get yourself a USB enclosure, put the dinged HD into it, and see if it will be recognized as an external.    2. Try using a bootable OS like knoppix (burnt to a CD) and see if it will recognize the HD as a slave.    Both of those will work as long as the only thing damaged is the part of the HD with the OS on it.  Its also very possible that the magnet wiped the data off your HD in the first place, in which case there's really no way of helping :(    If all else fails, try taking to a local computer shop.  They charge a bloody fortune for data recovery but, if nothign else, they shoudl be able to at least tell you if it's recoverable or not.|`|YrLVvAHvaa	now if you need that data really badly then you could go to a place that does data recovery but they can charge you as much as $1k a MB some time like a 160GB drive will cost cost lots of  money most of the time its just not worth the trouble to get the data back for the every day person. and if the dive still works you can try a HD enclosure to see if you can get to that data but most likely not.|`|OuQizrQ6aa	Yikes! The data on your hard drive is magnetically stored. Having a magnet near the drive while it's running will destroy the platters! In all likelihood, you will not be able to recover any data from that drive. Many times, in a case like this, the drive itself is destroyed as well. It couldn't hurt to try to pop your drive into a USB enclosure like this one:    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    Without a clean room, there's very little that a computer shop can do for you that you can't do yourself. (Clean room data recovery costs 5k+)    I wouldn't count on being able to recover any of your data! Sorry... That sucks!!!

AA12116276	I use both but don't use either that often anymore and will use torrents more for videos than anything else.     One reason I used to use limewire way more is because sometimes torrents are ridiculously slow. This is especially true when you first start using it, but it can also be true just because something you want has very few people seeding it. And sometimes even with seeds, it's still not downloading or is being annoyingly slow. It also seems easier to find really sketch (i.e. hard to find) stuff on limewire) than on torrents. I pretty much never find any hard-to-find songs on torrents but often can find them on limewire. And depending on what bit client you're using, you can't even preview songs as they download to make sure it's right or of good sound quality like you can with limewire (I know with bitcomet, you can preview, but bitcomet won't work well with either my computer or my internet connection...utorrent works well, but no previews).     As far as I know, none of my computer problems have ever been related to limewire except possibly the java interfering with my internet explorer (on my older laptop).|`|d97e0d7c192c0cd5634d474777b47535aa	I use it. Still have no viruses, the thing is - you have to have a good anit-virus and anti spyware/adware program that is up to date. Never open a file without scanning it and don't download executable files (.exe) unless you are certain you know what it is. You can also set it up to filter and deny X-rated content. I've used it for years and unless you're downloading kiddie porn, the sheriff and FBI won't come knocking down your door in the middle of the night, not to mention the person that you got it from, the person they got it from and so on, would have been arrested and most criminals aren't dumb enough to share that kind of stuff.     If you can't use it properly than don't use it at all. If you don't know about computers, find some one that does and have them set up parental controls on it. Otherwise, it's you're fault when something does happen.|`|ZYkjfxniaa	Torrents screwed up my computer twice.  I had to do a recovery after downloading a lot of torrent files.

And to the others claiming that Limewire or any other P2P service is only for stealing, you don't know what you're talking about.    P2P services are valuable to me for many reasons... from the purely frivolous seeking and downloading content (movies, music) that are NOT available in North America (there are many foreign films gems - especially out of Asia and Eastern Europe that I cannot get from the local video store), for nearly impossible to get ebooks (recently, a complete collection of scanned chess books published in the 1800's), or early turn of the century films. And for business, downloading reference material (manuals, ebooks)...      My P2P services of choice are Vuze (torrent compatible), and emule (the free one from emule-project.net - do not confuse it with the many emule scam sites!).     Some people still use Limewire because it is simple and it is the only one they know. People generally do not like to change. I got tired of Limewire because I found that nearly 90% of what I d/led was fake.    Bottom line when using any P2P is don't be a leecher, share what you have and be sure NOT to share newly copyrighted works! Not only is it wrong and unethical, it may also attract the attention of your ISP.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Torrents are more complicated. Most people are not computer savvy, despite their opinions otherwise. They go for the easiest route - and that is limewire-type applications.    Strange that you would ask such a question.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	The dangers of Limewire and what has happened to my family   ______________________________________...  Not sure how many of you are aware of Limewire that kids are using to download free music on their computers. I knew very little and still don't know all that much but it is a terrible thing to have on your computer and I want to get the word out as to what happened to us. First off, Limewire is a computer program you can download for free. This program allows you to download free songs that are illegal. It is a file sharing program which means if you have limewire and someone else has limewire, those two people can share their songs (or whatever else they download) from one computer to the next. With this being said, I knew my DD had limewire on her computer but had no idea what else you can do with this program. Come to find out, you can download ANYTHING from this Limewire, as in X-rated photos, child porn, videos ...etc.    A week ago we were woke up with 10 FBI men, 1 FBI woman and 1 sherriff banging on our door at 6 am. They had their FBI vests on, wore guns, etc. I answered the door and they asked me who was in the house, etc. They woke my DH and 2 teenagers up and we were told they had a search warrant. They had reason to believe we had someone in our house who had downloaded "something" illegal on one of our computers. We were all in shock, it felt like something out of a bad movie. They searched our house for 2 hours and they took all of our computers to investigate. I pray they don't find anything. DH and both kids have said they have done nothing wrong, I have not either.

Take a look at http://www.howtohaven.com/system/createw...  but don't tell Bill Gates I suggested it.|`|bnCiNAQdaa	the reinstallation disc is a pre-built recovery CD that may or may not even work with your PC if it isnt Vista-capable or compatable.  and keep in mine that once you activate that particular Vista OS, you cant use it on another PC without calling Microsoft. So if your friend ever needs to reinstall Vista after you, he may be screwed.    besides that, did you friend actually wipe out his Vista OS to go backwards to XP?? I would hope he only put on XP along with his Vista OS in a dual-boot setup. otherwise, why bother?|`|XJSOToRGaa	The problem isnt the license, it's the hardware.  The dell recovery disks come with drivers for specific hardware pre-loaded onto them, so while it may install, I think you'll find a lot of stuff not working when you're through.

Any computer for same in a Chain Store or Computer Store with a dual core CPU will run it just fine. Pick-up *any* laptop with a 2.0 dual core, 2 Gb of ram, and any graphics solution from nVidia (7xxx or later) or ATi (1650 or later) - not sure about Intel chipsets, and you should be fine. And that's considering that most laptops on the market right now (if not set-up for Linux) are running Vista, you're still fine. (Although the graphics would have to be nVidia 8xxx or ATi HD3xxx chipsets for best results with Dx10!)    Technically, any laptop released in the last 18 months should be fine with the program.     Good Luck!    NOTE: Macbook stats - Don't know, so you may not have that option.    EDIT: About $1000, eh? You can definately find some decent machines in that price range A friend of mine bought a High-End (at the time) Gaming Laptop with all the bells and whistles (and a few extras) for about $1800CAD with tax about 8 months ago.

NkbhHcIAaa	why not just buy a wireless access point and senc it to the main wireless router , would be much easier|`|ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	Routers can be "daisy chained" almost indefinitely. By that I mean that a cable from one of the LAN slots on the first router can be connected to the WAN slot on the next router. That second router can be a wifi wireless router. The IP address of the second router should be assigned by the DNS of the first router automatically although you can set it to another number set  if you wish.|`|YrLVvAHvaa	yeas you can just make shear that they don't have they same ip address's like the first router has an ip of 192.168.1.1 the the 2st router should have a different ip like 192.168.2.1 you may have to go to the router's manual or the website for it that brand.|`|yHI6rfeUaa	I presume you have terminated the connection in your home with a network switch.    I would buy a wireless access point and plug it into your network switch.  Program the access point by a wired link from your pc to the network switch - never by a wireless link.  If you use a wireless access point you need not concern yourself about changing the second router's subnet.    Alternatively, you can plug the RJ45 plug from the cable that links your home to the other home into a WAN port of a wireless router.  WAN port should be configured for a dynamic IP address if you wish to have its IP address provided by the primary router   You must change the LAN subnet of the secondary router (router in your location).  For example if the primary router LAN subnet is 192.168.1.0 / 24 (means that all LAN devices have IP addresses 192.168.1.n where n differs for each device and that the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0), make the LAN subnet of secondary router 192.168.2.0 / 24.  If you do not make sure subnets are different you will have a failure.

When you get tired of AVG and it's low detection rate and decide to delete it' It will release that virus that it has locked up in the vault right back out on your hard drive. If free is the best you can do get AVIRA. It's detection rate is somewhere around 94/95 % AVG free'82% detection rate and a 74% protection rate and no real time protection. AVAST 84% detection rate and a 76 % protection rate. It has real time protection but it isn't that good. AVIRA has it beat. The best you will get is paid and that is Kaspersky. One other thing' There is no such thing as a best free anti virus. ALL free AV's have security holes in them or they wouldn't be free. Don't let any one tell you that you can protect your computer well with free AV's. It's a lie. Free AV's will let you down.

Also what might be causing this problem is a overloaded CPU, you may have al ot of computer room and memory but there is a limit on how much stress you computer can run on. Music, Movies and programs can cram up you pc and cause it to become sluggish. I advise you to remove any programs that you do not need or use, such as big programs, or movies your tired of watching. Many people have this problem where they bought a new computer and a month later it is slow like an old one, all that happen is that you start personalizing you computer and unaware of there computers power.

So even running at slower clockspeeds like 1.66 Ghz, a Core 2 Duo easily outperforms an old Pentium 4 clocked at 3.2Ghz.<br>  <br>  But it's unlikely that your current motherboard which was accepts a single-core P4 3.2Ghz could take any dual-core processor except maybe an old Pentium-D.  <br>  <br>  You probably need a motherboard upgrade in order to install a Core 2 Duo- check your motherboard specs to be sure.

(there is a space bet wen the word explorer and the period. An explorer window should open up. <br>  <br>  I am guessing that you set an option not to send deleted files to the recycle bin.  To change that, locate the recycle bin icon on the desktop, right click and there should be a option to send deleted items to the recycle bin, select that.  Then delete some file.  I think windows will recreate the folder.
edIKhlR0aa	Yup. You will probably have to adjust the top:-100px. I don't know how much you know about CSS so I will give a very basic explaination. postion:relative makes it so you can move the section. As for top:, top:0 would be where it is now. To move it up you have to use a negative - margin. To move it down you would use a positive margin.<br>  <br>  <style><br>  .interestsAndDetails { position:relative; top:-100px; }<br>  </style>
BBnnSwK9aa	Window ME was simply 98SE with the "soon to be released" XP Graphic User Interface, targeted at Home Users.  It was a "cruel" test by Microsoft to see if the new GUI would catch on.<br>  <br>  Windows 2000 Pro was the best OS they developed, at the time, for Business users.<br>  <br>  Due to ME's failure and W2K's success, Microsoft merged the two and XP was born.<br>  <br>  Unable to learn from their mistakes, Microsoft introduced Vista (ME on Steroids) while they get "Windows 7" ready for prime time.  Software testing by users is always FREE.  And, the bottom line, in both cases, was GREED!!!<br>  <br>  I, for one, am fed up with being an "unpaid guinea pig" for Microsoft.

And really it was just the idea of it that was good.|`|eVYhqaXDaa	If I remember correctly this is when Microsoft ran two family of OS: home and business.

With XP, Microsoft began offering home and business versions within the same family.|`|440b5eeaa808017d23fb3beb1ec4fa73aa	Windows 2000 was used in the corporate environment, while Windows Me was targeted towards the home users.|`|a4da36557b90cbf554ded329d557968eaa	Originally, what became Windows XP was supposed to be released in 2000, but development was backed up for years (same as with Vista). Unfortunately, Microsoft decided that a release date was more important than a stable product: Hence ME. <br>  <br>  ME was a hack of Windows 98 code with some of the stuff they were planning for XP thrown out to meet a marketing date. Hence, it was not designed or developed as a product, and not really ever fixed: it was pretty much abandoned once XP was released.<br>  <br>  I was working in a repair shop at the time, and people were having so many problems with it, we used to wipe their hard drives and install Windows 98SE. <br>  <br>  Quite simply, Windows ME is proof that microsoft couldn't care less about its customers.

TyJuZnZhaa	Usually whenever I need a free download of some sort of program I use uTorrent which is a bittorrent client that uses .TORRENT files to download files.<br>  <br>  Very useful. <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.utorrent.com/</a> <--- Download it there.<br>  <br>  Then, do like I do, search: " (insert name of the file) bittorrent " (WITHOUT quotation marks.)<br>  <br>  However, I suggest getting an anti-virus software just in case if you don't have one. There are some malicious torrents out there, sadly.<br>  <br>  But I wouldn't be so worried about just one download if that's all you think you'll ever do. Make sure the torrent you download off has seeds, by the way. No seeds and you won't be able to download the file. It is a sharing file program, after all.<br>  <br>  Also make sure that you don't find a torrent that has 10 times more peers then seeds. <br>  <br>  Hope this works for you <3

If you have problems downloading or installing the malware removal tools please send an email to me and I will give you a step by step advice to fix this. Malware tends to block the download and installation of anti-virus and anti-spyware programs and websites. I recommend scanning in safe mode because a lot of times safe mode disables malware but this is not totally accurate. You can access safe mode by tapping F8 when your computer restarts, make sure to go into safe mode with networking to update the malware removal tools. I also recommend turning off system restore because users can restore their PC back to an infected state. You can do this by right clicking my computer, select properties, select system restore, and select turn off system restore.<br>  Update and do a quick scan with Malwarebytes and a full scan with Superantispyare to get rid of any malware that is installed on your PC. I recommend doing a scan with only one of these tools at a time because there may be complications. Once the removal process is finished restart your computer and turn system restore back on. Run Ccleaner and delete temporary files and invalid registry entries. If you have any questions email me at dejay19826@yahoo.com

If they're just replacing RAM, they don't need access to the harddrive, so you can password protect your user account.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately a motherboard replacement will require access to the administrator account, to install drivers that make it work with the operating system.<br>  <br>  My advice is to transfer sensitive files to a USB drive or second HD, delete them from the HD they need access to, then run a program like CCleaner and Advanced System Care (from download.com) to clean up the system.<br>  <br>  Conversely, try finding a local, independant computer geek that isn't affiliated with Best Buy - it will be cheaper, and he might be able to come to your house and do it while you watch.<br>  <br>  I contemplated telling you to setup a second Administrator level account to protect your files, but it may not prevent someone from getting into it via the other administrator level account.|`|AA11232283	why you paying GS to do something you can prob do yourself anyways??  if you do decide to do it, however, i would suggest you keep the hard drive with you|`|TIvdCg2taa	Personally, it's a good idea as long as you use trusted and popular ones.|`|bGO1AmEqaa	Chances are they won't mess with your personal files. However if you are concerned about it you may want to put a password on your account and mark your files as private and create another account for them to use so they can install the necessary drivers for the new motherboard. Without them doing that some things like your Video, Audio, and internet might not work right. Unless you are confident that you can install the drivers properly. If you are truly worried about them I'd go to a local computer store and do business with them instead.|`|AA10266684	Do what you feel comfortable with.

Choose Save, not Open. Save it some place you can find it on your computer (like your desktop).<br>  <br>  WINDOWS VISTA UNZIP: double-click on the zip to open it, then either click on "Extract all files" or drag and drop the files somewhere outside the zip window.<br>  <br>  WINDOWS VISTA INSTALL: Select the font files (.ttf or .otf ) from within the Extracted Folder or where you dragged then right-click > Install<br>  <br>  WINDOWS XP UNZIP: You should have extraction software already on your system - try right clicking on the file and selecting expand or extract if it is listed. Have it extract to where you are or where you can find it. <br>  <br>  If you do not have those choices, you need to download software - there are many free applications. I don't like Winzip at all - it's way more than you need. I really like ExtractNow.

It is easy to install. Once it is installed, you just launch it, drag your zipped folders into it and click Extract. It's great because you can extract multiple files at once.<br>  <br>  WINDOWS XP INSTALL: Go to your fonts folder. Either through the start menu > control panels > fonts (make sure you are using Classic View for the control panels - it's much easier). OR go to My Computer > Drive C > Windows > Fonts. Drag the new fonts (just the ttf/otf files) from the extracted folder or wherever they are into the fonts folder. A box should pop up showing that the font is being installed.<br>  <br>  FOR VISTA OR XP: If the download was just a single .ttf or.otf file, skip the extracting steps and go straight to installing.<br>  <br>  The font should now show up in the font list of all your programs. If you have any programs running you will need to quit and restart them before they see the newly installed font.

3GmG8uQzaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"<br>  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage! <br>  Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...<br>  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!<br>  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.<br>  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!<br>  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.<br>  Recommend tool:  <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> [if you do not have one]|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Check for survivors|`|wnyuH0aTaa	Press and hold the F8 key and turn the machine on - keep pressing the F8 key.<br>  <br>  You should get an option to start in Safe Mode.<br>  <br>  Choose that - the machine might start then.|`|ZIPd99xtaa	If you can get your hands on a windows disk when you boot to the windows disk you will get the chance to repair your Windows installation.

Linux and Unix from which it derives are MODULAR operating systems which contain elements from DIFFERENT vendors.  These include the desktops, which run on top of X-Windows, a program which reached more or less its current form about two years before the Linux kernel was written which is intended to be a cross-platform GUI.  Ubuntu is the only distribution which differentiates between them (with Kubuntu Xubuntu and their distribution of the third party Fubuntu) rather than giving us an a la carte menu.<br>  <br>  Ubuntu is a good place to start but there is no more reason to stay there than there is to change.  You can even download and install any of the other desktops.  They do stick to KDE 3.5 which is on my Debian desktop.  I had Fedora 10 on this laptop for a few days but KDE 4.0 was unendurable and I'm currently writing this on Slackware with Gentoo installed as a dual boot and XFCE4 as the desktop for both of them.  Gnome and KDE are the most full-featured but also the slowest and have the highest memory footprint.  Furthermore, you get a lot of complaints about sound card problems which usually turn out to be arts (KDE) or pulse-audio (Gnome) problems.  I wouldn't want to wish XFCE on anyone who wasn't either using dyne:bolic or had a lot of experience and knew about programs like ristretto and xarchiver which make life easier for you.<br>  <br>  The real power of Linux is that it is a great prototyping environment -- and that is why it is free, so people can offer you the next Compiz, say and find out if it's too confusing.  *ubuntu is a very conservative environment, so newbie friendly, and there are others.  If you like Ubuntu, fine.  If you like Gnome (which until KDE 4.0 was the largest and slowest of the distros) fine.    You really would be better off experimenting, running a liveCD like kubuntu xubuntu or even Damn Small Linux than asking us which environment would be the best.|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	Ubuntu's the best, in my experience.|`|Md07JyI7aa	1.)

2b5c7798e64b1e163191b1de08f80d42aa	Has yr Dell got a restore partition? This is the easiest way to get a fully functional operating system back as it was when you unpacked it - junk programs and all!<br>  <br>  I seem to remember that F11 at boot would get you into the restore option on a Dell. This will write an image from a hidden partition over yr existing system partition.<br>  It may be however that Dell don't do this any more, so:<br>  What you need is an operating system installation disk from Dell. These are normally supplied alongside a system driver disk and full instructions but let's say you don't have these. You can use any Windows disk to re-install as long as it is the same as you have at the moment i.e. XP Pro replacing XP Pro or Home replacing Home. Likewise for Vista.<br>  You can't upgrade, in other words, from Home Premium to Ultimate with yr existing product key (which you will find on a sticker on the outside of the case).<br>  <br>  Actually, with Dell you can (but that's another story).<br>  <br>  After backing up all yr personal data and collecting all drivers onto a removeable drive, all you need to do is to put the disk inti the CD/DVD tray and reboot. The installation disk is bootable and you can either set the optical drive higher in the BIOS boot order (F2 at boot and go to the boot order settings and move the CD/DVD drive higher than the hard drive) or select F12 and do it manually.<br>  Once booting, the option to reformat the drive will be available as part of the re-installation process. This will wipe yr drive ready for the new fresh system. Not completely tho' - if you have state secrets on there, you need to use a specialised low level formatting tool!<br>  <br>  So, short answer. No need to uninstall anything. The new installation will automatically overwrite what's there...<br>  :-)|`|BWFxyiwaaa	to do this fully you must have a recovery disc|`|8279d0a907ccc5fff04ebdb6ed176b32aa	if you format the drive it will remove everything

Vt0xnuWpaa	The best thing you can do is update your video drivers. There's not much else you can do for most laptops.<br>  <br>  Unless you've ordered the laptop with the card you wanted, you can't swap it out. Unlike Desktop graphics cards, which are limited only by available slots, Laptop graphics cards are hard to find, and even harder to replace.<br>  <br>  Laptop GPUs are not cards at all, but GPU chips soldered into the motherboard (which is why the ones with dedicated cards are said to have "discrete graphics" and others have the built-in "integrated graphics" rather than having "cards"), so as are some of the CPUs - meaning you have to melt the metal solder to even take them out. This is the way most laptops today are made. You'll have to be a real expert to be able to swap them successfully - even then success isn't 100%. Manufacturers will not take them back for an upgrade.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, your laptop motherboard chipset will not allow for you to upgrade to a discrete GPU if you ordered it with the integrated card.<br>  <br>  Unless you have a laptop with a separate graphics unit or an MXM slot, you won't be able to upgrade/replace it. Check your manual to see if they allow any upgrades. Few laptops today allow you to do so (the Alienware line being one of the very last) I know for sure that recent Dell laptops use the soldering style.<br>  <br>  -----------<br>  <br>  The only option you have left is to use an Expresscard-adpated graphics unit, but not yet. Maybe in the near future; right now external graphics through Expresscard is in the process of development/release.<br>  <br>  There aren't that many for sale yet in the U.S., but if you're lucky, you can find an ASUS XG Station for sale somewhere (but it won't be cheap considering its around $300 for the dock alone). You just need to have an Expresscard slot. They're only offering the 7900GS and 8600GT (desktop card) for the dock so far, but from the looks of the design you might fit other PCI-E x16 graphic cards into it in the future.<br>  <br>  However, because of the slower transfer bandwith through the ExpressCard port in comparison to the PCI-E x16 GPUS usually use, they will not perform nearly as well as built-in/native cards.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hwupgrade.com/articles/print/mobile/18/asusxg.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hwupgrade.com/articles/print/...</a><br>  <a href="http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/1671/asusxguh9.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/1671/...</a>|`|dILqe7nBaa	laptops can't be upgraded except ram,hard drive and dvd drive

Programs that run on Windows are often too big to all be loaded into the computer at any given time.  So they have replaceable modules.  When you go from one part of the program to another, it loads another part of itself.  That's a DLL.<br>  <br>  Also programmers can put routines and objects in DLLs that can be used by several programs.  If more than one program is running at a time that can use the same routines, you don't need to load two copies, they can share one copy.

XmnVJxzaaa	I'm not really a software expert, but I know what I use and I like it. For starters, I'm a big fan of free, open source software. As such, I'd suggest the rather unfortunately named GIMP for editing your photos and videos. It gets great reviews from all sources I've read and I enjoy working with it. <br>  The only issue I've encountered/seen regarding GIMP's Vista compatibility is that when you first run the software, it takes a long time to search for fonts and a few other plug-ins. Vista occasionally thinks this long search is a lock-up and reports the programs as, "Not responding," and suggest shutting down the programs. <br>  The suggested solution is clicking the, "Wait for program to start responding," which allows GIMP do its thing and the issue goes away. The loading fonts thing only happened to me the very first time I started GIMP. It lasted for about 45 seconds and I didn't get the, "Not responding," thing. Since then, it has been working fine.<br>  I'm including a link to the closest thing to a negative review of GIMP I could find*. That may sound odd, but even the reviewer liked it. The person writing the review claims to be a professional in the graphics field, so all they found as a negative was that GIMP didn't have all the tools they were used to in their commercial products.<br>  Your other options are Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 (for $60 USD), which seems to get decent reviews, or another bit of freeware that is becoming more popular, Picasa made by Google. Picasa isn't nearly as fully featured as either GIMP, Corel or Adobe, but it does the basics well, from what I've read**.<br>  For CD/DVD burning, I've always used whatever product came with the drive I bought. I usually choose 'optical drives' (the catchall, technical name for CD/DVD drives) that come with a version of Roxio software. I have Roxio Creator Basic on my Vista laptop (came free, who am I to argue with that price) and it works fine. I'm afraid I have no advice for burning software beyond that.<br>  Bloatware is a term used to describe software that is loaded onto a computer before you buy it that you don't necessarily need, will never use and takes up valuable resources on your computer that could be better put to doing other things. It can also refer to the nasty habit of some programs having other programs attached to them. Like iTunes having Quicktime attached to it, or Adobe Flash Player having Google Toolbars attached to it.  <br>  The software itself isn't really the bloatware. It's all the extra junk the software tries to install that is. Most bloatware does nothing more annoying than take up resources (hard drive space, CPU and internet bandwidth with their update subroutines). Some can be very annoying. Limewire in particular tried to install some kind of "lowest price search tool," that kept popping up little windows in the middle of my surfing.<br>  Anyhow, hope this helps. Feel free to contact me if you need more help.<br>  Good luck.|`|AA10954273	John S is correct.  Infra Recorder works fine on Vista.  Plus, it's open source.  This means it's free and legal.

AA10900831	Unfortunately, it is not possible, cause if your operation is to copy some data across workbooks, and in between key in something on each workbook, excel has not way to tell which instruction you made to the application you want to keep. <br>  <br>  Those data manually key might more important but excel can see only series of instructions in sequence. If you need to undo it, excel would undo it in chronological fashion.<br>  <br>  If you know VBA, you will find out that undo is tie to Application and not workbook or worksheet, so it is clear that undo is application wise and apply to all open worksheets of all open workbooks FILO.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Both have a desktop where icons can reside.  OS X has the dock bar at the bottom of the computer where your programs typically reside.  Vista has the task bar at the bottom where only open programs reside.  I think the Vista system is superior but to each their own.<br>  <br>  Hmm...

1k6QVKDSaa	A router and a modem are two different things.  Hack rate?  What?  If you setup WPA or WPA2 security on your router, you should be fine.

She might be subscribed to a cell phone service. <br>  However that being said, the reason your friend has excellent signal is that she is very near the neighbor's router. You might not be able to do that where you live if no router is really close. And if she has cell service you would need to subscribe too.<br>  Finally, the wired cable is almost always faster than a wifi connection. Most wired work at 100mbps and most wifi's max out at 54mbps.|`|eyjygFYxaa	.........wtf?<br>  A modem is a device that allows you to connect to the ISP, you internet service provider. For cable, that would probably be Comcast, and for DSL, probably AT&T. A wireless connection is broadcast by a wireless router. This is either included in your modem (for a little more dough of course) or bought seperately. There is no such thing as "hack rate" but if you're asking about how WiFi zones are compromised, it's if you don't have a password applied, or the WEP encryption algorithm applied. No password is just stupid, and WEP is vulnerable. There is a flaw that makes the password easily acquirable. <br>  Use WPA2 encryption to be safe. Currently, it's the most secure.<br>  ***<br>  So you're basically asking us whether you should buy internet, or steal it from others. Are you freakin kidding?|`|gz2JF00Saa	You have to have a wireless router before you can the the adapter, and either way you still need your modem, since the router must connect to your modem.<br>  <br>  The router will make you more secure versus on-line threats, but people hacking into your wireless network  (within range) may be a problem.|`|8O3ZdHuTaa	You should not give up your modem... It may be cheaper to steal someone else's internet connection, but you don't even know if there is a neighbor who has an unsecured wifi connection... and if they do, you can get in trouble if they find out you are stealing their bandwidth.
