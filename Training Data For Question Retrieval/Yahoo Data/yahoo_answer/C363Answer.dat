MX3xJlCNaa	Yes! I use the products and have used them for about six months now. I was skeptical at first, but I really like them. I have terrible allergies and their products really help. I love the glass cleaner especially (it really is better than Windex). Just to warn you the Sol-u-mel has a really strong smell much like teaberry gum. However, it did get permanent ink marker out of my carpet (after I had tried tons of other cleaners) and it didn't effect the color of my carpet. The products come in concentrate form so you mix it with water to create what you actually use in your house. I use everything they have laundry detergent, dish detergent, bathroom cleaner, wood cleaner, etc. I have no complaints. Just to warn you though. They will want you to sign up for a preferred customer program. This saves you money but you do have to buy about $50 of products a month. This has been no problem for because I clean and have animals (and a husband) which gives me more to clean. However, if you don't think you would use that much, I would try it without the preferred customer program. That way you can make sure you like it. As for the "safer" aspect, they are supposed to be all natural. However, the main ingredient used is Melaleuca oil which comes from a plant. Technically that plant would be poisonous if you were to ingest it in large doses, but they don't use a high enough concentrate in their product for it to be in anyway dangerous. (I still wouldn't drink it though lol) Hope I helped!|`|EKE7mhDlaa	i love this product! they are safer and more environment friendly and some of the products cheeper than others but not all of them work as well as they say.|`|1824e4fd97f4aa49dcab7a7af45d8236aa	I have no idea-my question which might answer yours-If they are so great why are they trying so hard to recruit ME 2 sell them?That is worth thinking about.

They will run constantly.  Do look at your home insurance policy if you have one but I doubt it will do anything.

mP0LLMVjaa	A living room, parlor and sitting room are where you receive guests. If you have a den then there is no TV or stereo equipment in those rooms. A den is for family entertainment and contains the TV etc. A den can contain a fireplace and is usually off the kitchen or breakfast area. A living room is closer to the front door. Many dens are add ons to the original house.|`|Dl6NIYt5aa	It doesn't have to be something that comes with a standard decor style. It all depends on your taste and requirements. You can design your rooms the way you want them to be designed.   I'm giving you some links that will help you understand everything in a broader manner.|`|Jl7VvX5daa	Generally speaking a living room is a more formal room, never has a TV, and generally attached to the formal dining room.  A living room can also be called a sitting room, but the term sitting room is older verbage.  A parlor would be an even more formal room than a living room and would only be used for special occasions.  A den would generally have a door on it, similar to a bedroom and kind of be tucked away from the main flow of the house.|`|vigFmfLmaa	I think the terms are interchangeable.  Living room, sitting room, parlor... are all terms for a more formal room where you would receive guests, sit before dinner, conversate.  A den, family room, great room is a casual room for everyday living.  This is where your tv, kids, games, etc would be.  Though I do believe that technically speaking in those old stately homes there were both sitting rooms and parlors, but I'm not sure of the different uses during the era those homes were built.
CgVuFUheaa	Grapes have a vey deep root system. The bigger the pot the better it will grow, I would probably get a bigger pot if you want it to cover the whole pergola. The roots should be growing now and stop as the weather gets colder and and all the leaves fall off. Depending on the variety you should see fruit in a couple of years, obviously the bigger the vine the more fruit you will get. Train a leader up over your pergola and cut off all the others, this will help it to establish quicker.|`|b44dc153fd5ba224cc405a4c25fa40e9aa	Gonegardening has a great sight and good discription as well as you can order root stock from them for grapes growing in containers.

I40vnqNyaa	Its mostly because of the type of foods they cook and the way they cook them.  Things like brands of washing powder, softener, shampoo's and deodorants they use also effect the way a house smells. Household cleaners and whether they have pets etc also has a lot to do with it.  All these smells get into the soft furnishings and create a "unique" household smell.|`|vigFmfLmaa	My aunt's house always smelled great when I was little.  I remember her house having a very distinct aroma, where I never noticed my own at all, even if I was away for a few days.  Now I only notice it with older people LOL I guess they use more fragrant things like potpourris (sp?) and heavy perfume.  I think it has a lot to do with cleaning supplies and laundry soaps.|`|f5OPADAFaa	i used to notice it more when i was younger but i don't realise it so much anymore. the things they use to clean their house?|`|nf3b6l1Baa	You are a nosy person.  Your nose ignores the unique and distinctive smell that perseates your routine.  Other nosy people may not appreciate the BO your nose attempts to ignore. With increased aroma, the nose can no longer remain passive.  Certainly, any distinctive differential between your effluents and another attract the nose's attention    Moisture, mold, viruses, mildew, dust, creepy crawlies, pellets, body fluids, spoiled food, cooking food, heat of combustion, fuels, vapours, mists, pet effluents, stale products, dirty clothing, sores, dried blood, ions, electrically charged powders and dust, germs, smoke, opacity, fumes, flames, ash, carpet cleaners, insulation outgassing, hosehold chemicals, clothes dryers, clothes washers, detergents, kitchen products, sweat, sweaty clothing, dirty diapers, moths, insects, mice, rats and other pets, bedding, stale food, dirty dishes, stagnant drinks, alcohol, roaches, ants, termites, bed mites, woops, there goes the alarm.  It's time to get a moving.  Do I smell a rat? Or is breakfast just making me fat?   The good think about unique house smells -  It's always the other person's house that has a bad smell  The arroma emitted from my house always has the smell of  perfume, chocolate, a fresh breeze, a sunny day, good clean clothing, sparks between the sheets, and two sheets in the wind.

8apA3Rffaa	When removing  grout haze from tile ,it should be done dry.... No water.   Grout  in the water is respread back over the tile .. 1 st try a dry bath towel or terri cloth  towel to "dust" the haze off.. Vacuuming  or sweeping the dust up.. Now if its really stuck on, you may have to get a white nylon pad , which is sold at most tile shop, and use that dry to dust off the tile.  As a last resort to removing the haze , they do sell a grout remover for this that you then use a mop.. About 5/6$ for an  8 oz bottle.. Any other questions you can e mail me thru my avatar and  check my qualifications there .. GL|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Scrub the floor with some white vinegar and water to remover the haze from the grout. I would do this on my hands and knees and work in sections using a towel to dry the area after you clean it.

Don't mix ammonia and bleach, that is very bad.|`|VNRJnNr2aa	Yes,to add spice to that ammonia use soft water called white king    or Calgon water softener it will leave a shine after you rinse,make     sure you use a hand brush to scrub those stubborn grout stains    this is caused from dirt and cooking oil traveled by family members     walking all over the place;you can let ammonia with water softener set    an hour and then scrub again to deepen the cleaning.|`|AA10685211	Ammonia will cause respiratory irritation and can be fatal if mixed too strong.  I use "Tub and Tile" from Melaleuca - it's non caustic and is made from citric acid. (Naturally derived from lemons.    You can also mix a paste of baking soda and use a good old fashioned tooth brush for the grout.  That should clean it as well - safely!

VFmmVHGVaa	Yes if you use a regular light bulb.First make sure the power is off at the panel box.  t|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Sure, you just swap out the existing switch with a dimmer.  Just be sure the light bulb you're using will work with a dimmer.  Most CFL bulbs, for instance, won't work with a dimmer.    Any hardware store will sell these switches.  Be sure you understand how to install it!  Be sure you've turned off the power at the fuse box before you attempt to install the switch.  The installation isn't hard - just plugging the wires into the proper spots on the switch - but you do not want to do this with live wires.  Otherwise you won't be around to enjoy your new dimmer.    If you don't think you can do this yourself, hire an electrician, or at least a handyman who knows how to do simple electrical work.  It shouldn't take someone more than 10 minutes to swap out the switch.|`|V4VGFyxlaa	You sure can!|`|ef831d986a5932fbeb4aaba747db2c77aa	A standard dimmer should be a drop in replacement for the switch. It will require a bit more space in the switch box and you will need to use wire nuts to attach the lead wires from the dimmer to the wiring.  Don't use a dimmer for compact fluorescent lamps unless they are designed to be used with a dimmer. Your local hardware store or home center, and even Walmart have dimmer controls.|`|V0ltn3Qkaa	the one thing that no one has mentioned is that dimmer switches are rated by wattage. the standard dimmer is rated 600w. so depending on the number of fixtures you rae controlling and the wattage of each lamp, we it will work.    example: 4 light fixtures each with 100watt lamps = 400 watts so a 600watt rated dimmer will work.|`|db4310b357e8b8155cfe1bd956cf7660aa	Can you turn the overhead light on from one location only? If the answer is yes, then go buy a single pole dimmer. If the answer is no then go buy a 3-way dimmer. And they DO make dimmable compact fluorescent light bulbs. You just have to make sure that the package says they are dimmable. Lowes has them for sale just as well as the dimmer switches.|`|QSgJc7HPaa	NO you have to make sure the light fixture can be dimmable , it will dim but it will damage your wiring and also damage your fixture if that fixture is not suitable for dimming,|`|IXlSrkyiaa	Yes you can    Where are you from and I may be able to tell you where to source such products|`|cplaV2KWaa	Easiest way if you aren't electrically inclined is to purchase a remote switch and transponder. The transponder screws into the light socket and the lamp screws into the transponder. The switch is like a remote. It can hang on the wall or be toted around. Most big hardware stores carry this.
Ioc0owmfaa	Go to Far East Flora nursery along Thompson Road (near Mediacorp). There are several other nurseries there too that sell different types of roses.    There are roses from Holland, India or Cameron Highlands. They are all very beautiful, fresh, and reasonably cheap.    A bundle (abt a dozen or more) cost abt $5-$12 dollars, depending on what type of breed. Usually the imported & better ones you can find inside the cold room.    You can get the 'clearance" roses at Far East Flora at $3-4 a bundle. They are still in very good condition.    So, if you divide the price with the no. of roses per bundle, it is definitely much much cheaper. You will definitely make a profit.

Take out two ice cubes. I like to use the old-fashioned ice cube trays because they produce ice with a flat top and a flat bottom, but any ice will do if you can stack them.    Place one cube under the gummed area, with as few layers of fabric as possible (ie - in the pant leg).    Situate the gum spot in the center of the cube, and carefully balance the second cube on top.    Wait for at least 30 minutes. You want the gum to get good and cold, through and through.    You have waited long enough. Take the ice cubes off the fabric and find a flat surface. Grab the butter-knife and, using a non-serrated edge, scrape the frozen gum off. It should come right off in one big chunk. You may have to scrape off some small bits too; make sure there are none left on the fabric.

AA12106467	Don't give them a fertilizer that is high in nitrogen.  That will do the opposite of what you want.  Nitrogen makes plants grow up.  What you want are fertilizers that are high in the other two: phosphorous and potassium.  Those two help make the roots of plants grow.  And of course for potatoes, the potato is part of the root.  So making the roots grow will help make the potato bigger.    With other plants you normally fertilize with fertilizer that is high in nitrogen and fairly low in the other two.    The percentage of the Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium is noted by the three numbers that are on every fertilizer bag.

63a744f8780da32e4dffc3dfb32eb089aa	Gypcrete is a brand name of gypsum concrete and a registered trademark of the Maxxon Corporation. The trademark has become a popularized term - similar to Kleenex - because of the prevalence of this product. Construction professionals and architects often use "gypcrete" to describe any type of gypsum concrete.      Properties  Gypcrete is a gypsum concrete floor underlayment that is used in wood-frame and concrete construction for fire-ratings, sound reduction, radiant heating, and floor leveling. Gypcrete is installed only by companies approved by the Maxxon Corporation.      History  Gypcrete was an almost instant success in the construction industry in the 1980s due to the many advantages over lightweight concrete. Specifically, Gypcrete was not as apt to crack and cause floor failures.    Some construction professionals are reticent to use Gypcrete due to the initial low quality installations in the 1980s. However, the quality of installation and strength in terms of PSI have both increased significantly since that time due primarily to competition from Hacker Industries, Inc.'s FIRM-FILL Gypsum Concrete and United States Gypsum's Levelrock.|`|AA10932041	it is wall board for behind showers amd things like that. it is sort of concrete sheet rock

zC4cgGhqaa	I was in your position not too many years ago.    First, find your new home, the closer to Uni the better - commuting costs just keep getting higher.  Get on the phone to every letting agent in the area and VIEW as many places as you can within your budget.  You'll know straight away where you could stand to live and where you couldn't!    Financial help is tricky.  Don't take out a loan whatever you do.  You should be claiming job seekers allowance already (if you're in the UK).  If you DO take the plunge and go to Uni, you will obviously get a student loan which will help.  Also, ask for money for birthdays and xmas etc, say it's the only thing you need!

It's very hard even with the right tools unless it's a very cheapo lock.|`|AA11448329	this all sounds a bit illegal. Lockpicking enthusiasts generally frown upon paperclips, safety pins, and the like. The argument against these improvised tools is that they are far more difficult to use than specially made picks. While this is generally true, these can be quite effective with practice and patience.   A technique called raking or scrubbing can be used as a shortcut. To rake the pins, insert your pick (preferably a rake pick or paperclip with several bends) all the way to the back of the keyhole without applying torque to the cylinder. Then quickly pull the pick out, raking it upward against the pins while simultaneously applying light torque with the tension wrench. Theoretically, you could pick a lock just by raking it once or twice, but generally raking will only set some of the pins, and you will need to individually set the remaining pins.

M8dmeAv6aa	I don't know what a pram is but apparently it made of steel. I just finished dealing with some rusty steel. I used a product called Rust Cure. I bought it at an Ace hardware store. It was the easiest product I've ever used. You just spray it on and let it sit for about 30 minutes to dissolve the rust, it then turns to a black primer. If you want the finish to be smoother just pour some of the product on a cloth and wipe. When it is dry it is ready for painting.

v0GwTTsVaa	"The successful stain removal of ink stains differs from case to case because of the many types of fabrics, colors, inks and time elapsed before stain removal. We cannot guarantee stain removal since many variables can be involved. Testing first is always recommended as well as following both the stain remover and clothing manufacturer's instructions. Following these steps should result in partial or complete removal.     General Rules:     1) Treat stains as soon as possible.  Fresh stains can be removed more easily than old ones.     2) Check manufacturer's labels as to fabric content and any special instructions     3) Always test stain removal solution first on a hidden part of the article or on swatch of fabric taken from seam allowance to insure no color loss or damage will occur.     4) Where possible, lay stained article face down on paper towels or clean white cloth and apply stain removal solution to underside of stain so that stain can be removed from the surface instead of pushing it through the fabric. Replace towels or cloth as they absorb stain to prevent stain transfer.     5) If enlisting the aid of a professional laundry or dry cleaner, be sure to indicate what the stain is and the type of fabric.     6) Do not iron stained garments or put in dryer as this may set stain.     * Also try AMODEX STAIN REMOVER for permanent ink: Amodex Products, P.O.

sCMYwtonaa	If your system has dampers you can use them to balance the cfm per register in the home. You want to look for a metal tab about 3 inches long near the start of the pipe closest to the furnace. There is a round disc inside the pipe and when the handle goes with the direction of the pipe it is open. When the handle it turned across the pipe it is closed. Locate some of the heat runs to parts of the home that dont need as much heat. Turn these about half way off. Or even a third of the way off. You can play with the dampers until you get a better balance of air in the home. Also duct boosters would be an option to get more cfm to second floor rooms. These come in particularly handy for using air conditioning. Good luck|`|Z41B2MwSaa	Close the vents.|`|1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	I'll bet its because you don't have any cold air returns on the second floor, except for maybe in the bathroom, and you keep all the doors shut upstairs, except for maybe the bathroom.  Air is just like liquid, if you want to put some in, you have to take some out.      Try leaving the doors open so the air can move.  If you DO have cold air returns in the upstairs, then do you have a separate filter for the upstairs cold air return?  Perhaps you have a plugged air filter.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Close the vents until you here a whistling noise, when you hear the noise open it back up just a little to stop the whistling.    Do not close all the way off, because its not good for the fan motor.    Edit: That is pretty much the only way, but remember, do NOT close the vents all the way.|`|950m8WZvaa	Sometimes there are dampers in the duct work that shuts off areas of the house. Sometimes these dampers are for fires and have a small lead latch that holds the damper open untill the lead gets hot or weak and then the damper snaps shut. Sometimes dampers are electric and are opened and closed by different thermostats in the house. They could be in small acess panels, crawlspaces, or attic spaces. You may need a professional even if you find dampers, to repair the problem.
djmu98oUaa	Impact sounds, such as those created by footsteps, the dropping of an object or the moving of furniture, can be a source of great annoyance in residential buildings. While there are no requirements in the National Building Code for impact sound attenuation, some degree of control is necessary for occupant comfort and satisfaction.  Impact sounds on concrete slabs finished with a hard surface such as ceramic tile can be described by terms such as click, clack or sharp tap. Most of the energy of such sounds occurs at high frequencies.

Mbx4Aty7aa	Fabric Washing Powder Ingredients      Modern fabric washing powders contain a number of chemical ingredients in various proportions. These products are complex mixtures which reflect the complex demands of modern living.     Most of today's detergent products will include some or all of the following in varying amounts:    SURFACTANTS (Surface Active Agents)  Complex molecules, surfactants, which have a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and a long hydrophobic (water-hating) tail. In effect, one part of the chemical compound is attracted to water and repels oil whilst the other part repels water and is attracted to oil.    BUILDERS  These include phosphates, carbonates, silicates, citrates and zeolites. Their key role is to combine with minerals in the washwater which otherwise would interfere with cleaning. In other words, they soften the water.    ANTIREDEPOSITION AGENTS  The most commonly used is Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) which is used to minimise redeposition of dirt that has already been removed by washing.    CORROSION INHIBITOR  An ingredient (usually sodium silicate) which protects against the corrosion of appliance surfaces. It is incorporated in laundry and automatic dishwasher products to protect washer and dishwasher metal parts and finishes, especially porcelain enamel.    BLEACH  Commonly sodium perborate ( known as "oxygen" bleach ), has been used in domestic detergent products for at least 50 years. It is a powder produced from borax and hydrogen peroxide, usually used in domestic detergents as the tetrahydrate NaBO3.4H2O.    TAED - (Tetra Acetyl Ethylene Diamine)  This is a bleach activator, reacting in solution with ordinary perborate to produce peroxyacetic acid, a more active bleach than hydrogen peroxide.    PHOSPHONATE  This is present at low levels in some laundry products which contain bleach in order to delay the decomposition of the oxygen bleach until the appropriate stage in the laundry programme.    FLUORESCERS - Optical brighteners, whitening agents  This is a chemical compound which creates a visual whitening or brightening effect.     LATHER CONTROL AGENTS - Suds Suppressor  To prevent excess foaming in automatic washing machines a suds suppressor is added, otherwise the operation of the machine can be affected. Small amounts of soap are often used as suds suppressors.    ENZYMES  Enzymes are proteins which occur naturally in all living matter whether plant or animal. For example the enzyme "Pepsin" found in the human stomach, breaks down protein so we can digest food.     FRAGRANCES  Scents for soaps and detergents are based on synthetic and naturally occurring materials. There are more than 4,000 compounds used in perfumery and one fragrance may contain a few, to hundreds of compounds.    PRESERVATIVE  A substance which protects against the natural effects of ageing, such as decay, discoloration, oxidation and bacterial degradation. In soap products the preservatives are used to forestall and slow down the natural tendency to develop rancidity upon ageing. In the process they also protect colour and fragrance.      You asked!
VFmmVHGVaa	It sounds like the heat sensor is bad,however turn off the power and check wires for good contact and remove all dust, then try again.  t|`|N8BbxwrGaa	They are correct, the thermocouple should be replaced. It uses heat to make a tiny electrical current to hold the service valve open by making a electromagnet- that is why you have to press the button first to get the process started which opens the valve, once the thermocouple is making electricity the electromagnet will hold the valve open, if the pilot flame fails the electricity fails and the valve is released and shuts under spring pressure|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Your thermocouple has gone bad.

With a screw gun that has a drill bit a little bit smaller diameter than the 4d or 6d nail you intend to use, pre-drill only through the qtr round and just start it into the holding surface. Drive the nail to within a 1/16 inch from the surface.

If you use wicker baskets for anything make sure there not scrubby and worn looking or that you can see useless junk poking through them, etc.  Also try giving areas in your room a good major clean that will spruce it up more than you ever would have noticed. Things may not look bad but you can really notice a huge difference after some easy major clean ups. Try washing down the walls, windows/mirriors, doors, baseboards and trims with hot soapy water as well as any furniture, etc. Take down any blinds/curtains and wash good in the machine/hand wash in tub, etc. A fresh coat of paint or new fabric over a chair.

Side note: if you live in an earthquake/flood area, please keep a flashlight (with good batteries) and shoes/clean socks just under your bed up  by your head - to grab "just in case".   Please, declutter each surface in your room,puttijng things where theybelong as you go. Once done, feel free to vacuum or sweep your carpet/floor.   Make your bed, with clean sheets if it's been a week or more since you changed the sheets.   To keep your room looking nice daily: every morning when you get up, make your bed. When you use soething,l put it back when done, dirty dishes in the kitchen etc.  Dirty clothes, in the basket/hanper, clean clothes put away once they are clean. Dust/vacuum/sweep your room weekly -not less than once3 every two weeks (if need be) best every week though. Honest.   Hope this helps.   By the way -- while cleaning, decluttering,etc., please feel free to put on some of your favorite muswic to listen to while you work. Take care.|`|2WwfS4x4aa	eliminate anything in your room that you do not use or that you can live without
