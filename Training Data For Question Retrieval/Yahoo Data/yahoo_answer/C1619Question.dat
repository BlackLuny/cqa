20080929050546AAWf6rU	Travel;United States;Phoenix	For Phoenix, arizona residents.?	I am considering moving from Portland, Oregon to phoenix, Arizona. I have 3 main concerns about this. first of all I know I probably sound paranoid but I would like to know just a little about scorpions. they are not a huge concern to me since I just read that only one person has died from a scorpion sting in Arizona in the last 20 years, but i would still like to avoid them anyway. I read a tip about avoiding them that said you should not walk around your house bare foot at night time and i wanted to know if this is just a ridiculously paranoid suggestion or if people actually live like that? I probably get out of bed to get something to drink twice every night and don’t want to have to put my shoes on every time I do this. my second concern is monsoons. I I have heard they really aren’t to dangerous from some people and others have told me they take roofs off of houses and kill people. so i would like to know more about exactly how dangerous monsoons are (me being from Oregon i am not used to any kind of severe weather at all) and my third concern is the microburst’s that can come with these monsoons and i would like to know about how often those occur and how dangerous they are as well. i would also like to know how likely you are to be effected by these storms in any serious way such as my house being seriously damaged or destroyed and obviously death. sorry if i sound paranoid. like I said i was born and raised in Oregon were severe weather doesn’t exist (for the most part).

Should the world community vote for the creation of a state run by a TERRORIST ORGANIZATION ??      From the Hamass charter   The Hamas Charter (1988)   Article 7 of the Hamas Covenant provides the following quotation, attributed to Mohammed: "The Day of Judgment will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (evidently a certain kind of tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews."

May I have an english translation please? thanks a ton guys      Resumen de Un Cuentecillo Triste      Un cuentecillo triste de Gabriel Garcia Marquez es una lectura sobre un chico que esta muy aburrido los domingos y escribió en el periódico para encontrar una chica. Después de tres días, una chica le escribió y dijo que ella estaba muy aburrida en los domingos también. Entonces, el chico y la chica fueron a un café y tomaron limonada y helado. Durante la noche, los chicos no hablaron mucho y había silencio. Ellos estuvieron muy molestos así que ellos fueron a ver una película muy dramática. En la película, ellos no hablaron y el chico se durmió. Después de diez minutos, la chica se durmió también.   Después de leer la lectura de un cuentecillo triste, yo pienso que la chica es muy Buena para el chico. !Ellos tienen muchas similitudes, por ejemplo ellos no son habladores y también ellos están pesado en los domingos! En mi opinión, la lectura no es triste sino un poco cómica las personas en la historia son muy normales y sus vidas no son interesantes. Las personas hablan en el periódico y van a una café y película por la noche. Esa noche es aburrida y no es interesante. En conclusión, un cuentecillo triste de Grabriel Garcia Marquez es muy diferente pero también un poco tedioso y cómico.

Is there any r&b or hip-hop played at all? also i already know that i can drink when i am offshore in bahamas, and by rules i cant drink on the ship, so are they really that strict with the age regulation on the ships or no? also is it easy to meet people there? i am going with my mom, so what do you suggest for us to do that we can both enjoy and have some good mother and daugther bonding (something that is free or cheap)    who ever answers all of my Qs will get 5 points! and i would greatly appreciate it
