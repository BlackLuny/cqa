Please read all I have to say, apparently my last post didn't make clear my problem. Before you say I'm using hacked pokemon, I"M NOT!! So that's NOT the answer to this problem. I am trying to hook my DS to Battle Revolution to copy my pokemon over, when I do it, the right way, it gives a white screen. I called Nintendo support last night, they said I HAVE to beat the Elite four in order to unlock that capability. Is this true or not? If not, I need to know. First the game wouldn't load up. Now it does all the time, but now I can't copy my pokemon over. I repeat, I do NOT have hacked pokemon. These are all Pokemon I have captured and raised since having the game. I have gotten none from anyone. I've not even hooked up with other users to battle or trade. These are 100% from in game and me going through the game. I want to do the Park battle on Wii where you have to have level 5 pokemon. But I can't get them to copy over. Someone knowledgable please help and tell me if it's true that you HAVE to beat the Elite four before you can hook up with Battle Revolution and DS???????????

However If i'm going to get a new system I will probably get the Xbox leaving me separated from the game.       Will they be releasing the game for the PS2 or the PSP?

20090203103115AAYmyes	Consumer Electronics;Land Phones	Where can I find an a/b switch for a phone/fax line?	My grandmother bought a fax machine (she runs 2 businesses) and she doesn't want to pay for a second phone line. I told her I could install a switch so she could have signal to the fax or the phone independently. The thing I'm looking for should have 3 phone jacks in it, 1 input for the main phone line and 2 outputs-1 for the phone and 1 for the fax machine. It would be nice if it had a simple toggle switch that I could label "phone" and "fax" but I suppose it would be ok if it was electronic with a button... If anyone knows where I can find something like this please let me know. I don't think something like this would cost more than $20... Thanx!

My battery in it runs flat faster than I think it should. It says it should have 36h of music and 6h of video. I think it may be because I use a lot of apps that use the accelerometer and use the screen a lot (touching it and showing pictures). When I got it, I charged it until it said fully charged, but even this was pretty fast. Should my battery be running out that fast? (I charge if about 1 or 2 times a fortnight) And how long will the battery last before I need a new one?

20090221011951AAeZjkt	Consumer Electronics;PDAs & Handhelds	I need a portable computer with specific features. plz read details. Can you help?	Plz read this detail - very important.   I require a powerful computer designed for the future, with specific features, and more importantly an absence of other very specific features.   What I need EXCLUDED:    Display. Any means of displaying the information stored on the device must be excluded. I have an accessory designed for that purpose, and I want the security that comes with not being able to use it without said accessory.   Optical drive. With the age of Wifi, I can download what I need from the internet, or slave an optical drive from a desktop computer.   Keyboard and cursor pad input. Again for portability and security, to reduce the physical size.         Features I need included:    USB2. I need several, like between 6 and 10 ports. I could use a hub, but prefer not to.   Wifi. The fastest available, with antenna port for increasing range.   Hard disk drive. Large, like 2 or 3 hundred gigs.   Compatible with XP Pro and Vista.      Other specifications are less important, so whatever the manufacturer chooses will be sufficient.   I am willing to yield on some of the minimum requirements, as long as the majority are satisfied.   Can anyone help??

FamilyTime plans may qualify for up to five Instant discounts.       can i still do it even though i already have a plan?
