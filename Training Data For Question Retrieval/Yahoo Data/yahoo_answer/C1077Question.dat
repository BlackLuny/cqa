20090131114237AAqlkLp	Sports;Wrestling	Is there a real excuse for not learning more about wrestling?	Since MAG, To Live and Clown have brought this up i though i would join in.      With Wikipedia, unreliable i know but it does cover the basics, and youtube having video's from all around the world covering all types of wrestling from all different promotions. Is there actually an excuse for not learning more about wrestling?       everyone has all this knowledge at there finger tips and yet there seems to be a lack of willingness by newer fans (in general not all of them) to actually do some looking into wrestling from years gone by.      THE BOTTOM LINE!!! asked a question who would win The Great Muta Vs. Rob Van Dam... most people said RVD, and for the most part i think that was because they have no idea who Muta is but i doubt any of them will look into him.      So is there an excuse for not using the internet to expand your wrestling knowledge beyond what Vince McMahon tells you?

It's apparent that Lawell has once again tried to take advantage of a smaller club and made a pathetically inadequete bid for Fletcher of Hibs.  Thankfully, Hibs have told him, like any other club he has tried to rob a player from lately, to shove his offer where the sun don't shine.   The question is, does Fletcher have the sense to avoid the same fate as Riordon, Killen, Caldwell and Broon ? Either not getting a chance or being ruined by Strachans inept management skills ? Broon, and Hartley for that matter, had vastly superior goals-per-game ratio's with their previous clubs before joining the unwashed, supposedly the most attack-minded team in the country ? Caldwell's an accident waiting to happen, and the other 2 never got a chance.  I see Riordon is scoring for Hibs again.  Hmmm.       Before all the '3 in a row' brigade kick off, how's the squads future looking ?      Nakamura off to japan in the summer.   McGeady made a fool of and surely wanting a move.   Boruc a joke.   Brown the goalie worse.   The free keeper frpm Dundee Utd worse again.   McDonald a shadow of the player he was last season.   No replacement for Naylor, Hinkel or McManus.

20090131145533AABL6Ez	Sports;Football (American)	I will tell you why the Pittsburgh Steelers will NOT win?	Super Bowl XL - Pittsburgh Steelers vs Seattle Seahawks 2005      It was blatantly obvious that the officials handed this game to the Steelers on a silver platter just so Jerome Bettis could ride off into the sunset with a super bowl win in his home town.  We all know that Ben Roethlisberger never crossed the goaline, only Steelers fans remain ignorant to that.  Every time the Seahawks made a play the refs would find some way to call it back.  Final score was 21-10, you take away that Roethlisberger TD, and give Seattle their 2 TDs that they were robbed of and the final score was 24-14.  For any doubters that remain... Big Ben's QB rating for that game was like a 40 or something, when was the last time a quarterback played that bad in the super bowl and still walked away with a ring?        Anyways, after that debacle in 2005, the Steelers have already been handed their 5th super bowl championship... it is now time for them to repay that dept to the cinderella story Cardinals.  Just like the 18-0 New England Patriots, the football Gods have not forgotten about their sins and will collect in the Super Bowl.  Mark my words.      BTW, I'm by no means a Seahawks fan... just calling it as I see it.

There are some parameters here that me and my old college roommate worked out after hours of debating this...   1) a random sampling of 3rd graders (i.e. 51% female)   2) you are armed with normal clothing, steal-toed-boots, and a cup   3) picture a football stadium (no field goal posts), you're on the 50 yard line, and the gates open, kids rush in from every available entrance   4) you have 3 months to get in shape, the kids have not   5) it is kill or be killed, the rules have been explained to the children   6) it is 2:00, we can assume they packed their "regular" lunch for school that day and ate it at noon... as far as sugar intake is concerned...   7) I have considered the psychological breakdown of 3rd graders, I don't know enough to "know" what they'd do, consider this while answering   8) There is a time limit:10 hours. If one side (you or the 3rd graders) isn't dead at midnight, (it starts at 2:00 PM) EVERYONE gets napalmed.      I'm looking for thoughtful, imaginative answers, with logical reasoning for or against the destruction of 500 3rd graders. Please don't just say "yes" or "no"

However, over the last 3 or so years, Williams and Howard always  seem to dominate the individual matchups against their counterparts.  So, does this show that, in actuality, Williams and Howard are actually better individual players (although not as good in a team context)?

20090218115838AAL0gC4	Sports;Basketball	T-Mac is out, I am screwed in basketball?	With T-Mac's injury out of the season, this adds another list to my injured players.  Out of my 13-man roster, this is my 9th player injured. My members that were injured before were       Brandon Roy   Kevin Martin   Elton Brand (out of the season)   T-Mac (out of the season)   Jason Terry (out with a fractured finger)   Dwight Howard   Andries Biendris    Nene Hiladio   Rafer Alston   D.J Augustin   These players were doing poorly when I got them but now are better with other teams   Charlie Villanueva (with Redd's injury, his numbers are increasing and he is in the starting lineup but not when I got him)   Krypto-Nate (was in a slump during his time but now is the best in the Knicks)   Cuttino Mobley (right when I got him, he retired)      also my favorite teams, the Kings and Wizards are in last place of each conference, my 4th place ranking is still 68 in a whole month and hasen't moved up in a LONG time, only down and the other top 3  in my league are in the 77's range. Is this bad luck with basketball, all a coincidence or should I just quit my fantasy team now to stop the frustration?

20090226033226AA7ZCCa	Sports;Cricket	Phil Hughes didn't deserve a test spot Yes or No ?	Look at the type of shot he played . Was this a t20 match ? Were there 500 on the board and a declaration coming ? Was the slip area vacant ? I mean that shot could only be justified in any of the above scenarios but in the 1st over of the test match to play that shot is JUST STUPID . Even our tail enders play with a straight bat and Hughes who is an opening batsmen plays that shot .    I know it was his debut match so he would have been nervous but to play that shot . Was there a gun held to his head that he had to play at that ?    It just exposes the middle order to the new ball early and it is not the kind of start you want .    If he had gotten out poking at a delivery outside off stump or LBW even bold to a good delivery then it would have been justified but that shot was not what was expected of your opener .

20090131154516AA1JFhK	Sports;Martial Arts	Who's your pick for UFC 94 tonight?	Georges St. Pierre or BJ Penn?      I have to go with BJ for the win. I know GSP is very quick and agile, and better on the mat than BJ, but BJ is just such a deadly and quick striker I think he will eventually catch Georges off guard and pulverize him. I know there is also a chance of BJ submitting GSP, but it's slim. Sure, he submitted Joe Stevenson when he won the Lightweight title, but Stevenson was bloodied and battered. So I am picking BJ to win by either KO or TKO and become dual champion with the Lightweight and Welterweight belts in his possession.      Your thoughts?

20081020074007AAcYGBr	Sports;Baseball	Who Is Your our Favorite Teams And How You Became A Fan?	I'm a fan of New York teams because I'm a New Yorker. But to go deeper, here it is.       Knicks: I was gonna be a Knicks fan because they rep New York. But it helped that I loved Bernard King (Brooklyn!) and Trent Tucker as well.      Yankees: Been a fan since '79, long before I knew about the championships. I just knew they represented New York and I liked Rick Cerone and Graig Nettles. I pretty much stuck with them when they got Dave Winfield. (Note: I was never going to be a Mets fan, even though I don't hate them. But had the Brooklyn Dodgers existed when I was coming up, I would have rooted for the Dodgers.)         Jets: The last major pro team I aligned myself with. I was actually close to becoming a Giants fan, but they had just  won Super Bowl XXI in 1987 and I thought it would look kinda wack for me to just hop on the bandwagon. Plus, I liked the Jets' style of play at the time with Ken O'Brien, Freeman McNeil and Al Toon. Despite the ulcers and losing my mind for three months, I don't regret my choice. (I think.)            Rangers: I actually saw an Islanders game first. But some kid I knew from Long Island when I was eight years old kept on talking bad about the Rangers and they were a New York team. I checked them out, liked Barry Beck and Ron Dugay and the rest is history.

20090131163329AAx5Sib	Sports;Martial Arts	Do you think this could motivate kids?	Excitement and spirit s lacking in my kids karate class right now because of the bad weather. Normally I hold classes outside but in temperatures below freazing thats not possible for small kids so were stuck in a small place with limited options for advanced training. so I thought I would create a competition. Where I would divide the class into two teams and then every class they can earn points by achieving goals (preforming a kata by themselves) and loose points by forgetting gear and not coming to class. and then in 1 month the group with the most points wins (i was thinking an extra stripe for their belt which counts as 20 pushups credit for the winners and the other team would get rising sun head bands but i wouldn't tell them the prizes.)      But for the groups I thought I would do white- through orange belts (7-8) with goals like      do 25 pushups in a row   do a kata by themselves   come to a sparing class    enter a practice tournament   lead exercises 1 day   make a poster to help advertise the class   practice journal with 3 days a week of 15 minutes outside of class (signed by parents)      for the green- purple (10-12 year olds)   enter a tournament (just points for going)   join demo team   help a younger student with their kata   do 50 pushups in a row   lead the class through a kata   come up with t shirt ideas   practice journal 5 days a week 20 minutes or more outside of class(signed by parents)      then have like weakily things like award points to the group with the most spirit, to the group who brought all materials to class. But kind of work on some confidene, and enthusiasm boosting.  What do you think- im no where near setting it up yet

20090131161207AAYxPJJ	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Arsenal fans : do you agree with this blog?	Wenger is sitting pretty in his MEGA-STADIUM, happy with what he has built over the years. He has gone on a limb with this YOUTH policy and has this smug SEVENGALI (SWENGERALI) attitude about unearthing the BEST young talent around. It seems to have BACKFIRED though but becasue of his LOYAL nature and his man-managment style he will never say what we all seem to know now. This team just is not good enough! THEY WILL NEVER win ANYTHING! It must be galling to realise this- but the fans that go to the match need to support the team (as 60,000 do every home match) BUT ALSO LET WENGER know THAT WE ARE VERY UNHAPPY with the state of affairs. HEY, I can watch the game from the comfort of my sofa in sunny, warm Jamaica-I do not have to freeze to F$%@$@%ING death at the EMIRATES every other weekend to watch the same damn thing over and over again!      It was Wenger that said that they have a responsibility to provide entertainment, well in my opinion this season has not been entertainment. It has been one frustrating game after another! Maybe people should stay away from a game or two to SHOW their displeasure at the state of affairs. All the blogging that goes on indicate a lot of the fans are pissed off at where we stand in the table and where we are heading. So Wenger is not going to do anything-THE FANS should DO something then.      Am I OTT-God knows but I am pissed off at the way we play OVER & OVER again and the fact that we have lost great players and WILL NOT replace them with proven talent! The current situation is a result of other teams improving but ALSO because WENGER has assembled a team one-or two injuries away from GOING nowhere! We have too many players in our ranks that will WIN ARSENAL FC a big FAT ZERO or if they do it will be in 3-5 years time! DOES he not have a responsibility to WIN NOW!      I still ask, how can you have a team that GOES ONE WHOLE SEASON UNBEATEN and then NOT win anything again for 5 years. (i know the FA CUP in 04-05). Somebody SCREWED UP big time! Who????      100% :)

Does bike riding only tone your lower body, because I am afraid I am going to get skinny legs and a fat tummy, lol. I am not fat. My legs are pretty toned and small but my stomach isn't (it's not big tho) I was just wondering ways you can tone your stomach -not crunches and sit-ups but like sports.       How Many calories does a 10 mile bike ride burn?      And how many calories should and average 16 year old girl take in a day? Is 1000 enough?

20090131165541AAsKkkM	Sports;Winter Sports;Ice Skating	Which ice-skates are best for me to get? Best answer 10 points!?	I went ice-skating with my friend today for the first time in about a year. I have had my own skates for about 4 years, but today they were so uncomfortable! They have never softened up and are extremely ridgid and stiff. They are white figure skates, and my ankles were in agony by the end. I was wearing long socks & legwarmers, but the skates still grazed my ankles and make them red and sore.  Now I am considering buying some ice-hockey skates instead, as they look so much more comfortable...  What do you think is wrong with my skates? and do you think hockey skates would be better?  Oh and I only use them for recreational use at the public rink, but I really enjoy it and love having my own skates. So I don't need either for jumping or playing hockey, just wearing a lot out, as I really want to get back into skating.
