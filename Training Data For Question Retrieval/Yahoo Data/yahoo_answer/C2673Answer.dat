wLgGD63raa	There is no such thing as a "designer dog". They are MUTTS! Period. There is no problem with mutts, but charging thousands of dollars for them is ridiculous. There are already too many dogs in shelters as it is.|`|csDhZDvraa	The dogs are not the issue its their breeding, but you already know that. ;)<br>  <br>  Breeding two unhealth tested dogs despite them being of different breeds is like throwing muddy-water with muddy-water then expecting clear-water to magicly appear as a result. Thats not how gthis works, the puppies in the F1 generation may be healthier but the resulting generations will be the exact same as the purebreds used to create it.<br>  <br>  Purebreds were created to be healthier and breed truer then average random bred mutts. (Mutts are great I own many rescues, btw)<br>  <br>  Poodles are hypoallergenic, as well as MANY other purebreeds. SOmeone allergice can take meds for allergies or get an already existing breed. Why pay money to a puppymiller for a mutt who probably is not even hypoallergenic?<br>  <br>  I would like to know a breeder who actually helath tests AND titles their 'designer breed' breeding stock. I would consider them an honest breeder. Unfortionatly finding a breeder like that is like searching for a needle in a hay stack. A hay stack of moldly rotting hay.|`|3z3P6j49aa	I have NO problems with mix breeds. I love them just as much as purebreds, but purebreds are bred for specific reasons, to do jobs. Police dogs, guard dogs, military dogs, herding dogs, seeing eye dogs, therapy dogs, and just show dogs to bring out good in a breed. <br>  A mix, or "designer dog" is just because it LOOKS pretty. Hello, DESIGNER dog?? Where does that name come from, I wonder. <br>   Thousand of 'cockapoos' and 'puggles' are at a shelter for 50$, when you dont look there and see a cute one at a petstore for $5,000|`|3zv2bbolaa	Here is the issue with "Designer Dogs" like Labradoodles and that is the characteristics they promote are inconsistent and often misleading. Labradoodles were started as a well meaning experiment in starting a new low allergenic breed with high intelligence and trainability, but they found that within two generations, the characteristics were lost and the project was deemed a failure. <br>  <br>  Most designer dogs do not come from health tested parents nor is there any effort made to track the occurance of genetic problems in their pedigrees so the public is duped into purchasing dogs they feel will be healthy or have traits a purebred can't offer only to discover that isn't the case at all. <br>  <br>  I guess the issue here is honesty in what is being represented.|`|W0buucLsaa	The problem is not mutts or even, really, the production of mutts (though the fact that there are so many dying and suffering in shelters is a huge concern). <br>  <br>  IMO, the real problem, is that people are being convinced that a mixed breed puppy they are getting has certain characteristics like a purebred should, when they just DON'T necessarily have that characteristic. Like the allergen example - there's not much of a chance that a labradoodle will be hypoallergenic. <br>  <br>  So what happens, in this scenario: parents want hypoallergenic dog because of their kids' allergies. They get a labradoodle, because the "breeders" say that they are hypoallergenic. Big surprise - a few months after they bring the dog home, their kids are constantly sneezing and getting sinus headaches. They realize that the dog's really NOT hypoallergenic. So what do they do? They haul that dog to the shelter.<br>  <br>  I'm not one of those people that says that you can't predict ANYTHING in a mixed breed, because you can. When a Mastiff and a Saint Bernard mate, those puppies are going to grow up to be giant dogs. The end. You aren't going to end up with a 50-pounder. When a Boxer and a Weim mate, the resultant puppies will be energetic. In people, when a blue-eyed Persian has a child with a blue-eyed Scot, their kids will have blue eyes.<br>  <br>  Basically, when you have two breeds with the same characteristic, their offspring will also have that characteristic. But when breeding two breeds with DIFFERENT characteristics, which one shows up is a crapshoot. Lab + poodle can have fur like a lab or hair like a poodle. You might end up with a poodle-shaped dog with lab fur or a lab-shaped dog with poodle hair. We don't NEED either of those things, because there are purebreds already that satisfy those requirements. (Lab personality and instincts + poodle-y coat = Irish Water Spaniel. Poodle-y personality + Lab coat = Weimaraner.)<br>  <br>  So there is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to try to get these traits, and the fact that people are being conned into believing that a mixed breed has them and they should fork over money for it? Is bad. Especially when it's not true and some people NEED certain traits in the dog - for the sake of the dog as well as the people! <br>  <br>  I don't want dogs ending up in shelters, and THAT is why I'm against "designer dogs." People who just want a pet dog can have their pick from the thousands of puppies AND adult dogs who are euthanized every single day in the shelters across the U.S. People who want dogs for a certain trait need to get purebred dogs, and not be conned into the idea that a designer mutt has these traits - because otherwise, those dogs will end up in shelters, too.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Part of the problem is breeding with a poodle generally gives you a dog that sheds & isn't considered hypo. Dander comes from the skin not the hair so all dogs have dander.  This was the reasons the man who started this stuff in Australia gave up after about 20yr of breeding - he couldn't get consistent results for either issue with Labradoodles.  He have no idea that much the idea would take off & be exploited by BYBs.<br>  <br>  I have a problem with anyone breeding w/o proper health testing for purebreds or mutts.  It is very rare to find anyone who health tests the "designer breeds" compared with purebreds even though there are tons of bybs & oops litters of purebreds.|`|mwVCFlLTaa	Keep in mind this question said they are properly vetting them (hopefully genetic screening, OFA, etc) and I don't see a problem with that IF if is being done responsibly and they are held to the same standards as GOOD breeders.  There are several mixes that are popular with agility and flyball folks, these dogs go to great homes, parents have all clearances, breeders take responsibility for the lifetime of the pup.<br>  <br>  However, most of the "designer dogs" being bred outside of dog sports aren't being done responsibly.|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	I have a mix breed dog. I dislike the term designer dogs its a lame word for mutt. I have a shihpoo and she is adorable. I wanted a poodle because they are very smart and shihzus are cute. I dont know why people have issues with mix breeds. After all even pure breed dogs arent pure they were mixed with something to begin with ya know.|`|tTLg4u9laa	Oh sure!!  We have lots of "designer dogs" in our shelter right now...many that probably go for thousands of dollars at the pet shop down the street in the mall!  I love all of those dogs!<br>  <br>  There is absolutely NO need for "doodles" at all because Standard Poodles already serve the original purpose the "doodles" were thought up for.|`|FhVobWpeaa	I have a problem with irresponsible breeding not the results of that <br>  i have owned 3 dogs 2 cross breeds and 1 purebred they were all loving companions and I would not changed the character etc of any one of them a dog is a dog they are all equally deserving of a good home.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	What purpose would these dogs serve that existing purebreds can't?  There is none...so there is no point in creating a bunch of mutts when we have so many sitting and dying in shelters.<br>  <br>  As for the allergies...there are several breeds out there that *may* be appropriate for people who have mild allergies.  But sticking a poodle and a labrador together will not yield an allergen free dog.  Again, that "job" is covered by purebreds...no need for mutts.<br>  <br>  That being said, it isn't the actual *dogs* that are bad.  We all know that a mutt (like the one in my picture,) can be just as sweet and as great of a companion as any purebred.  There are literally millions that are euthanized every year.  We simply do not need anymore mutts when we have that much trouble finding the ones already alive a good, permanent home.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	To add to this ... no responsible breeder is going to allow someone who plans to do this to get a well bred dog from them.  The dogs that are usually used by these people come from back yard breeders and commercial breeders that aren't tracking the health and temperament of the dogs they're breeding.  It's very unfortunate, but ... <br>  <br>  There are SEVERAL breeds that will be as "hypoallergenic" as a "doodle."   And probably even more so since we can actually predict what kind of coat these dogs will have.  <br>  <br>  I know we've exchanged a few emails and you've said, don't get defensive and all that.  And honestly, I'm not defensive about it at all.  It's just that through experience and with my educational background (biologist) I view these dogs as being very inferior to well bred, pure bred dogs.  <br>  <br>  And I also know, by experience, that not all purebreds are well bred.  But I've learned how to identify breeders and breeding programs that produce healthy dogs that do what they were bred to do.  <br>  <br>  I'm not jumping on you, I'm not lecturing you ... I'm simply going to say to you now that several people who have responded are very knowledgeable about dogs and genetics.  It might behoove you to trust them a little.|`|d2b13247b0a080e166b6ef614a4f6a7daa	In my opinion "designer dogs" aren't bad. What I find bad is the people who breed two dogs, come up with a cutesy name, and sell the puppies for as much as they can. These dogs are nothing more than crossbreeds, not mutts as a lot of people think. Mutts are dogs with more than 3 breeds, and crossbreeds are dogs with only two. Either way, if someone really wanted a crossbreed dog, they should go to their local shelter instead of supporting puppy mills and backyard breeders. By the way, I happen to have owned a Lab/Pointer, and now own two Pitbull/Rottweilers. In both cases they were oops litters, and I am more than happy to have them...and not pay mega bucks because they weren't sold as designer.|`|t78DA6Dpaa	Well if you think about it all these AKC registered "pure bred" dogs we know of today are all man made. All took two or more separate breeds to breed together to make them. <br>  <br>  For instance the Boxer is a descendant from the Mastiff. The Doberman is the descendant from the Rottweiler. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a descendant from the Pug. The Pit bull is a descendant from the Bull Terrier and so on and so forth.... <br>  <br>  Have met several Labradoodles and Goldendoodles to realize that they are really one of the nicest mixed breeds out there created by man. Have yet to meet an ill behaved, aggressive one.<br>  <br>  And remember the Cockapoo has been around for over 10 years and i have yet to hear anyone ever complain about that so called designer breed. Yet the Cocker Spaniel has got to be the worst dog to be breeding like that.|`|16XpYCBmaa	I see nothing wrong with the designer dogs. They are really cute. And people make a big deal about them and say how they are not healthy and all of that stuff. I prefer a mixed breed over a purebred any day. Because I think mixed breeds are really unique with all there different personality's and the different colors they all have.|`|063f3r4laa	They're not all bad.  Ask someone who owns one and they love them.  The only risk I can think of  is that  mixed breeds would not have the same predictable characteristics of purebreds.|`|6PasPfKEaa	Of course not! I would never hate a dog because of some stupid mistake its OWNER or "BREEDER" made. The dog did not ask to be poorly bred and falsely advertised for big bucks. I love dogs regardless.<br>  <br>  Now, the purchasing and breeding (but never adopting) of these mutts I absolutely abhor. <br>  <br>  Now, while there are many breeders of purebreds who do not health test or title dogs, there are also, believe it or not, "designer breeders" who health and temperament test. There are the kinds who loose money with every litter, are still paying off debts from medical care and raising their dogs, and do not breed for money. <br>  <br>  However, ask even the most dilligent and admirable "designer breeder" WHY they breed and they will tell you because they love the breed. Love is a selfish reason to breed, period. Love is not going to magically give all those dying dogs in shelters a home. Love is not going to cure all those crippled dogs. Anyone who TRULY loves dogs will not breed just because of that. They will realize that there is a huge overpopulation crisis among dogs, millions upon millions of dogs needing homes in shelters. We do not need more unwanted puppies.<br>  <br>  Now, the issue of a "hypoallergenic" dog. Honest "designer" owners will tell you the dogs they breed are NOT hypoallergenic. Allergies are caused by dander, which is skin. There is no skinless dog. (and don't give those "designer" puppy mills any ideas!) Want minimal shedding? Get a poodle, get a Portugese water dog, get a Yorkshire Terrier. <br>  <br>  Of course, now you might want to attack me at this point and say "Well, if you're all for not breeding unwanted puppies and aiding shelter dogs, why did YOU pay $3,000 for your German import GSD?" Why? Because I thinking reputable breeding is a great thing, preserving the dogs we need in our lives to aid us. Preserving the pure lines that were bred for a PURPOSE through decades, if not centuries, of careful selection and adaption. Why breed purebreds when there are dogs in shelters? Because we need these dogs. Purebred dogs are easier to predict and we have more knowledge of them. We know what health problems they are prone to, we know what temperament they have, we know their exercise needs and what sport is best for them and how trainable they are. Also, purebred dogs do have health issues, but through good breeding, people are trying to get rid of these health risks, such as OFA'ing hips and elbows in German shepherds. Purebred dogs have helped us from serving in the police force to patrolling borders to saving lives in war to being our hunting companions to herding livestock to catching prey/food for us. And they have been bred to do what they do best.<br>  <br>  So the reason most "designer breeders" give you for their breeding:<br>  <br>  - I love labradoodles/goldendoodles/shitpoo/bully...<br>        ~ A selfish reason. Any dog is worthy of love, any dog can love you unconditionally. There is no one breed or mix more lovable than others.<br>  <br>  - They're hypoallergenic!<br>        ~ No they're not. They have skin.<br>  <br>  - They're bred for service dogs!<br>       ~ Yeah, maybe that was once the intention. However that program turned out to be a complete failure and was terminated. Besides, I once met a Yorkie service dog.<br>  <br>  - They don't shed!<br>       ~ Neither does the more predictable and healthier (if well bred) Poodle, Yorkie, etc...<br>  <br>  - I want to witness the miracle of birth!<br>       ~ Then have a baby. I want to hit you over the head with a 50 lb mallet. Can I?
3zv2bbolaa	Expensive food costs more because it has quality ingredients that are healthier for the dog. A dog, given it's choice, would eat most anything. We feed better foods because we want our dogs to remain healthy and problem free, not because we are trying appease their palettes.|`|E70A7aqcaa	Some of mine do, but I also have a dog that will seemingly eat anything you put in front of him.  Of course, we have a certain "quality level" that we won't go below in feeding our dogs, so maybe it's just that he feels confident that we won't feed  him anything harmful, so he can act like a "chewing machine" anytime we put food in front of him.  But, like I said, we have a "quality level" of food that we feed them that we won't go below, simply based on what our vet says is good for them, with a little variation that my wife adds to their bowls. No wonder they're so blasted healthy!!   My wife's a great cook and feeds ME well, but sometimes I see the care and the extras she adds to their bowls in the morning and, well, I do get tempted.  LOL!!  God Bless you.|`|443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	Dogs do not care what they eat as long as they eat.......however, the issue lies in the "ingredients" given to them.

That is why we must be the ones to look over them and give them what aleviates health issues such as fat, heart problems, eyes, etc........not to mention the "gas" dogs get from food of low quality, with fillers, and their coat will lack in shine, thickness, and health. <br>  <br>  A dog that eats a lot of poor quality food will surely be one of the first to have the health issues, most times.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Well, while it seems dogs will eat anything, some will not..<br>  <br>  while some will eat the worse food ever given to them, cause they are use to it.....and then others even given bad food the first time will not eat it.<br>  <br>  yes, I do think they tend to know the smell of crappy dog food and something that has a better smell or taste to it.<br>  <br>  and yes, they do care what they eat.<br>  <br>  that is why Denon, Bo and Koda turn in their weekly menu to me, so I don't miss fixing their London Broils, boiled boneless chicken breast, grilled prime rib,....for real....and we do cook this for them and they also get Taste of the Wild dog food which they love..<br>  <br>  LOL, dogs I think know bad from good, but eat what they are given cause they know if I dont eat this stufrf, I wont get anything else.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion....I think they do.....some say no they don't, I will argue they do.......that's just me,  Ole Red Head Hard Head.....|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	Yes, it very much does matter.<br>  <br>  It's not if they eat it.

It's really if you want to pay the extra money to give a higher quality dog food. Some cheap dog foods have other dead animals in them like horses, dogs, cats, and rodents. But the higher quality food is made out of vegetables and whole grain and stuff like that. Your dog might have food allergies, and if she does, then you have to buy the higher quality food. It's really up to you, but for your dogs health, I would say that you should go for the higher quality food if you can afford it. Good luck and I hope this helped!|`|CEgq26oHaa	It's not a matter of if your dog cares for what he eats, its more like what is better for your dog.  Cheap dog foods...no way, those are made more of fillers than anything and your dog will lack protein and nutrition and can end up with problems later on down the road.  In my opinion, it's worth paying the extra buck if your dog is healthier.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I don't think they care like we might care, but better dog food is healthier for them.  You can raise your kids on hot dogs and canned spaghetti products, but it's not really healthy.<br>  <br>  Over all, feeding a better diet will probably save you in vet bills down the road so ... I think it's worth it.|`|zTeLhroWaa	Your dogs, mentally, don't care what they eat.<br>  <br>  Physically, their inner bodies care.  My dogs get diarrhea on some cheap food.  Others, they get itchy.  Some make them constantly tired.  In fact, my dogs can only eat one kind of food if I want to see them happy and healthy.  And it's expensive.  And they go through it like crazy.<br>  <br>  But I love my dogs and I want to do what's best for them.|`|16XpYCBmaa	Most dogs don't care what they eat. But with mine she does not like the good quality brands. She would rather starve then eat it seriously.  And also some dogs don't do good on them because they are grain free and higher in fat. So just feed your dog what she does good on.|`|JAdNkzENaa	i dont think your dog cares short term. in the long run he will care becasue he will live longer.|`|aYZXi6ffaa	Do you care what you eat?  Of course you could live on scraps of garbage too!|`|4kuWOZowaa	my dogs sure do|`|OVMb4V7Maa	No, I'm pretty sure they don't care. But that doesn't mean you should feed them normal food, or things that aren't actually food. If you feed them normal food, they'll end up stealing food from the counters/tables/etc. because they'll grow to think it's theirs. And why not spend the extra "dollar or two", does that really make a difference in your bank account? No. <br>  <br>   So, basically, they don't care, but you should get them actual dog food.|`|0fe94fd7d5db6bc0416b695f26217eeaaa	It isn't always about what your dog chooses to eat. Dogs will eat pretty much anything that comes under their nose, this is true. But that doesn't mean your dog is getting good nutrition. There are by-products in some cheap brands of food that can severely effect your dog's health in the long run.<br>  <br>  Dog foods that are high in protein are processed by the kidneys far better than dog foods that are high in grains. Grains tend to sit in the kidneys for 3 days, whereas protein sits in the kidneys for one day. Shortening the length of time these sources of food sit in the kidneys can increase the lifespan of your animals kidneys. It can delay the onset of diseases such as Kushings, Renal Failure (a.k.a. Kidney Failure), or Kidney stones. <br>  <br>  Other by-products that can be found in cheaper dog foods are things like Beet pulp. Beet pulp is highly controversial and is only a preservative. It is the dregs of boiled beets. This preservative can spur on health problems through time. Just as we humans - if we eat nothing but crap for our lives we can drastically shorten our lifespan, so can a dog's lifespan be shortened if he's not getting good nutrition.<br>  <br>  So now it's up to you. Do you want to spend the extra dollar to give your dog a few extra miles, or feed him something equivalent to a big mac and fries on a daily basis?<br>  <br>  Up to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your decision.|`|GNq2rmrNaa	it doesn't really matter because they'll eat anything if they're hungry but it would probably be better to get it the more expensive one if it's only a couple of dollars more|`|gotklLEXaa	If your dog wolfs down everything you put in front of him, then get him something like Purina Dog/puppy chow.

It is a great thing that she is passing gas.  <br>  <br>  Call your vet in the morning, and see if you can get a dose of Gas-X to give the dog on a regular basis.  It is safe, and easy to give.

Her needs might be more sensitive than the needs of other dogs and veterinary clinics carry dog food made for dogs with sensitive stomachs. <br>  <br>  Also, what was previously said - is correct. If she is a deep chested dog she could have a stomach twist.

New birds can sometimes carry diseases and these can be passed on to your bird.  Better safe than sorry.  Introduce them slowly and give them some time out together.  Cockatiels are very social birds and I've never had a problem introducing a new bird.  I have 6 and they all get along very well.  She didn't lay eggs because she's lonely.  Some female cockatiels will lay eggs for no reason and they don't need a mate to lay eggs.  I wouldn't worry about that, it's perfectly normal.  I would get another female to avoid the problem of them breeding.|`|OmkxSKTwaa	It doesnt really matter what the sex. If you want them to breed, get the opposite sex.

This allows you to know if the bird has a disease or anything wrong with it. But once you introduce them, just let them work themselves into it. I think what you should do is after you quarentine it you should put the cage your quarentined it in, right next to the cage so they can be used to being around eachother and after a week you could put him in your original 'tiels cage. <br>  <br>  Whatever you end up doing, good luck!

I would either borrow a cage- or get a cage, for a day or 2, and put it about 2 feet away from the other cage, so the new bird is Protected. This gives them each an opportunity to see one another. After a few hours of starring @ each other- and Possible "Hissing", take them each out- and put them on top of there Own-Cages, and let them decide when they are ready to join each other !  I'm sure they will be Proud to "show-off'  there home to each other ! Just give it all a chance. They soon will learn to Love each other- this may take a month . Don't "Force" them together- as one can KILL the other !!  You'll know when they have excepted each other, when they are Preening each others heads. Then - I still would keep an eye on them for the first while. Once they have established there relationship - they are Inseparable ! <br>  <br>  Just make sure the New one you get- is still quite young- then she will look up to your older one as "Mommy" !

The different sexes can definitely play a role in your dogs general mood but their own personality will shine through regardless of their sex. You could get a very dominant dog and never have expected it to be.<br>  <br>  The real thing is, your dogs should be spayed/neutered before you put them together. Introducing two dogs together should be a calm, loving process. You don't want it to turn chaotic.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can give - check out Cesar Millan's website. He has plenty of advice on how to bring two dogs together and advice on picking the right dog for you right from a puppy. That way you can find a dobe puppy that suits you and your current dogs energy level and needs.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I love dobes! (Get a red one!! :))|`|L5jjhYnNaa	Every animal regardless of sex has its own unique personality...so your question works either way.Since you have a female already,i would get a male.A close friend of mine has two dobermans one female the other male,the male [Harvey] is so much sweeter and easygoing then the female [Diva].From what I've seen Dobermans are great dogs loyal,funny characters,and protective without being aggressive. When i look back on every dog I've had my boys seem to be more gentle and less serious then my girls [but that's just my opinion].I think you should go check out some puppies with your Maltese and which ever one catches your eye,you should get.Go with your gut,if you dog likes other canines in general you shouldn't have a problem  :)|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	After breeding dobermans many years ago l would in your case if you have a female go for a fixed male as two females do not always get along.The hard thing is the males are just so powerful that you would have to enrol in Obedience classes to learn how to train the dog and this must be done carefully as they are highly intelligent;able to twist their owners round their paws and have a mind of their own.They are wonderful breed and l will always love them as my first choice of breeding dogs.If you have a very submissive maltese you may be able to get away with a female dob as in general they are a little smaller less powerful but still have a dominance issue and all the traits dobs have.Usually a doberman outhinks you and this is part and parcel of the breed.They are completely different to the maltese not just in size but behaviour and individual traits.if you want info re Dobermans go to the AKC website and look up Dobermans there.No one can really tell you what To do we all draw on personal experiences.As for me l would never mix a large dog like the Dob with living with a small dog like the maltese but that is a personal observation only|`|eDySIDPQaa	I don't have Dobies, but we have some great people on here that do, so I am starring so we can get you some great answers.<br>  <br>  good luck,   It's just me, but I always prefer males over females, I think they train better and are less moody for any breed,..but that's my opinion, not set in rock, stone or anything else, just my preference.<br>  <br>  I have seen males so gentle a litlte dog could whip then, then of course the same with females...male with male if all neutered are great companions, mine have been.....and none of my 3 are neutered males, no sign of aggression to each other ever.....big ole playmates to each other....|`|CEgq26oHaa	I've always found that female dobermans were more gentler in nature than the males and great with smaller animals...but if you are planning to get a female, you really need to make sure both your dogs are spayed or you will be having fights on your hands.|`|BpKECFBSaa	I think you should get a male. Females tend to be more dominant then males, especially with other females. Good luck and hope this helped!|`|jQpTKq3waa	If you are purchasing from a breeder it is best to consult the breeder, a reputable breeder will tell you all about their breeding dogs temperaments.  They can assist you in choosing the right Doberman for you, whether it be a male or female from your chosen litter.  The dogs temperament has alot to do with what gender you choose, you could choose a hyper female that may play to roughly with your Maltese or your breeder could choose a really calm male that would take alot of abuse from your Maltese but still maintain the protective standards you expect out of a Doberman.  My best advice is consult your breeder and provide them with as much information about your current dog and what you are looking for in your new Doberman pet.

It's a good idea to spay her anyway, beause if she is an outdoor cat she will eventually get pregnant, and there are already too many little kitties in shelters without homes to go to. If she's an indoor cat, she will continue to be frustrated until her heat cycle is over, but she'll start another heat cycle in just a few weeks and the meowing will start all over again!<br>  <br>  Veterinarians will operate on kitties in heat to spay them, but it usually costs more and is a tad bit more risky. You can either take her to get spayed now, or wait until the current heat cycle is over and take her in--before the next one starts!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  -KittyMamma<br>  <a href="http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com</a>
O4M6BEDJaa	Depends on what you want if you would like the hair on her body shorter or you could even leave it at the length it is right now it's not real long yet, if you get hair taken off the body I would have them do a comb cut  it's cute when they have a little length and not shaved down really short. Have them clean up around her eyes so the hair isn't in her way and if you like having the bows like it is in the picture make sure to tell them you down want her bangs cut.  Oh if you want the hair the length it is you could just have them bath her and trim up her face a little and then around her privates and feet.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Depends on how fluffy you want her to be. Notify the groomer on how long you want her fur. Let him/her know that you want the face trimmed up, as well. Do you want the hair up in a bow/rubber band? or do you want that clipped too? If anyone here were to suggest a hair style for your dog, you may not like it. Get her groomed to how YOU like it.|`|T1RZFeXJaa	short body trim and fix up the ears and  leave on top of his head and around his eyes spiky :)|`|R1uFA7nKaa	Oh my gosh she/he is adorable!!

It really all depends on how much you wanna brush on her the matt very easily. So the way we do it mostly is clean up the eyes and do a round face and put a blade on he body (normally a number 4 blade it leaves the hair about 2 ) and scissor the legs. Its a lamb cut  a shorter puppy cut. Some groomers know some dont. Good Luck|`|R8Q6GoOfaa	What a cute puppy!  I have a 9 year-old Shih-Tzu and she's wonderful.  I usually get her cut short, with her hair about an inch long.  She looks almost exactly like your puppy.  With the shorter cut, it's easier to brush her and I send her to the groomer less often.  Let me know what you decide.  : )|`|Grb85RJuaa	You already make him wear that bow so leave him natural so he can at leas have SOME dignity.|`|y8DLyE5raa	I'm sorry, I don't have an answer but OMG is that dog cute! :O)|`|8OFTX19Yaa	AW he is cute!!
8Rn2pX4jaa	If you can feel the baby moving and she is not behaving unusual, I wouldn't worry.  Some horses, especially your stockier breeds, don't look nearly as big as your more refined breeds.  Being her first foal, she may also be carrying on the smaller side.  <br>  <br>  Watch her teats for signs that she is getting ready to foal.  She still has a month to go.  A friend of mine had two mares in foal (or so she thought) one was HUGE!  The other wasn't big at all.  Turned out the one that was huge, had aborted or absorbed the foal and was just getting fat.  The mare that gave birth to a healthy foal wasn't big at all.<br>  <br>  So... size is not always the most important indicator.  If you are still concerned that she is to small, I would contact the vet as you get closer to the due date.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|UIM8X38Oaa	If you are concerned you might want to ask the vet and have her looked at.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|MK8nvkaxaa	Don't worry, everything will be fine.  I have bought mares who never looked pregnant and had baby's out of the blue.  Look at the bright side, a small colt will be easier on her being her first time and all.  Just because it is born small doesn't necessarily mean it will stay small.  Feed her well when the colt is nursing.  That baby will suck the weight right off her and may stunt his growth as well if you don't keep her fed well.  Remember she eats for two.  Some mares will "bag up" before the colt is born.  Watching her teats is always good.  But she may not make a bag (or come to milk) until the colt hits the ground.  Watch her for swelling or any uncomfortable type behavior.  Some mares it is easy to tell when they are about to go into labor.  Then there are those you don't have a clue until you find a colt alongside her.  Don't worry.  Odds are she is fine.  I have raised lots and lots of babies.  Unless she has trouble actually having the baby, which is unlikely, she'll be fine and raise you a fine colt.  Good luck!!|`|mFLL37M5aa	Every pregnancy is different.  Some mares' bellys don't actually "drop" until DAYS before they foal.  Take it easy and call the vet if you are concerned.  Good luck to you dear.|`|WVyP2I4saa	Relax, this stuff is pretty common with mares.  I had a very good vet "miss" a pregnancy, she was a little embarassed when we returned the mare to the stud only to be told she was actually in foal. Have you given her the shots at 5, 7, and 9 months for rhino?  And make sure you get her a suppliment, the foal grows the most in the last three months of pregnancy.  As for the teats, the norm is for the mare to start "bagging" 3-6 weeks before foaling, but all mares are not the same.  Especially with a maiden mare or one you don't have a history on, things can vary and still be okay.  You will usually see a different attitude as she gets closer to the actual foaling, she may want to hang around the barn, separate from other horses.  Many mares stream colostrum and milk down their back legs days or weeks before they give birth.  I had one maiden mare who showed none of the usual signs.  She wouldn't leave the barn area after I put her out and cleaned her stall so I put her back in.  Thanks heaven I was there, she immediately went into labor!  I had just enough time to get the straw put down and call my vet when she started to stream milk and give birth.  It's hard to relax but you will be no help to your mare if you are too nervous to keep a cool head and think.  Get some books and read, prepare ahead, have your cell phone handy with necessary numbers and watch.  Being prepared is the best you can do, and try to get some sleep now so you can stay with her when she gets really close.|`|eq5qPnRGaa	Talk to any woman who's had a baby, most didn't get HUGE until the last month or so.  Horses are often the same.  Usually they're barely fat until a few weeks before, and then all of a sudden they seem to get bigger by the second.<br>  <br>  It is also possible the dates are a little off.  Due dates are always a guideline, they aren't set in stone.  Her earlier weight loss may have affected the foal's size as well.  She could also just be one of those mares that never do get terribly large.  As long as she seems healthy, don't worry about it.  Take the best care of her you can, and be patient.  The foal will turn out just fine regardless of what the mare looks like.|`|Duhh8Aisaa	Some mares just don't gain as much weight as others. The best thing you could do would be to call your vet. Since you've never had any experience with a pregnant mare before, he should be following her case very closely anyway.
Rw7gi86Naa	Remember, a cat’s sense of smell is fourteen times stronger than that of a human. This is why it is so important for you to thoroughly clean the urine spots. Even if you can’t smell it, your cat probably still smells the urine in the carpet, and this can make them want to “re-mark” that spot over and over.<br>  <br>  To remove the smell of urine from just about anything, first clean it with some sort of soap or kitchen cleaner. Then clean it with lemon juice. If you don’t like the smell of lemon juice follow it up with a little bit of vanilla extract. One of the most effective formulas I’ve found for removing ANY odor was from Popular Science Magazine. Mix 1 quart of Hydrogen Peroxide, with 1/4 cup of Baking Soda, and one tablespoon of liquid dishwashing soap. Saturate the affected area, rinse thoroughly with clean water, and the smell is gone. This is non-toxic and safe for your animals and children, and those with allergies. This is especially helpful for removing skunk odor from your outdoor animals. As always, test a small portion of fabric for color fastness, before treating a large area. <br>  <br>  What Won’t Work… There are many home remedies for treating pet stains and odors, and let me stress that most of them are not too bad as far as removing odors for humans’ noses. Vinegar, ammonia, baking soda, laundry detergents, lemon juice, fabric softeners, and commercial strength pet stain removers are all great for removing the odors that humans can smell. However; you will need more to remove the odor for your cat’s nose. An enzymatic cleaner is the best answer, but it is slow and may take more than one application, (Nature’s Miracle is one of them). The Hydrogen Peroxide/Baking Soda combo is fast, but can alter the colors of some fabrics. In the end, you must decide which application is best for your situation. <br>  <br>  Even if you clean a pet stain with soap and water certain micro-organisms remain behind and your pet can smell them. Enzymatic Cleaners are designed to completely eliminate the source of the odor by using enzymes to eat away the micro-organisms that cause the odor. The one drawback to these cleaners is that they are slow; it could take several weeks for them to completely eliminate an odor. Enzymantic Cleaners are available at most pet stores, organic/natural/health food stores, and even some hardware stores. You can also ask your vet for suppliers.<br>  <br>  **Never steam clean a stain. That will only make the stain worse!**|`|zeTGmB3faa	You need a pet enzyme odor eliminator. I have used the one by Rug Doctor with good results. I applied it, soaking the area of the carpet, keeping it wet for a few days and keeping the area blocked off. I did this a few times and the odor disappeared completely. You should get a lot of suggestions on here. Good luck.|`|blIUbMzaaa	Try sprinkling the stained areas with a good coverage of bicarbonate of soda and leave for 24  hours if possible,  then vacuum.  This has worked for me in the past and it's cheap.  Good luck!|`|7fVr3q0kaa	I had a similar problem--when I moved into my current apartment, my kitties quickly found a spot on the carpet where a previous tenant's cat had obviously urinated. I tried all kinds of cleaners, including one designed specifically for cat urine, but one of my kitties kept urinating there. The scent tells them that this area is a toilet!<br>  <br>  I finally hit on something that worked. I bought an extra litterbox and kept it right on top of the spot on the carpet she was urinating on. She started going in the litterbox, and a few months later I began gradually moving the litterbox out of that room and into the room I want it in. By then, she was firmly litterbox trained, so even though I sometimes see her sniffing in that corner, she only goes in the litterbox.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  -KittyMamma<br>  <a href="http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com</a>|`|Nt7exGYAaa	Don't use anything with a perfume in it as this can in fact set the smell and of course it'll keep returning and using the same spot.<br>  <br>  Best is water, mop it up really well and if you have to use any particular products, make sure it's one from a vet as some of the supermarket varieties can set the smell.|`|XG7zVTIsaa	Bi carbonated soda is the only answer and have the cat neutered or spade

If she is making mistakes it's you that is failing for not taking her outside often enough or at the right time....she's not failing.<br>  <br>  Take her outside after eating, drinking, playing, sleeping and stay with her so you can praise her when she obliges.

2Qykhk0gaa	ASHLEY & SARA'S ANSWER:<br>  <br>  Okay, have you ever sat down to pee but haven't really peed?? You still wipe your ***. Out of habit. Same with kitty. The fact that there is no litter around desn't mean he's not going to go through his normal potty routine. The bigger question here, is why he might be regressing from using the box before and is now going on the floor. Maybe he's trying to tell you something.|`|SxpXdKBWaa	lmao our cat will go in his box then he;ll get out and try covering it up from the outside like the carpet its hilarious|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	It's just a cat's nature but you need to get him back to using the litter box right away. Make sure the litter box is cleaned out two or three times a day. When I took my new kitty to the Vet for her shots, that's one thing the Vet told me. Kittens/cats will NOT go in a dirty litter box. I clean her litter box three times a day, stick with the same brand of litter, & I lightly sprinkle the litter with Arm & Hammer litter box baking soda. I sprinkle it on top of the litter, then take the scooper, & mix it in the litter. It smells really nice & my kitty goes to her box when nature calls. You may have to place your kitty in the litter box a few times, to get him back into the habit of using the box.   ~^-^~|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Many people believe they bury their waste products because they are fastidious.  That isn't necessarily so.  In the wild, only secondary cats bury their waste to protect their trail from predators.  The dominant feline will actually display his or her feces prominently.  This sends a strong message of dominance.  In the world of house cats, you are the dominant animal and the house cat chooses not to offend you. They will carefully bury their feces to eliminate interfering with what they perceive as the natural order.
4Sc3FAwUaa	Yes they are but DO NOT buy one from a pet store. Most exotic pet stores do not get their hedgehogs from a reputable breeder. They buy them from people who breed their hedgehogs more often than they should and often without regard to which lines of hedgehogs are with out genetic disorders and such. I suggest going straight to a breeder who hand raises their hedgehogs and breeds for the highest quality hedgehogs. I've had two over the last decade and they can be extremely fun and suprisingly loving and affectionate if you handle them daily and make sure they are loved and cared for. Now some people get them because they think it's "cool" and while it is you have to make sure that's not the only reason you're getting a hedgie. If you feel you can dedicate a little bit of your time daily to playing and getting your hedgie out of the cage. I'm sure you'd love it.

FQyeGsIyaa	Cats should have their teeth brushed daily.<br>  <br>  My cat had the beginnings of gingivitis at her last checkup and the vet recommended I use CET rinse. I started by putting it on a cotton swab and running it along her gums. The crazy cat liked the taste and kept trying to chomp on the swab! Initially, I didn't try to do a thorough job, I just wanted to get her used to the process. Gradually, I was able to do a better job and the cat was relaxed about it. Now, she'll even wait next to me while I get the supplies out to do it.<br>  <br>  I tried to the finger brush which didn't work for either of us (it was too big for my finger and the cat was used to the smaller swab). I now use the little cat toothbrush with the rinse on it. I've tried moving on to using toothpaste a couple of times, but the cat likes the rinse better. I may try a different flavor toothpaste next time<br>  <br>  The link below from Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine has a good video about brushing the cats teeth and a 4wk training program.  I found this after I started the routine the vet told me about.  I think this way might have been a little easier but the guideline is similar-take it gradually.|`|Nt7exGYAaa	Better than a toothpaste (and undoubtedly getting shredded by the cat at the same time) there are special cat nibblies available that clean their teeth.  <br>  <br>  If your cat allows it, you can gently scrape any tartar from the tooth with your fingernail.<br>  <br>  Unless the cat has been introduced to a toothbrush from the onset you'd have a battle on your hands.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Take the cat to your vet and they can tell you when, how and what to use.|`|AA11887983	There are types of treatments that do not involve brushing.

eq5qPnRGaa	A saddle that fits properly should slide into place and feel like it couldn't possibly go elsewhere.  The seat should be nice and level front to back and the girth once fastened on most horses should sit 4-6" behind the horse's elbow.  On short/long barreled horses it may be more or less.|`|gzQAIahaaa	Put the saddle on really far forward then keep wriggling it back loosely until it is sitting without moving back.|`|qQsFTkWmaa	the cantle should be 2 fingers width from the start of the withers..<br>  <br>  on MOST horse..  i find with hight witherd horses it needs to be back a bit more...|`|wk94gNnWaa	The way I was first taught was to place the saddle blanket so it was up on the withers and was half way onto the shoulder. Imagine drawing a line halfway through the leg to his neck, the pad should sit just behind that. The saddle should sit just inside the rim of that (general all-purpose saddle). Pull the pad up into the gullet so it's not pressing and rubbing on the withers. Note to the first post: the cantle is the very back of the seat. The pommel is the front and the gullet is the frame under the pommel.<br>  <br>  Usually you can just slide it forward or back (without changing the pad) until it feels like it can't sit anywhere else. (Good point to the post above.) The pommel should sit just over the withers but not actually on it. If you're seriously in doubt, see if you can get someone else to double check it for you (as long as you think they know what they're doing).<br>  <br>  Don't panic, if your horse isn't playing up more than usual (or more than none if your horse is such), you should be fine. Unless your horse is in pain, stop panicking! I know it's hard and you show you love your horse but sometimes you just have to go with the flow. Hope it helps and good luck. (:|`|ZkkawcKKaa	It just depends what kind of saddle it is. If it is a dressage saddle the front is supposed to line up with the horses shoulder.

The girth should end up about a hand's width behind the elbow.|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	Put the saddle on by placing it too far forward so the front is right on the withers and then slide it backwards til just behind the withers, you can sort of feel when it is in the right place.
XurYYreBaa	The bleeding is *not* normal.  If there are no signs of a fight then she probably has an infection.

wEiHz1Llaa	Well- he is 7. I have one that will be 7 in sept. These guys are kinda set in there ways. Where as my 2 year old- just Loves all the other Birdies. <br>  I guess it would depend on how friendly he is, and happy ? My 7 year old has many "hang-up"- lost 3 wives, to "egg-bound"- so he's been in depression. But he has 5 other male friends, and is "highly In Love again". Based on his age- I would say - no. But if he is an "exception" and VERY Happy, lil Fellow- perhaps he may like a Male ? I would get a separate cage- so the new one is SAFE. You need to keep them apart for a while- to see if your bird is acting jealous, and to make sure that there are no-diseases coming in from the new bird. I would set up cage # 2  nicely, and after a couple days- put them both on top of there own cages (about 2 feet apart), and then let them decide if they like each other. Don't Force the new Bird- in the 7 year Old's cage! As he is Territorial , and should be- this is HIS Home ! The new cage- should be a place that they "both-meet" in the future. and the 7 year old- still may enjoy his own place ?? <br>  <br>  Good Luck.....Chewy and HipHop|`|qDl5Fhcnaa	well i have two male cockatiels and they dont really care about eachother, they were brought home two days apart and live in different rooms, occasionally they are together and dont bother eachother except when they are eating.<br>  <br>  i dont really know if they will fight. but goodluck.

If you quit responding she will soon learn that there's no point to crying.

R3E8DkTfaa	Well first off I don't believe that you are dealing with ammonia poisoning.  That is always the first thing that people point to when they see that a tank is new.  Since you didn't say how long the tank has been  set up, I am assuming that it is very new.  Lets suppose your tank is only a few days old, there is no way that your mollies produced enough ammonia to put them in distress in only a few days time.  That is only an example of course but is meant to illustrate the point that just because the tank is new doesn't mean that ammonia is the culprit.  If it was ammonia the bulk of your fish if not all of them would be suffering from it.  As for your tank being over stocked, the idea that a tank should have 1" of fish per gallon is antiquated, and isn't accepted by knowledgable fish keepers.  The body mass of a fish is a much more reliable means of  estimating how much waste a fish will produce.  Based on that theory, you could put  twelve 1 inch guppies into 12 gallons of water or a 12 inch bass.  I don't think that anyone would argue that this represents an equal biological load on the tank.  There are also several things that affect the toxicity of ammonia including temperature and ph.  Buy a good test kit, and check your water for ammonia, nitrate and nitrite.  As well as ph.  You can take your water to a local pet shop for testing, but there is no substitute for being able to do spot checks of your waters condition.<br>  <br>  Cycling your tank has nothing to do with changing water.  It has everything to do with allowing your tank to achieve equilibrium between the benifical bacterial population and the amount of ammonia in the water.  During cycling your tank will experience extreme highs and lows in both ammonia levels and bacterial population.  Something that you will notice is that the tank will be cloudy looking.  This is caused by bacterial blooms.  It is generally considered best to cycle the tank without fish because of these spikes,  but it can be done with one or two fish.  When the tank reaches equilibrium the water will become clear and remain that way.  You can then begin adding fish slowly, one or two at a time.  In your case you already have the fish, so if  you are cycling, you will have to take other measures to prevent ammonia spikes from being high enough to kill  your fish.  Zeolite will help in this regard, as will partial water changes if ammonia reaches dangerous levels. This is where that test kit comes in. <br>  <br>  You definitely need to add aquarium salt to a tank with Mollies.  They are found in brackish waters in the wild, and will do much better in water with a small amount of salt.  <br>  <br>  I wish that I could tell you exactly what is wrong with your fish, but it could be many things.  As one answerer said, it could be that you are about to have baby mollies.  It could also be that the fish weren't acclimated properly before being released in the tank.  It is all speculation without more information.  I hope that all comes out well for your new tank, and I wish  you the best of luck.|`|nbtVuFVNaa	thats a lot of fish for that tank...1 gallon per inch of the adult fish....could be pregnacy...no eggs they are live bearers...add some aquarium salt or some other stress medication...sry...this might help tho... <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/uc/petarticles_db.jsp?ucCategory=CARE&ucTopic=FISH&ucSubTopic=CARE&ucSubTopic2=&ucContent=/articles/content/fish/care/livebearer/Livebearers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/uc/petarticles_d...</a> .... and   <a href="http://www.fishbase.org/ComNames/CommonNameSearchList.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishbase.org/ComNames/CommonN...</a> ...|`|AraBfesHaa	Obviously you didn't cycle the tank.  So the problem you have now is ammonia.  You've added too many fish at once to an uncycled tank.  Go to the store and get an ammonia neutralizer, and do a partial water change while you're waiting to get to the store to decrease the amount of the ammonia in the tank.  Don't forget to dechlorinate the water before adding it to the tank.  It would be best, since  you already have the fish in the tank, to get some Cycle, or Stability and add that to the new water before putting it in the tank.  it will help age the water.  I don't think she's ready to have fry, but without seeing her can't be sure,  I think it's ammonia poisoning, and each fish will react differently to it unless it's so high that none can survive.<br>  Get a water test kit too.  You'll need it to test for ammonia for several days until you get the water aged and the ammonia under control.|`|L6C66lAJaa	You are supposed to let the tank filter for 24 hours before adding fish. Also, when you put your fish in the tank, you want to make sure you let the bag they are in float in the tank so that the water temp is the same as the tank, so they dont go into shock.Also, make sure you put enough dechlor in the tank. If you didnt let the water temp regulate, then your fish is probably in shock. Nothing you can really do except wait and see what happens. Good luck.|`|QE129IKNaa	no dought u r molly is sick. just check for white dots on the body. if so go to the aqua shop and get shop. how about oxygen supply? check it properly. sometimes fishes act like this because insufficient suppy of oxygen.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Did you cycle the tank?

The Vet will have seen his incision and can make a better judgement call than what we can here on YA'dogs. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you now.......hugs from Pilot and I.  :oP|`|d87b4fac7f53e9dd399f4663d9097055aa	He should wait 10-14 days from his surgery date to resume any normal activity, this includes bathing.|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	Wait at least 10 days.<br>  <br>  Don't bathe a dog too often.

wwmArsKJaa	Your old tank is only about one third the size of your new one, and water in the new tank is going to need time to age, so that it can have the necesarry beneficial bacteria for the fish.<br>  So, you might want to fill the new tank to about 2/3 capacity first, with all your decos, gravel, etc. Let it sit for at least 24 hours. Ideally 2-3 days.<br>  When you move the old tank, remove the water to a point where you have just a few inches in the bottom of the tank, and place the water you remove into separate containers The water level in the tank should be just enough for the fish to swim in. Yes, leave the fish in the tank. Don't forget to remove the decos. You can leave the gravel in there. I realize this is a large tank, so of course you're going to have to find a method of transport from house to vehicle to house. Just be sure to have support underneath.<br>  Once you get the old tank to the new house, put it somewhere close to the new tank so you don't have to do too much of the back and forth thing. Then carefully put all that water you removed back into the tank, this way you've retained all the beneficial bacteria, and it won't be such a shock for the fish. Feeding them afterward will help lower the stress level, also.<br>  Once the water in the new tank is ready, you can add the water from the old tank, along with your fish. The transition should go fairly smoothly. The one thing you'll want to watch for in the next few days is increased ammonia levels. The fish will still be a little stressed, and will have been relieving themselves a lot. Figure on having to do maybe a 30% water change, and add conditioner. Hope this helps.|`|aPClcfh9aa	Adding the water from the 55 gallon tank would be a great idea,also any decor you have in the tank should not be cleaned so that there are some of the same bacteria in the water that the fish are used to. I would recommend treating the full tank of water with a "tap water conditioner" and keeping a close eye on your ph levels, but honestly I think they will be fine. Technically you are providing 1/3 of the tank water (for the 150) with the water from your 55, which would be very close to completing a thorough tank cleaning/change. And I'm sure the fish will be very happy with the extra room!|`|LQcsiZlFaa	You will need to cycle the new tank.<br>  To speed up the process move all the gravel/decorations and filter from old tank to new tank. The bacteria do not live long without water and oxygen, so keep all these under aquarium water till ready to move to new tank.<br>  <br>  Note that the bacteria live on the glass surface of the tank,<br>  gravel, decorations and mainly the filter.

jDPULfjKaa	Well your turtle is a male because that was his penis. yes you did just see a turtle's reproductive organs o.O Don't worry. It's called fanning <very normal for growing male turtles> BUT (and do listen) it could also be some very dangerous intestinal impaction or prolapse from ingesting gravel or something else inanimate inside of the tank. If you have lots of small gravel, or anything else the turtle can swallow that can be dangerous, i think you would need to seek veterinary help if your turtle does not eat, or is acting strangely. good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: do NOT treat an intestinal prolapse by yourself! You need a qualified vet that specializes in reptiles to do this. By no means is any owner qualified to operate on a turtle or touch their "privates" This could really hurt the turtle!|`|CdRlOsnyaa	it could be prolapse( intestinal or penile) -  or simply your turtle was faning ill explain the three <br>  <br>  Intestinal Prolapse     <br>        <br>  This is most often, but not always, caused by ingested gravel. The gravel is eaten and when pushed to exit the turtle’s system, it becomes lodged in the intestinal tract and, when forced out by the turtle, it exits the body bringing the intestinal tract out with it. Another cause is an impaction in the stomach that is finally released. These are usually self-repairing, as the intestinal tract retracts back into the body once the feces are expelled. If not, see treatment below. And yet a third reason has yet to be determined. Believed to be secondary to an existing condition, it is uncertain why turtles will sometime have these prolapse conditions for unknown reasons, most times, repairing themselves shortly after. <br>  <br>  Penile Prolapse<br>  <br>  This is sometimes secondary to an existing condition, but sometimes it is just one of those things that ‘just happens’. When this occurs, the turtle should be removed immediately if housed with other turtles. I have personally witnessed one being bitten (yes, ouch) by another turtle, even though it was not in a prolapse situation. It is not uncommon for turtles to ‘display’ themselves for short periods of time or times of stressed, so do not be alarmed. At times, when retracting their organs, they may appear to swat or kick at it while it withdrawls. This does not mean they are experiencing a prolapse. If it goes back in, all is good. <br>  <br>  HERES TREATMENT for prolapses<br>  Intestinal<br>  Once this happens, the turtle must be removed from the habitat, as other turtles (as well as the prolapsed turtle itself) my see this as a food item and bite it, causing serious injury and often times, death. Recommended home treatment is to place the animal in a clean, smooth container (I use the bathtub) and coat the prolapse with either granulated sugar (dry sugar, not a water:sugar solution) or honey. This will assist in reducing any swelling and hopefully allow the prolapsed item to be drawn back into the body. It is best to immobilize the turtle to prevent the animal from stepping on it, dragging it, cutting it, or even severing it while it walks and/or struggles. If it goes back in on it's own, that's great. If not, once the swelling has gone down, you can GENTLY try to assist it back into the vent. If you do not feel comfortable with this, it's not working out or you think there is possibly damage to the prolapsed material, then get the turtle to a qualified vet. The vet will assist the animal, sometimes surgically, in returning the intestines to their proper place. At times, removal of a section of the intestinal tract is required, especially if the exposed tract becomes injured. The vet will also suture a purse string to help prevent this from happening again. <br>  penile <br>  With clean hands (preferably sterile gloves, but not everyone has these at their home), lubricate the organ with KY Jelly, and gently attempt to assist the organ back into the turtle. If this fails, as above with the intestinal prolapse, coat the penis with dry, granulated sugar or honey to assist in reducing the swelling. If the penis does not go back in on it's own, you can GENTLY try to assist it back into the vent. If you do not feel comfortable with this, it's not working out or you think there is possibly damage to the prolapsed material, then get the turtle to a qualified vet. Some conditions need some topical medication to assist in returning the prolapse, followed by a suturing which will be removed a few days later. Waiting too long or drastically traumatized organs may require amputation, but this is a very rare case. <br>  <br>  FANING <br>  Fanning is when a male extrudes his penis through the vent in his tail and swishes it around in his water dish. a female doesnt do this so check out this website on sexing turtles to make sure you have a male <br>  <a href="http://www.ornatebirdgarden.com/html/males_females.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ornatebirdgarden.com/html/mal...</a>|`|KcQT4ph8aa	Ugh..

The nails are for doing the mating dance which consists of the male putting his arms in front of his face and flickering them in front of the females face.  The long tail is for mating, so while he's on top of her shell, his tail can swoop under hers and start the mating process.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped.|`|zopegiT4aa	yup! my red ear sliders are about 6 years old and they're super long|`|qCUz6YXMaa	Hey, his really long nails are used for courting a female.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck.<br>  x

UIM8X38Oaa	You should be able to work with him in a standard snaffle bit.  What you need to do is get control of his head and you can do that with give to the bit first from side to side one reign at a time.  Apply pressure slowly and gradually until he puts some slack in the reign and begins to drop his head then release the reign.  Practice this alot.  Once he understands how that works then start to apply even pressure with your legs and drive him up to the bit.  You can control how high his head depending on where his release is.  I don't know if that makes sense to you or not.  It is always easier to explain these things in person.  Ok, Good Luck<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|TNTFomKeaa	I would lunge him with side reins. You should use elasticated ones and attach them low down on the surcingle to encourage him to work in a lower outline. As you lunge him, focus on making his paces active and forward so that he really moves into the contact with the side reins. It sounds like he doesn't have the muscles to hold himself in the proper shape and he doesn't really understand what you want him to do - lunging will help him build up the right muscles so that he can go on the bit.<br>  As you ride him, focus on getting him to give to the bit. Turn his head, circle him with bend and counter bend, get control of where his head is. Also get control of his hind end - you should be able to move that from side to side without moving his front (haunches in/out, pivots on the forehand). Anytime that he drops his head, tell him it was great. Don't expect him to do it for too long - remember, this is new to him so it's hard. Lots of walking on a  long rein will encourage him to stretch down.<br>  You should be able to do this in your regular snaffle bit. If you end up using a curb or something with poll pressure, your horse won't be genuinely on the bit, just having his head pushed down. However, I have had good results with Myler snaffles. They are milder than regular snaffles because they conform better to the shape of the horse's mouth and they help you communicate more effectively.<br>  The best thing you could do I think would be to get some lessons with a good dressage trainer. He or she would be able to show you what to do so that your horse gets the best possible training. If you are thinking about trying a change of bit, you can also talk this through with the trainer, but it really shouldn't be necessary.|`|RloOJ43haa	This is a long term problem without a simple fix. You need the help of a trainer or instructor in your area.|`|MBwln1m7aa	Get him going good with long and low first then when he's comfortable doing that push him up with your legs and ask for his head to come in gently with your hands.<br>  To get his head down and on the bit you can ask for outside flexion and then a few strides later ask him to bring his head to the inside which he would find more comfortable and he should drop his head.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	First you have to remember, he was taught to keep his head really high as a trotter or pacer.  Depending on how old he is, how long he was trained and how long since he has been off will all play a role in re-educating your guy.  Un-teaching him this is going to be a challenge, requiring patience unless you take dramatic means to accomplish this.<br>  <br>  Also, I wouldn't go with harsher bits since they are trained with the driving bits which are hard on their mouths.  You have probably also noticed the more contact, the higher the head.<br>  <br>  When I retrained mine, I took him down to a rubber snaffle.  Do a lot of work at a walk working on seat and relaxing him with a loose rein. Work on re-balancing him.  He is also not used to leg so he will be extremely sensitive to the pressure.  If you are comfortable with a running martingale, you can do that, but be sure that it isn't really tight.  You don't want him fighting.  When he relaxes his neck and gives, release any pressure.  You may also want to look into some natural horsemanship on giving his head and work from the ground. <br>  <br>  It is a labor of love, but will be worth the effort.  My boy is great and can keep up with my other 2 in a show ring.|`|qw9ZjAlDaa	Get a trainer.  Getting a horse "on the bit" isn't just getting them to lower their head, it's much more complicated than that.  It isn't something that can be explained on the internet.  If you are truly interested in learning how to do it, and getting your horse to do it, you need to invest in a trainer.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	Your horse's head is high because he is tense or because he has trained to be that way. Please avoid any confusion between stop and go cues such as "driving him into the bit". These "techniques" do more harm than good because they detrain both stop and go cues and also cause conflicts in the horse's training that will manifest as additional nervousness and even hyper-reactive behavior.<br>  <br>  You can test the horse in a number of ways to figure out a good course of action.<br>  <br>  - Does he lower his head on the lunge? If so, he may be afraid of the bit. Spend a lot of time riding him on a loose rein in a snaffle or short shanked curb (depending on whether you are riding English or Western). If not, this is either his trained position, or he is still nervous even without the bit.<br>  <br>  - Does he lower his head when ridden at an extended walk on a loose rein? Or does he run off? If the former, then he's able to relax with the bit and you need to do a lot more of that. You then need to gradually work to find the contact point that provides no more than a tiny amount of pressure. You can work with a friend who can hold the bit to get a feel for this. If the latter, he has race horse training and you need to retrain his stop and go cues. They are inverted and he believes the release of reins means "go" rather than seeing it as an invitation to self-carriage.<br>  <br>  Other things you can do that will help:<br>  <br>  - Teach the horse a head down cue on the ground. Say "relax" and provide a consistent and unyielding downward pressure until you feel him relax into it (to the tiniest degree). When that happens, you must slack the lead rope as much as possible. Pause and repeat, gradually requiring more downward travel as you see him responding. This will help him get used to putting his head low on command.<br>  <br>  - Teach the horse a head down cue under saddle. Do this first at the halt. Use the reins to lightly tug on his mouth and as soon as he lowers his head at all to comply with the pressure, stop for at least three seconds. Then repeat. Don't do too much of this in one session to avoid mouth irritation. Eventually, as he improves. start to switch the cue to a patting of your legs on his side. Pat the legs for a second or two and overlap with the tugs on the reins and stop both when he responds. Repeat, again, not too much each session. Eventually, he will start to respond when you start with the legs. Immediately stop leg motion. Then praise him and repeat. You will occasionally need the reins still. <br>  <br>  Now transition this to the walk by using the leg cue at the walk, overlapping with a following rein cue if he needs it. If you need to use the rein cue, try to be slowing or stopping the horse at that time to avoid detraining the stop. As he gets better with the legs, you can use the legs each time he starts to raise his head and he will learn from that to begin self-carriage in the head down position.<br>  <br>  Now, having done all this, you probably have a lot more relaxed horse who can ride with a level head (at least) and a loose rein or very light contact rein. This is "on the bit" and your horse should be relaxed and light.<br>  <br>  Always remember, don't pull on the reins unless you want to slow or stop. Avoid pulling on reins or holding reins tight when signaling go. "Neurotic" behavior can be the result.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your horse!|`|gzQAIahaaa	try using a market harborough, i have broken in 5 standardbreds and all have been difficult with this.

AA11459417	Why not look at an animal shelter?  Within just a few weeks, shelters are probably going to be overrun with kittens and you'll have so many to choose from.  The good thing about getting an animal from a shelter (besides the obvious, that you'll be saving a life) is that the animal will come to you already vaccinated, spayed or neutered, microchipped and tested for feline diseases.  Animals at shelters usually aren't free (not where I'm from anyway), but it will cost A LOT less than getting an animal from some stranger and then having to pay for all those veterinary services at a vet's office.  I don't know where you live, but I'm in Orange County, California, and there are hundreds of vets here who offer the first vet visit for FREE if you show them the receipt that proves you got your pet from a shelter.  So check out the shelters in your area -- you probably won't be disappointed.|`|quTKsQPhaa	The Craigslist idea is amazing. Many kitten owners will be on there posting their unwanted babies!

jDPULfjKaa	Treatment takes time. don't expect a bad case of shell rot to go away over night. The proper thing to do was to have prevented it with the proper uvb light and calcium and vitamin d3 supplements. I assume you have a good uvb light like Reptisun?......10.0 not 5.0, since the turtle has shell rot you need to increase the uvb light "power" by getting a Reptisun 10.0, and you need to keep it a good distance away because if it is too close it will blind the turtle. In addition to the uvb light you need to have the proper supplements! Calcium powder, such as Rep-cal is vital. And Rep-cal also makes vitamins, labeled Herptivite. Get both if you have not already. You should also have cuttlebones in the water that the turtle can chew any time it feels the need to.<br>  <br>  Reptisun 10.0<br>  <a href="http://www.livefoods.co.uk/images/reptisun_10.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.livefoods.co.uk/images/reptis...</a><br>  <br>  Rep-cal And Herptivite<br>  <a href="http://www.toandfrogliders.com/PicsToPickFin/PicsToPickFin/Repcalgroup.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.toandfrogliders.com/PicsToPic...</a><br>  <br>  Cuttlebones<br>  <a href="http://www.evergreen-sdi.com/Product/Cuttle%20Bone.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.evergreen-sdi.com/Product/Cut...</a><br>  <br>  and water conditioner ( with calcium)<br>  <a href="http://www.turtlestuff.com/shop/images/100221.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.turtlestuff.com/shop/images/1...</a><br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  additional Details: Yes please do. it is never appropriate to feed one food and completely EXCLUDE all of the other options. But, if this is a small hatchling obviously it makes senses to feed a hatchling formula, but ALSO other dusted insects are needed! So dust crickets (good), grasshoppers, silk worms (good), earth worms (better), meal worms( eh...) fish, and shrimp are ok as treats : <a href="http://www.exo-terra.com/images/shared/products/canned_foods_set.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.exo-terra.com/images/shared/p...</a>|`|CdRlOsnyaa	Wet SCUD<br>  <br>  This is either bacterial infection or fungal infection. This is usually the result of a crack, break, cut or other type of lesion in the shell that has become infected. The typical cause for a fungal infection is the turtle being unable to get completely dry. This condition is usually white and/or yellow, smells really bad, and is squishy with pussy discharge not uncommon. Untreated, it can quickly progress into septicemia. <br>  <br>  Dry SCUD<br>  <br>  The most common causes of this condition are water quality and injuries, albeit minor at times, from habitat decorations (scratched while climbing, swimming or diving into the water, substrate, heater burns, etc). It appears most times as white patches on shell.<br>  <br>  The treatment (below) is similar to that of the wet form of SCUD, while serious infections will require the addition of systemic medications. Better results have been gained from keeping the turtle in the alternate treatment (described above) with the water treated with Acriflavine as well. Frye (1991) shows that pathogens that can cause SCUD can be carried by shrimp. <br>  <br>  Another VERY effective treatment is the use of Silverdyne (Silver Sulfadiazine) Cream. This is a prescription medication that is used to treat human burn victims. It is very effective.<br>   <br>  heres treatment <br>  <br>  Remove turtle and place in a quarantine tank. The infected areas should be cleaned and, if need be, affected scutes removed to ensure effective treatment underneath. Remove all squishy, off-white colored material. Be careful as the infection may have gone deep. Going too deep may cause you to penetrate into the body cavity. If you see that you will have to go more then a little bit past the surface of the shell, stop and seek veterinary assistance. <br>  <br>  Listed below is a regimen that I have followed in treating shell problems and has yielded great results. Keep in mind that shell injuries will take months and sometimes years to get back to looking normal if the possibility exists. It takes weeks before the shell will look like it's getting better. While treating, you are not looking for signs of healing or repair - you are looking to ensure that it is not spreading. <br>  <br>  Clean infected areas thoroughly with a strong, undiluted betadine, iodine or Nolvasan solution. Let the turtle air dry in a warm setting for about 45 minutes.<br>  <br>  Apply a generous coating of Silvadene cream. Work into problem areas.<br>  <br>  Leave the turtle dry and warm, ensuring that you do not over-heat, for 18-21 hours each day. <br>  <br>  The next day, scrub entire shell with a one of the previously mentioned solutions, using a soft-bristled toothbrush<br>  <br>  Place them into fresh, clean water. Let them swim, drink and eat for approximately 1 -  1 ? hours.<br>  <br>  Repeat procedure from Step 1.<br>  <br>  This treatment performed daily or twice daily, depending on your time  allocation, has been successful in as few as 8-10 days but in more extreme cases can take a few weeks. It is difficult to tell success right away, so it is often discouraging. It is, however, quite effective and you will begin to see small improvement (in most cases) in only a few weeks|`|2YIxnXXyaa	They pretty much have it covered with the rest but in response to your "Additional Details"...<br>  Meal worms don't have much of a use for good protein for them.  Try to buy some earthworms and put the calcium dust on the worm before feeding it to the turtle.<br>  <br>  Also, it's great to let your turtle walk around outside during the daytime because the natural sunlight is always a help, and it's good exercise for the turtle as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|McnuekTBaa	It appears Veronica has given you info for preventing soft shell, rather than shell rot. They are separate, unrelated ailments.<br>  Shell rot is caused by being kept in dirty water and/or not basking.<br>  I have successfully treated shell rot using the following technique:<br>  -remove the turtle from the water and let it dry for a few hours.<br>  -scrape the loose fungus off with a butter knife<br>  -apply neosporin ointment to the wound, leave the turtle out of the water for a few more hours.<br>  -repeat every three days for three weeks.<br>  Add novaqua (available in fish stores) to the water as a preventative.

The mother doesn’t begin to bulge noticeably until a couple of weeks before delivery time.

I have owned cats for decades and I started out not neutering (because I loved the kittens..of course) but then I decided I'd fix of my cats & now my 6 barn cats are fixed (yes, I live in the country...20 miles from the nearest store to be exact)...<br>  Now, not only do i not have the prego problem, but also, these cats do not wander as far, and they are more likely to survive longer (otherwise the coyotes get them).<br>  Sorry! Now to your question lol...<br>  To tell if she's pregnant you can feel her stomach and see if her nipples are becoming more prominent. Worms is a very likely condition if she is not pregnant, and to tell the difference can be difficult. I suggest going to your local vet (this is what i do) and buy a bottle of de-worming medicine, then get a syringe & u can deworm the cats yourself. Its very easy & very helpful because your cats will eat less when they dont have worms, and they will not vomit everywhere.<br>  So, the signs to check for pregnancy:<br>  - Nipples<br>  - if you can lay your hand on her stomach to see if you can feel the kittens<br>  - She tries to get into your house (if she's outside) or other warm, safe places..looking for somewhere to have the kittens<br>  <br>  Hope that helps a little!!<br>  If you have anymore Q's, feel free to email me =]]

Long term is how you can remember something significant like the name of a friend you have not seen for a while or how to tie your shoe laces.  Or if your a dog you remember the way to the dog park and things like not to pee in the house (hopefully).  Also dogs never forget the people they love.  Short term memory is things you only remember for a few minutes because they are not that significant like what was the weather like two weeks ago or the first song you heard on the radio today.  Dogs short term memory is a lot shorter than a humans.  She remembers her dog friend because she likes that dog.  Same if there was a dog she was afraid of.  But she won't remember the walk you just took her on and probably not the trip to the park, just her friend.  That's why dogs are happy to go for a walk on the same path day after day.

AA11887983	I am appauled that anyone thought this was a good way for a chimpazee to live in the first place.  He was placed into an environment with a woman who clearly has some psychological issues, treated as a human and then punished when he acted like a chiimp.  The attack on that woman could have been prevented if the chimp's "owner" had been responsible and given him to a sanctuary right when she got him.  <br>  <br>  When will people learn that we cannot force wild animals to conform to our rules of society?  Travis never stood a chance.  He just did what a frustrated chimp of his age would do, and he wound up hurting someone.  It was saddest when the woman who owned him wouldn't accept blame for his actions.  She treated him like her kid or her lover, and then acts surprised by his actions.  Hopefully she will not be allowed to own another animal, let alone a primate.  <br>  <br>  And maybe this will lead to stricter laws on keeping wild animals.  In the proper setting, it is ok, but most people do not provide the proper setting.  And there needs to be stricter punishments for people who have animals that injure others. <br>  <br>  Sorry about the rant!  Been stewing over this one for days!<br>  <br>  And I heard that Travis opened the police car door and went after the cop in the car.  He was perfectly within his right to shoot.  A chimp that large can kill someone.  And he was already proving that he was willing.  The problem is not how the police handled it.  It is how the woman who kept him treated him the whole time.    Unfortunately, I don't think that tranquilizers would have worked, even had the police had them.  He would probably have injured others that day.|`|uSjy6vgnaa	It makes me sad that people try to keep wild animals for pets.

I feel bad for Travis, he was bought as a source of amusement and a prop to sell things. Over and over these animal attacks happen and its just disgusting that people can not understand that this in unnatural and that wild animals are going to behave like wild animals. All chimps go through a "rough phase" around ten and should only be owned, handled, cared for by people who are experienced and able to restrain and prevent cases like these.<br>  <br>  I was heart broken ans deeply sadden when i read about Travis's "final moments" but I think it was handled as best as it could have been to insure the safety of the people.|`|QOlZ9qv0aa	It  is  sad  it  had  to  die but  under  circumstances   a  persons  life  outweighs  the  animal.

dlOiB0cyaa	It takes some time to tame birds. Just take them out everyday. You really don't have to continually pet them, or give them lots of attention. As long as you have them with you as you are watching tv, doing homework, ect, they will get used to you. After a while they will learn you are not taking them out of their cage to hurt them. When they begin to trust you, try to feed them out of your hand. Some birds are extremely easy to tame. Other are not. My experience with lovebirds has taught me to be very patient.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	If they are new to your home expect quite some time to tame and socalize them. If you got them in a pair expect a great challenge in taming them. Love Birds are wonderful as a single bird, they will not die if alone infact they will have a deeper bond with their owner. Pet stores sell them in pairs so this is what most people get. Love Birds when with another will bond deeply with each other and they do become very agressive if someone tried to approach their mate. It takes a lot of work to gain the trust of both birds. I suggest contacting someone who works at an animal rescue/bird rescue for some basic bird behavior classes and nutritional needs classes. The rescue worker can offer you one on one classes and training to your situation, come to your home in your enviroment and work with you & your birds. A dear friend of mine is an animal rescue worker non profit, and I got tohold baby love birds that she was hand feeding. They were rescued from a man who tried to breed them to make money. He did a bad job & they wound up with her. Verrrrrry sweeeeeet little birds, Very loving. Try to offer them fresh veggies and fruits & once they get use to you try to work with them on stepping up. Expect to be nipped and ran away from. Don't chase them or yell no. It will take a lot of time. Just keep trying to be with them every day. I have a semi tame zebra finch. It took a long time to get him to get that far. Just take it easy it will take some time. best wishes.|`|ZPYZQxjkaa	They are very loving birds and quite comical. you need to give it Time.  I talk to mine alot and whistle at them. You know they won't talk but they can mimic a whistle.  Take the bird out of his cage and spend one on one time with it. Mine likes to climb onto the palm of my hand. Just go into the cage and grab one gently. put him on your shoulder and let him get used to you. The need to touch and smell you too. Let him walk around on the floor an try to play with him. Mine doesn't like to be petted just an occasional touch. Then it's time go back in the cage pick him up and put him backl. Do this every day. He will ' grow to love you.
pwhpfhjVaa	The word tame can mean a lot of things.  Single lovebirds are more likely to becoming infatuated with their owners than are multiple birds. Bonded pairs of birds are sometimes not interested in spending time with their owners. Birds that were not imprinted on humans when the birds were babies can be difficult to train because they are not really tame. In my experience, lovebirds are more likely to be aggressive than cuddly. <br>  <br>  Our adopted pair of black-mask lovebirds know that we are providing their food and water, but they will not let us touch them.  They whistle to us (or nibble on our toes) when they want to communicate, just as if we were their lovebird neighbors. After a year of interaction, they will eat from a hand, step up onto a stick and ride on shoulders, but will not sit on a finger. They seem to bite for fun, like it was some kind of game, intentionally going for the soft parts, and they can do a lot more damage to skin than a budgie or cockatiel does, so a thick towel or leather gloves are necessary for the occasional clipping or trip to the vet.<br>  <br>  They have been nesting and breeding since a few weeks after we got them.  We were forced to clip their wings because they regularly attack our parakeets and visitors.  From the inside of their cage, they have bitten toes off of unlucky birds that landed on the outside. Sometimes, when one of the couple tries to interact with us, the other will nip the unfaithful spouse! <br>  <br>  In ideal circumstances, lovebirds can be trained and even tamed, but try not to be too hasty.  The birds are fascinating, even when they are not being little angels.

Wx2Fl0xQaa	They have personalities just like humans. It's all how you raise them. I have 11 Cockatiels and none have the same personality. They are all different. This is why it's so easy to name your bird. Trust me as you spend time with them the name will come to you just based on their actions.<br>  They are the most loving birds. Some will even use you as a partner and will lay eggs for you. This is if you only have one bird. Some people say that if you get a pair they will bond with each other and not you. Not True. Like I said in the beginning it's all how you raise them. <br>  When you get your bird, give them time to get use to their surrounding and you. It will take time but trust will build. Everything takes work. I started with 2, a male and female. Now a year later I have a house full. My husband and I have had many sleepless nights. We won't let nature take it's course without a fight. Some of the babies would not have made it if we hadn't taken the time and raise them ourselves. And as a beginner this was a job. One baby we spent over 1,300.00 on him trying to get his splayed leg straighten, only to have lost him 4 months later. The heart break, no sleep, worry, and then the joy when you saved a life. Then when you do spend all this time with them you can't let them go. You buy another cage, then another, then you start making them. We are now at a point of building a new house and our plans are for one room as a natural habit for the birds. Think about this before you decided to get a pair. Maybe best to get one first. And I have found that the females bond faster. However the males are the vocal ones. If you feel your bird might be lonely then get two females. They will live together nicely. For sure you won't regret getting a cockatiel. All birds have personality. I have a sparrow I raised from 5 days old and he is a mess. As you can tell we love our birds.<br>  Good Luck what ever you decide. No matter what you get take time with them. You won't be dissapointed.|`|rVdT48taaa	Well I can only speak from personal experience but the more love and time you give your bird the more your bird claims you as his or her family. When they put their head down they loved to be rubbed on there neck head beak.... Some whistles and some will even try to mimick you. The girls are whistlers and quiet they don't talk but the boys are more verbal and they whistle and talk and mimim and I even taught my bird to spread his wings on command by repition. For a male cockateil repition is the key. They love toys and naps and mine hang out on my shoulder, where I type at the computer. They are extremely precious birds. I put my birds in a cage area but they are free but there are alot of toysfor them to play with and their food is on top of their cage by a window so they can look out and see the world.
qMO9S6kvaa	Well, usually, a new tank should be set up for a week or two (with filters and plants in it) before you add fish. Sometimes you can get lucky and they will live if you just slap in a new tank day 1, as long as the temperature is ok for them. I did this with guppies when i got my girlfriend a new tank and 90% of them made it no problem. Goldfish dont need a heater to survive, but there water temp should be in the 60's maybe up to lower 70's. <br>  What'd i would do is keep the tank away from a direct sunlit spot. Get a 10 or 20 gallon filter and run that tank for a week or more. You can get a Sponge filter and a air stone with an air pump to help the water conditions for your fish. also when you add the fish try to put them in the new tank with most of their water from the tank or bowls you have them in now. :D|`|ShCaAW5naa	Hello,<br>  <br>  the tank can cycle without fish in it.<br>  <br>  Overfeeding can cause ammonia levels to rise. This ammonia can be the source to start the cycle. Thus, with traditional means, you can cycle your tank with fish food.<br>  <br>  Thus, you can do fishless cycling by feeding your empty tank. Preferably you should get ammonia, nitrite and nitrate test kit. When you see ammonia spike, that means the food has been converted to ammonia.<br>  <br>  When you see the ammonia spike drops and nitrite spike goes up, that means bacteria that converts ammonia to nitrite has been established. You should still provide a source of ammonia for these bacteria's food.<br>  <br>  When you see the nitrite spike goes down to zero and start seeing nitrate, then your tank is cycled. At this moment, assuming you have no live plants, you should see 0 ammonia, 0 nitrites and some nitrate reading.<br>  <br>  Cycling with fish is not recommended if you like the fish. If they even survive the cycle, they'll most likely not have a good life for the rest of their life.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	If you don't want your fish to die you can do a fishless cycling with ammonia drops.|`|MJbXxrjXaa	goldfish are hardy, they can probably handle it
d0ee85442ce5191c782fef3b8ab2dfb0aa	you will need to empty the tank let it dry. remove old silicone.<br>  Replace silicone with any 100% pure silicone I like GE silicone .<br>  <br>  let dry for 48 hours to be safe|`|0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	You must use a Silicone Sealant made expressly for aquaria,that is, one that does not contain anti mold chemicals that can leach into your water and kill the fish. General Electric makes just such a product and most pet stores will order it for you. Also it would be best to remove the old sealant  and carefully clean the area to be sealed before applying fresh sealant. It's not an easy job,but it's not too complicated,it requires that you be concienscious in the surface preparation and careful in the application.|`|QE129IKNaa	Empty the tank. apply the silicon glue from inside. very simple. Dont make it a mess when applying. wash the tank after glue get dried. dont transfer the live fishes immediately.|`|aeonmRR2aa	Don't silicone over the existing stuff.  To do a good job, you have to scrape it all and start over.<br>  You can buy a small tube at Home Depot, specifically rated for aquariums.  But any high-quality 100% pure silicone should be fine, so if you want a full-size tube for a full-size job, ignore aquarium ratings.<br>  <br>  Read this article:<br>  <a href="http://www.aquamaniacs.net/forum/cms_view_article.php?aid=107" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquamaniacs.net/forum/cms_vie...</a><br>  <br>  ...and you will know all there is to know!<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.  NOTE!  You have to drain, empty, dry, and clean your tank ANYWAY, so you may as well do it right!  Silicone cannot be used in an active tank, since the solvents will get in the water and kill things.  Only once it is totally dry (say, 48 hours) is it safe for fish to be near it.|`|qMO9S6kvaa	Agreed, use a non toxic water proof silicon and dont wash it after with any chemicals, hot water will do. Also make sure you follow the drying/curing directions for the silicon or whatever you use to seal your tank.

g25k21fAaa	First of all, I didn't take your unicorn, it can take care of itself, that's why its got a horn. But I did meet him on his way through the mist last evening, and on second thoughts, unicorns can never be owned by anyone. They're wild things, free to come and go as they will.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I asked him where he was going and why he was leaving you, but he said that was none of my business - very politely, of course, he being a unicorn and all. However, he did mention something about a Rainbow and being needed by the Bears of Care - I think he meant the Carebears or something, because they were being terrorised by a real grizzly that had accidentally found its way to Carebear land one foggy night when it made a wrong turn on Sunbeamway, as a result feeling extra grizzly and grumpy. Poor bear, I hope he gets home all right and doesn't get scolded by his wife for giving her such a fright.<br>  <br>  Oh, the unicorn said he like the pancakes and corn and asked me to thank you for being so kind as to give him a new rope for him to help lead the grizzly back to wherever he belongs. I have a feeling he quite enjoyed all your attention. So, I have a feeling he'll be back some day, before dawn of course, since the unicorn don't like being about in daytime. He did drop a hint about it after all. Something about acorns, and red and golden leaves that carpet the ground.

xOI3xlXmaa	Its called coprophagia, and quite natural.  Easiest solution?  A few tidbits of pineapple before feeding her a meal.  (If she is a small or toy breed, crushed pineapple works best simply because it is easier to chew and swallow.)  Please steer clear of the powders and commercial preparations: they contain a chemical called MSG.  It is a neuroexcitotoxin and not good for your dog. You will have to consistently feed the pineapple before every meal if you want this to work. It works by natural acids and bromelain enzymes that will help digest her food, but you need this every time she eats.  Best news?  She will probably outgrow this habit, especially if you prevent her from doing it when you are outside with her and consistently use the pineapple bites to discourage what you might not see or be there to take care of.  good luck!|`|24249e5fba62567445c8e54b9df60520aa	This is a normal behavior for a puppy.

Some puppies grow out of the habit, while others never do.  But, whatever it is, bottom line, it's gross.  Many people swear by adding pineapple to the dog's food once a week and there are also commercial products out there such as "Distaste" sold at Petco and Petsmart which is supposed to make the poo very unpalatable.

Q4JCeVB9aa	This same thing is what I asked of several reputable donkey owners.   <br>  <br>  Here's what several months of research produced:   no guarantee when you mix the genetics!

We'll let you know what happens next year!<br>  <br>  The overall odds of getting a spotted mule are around 70% when breeding to a proven spotted jack.   <br>  <br>  I am not quite sure what you mean by a normal brown/bay mule.

And do you want to pass on her behavior traits, because you will.  <br>  <br>  Some jacks won't breed a horse, only donkeys.   Some jacks don't throw nice mules.   Find a proven jack.

I don't know if he was abused before I got him, but sometimes when he sleeps really deeply, he lets out little yelps and whimpers like he's reliving a traumatic event.  I ALWAYS wake him, but I do it gentle, usually by saying his name repeatedly & softly and gently rubbing/shaking him awake.  It's never been a problem.<br>  <br>  BUT this caution is not so much for the dog as for you:  Stay arms length from the dog, keep your face away from the dog's face, and definitely start be using his/her name.  The danger IS TO YOU - if you startle the dog awake, especially if it's a low-light/dark situation, the dog may bite or attack out of fear.  To a dog, an unfamiliar face coming at their face is an attack.  (I have a cousin who was mauled when she woke the family dog and had her face right in the dog's face.  They'd had the dog for many years when the incident happened.)|`|voUv4up1aa	Yes.|`|mVM7DYPZaa	i wake mine up, if the dream is getting too intense. They seem fine

bcca81e3a01eecd371f088c347c05a2aaa	Try taking him to an avian vet. If you don't have an avian vet, you can look one up in your area here: <a href="http://aav.org/vet-lookup" rel="nofollow">http://aav.org/vet-lookup</a> There are many reasons birds pluck, but it boils down to these general points:<br>  1) Boredom.<br>  2) Stress/change.<br>  3) Malnutrition.<br>  4) Discomfort/illness. <br>  5) Neurosis.<br>  <br>  Discomfort or illness are usually very ignored. As you've already tried, boredom and malnutrition are the easier ones to take care of. If you catch a disease, tumor, or illness early enough, that can be taken care of too. If he's only plucking a specific area (wings and chests are often the first and most commonly plucked areas), he may be experiencing pain there. Budgies are most known for having fatty liver disease or fatty tumors that they may pick at, but this doesn't exclude cockatiels from the likely chance.<br>  <br>  If he's had a lot of trauma in his life, or neglect of any sorts, it may have left him very paranoid, stressed out, and even a bit neurotic. Few, but some, rescue birds may suffer this due to poorly educated past owners.<br>  <br>  A vet visit can rule out any abnormalities in his body through physical tests, blood tests, gram stains, etc. However, have the money prepared for it. It may seem a bit costly, but even if he's healthy, it's better to have peace of mind than to wind up with a possibly dead bird if he DID have a tumor or something cancerous that you didn't catch.|`|AA11896821	I don't think we are certain of the cause. An avian vet can try medication for your bird. One thing is for certain, caged birds do this, free birds don't. It leads many to believe stress is a factor.<a href="http://www.multiscope.com/hotspot/featherpicking.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.multiscope.com/hotspot/feathe...</a> Here's an article that might help. Have a good day and may things improve soon.|`|922b1183fa14fb3163c08e7ddb8fe645aa	Certain internal or systemic disease conditions will produce skin irritation that results in plucking. <br>  Liver disease is one; Giardiasis in Cockatiels is another. <br>  Dietary problems are also highly significant in feather disease. <br>  Many caged birds are kept on an inadequate or unbalanced diet, and deficiencies of vitamins (especially A), minerals (especially Calcium), trace elements (e.g. Zinc) and amino acids will result in poor feather and skin quality, which in turn predispose to plucking. <br>  In some cases too much of a dietary component can cause a problem - a fat-rich diet or simple obesity will produce poor plumage condition. <br>  The bird's environment is extremely important: A dry, dusty atmosphere is very bad for plumage quality - the feathers will become brittle and will then irritate. <br>  Regular bathing or spraying is essential. <br>  Lighting is important - too long a photoperiod (length of daylight) may tire the bird or stimulate breeding activity or encourage frequent moulting. <br>  Light levels that are too low will result in poor quality feather growth. <br>  Another environmental consideration is boredom. <br>  This is frequently cited as a cause of feather plucking, but in my experience it is by no means the commonest cause. <br>  Parrots are extremely intelligent creatures and do need a lot of physical and mental stimulation to satisfy their needs. <br>  Therefore toys, objects to chew, radios playing, "playtime" with the owner are all important for their wellbeing, and in many cases, the provision of such items where they are not present will prevent plucking in a bird. <br>  However, the opposite situation can also arise ~ that is to say that a bird's environment can be too busy. <br>  In an active household, with children playing and running around, dogs barking, music blaring, and general busy-ness from dawn 'til well past dusk, the poor bird may get overstimulated and have no chance of proper rest. <br>  This can result in feather plucking and the answer in this case is obviously to move the bird to a more relaxed atmosphere! <br>  Specific infections of the skin or feathers may lead to plucking because of the irritation caused. <br>  These would include bacterial infections of the skin (dermatitis) or feather follicles (folliculitis); fungal diseases (similar to diseases such as Athlete's foot, or Ringworm); or virus infections such as PBFD or Polyomavirus. <br>  Plucking often starts at adolescence, or following some episode of stress. <br>  The time of day that plucking occurs is significant - "situation" plucking in response to something that annoys the bird is common: for example, being put away at night when he doesn't want to go! <br>  Birds are very sensitive to environment and routine the classic case was the Cockatoo that plucked when its owner moved a picture from one wall in the room to another, and stopped plucking when the picture was replaced!  <br>  Jealousy and stress are commonly implicated - having builders in or relatives to stay; holiday times or other changes in routine may all be responsible for starting a bird pulling at its feathers. <br>  The area of feathers that the bird attacks is also significant - chest and shoulder pluckers are most commonly influenced by hormone changes and broody behaviour; whereas a small local area may indicate some underlying internal pain.|`|0nb9zo9xaa	I have 2 quackers, Magellan and Alligator, 4 and 8 years old.  alligator was a plucker when I got him.

Have you thought about getting him another friend for company?  If not then do the mirror thing.  You may want to get a mite mist if it continues even with the mirrirs and try that.

I'm allergic to dust mites, so I can tell you what's helped for me.  <br>  <br>  Is your home carpeted?  Carpet is HORRIBLE for dust mite allergies.  If it's at all possible, remove any carpeting and get wood, tile, or linoleum flooring instead.  Use a vaccum with a HEPA filter.  If you rent and can't remove your carpeting, use a dust mite spray on the carpet to reduce dust mites until you can move to a place that doesn't have carpeting.  I believe Febreeze makes an allergy spray for fabric and carpeting, or you can find them on allergy product web sites.<br>  <br>  Get your dog a bed to use that can be washed and dried in the dryer, and wash & dry it weekly.  Change your air conditioning and furnace filter regularly.  Use blinds instead of curtains, and try to reduce the amount of unwashable dust-gathering cloth objects in your home - leather or vinyl upholstery is better than cloth, and avoid keeping fabric-covered throw pillows, unless they're washable or small enough to toss in the freezer or the dryer occasionally (freezing will kill dust mites, as will tossing items in they dryer on hot for a little while).  If you don't want to have to replace your couch, use a couch cover over your fabric couch and wash it regularly.  <br>  <br>  Dust mites thrive in humid climates - keeping the humidity level in your home below 50% can help.  If you live in a humid climate, using a dehumidifier may help.<br>  <br>  These links have lots of good tips:<br>  <a href="http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&sub=22&cont=315" rel="nofollow">http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&sub...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&action=detail&ref=1262" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a...</a>|`|q0Zc2acdaa	my dog was too but then we got wipes that soother the allergies they work very well

If you have a house cat, they will probably run around the house at night for a bit, but then get bored because they are meant to be hunting at night. So when they get bored, they go back to sleep. My farm cats sleep on my porch all day but do a lot of hunting at night... I know.. they come and show me their catch in the morning... At least I have no mice in my yard.

Just so you know.<br>  <br>  THe only place that I have seen "free puppies" has been in a newspaper, in which case someone's dog got accidentally (or purposefully) impregnated which means you have NO idea about the health and quality of the puppies, you have no idea about at least one of the parents, your puppy is going to show up without its first shots, without being wormed, and who knows what else.<br>  <br>  So check the newspaper. <br>  <br>  Or better yet, save up a bunch of money, because puppies are expensive.<br>  <br>  First shots, deworming<br>  Spaying/Neutering<br>  Kennel<br>  Food<br>  Bowls<br>  Registration with the county<br>  Leashes and collars<br>  <br>  Can all run you over 1000.00 (minimum) in your first year of puppy ownership.  And that doesn't include if the puppy ruins your carpet, or couch, or bedspread, or linoleum or anything else in your house that he might end up destroying . . .<br>  <br>  Free puppies - never really free.

Check on petfinder for yorkie puppies available for adoption, but be prepared to pay at least 50-100 dollars for one.

(lab testing, dog fighting, etc.)<br>  <br>  If you want a breed, make sure it has a good pedigree, or you could find yourself with a sickly puppy and expensive vet bills. Which isn't free. What that means is that you don't buy from a store, and you tour any prospective breeder's facility. But it sounds like what you want is a rescue. A quick websearch will turn one up.

When he picks up and keeps the correct lead tell him "Good horse!!" pat him, pull up to a whoa and finish on that note.

AUJ6uG0oaa	The home-made ones.  I have seen twisted barb wire snaffle bits.  I have even seen barbwire nosebands hooked to tie-downs to keep the horse from throwing its head or bolting.  I have witnessed people using baling twine as a bit - not like a thong bit, or jaw rope - no as an actual bit with reins attached.<br>  <br>  The home-made ones are the worst in my book - however I have seen plenty of cut mouths or even severed tongues thanks to a heavy hand and a simple snaffle.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	appy lover had a good answer.  If someone has rough hands and is yanking with a lot of power, any bit can be harsh.  The harshest are the non-jointed bits with thin mothpieces (twisted and thin is worse) with high ports and/or long shanks.  That goes for hackamores, too - long shanks and rigid and thin nosebands can break a horse's nose easily.  <br>  <br>  In the right hands, some of those bit features would probably be fine, but there are very few novice rider/non-professional level situations (if any) that would call for them.|`|uec7RIhbaa	just a few suggestions - a pelham with double reins, a gag with a long shank, a liverpool bit with a curbchain and with the reins on third bar or even a hackamore - its technically "bitless" but its got a helluva lot of stopping power!!!! not sure exactly which is the "strongest" of all bits but these are some suggestions of severe bits!!!!|`|53e2ec9d500a1e40c31049a6ec1b8c1baa	You have to think about what part of the mouth,poll,chin,etc that the bit would come into action.

High ported is pretty strong, and then think about the action of a Cheltenham gag (look what happens when you pull the runners through the centre.......)|`|BINKsgveaa	A high port curb bit with long shanks, like 7-8 " would be really severe.

MDKfZFATaa	they are probably just a little uneasy because of the kids who they used to live with. they will adjust in about a week or so maybe less maybe more. and it is good that they like eachother at least. and if they don't adjust you should probably call a vet and ask what you should do. also you should check out a guineapig book from the library or something and find out how to bond with them/ get them to trust you.|`|C32K8iQVaa	guinea pigs are really nervouse animals in general. I used to have some as a kid and they were always sorta jumpy, but coming from an abusive owner doesnt help. I'm sure they will get better if you treat them nicely. As for the cage, i had one about that size and it was ok, but it still good to take them out to run about.|`|ksRSozVqaa	Don't worry they'll come around. When I first got mine, they were scary too. The size of the cage is perfect especially since it's two of them in the cage. Just make sure you pet them alot, them like that.|`|Y3dcEN4raa	well just give them some time to adjust they will come around once they see u mean no harm to them|`|19531196a60641f47f4076b1eb9e694eaa	they need time to adjust, thats a good size.
PToNhelAaa	Speaking from experience as my dog had parvo once and I volunteer with a charitable organization for dogs where i live so i have hands on experience working with vets and dogs. I think you need a different vet. I gave my puppy a parvo shot when she had parvo by accident because she was not showing any signs o f having it. Two days later i took her to the vet because i realize she had parvo. When i got there the vet confirmed it and told me that she would have to stay. She spent three days at the vet hospital, the put her on drips, she had a blood trnsfusion, the works. So like most of the other persons who told you already you need to go to another vet. NO vet in his or her right mind will refuse to do anything to your pups. Also the vet says that if you put a drop or two of bleach/ clorox in the pup's water that will stop them from getting parvo because it will kill the germs. i dont know how you will be able to get them to eat but you may try giving them a drop of bleach with some water in a syringe and make them drink it by holding their mouth shut until they swallow. If they vomit this is a good thing as this will be the bleach working. P.s. do not give them the bleach directly you must add water with it as they are still pups. Also try feeding them out of a baby bottle and see if that helps as it will remind them of their mom's breast.|`|XEbe4Votaa	You need to talk to a different vet.  That is not an acceptable answer you were given.  Dogs don't just fight off Parvo by themselves - they need treatment.  <br>  The general rule with parvo is that even WITH treatment, many dogs have about a 50/50 shot at survival.  Don't wait, and don't ever go back to that vet again.|`|Xa9esMTEaa	Find another vet, quickly. Your vet is an idiot. Those pups should be on IVs if they're dehydrated which they probably are. Find another vet immediately before you lose all of those pups.|`|p7swtBYzaa	First of all, you need a new vet.   If your pups had their shots and still got parvo, something is very wrong.<br>  They should be at the vet's on I.V.s right now, that is the key to getting them over parvo - if they are to survive it is more than a matter of them eating and "fighting back" - I never heard such nonsense in my life - it is just not true.<br>  I am with a rescue and we have taken in dogs with parvo, they survived because they were at the vet's being hydrated, on i.v.s, not thrown on their own devices - "eat and fight back" - they CAN'T eat or fight back when they are sick.<br>  <br>  Either you are saying what you wanted to hear from the vet or you have about the worst vet possible - in either case, if you want those pups to survive, get them to a decent vet and have them treated until they get better - and don't ever feed dog's bacon or bologna, the salt and fat is enough to make them horribly ill.<br>  <br>  I hope you don't plan to breed any more pups - between that vet and your attitude - they haven't got  a chance.|`|InW0oPVyaa	Dogs with parvo need to not eat for a couple of days, at least until they stop vomiting. Their digestive system needs to rest. But they do need fluids. I'm astonished the vet did not keep your puppies to put them on IV fluids, or at least teach you to give them fluids sub-q. You need to try forcing them to drink, try using the syringe to give them unflavored pedialyte. Good luck!  Perhaps your vet was simply convinced they wouldn't live and simply spared you the expense.  :(|`|8CwYzBNoaa	Get a new vet- NOW.  A good vet will immediately put them on IV's, as well as anti diarrhea and anti vomiting medicine. There is no 'cure' for parvo, you can only give supportive treatment until it passes, which can take up to 2 weeks of nonstop care being boarded at the vets hospital. It destroys the lining of the stomach and the ability to absorb nutrients. In severe cases a blood transfusion may be called for. Even with the best care, not all pups with parvo make it, but lots of them do! This treatment can be expensive though, which is probably why the vet didn't want to do it, you must INSIST on treatment. Good luck, hope they make it.|`|Y0WIlWoiaa	50% of parvo dogs DIE,no matter what you do!<br>  <br>  <br>  & the virus is EXTREMELY difficult to ever destroy.<br>  I know people who've burned their entire kennels to the ground trying.|`|qdEttv62aa	Go see another vet.

You either let them outside in an area that had it in the ground or let someone mess with them that had it on their shoes, clothes or person I keep my pups very isolated till parvo vac. are done. They don't play in the yard or get handled by anyone except family members. You need to give them pedialite for kids, not all that other crap you're trying to shove down their throats. Keep them warm and quiet. Get some antibiotics, for secondary illnesses,  and anti nausea meds from the vet. Good luck, it doesn't look good.<br>  <br>  Thumbs down me if you want. My pups don't get parvo! Once almost 30 years ago??!! If you were puking your guts up and pooping out your intestines, would you like a nice piece of greasy bacon?? Use your brains.

xy9m59zmaa	I have a QH buckskin gelding and a black paint mare that I had to work hard to grow a mane and tail on both of them.  I tried a variety of things, from flax seed (which I try to stay away from now) to different skin and coat supplements.  So far, the thing that seems to really promote healthy mane and tail as well as skin, coat, and all around health, is a Purina feed called Born to Win.  Its relatively inexpensive, and I saw results within the first month.  Now, they're both shiny and showing results! My gelding has a great mane and a tail that brushes the ground, and he's been on it for a year and a half.  My mare is shedding out all her old, sun-damaged and broken mane and tail and is growing in a stronger, more healthy mane and tail underneath.  She's been on it for about 8 months, and her tail has almost reached the ground already!  <br>  Also, try to keep it all braided if you can, but only if she is in a pen or pasture that she can't rip the braids out on wire or fencing.  Every day grooming keeps blood flowing to the skin's surface and promotes natural oils on the hair and coat.  Don't wash it too much, as that will result in its drying out and breaking due to stripping the coat and hair of its natural oils.  Also, try to keep her out of the sun as much as you can, as the sun is damaging as well.  I pen my horses up in the shade during the day, and let them out on pasture at night to help with it.  You can use grooming aids, such as Show Sheen type products, just be careful as many of them have oils in their ingredients, and oils promote sun damage.  Something as simple as keeping fly spray or some type of bug repellant on them as much as possible helps greatly, too.  The constant swishing of a tail and shaking of a mane tangles it and can promote splitting the ends and weakening the hair itself, not to mention it helps them from rubbing out their braids and tearing up their mane, and swishing out their tail braids or rubbing them out on fencing.<br>  Just some of my thoughts on the matter!  Hope I was of some help!|`|M20TOLyjaa	I like NuImage supplement. It helps with overall coat conditioning. Really anything that is high in Biotin will help with hair growth.<br>  Corn oil added to the grain also helps with a healthy coat.|`|V1al8lOAaa	i add livermol and one duck egg a week to my horses feed, also vegetable oil and salt helps hair growth just add it into their feed.|`|EQvAbyvcaa	Give her a balanced diet and that is the best you can do for her.  there is nothing specifically that will speed the growth of the mane and tail.  It will just take time.  Be patient.  Relative to the scars, you did not say what color she is or the color of her skin.  When there is an injury that scars, if the hair grows back (and it usually will), it will grow back the color of the horse's skin as a general rule.  My WB is a grey with black skin.  Any area of injury, the hair comes back black in that spot.  My QH is chestnut and he has reddish/but pinkish skin.  When his hair comes back, it is a slight difference than his chestnut hair coloring but I can see the effected area.  There is a product called Nustock that is a wonderful healing product and it will promote hair growth very well.  When I got my QH, he had a small area that was scarred and did not have hair.  I took a chance and started putting the Nustock on and it took about a year, but eventually the hair came back over the scar tissue.  If he had been treated at the time of injury, he would have healed better.  Good luck with your horse.  Be patient.  She'll be better in time.|`|W6GnCFHuaa	i don't know if it will help to grow it, but you can be sure to braid her mane so when it does grow, it all grows to one side and it looks nice and healthy|`|TZiisPhwaa	The mane and tail grow very slowly, just be patent. Give your horse a nice healthy feed, and maybe ask your vet and local riding school/ feed store|`|8yDCDPjvaa	As regards to the cuts, this appears to be old bites, kicks, or scratch wounds that other horses receive with-in side the stall or from other horses when they are probably turned out together. Horses do play rough or often times fight to find out their pecking order amongst one another. Once the scar heals to my knowledge its to late to do anything about it; you just wind up with ugly scars. However, in the future, if you have any other problems with your horse having a nick or scars try a product called Cut & Heal. This product has made me a beliver over and over again. Although I use to use other item such as Coronea and things of that nature they do not compare. Cut & Heal will allow your horses hair to regrow where you can't tell there was ever a mark. I can make that claim and I have been into horses for over 30 years. Good luck! <br>  <br>  Although, your horses hair had been crouch it does take a long time in order for their hair to grow back, once it has been completly cut down. If you have ever cut a briddle path in your horse maine then  that should give you an idea about how long it will take. One last thing, all horses develope a different growth in their hair growth and length the same as humans.|`|v9lmFu8Waa	because hoof material is the same sort of material that the mane and tail is made out of, any suppliments you give your horse to help with stronger hooves or whatever will also give your horse stronger mane and tail hair. <br>  <br>  so, what i suggest is some suppliment for stronger hooves that you just add to her feed. i dont know how much or where you can get it from, but try your local horse feed shop, they will be able to help. <br>  <br>  also, refrain from brushing! if the mane and tail is really getting knotted, then use your fingers. when you use a brush, you break the hairs, and they can take aaaggeeesss to grow back.<br>  <br>  as for the markings, i dont know. sorry. the hoof suppliment might help with that too, because coat hair should be made from similar stuff to the mane and tail. give it a try.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.<br>  bee.|`|67dWrrH9aa	feed it miley cyrus. it'll do the world good|`|dt57t69iaa	try looking for special health packs. we got some for our dog that is like crystal light for dogs! its great!!! check if you can find for horses!<br>  ~Grace & Sara~<br>  check us out!!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnkEkrL_gxBzH0KIVOTzydXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080710223945AA6wVsZ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
AiGTDA89aa	1D  is the fastest time out of everyone.  Some places do 1 second splits, others do 1/2 second splits.  For NBHA, this is the set up.  Let's say the overall fastest time is a 15.3  therefore the 1D winning time is 15.3  The winning 2D time will be anything 15.8 and above.  So anyone who falls within that slot will be 1D (15.4, 15.6, etc.up to 15.799.)  Same for 3D, anyone 1/2 second behind 15.8 will be the 3D winner, so 16.3  In NBHA, the 4D is one full second off of 3D, so the winning 4D time will be 17.3.  Basically, the 1D is decided by the fastest and depending on who you are running with, the other divisions are set by that time. Hope that made sense, you get the hang of it eventually.|`|CQUX7IAPaa	they are the ranks of times of how fast your time is|`|XDJjPBMyaa	whats 1D what does the D means 
pDPSaL37aa	Currently, I have a female Panda Bear Hamster (Black Banded) named Cookie. She's the sweetest little thing. Although, today she chewed my PS2 wire in half and I was pretty pissed off. When I was younger I had a male Teddy Bear Hamster (Albino, Long Haired Cinnamon Dominant Spot) named Peewee. He was extremely friendly and lived in the same cage as my Guinea Pig, Floppy (She lived for 10 years. I got her when I was 5 as a birthday present and she died a week after my 15th birthday), for most of his life. I've had all different types of hamsters since I was about 6 years old until I turned 15 and just recently got Cookie in the last year or so. They're both friendly hamsters if they are tamed properly. You may have to groom the Teddy Bear Hamsters once in a while with a soft-bristled hamster or guinea pig brush because their fur tends to get matted. It doesn't really matter whether they're female or male in my opinion. All of the hamsters I have owned over the years have been perfectly easy to hand tame. Good luck deciding which one to get!|`|z7zkwbFGaa	First of all, the species of hamsters is called "Syrian Hamsters". Teddy bear and panda are just petstore names, after their color variation ;]<br>  <br>  As for the gender, it's all on preference. The urine of females smell pretty bad every few days when they are in heat. Male hamsters generally have a musky smell at all times. The private parts of male hamsters are also very ... er... apparent. So if you don't like that, get a female.<br>  <br>  You should research syrian hamsters. There are lots of different color variations and stuff you should find out, such as taming, temperment, and dietary needs :D<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3OhxT9Mcaa	Okay yeah, you should definetely get a SYRAIN hamster because they are wayyy better than the dwarf hamster. 1) Okay first of all those dwarf hamsters are freakin mean!

Trust me get a Syrain Hamster cause they are more mild mannered and the are just a lot nicer, especially whenever you try to play with them during the day they wont get angry because they are sleeping. Also get a male because they aren't as "high strung" as females.. lol.

Do not switch types at this point.. add puppy formula onto dry food and let dry suck it up.(until very soupy!) Use a lot of patience|`|LCQCWWnoaa	Dogs shouldn't be away from their mothers until they are at least 8 weeks old, take it back if possible or talk to a vet ASAP! :D Good luck!!!|`|to2opyqNaa	it should still be with its mother at 5 weeks because it cant eat food yet it still needs milk|`|xXPIH9rEaa	poor thing is scared(= you need to take it back and wait sorry=/ it'd be better for her she wont make it without the mothers nuitrition.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|8zWYFv6Maa	You just gotta wait for the vet. dont force her to eat|`|sVKw8EPmaa	Usually, when you get a dog it has to have time to get used to it's surroundings and get comfortable with it's new family. Also if it's only 5 weeks old then it still should have the formula. If the dog gets really hungry she'll eat. Our dog would not eat her food, we found that putting bits of cheese (very small) or playing with the food with her helped her eat. maybe making a trail of food would help. Do not give it human food. That will increase the vomit and diarrhea. Make sure the pup is healthy and it's eating good food, the bacon is too greasy and the cat food is made for cats do not give her that. Try peanut butter, and good smelling food. If you give her table scraps she will only start to beg and rely more on the scraps then eating her food. Good Luck!!!|`|MuD5oXQQaa	Take that dog back
GaL66jbQaa	he probably wants you to play with him.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I think he's trying to say "come play with meeeeeeeeeeee!!!"|`|X1tawExBaa	My 6 month old german shepherd does the same thing.|`|PkUBJMd9aa	yes he deffo wants to play with you and hos squeaky ball try throwing it see what he does....=]|`|nd30LQhlaa	yea prolly ttrying to get you to play. and that is cute!|`|a3R1NxH5aa	aw your dog sounds so cute i love poodles lol i like how its the dogs chair now but maybe your dog just wants attention or just being a dog lol idk|`|jBOHWOBtaa	lmao!<br>  maybe it just wants to play with you!|`|I7UY3yDkaa	have you feed him? does he want to play?|`|AA10265922	he is trying to tell you something,you have to find out what it is,sorry,but you spend enough time you will figure it out,it may want you to sit with him or her,
Yp15y9zRaa	Breeding bettas is not easy...I suggest you do a bit of research first. Sorry if you already have, it's just this question is a little vague and suggests that maybe you are not fully prepared for breeding bettas. It could just be my mistake though...|`|qEPdwQIkaa	Betta's can't handle a strong current that is why they usually are just in bowls. Too much movement in your water and not only will you not be able to breed Betta's (Which to my knowledge is difficult on it's own) but you will stress/kill the full grown ones as well.|`|ytGdMcQsaa	You can buy some sponges that  attach to the input of the filter so the suction won't be as great. As for the current your filter gives out, try putting it on the corner of the tank so your betas won't be fighting the current all the time.|`|gEv448Jdaa	well it depends on what kind of filter your Betta could get sick if you breed them and you dont have a sponge filter
cnZlMojUaa	I let the dogs sleep in my bed until one fell off and sprained her back. I tried doggie steps, but my male would run up them and then leap off the bed half-way across the room. My dog who got injured passed away, and the older male really can't jump up on his own. His bed is at the foot of our bed and he is very content sleeping there.<br>  <br>  Our new dog can jump on the bed and I do allow her to come up when I ask her too. She will have some cuddle time in the mornings or share a nap in the afternoons. At night she runs to her kennel crate and wants to sleep there. She is now housebroken, but I'm afraid she might chew on electric cords, so I don't mind her in the crate. It is a safe place for her when I can't give her my attention.|`|bIaywrBCaa	some in my bed, others in theirs|`|54GBWTgoaa	yes my husky girl sleeps with because:<br>  -she keeps the bed warm<br>  -i get a nice warm welcome in the morning<br>  -she likes it in my bed and hasn't shown any dominance as of yet<br>   and lets face it, i love her to bits and wouldn't have it any other way!! i think i would actually miss her if she was to sleep downstairs<br>  <br>  we have another dog but he's not actually my dog so he sleeps in a crate downstairs, i think i will always have my dogs at least in my room with me ;)|`|xEyyFrPhaa	my two mini long haired dachshunds sleep in bed with me cos they are spoiled rotten, my sheltie sleeps down stairs cos there will be no room i bed for me if they all slept in my bed as they hog most of the bed.|`|Rva0ocMOaa	For the first six months of his life he slept in his crate.

Why not?<br>  They keep me warm, it's convenient and I haven't noticed any bad behaviours rooted from it. <br>  To each his/her own though I know of many people who have their dogs sleep elsewhere and it's a personal decision.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	My oldest does, he's 13 & 1/2 and I've had him his entire life so it's hard for me to untrain his behavior that I've endorsed for so long.  My other 2 dogs, both girls, have been crate trained from puppihood and since we recently moved they've slept on a great big dog bed on the floof of our bedroom.  No more dogs in the bed for us...I like to keep the bed for ME & MY HUSBAND only.|`|br1Ixdxkaa	yes, she ia a poodle and silky terrier cross.<br>  she likes her nose to touch mine while i sleep.<br>  it's cute in my opinion<br>  <a href="http://www.bissell.com/MVP09/Week06/Vote6.aspx?ImageName=Oreo&FileName=2804.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bissell.com/MVP09/Week06/Vote...</a><br>  please vote for her to win 10,000 dollars for our local animal rescues|`|a6an2aN0aa	My dogs switch off.

But I tell them no, so they go back to their beds on the floor ^_^|`|mnFmamfOaa	our dog doesn't sleep with me in my bed.He sleeps on the floor near my parents bed.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	My Basenji Mini Schnauzer cross (20lbs) does my Husky mix (50+lbs) sleeps either in her crate or on the couch|`|yLwKWzIUaa	yes, but ONLY if they are invited.<br>  though both my dogs love the crate :)|`|afU9Hg7Kaa	We started with our puppy sleeping in the crate to potty train and it worked like a charm. Now that the dog is older (1 year) she only sleeps on the bed in the winter when it's freezing. In summer, it's back to the crate at night.<br>  <br>  Why: It's healthy for the dog to have his/her own space. You need to have your own space. It helps establish that you are the person, they are the dog, you are the owner, not the other way around. I think it's all about balance. Plus the dog hair can get pretty gross after a while.|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Yepper all 35+ years as well as my child hood years. I have two that sleep in bed and some sleep in there beds for various reasons, thankfully as they all don't fit! I keep a blanket on half my bed across the bottom and they know this is just for them!<br>  My dogs cannot wait for bedtime and generally if I stay up to late they come and get me. It is so funny they can designate between the work week and the weekends! Not that you asked but one of our two cats sleeps next to me on her own pillow I put on our ceder chest!<br>  We have quit a crew and love them dearly and have never had ANY problem with our dogs or their temperament.<br>  By the way let me also mention all of my dogs are crate trained in case of any emergencies we pull them out a few times a year and set them up to make sure they are still comfortable if ever needed.|`|6ApIp7Ryaa	Well my beagle has her own bed which she goes to sleep in at night. <br>  <br>  Then about 5 minutes after we have gone to bed she decides that it's time to sleep with the humans and so hops up onto our bed.<br>  <br>  Why do we let her? Warmth, company, and she gives a good foot bath/massage.|`|Bjv0RMWHaa	in my bed .....but that is because he did when he was  a puppy, but he does have his own bed and he does relax and sleep   in it in the day vut when everyone eles goes to sleep he sleeps wih me.but  if you train them to sleep in their own bed they will. so what ever you want them to to sleep with you or own bed.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Yes they are allowed to sleep on the bed, only two of them do though (my yellow lab and one of my shepherds). <br>  <br>  The beagle likes to sleep in his dog bed (the ones that look like doggie sleeping bags).

Some think it's acceptable since dogs are part of the family.

FAf1y4Q5aa	im sure you seen this site already but www.dapperrat.com has some step by step ways to build a cage but...I think its just s expensive in most cases to build one from scratch. If you can I would deff. try E-bay I got an awsome martins cage on their for like 30 bucks!!! just wash it really well if you go that route because their are some dirty people out their...<br>  <br>  PS. you could temporarally fix the latch with some plyers and a sturdy clothes hanger...|`|II8PSRMgaa	You can get a ten gallon tank for ten dollars. you might have to improvise a lid until you can buy something else. but it will hold you over. also a big tupperwear bin can help. with holds in the lid of course. but that should only be temp|`|lv0YHuXHaa	yeah if u go to petco or petsmart they have these meatal cages that are cheap but very good. we got my rat a three story high one for forty bucks and she loved it!|`|q7HvkRpyaa	PetSmart has a 3 level wire cage that is $40. That is what I have. You could also look on Craigslist in your area. There are always people selling cages on there. Get a wire cage this time. Plastic cages don't work well for rats. They are chewers by nature and will chew through a plastic cage a week if you aren't careful. Plus wire cages provide them with better ventilation, which rats need since they are notorious for breathing problems. Good luck.|`|AA11906603	You might be able to put them into a used bird cage or aquarium with a wire mesh top that is weighted down by something heavy. Clean it well first with bleach in water. <br>  <br>  You can go to www.freecycle.com and look for postings for free stuff. I gave away a mouse cage once that way. You can also post a Wanted ad there, provided you have already given one thing away through the Website. One guy picked up an old bathroom mirror 15 minutes after I made the posting.
AraBfesHaa	Was the 10-gallon tank cycled first?<br>  That's alot of fish to put into a 10 gallon tank all at once, even if they are small.<br>  I'd be willing to bet they caused a huge ammonia spike with all that bio load the filter probably can't handle it quickly enough, and if you don't have a filter running, I'm almost positive that's the problem.  You need to get some ammonia neutralizer in there ASAP or you'll lose them all, including the mom.  Have you checked the ammonia level?  If you don't have any ammonia neutralizer, you'll have to do partial water changes quite often to keep the ammonia levels down until you can get some.<br>  And on top of that, she's probably stressed due to being moved into the other tank.  Hopefully, you took some of her old tank water with her.|`|ytGdMcQsaa	If she's old and gave that big load of fish, she might die. Maybe its just recovering from that big birth she just had too. If she looks fine, with no noticeable diseases, then it might be the birth.
TYohMrlXaa	Your fish are fine. As long as they where sealed you can use them. They might have an expiration date but other than that your good. You only have to worry about tossing it if you had an open jar for that long.|`|lwfbhYDcaa	they will just probably get a little sick thats it.|`|6gB6AAoyaa	i don't think any thing will happen just stop feeding them the old fish food and they should be fine
rMzEt909aa	Frontline or Advantage is pretty much up to you and your vet. I personally prefer Frontline, as that's all we've ever used on our animals and it worked great.<br>  Please, don't waste your money on Hartz products.  To bathe your dog, it doesn't matter what kind of shampoo you use, except you want something that is mild.  Therefore, I use Johnson's Baby Shampoo, because it's gentle and never irritates our dogs skin.  What I do is put her in the tub, and using a hand held shower (it rinses best), I make a thick lather on her, starting with her head; because if she has fleas on her, and you start to lather at the back end, the fleas will possibly go in her ears to try to get away. Then with you sitting there talking calmly to your dog, leave the heavy lather on her for 4-5 min.  (And, although this is a no tear shampoo, I try to keep the soap from her eyes and mouth.) Doing this smothers any fleas that are on your dog. I then like to rinse her really well, and if your dog has fleas, you will see the dead fleas rinsing off in the water.  YEEEEEEEESSS!!!!! This is what you want, dead fleas. <br>  As for your house, if your have carpet on your floors, you must vacuum your furniture and floors everyday, and make sure to throw away the sweeper bag away from where your dog goes outside. (A tight fitting trash can with pesticide sprayed inside would be good). <br>  the Frontline, if used per instructions, is the only flea meds you will need, and with the daily vacuuming, this should eventually rid you of fleas indoors.  <br>  However, if your yard has lots of fleas, you can also be bringing them in the house on your clothes, as well as the dog bringing in new ones.  So, you need to spray your yard really well with Svin or some other reliable pesticide. <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps you as well as it did me and my dog.|`|LCQCWWnoaa	Use whatever your vet recommends - although i'd be careful w/ puppies sensitive skin, but I like frontline personally :D|`|8zWYFv6Maa	Frontline but i use advantage. just dont use Hartz!|`|2Xnct3Mcaa	frontline is good for fleas|`|luF9S01iaa	Well  there is this special soap that you can use on it|`|KuNqTpDTaa	advantix is better than frontline|`|AzJ8t1ZTaa	To really get rid of fleas, you have to disrupt their life cycle. Fleas thrive in moist, humid environments--that's why they're a much bigger problem in the summer than in winter,<br>  <br>  Different vets like to use different products for controlling fleas. The most popular choices generally include spot-ons, which are dabbed between a dog's shoulder blades each month; pills, which are also effective for a month; and sprays for the yard, which can work for up to three months.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/flea-control.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/flea-control.html</a>|`|sMbDtz9yaa	You can always get a Professional to treat the yard for the fleas, but i would suggest something else first.  I would recommend Advantage for your puppy! I really like the product and it works for a whole month. Just make sure that you bathe before you put it on, and don't wash her until you need to re-apply the product :) That should take care of any flea that jumps on her, from the house or the yard! |`|8tJPK69iaa	Put her on a regular flea medication like frontline. If she has missed enough of her interceptor the vet may want her checked again. You cannot skip those. As for the house, I'm sorry I've never had that problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|tvlELUloaa	Frontline is the best but you might want to bomb your house too they get everywhere|`|xXPIH9rEaa	frontline is amazing i use it on my dog(= just make sure to put it behind his head so he can't eat it lol(: and to definitely ask you're vet about which type to use and how often to do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped good luck with your puppy!|`|4higWvgaaa	Talk to your vet about the fleas, and call an exterminator for the fleas.  No excuse, these days, for dogs to have fleas.    BTW, Hartz products are crap.|`|PfmXPbFpaa	We used the Hartz flea bath on my kittens and then applied Frontline on them the next week - the combination was amazing.  <br>  <br>  You are not supposed to give baths 48 hrs before or after you apply Frontline.<br>  <br>  However, next month I'm going to ask my vet about switching to Revolution, because it also protects against worms and ear mites.<br>  <br>  In order to keep the fleas under control, you will need to keep up the treatment for at least 6 months (this is because flea pupae can stay safe in their little cocoon for that long, this stage is impervious to chemicals/sprays).|`|X4NIyjUkaa	ya i would use front line because it rocks at getting rd of fleas.the fleas are parting and them they just pack their bags and leave.o oops i meant to help.
4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	I think you mean "spurs". No, they aren't painful for them--its just dead skin, but you also don't want them to get too long or it could accidentally rip the pad open.<br>  <br>  They can be clipped with regular human toenail clippers or blunt-tipped cuticle scissors. Clip it close enough to the pad so that there's no "flap" left that could possibly catch on something & tear open. This would set the piggie up for infection. Some people advocate soaking the feet for a little while to soften the skin prior to clipping.  I lightly wipe the foot pad with water diluted iodine when I'm done clipping to cleanse the area.<br>  <br>  If you are afraid to clip them, you should see an exotics vet and have the vet tech do it.|`|nPdKJyK4aa	I agree its better to be safe than sorry.

o93EwErKaa	Yes, I have heard of it.  This will speed up movement of any foreign object. The safest and most effective lubricant is Vaseline. The Vaseline dose is 1 tablespoon per 10 lbs. Place it on the roof of your pet's mouth.|`|xi9amEG2aa	That doesn't sound like it would be a good idea.  I would call a different vet to see what they say.|`|JRqzkUxUaa	Yes I have heard of this. My friend's dog swallowed something (I forget now what it was, I think a piece of a toy), and the vet told her to feed her dog Vaseline.

I use olive oil just bout a cap full for big dogs and half cap for small dogs it works|`|lTsDwY9Paa	No and I'd call a different vet for a second opinion. Vaseline should never be ingested.|`|3p3otDlXaa	Nope, but plastic isn't good for anything.|`|jzKS5pxkaa	well no i havent and my mom IS a vet she talks about it all the time and since he swallowed a straw clearly its already been too long to make him throw it up i actually dont think a straw will cause damage what knd of straw was it?|`|izO5Khy7aa	it is a green tub that says vaseline on the box you can find it at any pharmacy|`|TM1mTj3kaa	yes i did but my dog passed a barbie arm without it

3LXbUg1raa	I'll give you a start on what's wrong...<br>  <br>  First, on the second line the phrase "soft and as smooth as silk, hanging freely" needs to be moved near the word 'forelock' because as it is now, it is modifying the word 'eyes' instead.<br>  <br>  Also, you start your essay rather abruptly...you may want to 'ease' into your main subject a little more...I'm not sure what your actual instructions are for your essay, but if it is to be like a normal essay, you would want to start with a good opening paragraph that will introduce your audience to your main subject and give them a feel for what you will be covering in the body of your essay.  In the next several paragraphs, you would go into the specific details of what you mentioned in the first paragraph and expand on those details.  Then, you will want to tie everything together in a conclusive paragraph. <br>  <br>  The line "Eyes relaxed and calm with a soft gentle feeling" is not a complete sentence. <br>  <br>   "Sticking my fingers in her mouth feeling the bumpy texture of her teeth with my thumbs"- what?  It is more of a phrase than a sentence.  Also, you may want to reword "raised high."  It sounds awkward at best.<br>  <br>  "Her neck is long and wide, chestnut all around except for a splash of dirty white like pond in the middle of a desert." -this sentence is incorrect as it stands.  You could say "...wide, with chestnut..." or do something like "...wide.  It is chestnut..."  Either way, as it stands now, it is grammatically incorrect.<br>  <br>  That's about as far as I've read.  What you have is basically the body of the essay.  You have no introduction paragraph and no conclusion.  The paragraphs that you do have aren't very clear cut so to speak.  You'd have better luck if you'd break your horse into sections such as the front end, middle, and hind quarters...You could either write about the legs in their own section, or put the front legs in with the front end section and the back legs in with the hind quarters section.  Each section is a new paragraph, and each paragraph should 'flow' into the next.  Then, the final paragraph should tie everything together and be your concluding paragraph.  <br>  <br>  I'd say you still have some work to do.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	instead of butt..<br>  say "rump" because if it is an essay, your teacher won't love the word butt.<br>  Sounds good other than that!  I really like it!|`|Sv99BNlEaa	i like it! you have wonderful descriptions and i can really understand that you "showed" me instead of "told" me, which is really good! only thing i would change is, (if youre trying to make this a formal piece of writing) that "butt" isnt very formal. you could try using a less...ooh how do i put this...common name for butt. like technical horse term. other than that i think its very well written!
oACF40HYaa	What you describe is called flecking. It is an excess of melanin in the bird. Melanin is the material that decides how dark the birds feathering is and the colour. There is nothing wrong with the bird in any way. When birds are paired up to produce larger spots for showing, a disadvantage is that sometimes you get an excess of melanin appearing as flecking. Flecking varies from small spots to the birds forehead being almost completely black. In show birds it is a fault. |`|ZXHXrTiDaa	that is natural  it is part of i'ts plumage <br>  one of my bugies has them like that her name is pitree|`|dd29142df42d00c2832dc987bcd6b003aa	 Those are neither organisms nor stains,they are merely scattered feathers of a dark shade,need not loose sleep over it,many budgies do have them ,a lot of variation in plumage is seen ,more so on close inspection as one would do with a few pet birds.<br>  I have many pairs of budgies in an outdoor aviary & many smaller variations go un noticed .

Dogs can also have seizures, which should be checked out by a vet, but most likely your little puppy is just having some wild dreams.|`|AA11887983	I think they have dreams.  There is speculation that dreams in humans are just chemical reactions in the brain. Dogs have similar chemicals, so they may have dreams too.

Try positive reinforcement techniques instead ( eg. if she's doing something bad, like chewing on shoes, show her acceptable behaviour, like chewing on her toys and praise her lots for it ).|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Training|`|FsozOO6Zaa	Why would you sell your dog? And all animals deserve love. And why do you have to train your dog? It is a waste of money, when all they really need to know is "SIT"...unless you want to showoff and show what your dog can do, which isnt really a big deal at all so why train it. But you can try teaching your dog yourself...|`|ydshiNrKaa	You should d) train her !  Don't don't automatically respond to you, they need to be trained.  If you don't know how to do this, get some help from a professional.|`|AA10265922	give it lots of love and attention,sit and 'talk' with it for hours,give it time,YOU have to show it you love it<if you don't may as well get rid of it|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You should seek a professional animal behaviorist/trainer.

It all depends on how old your dog is. If your dog is young, take it to a professional trainer, not PetSmart. Look into finding a local professional, they do the best work. Giving a dog more love, when they are stubborn will only make it harder. Give them more love later when they are respondent. Otherwise you'll have problems.|`|ClQoSrMmaa	ummm C but you need to add more detail...<br>  <br>  1) leave her 'accidentally' at a zoo without a collar in the monkey cage<br>  <br>  2) ship her to Japan with a love note that says 'to my sweetheart...to bad you didn't love me, so now put up with all the c*** this dog has left in the box)<br>  <br>  3) sell her on eBay|`|ohHKylkPaa	i say A and B cuz if there your dog you prolly love them and dont wanna sell them but you should definitly be giving your dog TONS of love. And if theyre not responding so well i think you should give pet Smart training a try before you sell her<br>   hope i helped :-)|`|2pEKV27Laa	call the dog whisperer lol jk, i would have to say both A and B, dogs take time to gain awareness of your demands. Just give it a little patience and your dog will do pretty much whatever you say, unless you have a beagle like mine lol|`|T6SPad3Haa	try a different method of training, put her to work more and do it on a leash.<br>  A dog school or training school can teach you how to command your dog.<br>  <br>  Try positive reinforcement of treats but don't spoil her!|`|jAZ8UruEaa	if you mean she's not listening, try more interaction and affection, yet establish that you are alpha. there's tons of stuff on the internet about establishing alpha status.|`|XohJPdfTaa	I know how this is with my dog you have to give him extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra love give him alot of treats (they love puperoni).|`|Jp6qXWeYaa	It depends on how old she is, if she's still a puppy then it takes time to get a response from her, but all in all I think that training should help.

ydshiNrKaa	They will both eventually get over it and bond with their new owners.

And also unless they were left alone together for long periods of time, and the one left will continue to be alone a lot.

P2yRAWiJaa	So you live with a backyard breeder that doesn't know what to do and is looking to make money off of you. <br>  <br>  Ask questions.  Will you be inside or outside?  Will you be utd on vaccinations?  Will you be spayed/neutered to prevent unwanted pups? Will you receive basic training? Do the new owners rent or own?  Married, children? Will they agree to bring you back if they can't keep you?|`|pvQ9OXiOaa	I believe you would want an owner that is a match of you, in human form. Same energy level...willing to help you in all your trials, and very patient.<br>  <br>  You'll want someone to take you to the vet asap and continue with your puppy boosters. You will want to be spayed/neutered to prevent any health problem or messy mishaps in the future.<br>  <br>  Most of all you want an owner that is ready for a lifelong commitment!|`|n560blqraa	You need to look for people who adore animals and have a lot of love to give. Someone who wants to have not just a pet, but a family member to love, respect and cherish till the end of time. An individual who will be financially responsible for a dogs health, and needs. <br>  <br>  Someone who would never hurt or abuse them in any way.<br>  <br>  Lastly, someone who acknowledges the importance of every bit of love,tenderness, and respect that you show a dog will come back to you 100x over.<br>  <br>  My girls (one German Shepherd,one Sheltie) are the light of my life.<br>  I could not imagine a day without them in it. They bring me enormous amounts of joy and laughter, and when I am sad they lick the tears from my eyes. They are precious in every way!|`|LtxNbyGQaa	Dont give them to public beacuse you never know whats going on in the naborhood.but u can give it to your friends,family,or others who you trust|`|OyOQES3paa	look for someone who has had experience with animals but doesn't own too many and might neglect the puppy. also if they have kids that's sometimes good cuz they will know how to be responsible with taking care of someone or something. look for animal lovers.

wd5zHEq7aa	You really need to train your dog and get im used to being alone, he is acting like he dominates you. You should start by leaving him alone for a couple of minutes at a time and praising him when you come back in, then increase the time. If he is getting untrustworthy then stop picking him up and train him to go where you tell him. It sounds like whilst you have tried to relieve his anxiety you have unwittingly escalated the problem. You need to act soon as it will only get worse, but it will take a lot of time and patience. Good luck

A lot of ferret diseases can be treated if caught early enough.<br>  <br>  If he seems to act more lethargic then normal its a good idea to have him see a vet. But if his poop is normal sized, normal color, he's eating and drinking well, and moving around in his cage..he's just a slower ferret, not ever ferret gets excited about a sock being flung across the room.|`|30eSQJE0aa	If he hasn't had a "fat" phase yet, this might be it.  Ferrets gain up to 30% of their weight in the winter season, and they lose it in the spring.  Young ferrets from large breeders, that may have been born in an odd season, will get pudgy a bit too early or a bit too late, depending on their age.  One surefire way to tell is by looking at his fur - is it longer, fluffier, and thicker?  Then he's definitely in his winter fluff and pudge.  Give him lots of food, lots of rest, and play with your other ferret more because your tubby one will be too busy sleeping.  If it really is his winter "slow-down" time, he'll lose all that weight in only a few months and be back to normal, even a bit hyper as his metabolism speeds up.|`|OGbxnRkjaa	Ferrets sleep A LOT.

nLmk1J7Xaa	Well, there are many things needed. And you don't absolutly need tack if the owner is letting you borrow their tack. But if they aren't then yes, and the right fitting tack to! Yes, you will need riding boots and definately a helmet! Brushes are important to. Well, it wouldn't hurt to get some fly spray and treats. And I find the best brand of fly spray is: Bronco. And treats, it doesn't really matter what kind. <br>  <br>  Well, that is a tough question. And that would be something to ask her ahead of time, if you can do that. It really all depends, if you ask her and she says that she would like you to ask her then you ask her. But if you ask her and she says you can do whatever, then you don't need to ask her when you go and do it.<br>  <br>  LOL! Well, I'm not really sure, I have never leased a horse, alothough my best friend has. So I don't know on that one. But I would think that you might only have to pay half of that or none, because it is her/his horse and at her/his barn (right?), so if that is correct then I don't think you should have to pay!<br>  <br>  Well, that is a very good question. There are so many ways to go about it. If you know of anyone or any barns near you, go and them. But if not then you go on the internet (ie. Google or Blackle it), then these are websites that would be good to search for that: horsetopia.com  --  horseville.com  --  Equnie Now!  --  EquineHits.com  -----> those are good sites and you just go on advanced search and fill that in!<br>  <br>  I know what you mean. Just ignore all rude comments, some people on here are very rude. But good luck in finding a good leasing horse. And I hope you have a good time! Hope this helpes and Good Luck! |`|WJJMZ9IQaa	-What things do I need if I lease? I'm assuming the tack is provided..? <br>  I know ill need riding boots, a helmet, and breeches. I have brushes already. Anything else I'll be needing? Can you link to brands and stuff please =) <br>  ANSWER: you need all riding clothes, brushes, a crop, shampoo and conditioner, a first aid kit, money, and someone to help you (like an instructor). I would go with tuffrider and devon-aire. If you can afford it then get some ariat<br>  <br>  -Also, for example, If I wanted to go trail riding with a friend at her house and maybe stay over night. Would I have to ask the people who own the horse If I could go, or would it be like my own horse where I could just show, ride, etc wherever and whenever I want? (srry if that's abit confusing.)<br>  <br>  ANSWER: it really depends on the the person leasing it to you, you might not be allowed to at all, you might be allowed to but only with permission, and you might be allowed to without permission.<br>  <br>  -If the boarding fee around here is 300-400 per month for a full board, around how much do you think a full lease would cost (srry, im a total leasing newb, i know ^^;) <br>  <br>  ANSWER: it depends on the horse, anywhere from $200-$1,000<br>  <br>  -How do I go about finding a horse to lease ._. <br>  <br>  ANSWER: Go to a website like dreamhorse.com|`|Y17bQKniaa	<a href="http://www.bestfriends.org/theanimals/pdfs/horses/readyforahorse.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestfriends.org/theanimals/pd...</a>|`|S9hcQnYVaa	how i know|`|709KrOHxaa	1. When you lease a horse, the only thing that is provided is the horse.<br>  2. Once you sign the lease, you do not have to ask the owners if you can take the horse anywhere because you basically have "custody" of it. lol. <br>  3.I know all the leases I have ever seen have been free... sometimes people charge but it is not a whole lot, maybe a couple hundred. <br>  4. Look in horse magazines that are from your area (I dont know where you are from so I can't help you much), you know, the magazines that sell horses. Also in the news paper. There will be listings for horses for lease. <br>  <br>  Good luck!! Horses are great :)|`|ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	Usually, the leasing contract outlines all of your questions.  Every owner is different.  Some will give you tack to use, some will ask that you use your own tack.  Some people will let you take the horse to your property, shows, etc., and some will insist the horse stay on their grounds at all times.  It all depends on the owner and what terms they want to set.  <br>  <br>  In my area, a full 7-day a week lease is equal to the cost of board.  A half lease, which is either 3 or 4 days a week, is usually 1/2 the cost of board.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|xL9EpNctaa	DONT ASSUME ANYTHING! You need to ask the owner what all the lease is going to include. Usually you are responsible for 1/2 of everything; vets, food, boarding, etc. If they do not have tack you will need to provide your own. Get everything in writing in the contract up front so there are no surprises. |`|enYbGKrQaa	hello if youre leasing the horse then its yours while your paying for it do whatever you want with it|`|4SisMoiAaa	im sorry but i know nothing about horses|`|oHdqiKDwaa	feed holder,feed scoopes,stall muking stuff,horse shampoo.....go to horse.com|`|j50a803oaa	-never assume that the horse comes with tack ask the owner about that <br>  <br>  -for trail riding and things like that it depends on the lease like if you have a full on the horse you should be able to take it of the property( but i would always tell the owner where you where taking there horse) but if you half lease a horse you would have to check with the owner and make sure you can ride with your friends and bring him/her to shows<br>  <br>  -when i half leased a horse it cost 200 a month but when i full leased a horse it costed about 300 a month. but it really depends on the owner and the horse you want to lease because everyone has a different price<br>  <br>  - here are a few site for leasing you can loook at but u have to fill out the info though<br>  <br>  -<a href="http://www.equinehits.com/horses_search.php-" rel="nofollow">http://www.equinehits.com/horses_search....</a><br>  <br>  -<a href="http://www.horseville.com/php/horses-for-lease.php-" rel="nofollow">http://www.horseville.com/php/horses-for...</a><br>  <br>  -<a href="http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/home.cfm/horses.html-" rel="nofollow">http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/hom...</a><br>  <br>  those r just a few but ull have to find the boxes that say for sale or for lease and make sure u pick that one|`|wjJjthHvaa	Regarding tack, you might be surprised to find that a lot of leases do not include tack.  I've had a personal experience with a lease that didn't involve tack being included in the contract. I leased from August to December of last year, and had never been offered any tack, so I had to use the tack I already owned from my late gelding.  The best thing to do is ask the owner of the horse you plan to lease,   They might tell you that tack is included, or request that you get your own according to their specifications (i.e. a specific bit or something)  The best thing to do is ask prior to the contact being written.<br>  <br>  As far as transporting the horse off the property for a trail or an overnight stay, you would again have to ask the horse's owners prior to writing the contract.  In my own experience, I laid everything out on the table, told the owner of the mare I wanted to lease that I'd love to be able to trailer off-property, and there were some requirements for me to do so (i.e. trailer only in an insured vehicle, etc.)  Talk to the owners, see if they're game about that kind of thing, or if they would rather the horse remained on the property.<br>  <br>  If you want to full lease a horse, and board will run between $300-400, then you can expect to pay $300-400 plus all expenses involving farrier, vet, etc.  A full lease is basically being financially responsible for the horse, without holding any ownership of it.  You have pretty much 24/7 access to the horse, and therefore the owners wouldn't have any expenses. Basically a full lease is being 100% responsible for all of the horse's maintenance costs.  That's also presuming that you're getting a free lease  (i.e. a lease without an additional fee to be paid for the year, which is usually about 10% of a horse's sale cost and then divide that by 12 for the monthly costs.)  I'd probably say for a free lease with a board of $400, and a horse that wears, say, front shoes, it could possibly cost you $500 or more a month, depending.<br>  <br>  That said, if you were interested more in share-boarding or part-leasing, you'd be getting the chance to ride the horse a few times a week, and that could also be a varying cost, depending if the owner has a set monthly fee, or if they want you to say, pay half the board and half the farrier costs.  When I half-leased a horse, I ended up paying a flat rate of $200 a month, which was half the board, and half farrier costs, more or less in exchange for riding 4 days a week.<br>  <br>  As for finding horses for lease, ask around.  I found mine at the barn I boarded my gelding at before he passed away.  Check the bulletin boards at the feed stores too, and talk to friends who have horses.  Word of mouth helps a lot.
RloOJ43haa	You can get Ovation boots for that price. |`|6GehblM3aa	I'd recommend ariat or devon-aire...I had devon-aires for a while (then my calf got too big and they don't fit...I'm still so mad).

If you are on that tight a budget and don't show, I'd spend my money buying a good pair of Ariat paddock boots and some cheap Barn-Stable half chaps.  <br>  <br>  Dover Saddlery sells both.  If you watch for a sale or do some comparison shopping you can find them for around $150 for the two.  They'll get you exactly the same thing function wise and if well cared for will last five to ten years.  They are also more comfortable than tall boots.<br>  <br>  Any tall boots worth having are way more than $150.  Don't waste your money on cheap crap you will have to replace six months from now.  It will cost you more in the long run.|`|8i73lpwgaa	I loooove my ariat boots. I got my paddock boots from them for about $100.

Anyway, we know the people now and they're having one of the siamesey kittens and calling her Tia because it's like Thai.

This is commonly used in cats and dogs.  It's a tini chip implanted just below the surfacwe of the skin at the base of the neck.  It is painless.  My pets have this.   The types you can get vary.  There are GPS and then ones that only register if your pet is lost and they are scanned.  I would talk to your cat's vet for more info.  And while GPS in the collar is a great idea, cats are prone to losing their collars on braches and stuff.|`|H08vPJ2Maa	That would be quite cool!

I'm just going to give some questions that you should ask to yourself. First, do you really think that you can imagine your dog in someone else's hands? Second, if you really love him and he loves you, why should you give it away? Third, is it a good idea to give a dog away just because it's a hassle? Fourth, even if you can't spend a lot of time with him, wouldn't it be even worse if you had to give him away and didn't spend any time with him at all? Just think this over and I hope you make the right choice.|`|C0yErs0Uaa	If you really can't take care of your dog, start looking for a home NOW. It's going to take a while before you find a good home for your dog, so startlooking early! if you put it off you might be forced to take it to the shelter and we don't want that to happen. <br>  Try looking at different options though. I suggest looking up some dog day care centers or kennels in your area. (there are TON of those doggy day cares where I live and it's not hard to find one at ag ood price). You can drop off your dog before you go to work, and pick him up afterwards. Your dog will be able to spend the day with other dogs, and you won't have to leave him home alone all the time and you'll know your dog is being well taken care of. My dog has so much fun when I takeher, and when I pick her up at the end of the day she's tired from playing all day and goes right to sleep. Try it! That way you can keep your dog! But if you decide to send her to a doggy place, make sure you do your homework! Look up serveral places, visit the centers in person, etc. There are some articles floating around the net on how to pick the write day care for your dog. Good luck!|`|UTw3QefOaa	Oh I hate giving animals as gifts.  That's the worst idea ever.  But you have some hope.  It sounds like you know that maybe your dog would be better off with a loving family, maybe with kids, or a big yard, or whatever.  It doesn't sound like you're mistreating your dog, and that you do like him, but maybe you were never ready for the level of commitment.  <br>  <br>  You should go on www.petfinder.com and search for animal shelters in your area.  There's only 8 states left that have kill shelters, but you still have to be careful that you're not one of those states.  If you surrender him to an adoption agency or an animal shelter, you may have to pay a surrendering fee, but that's to ensure the dog will get proper care.  <br>  <br>  It's an unfortunate case but it sounds like you are making a mature, well thought out decision.|`|iBfA6qXCaa	if he has some problems you could have him professioanlly trained. just like in a relationship, each partner has to put in thier effort, think of it this way, dogs are dumb.....so if he is doing something that irritates you its your fault becuase you haven't trained him to do otherwise. if he is doing something that irritates you need to show him and train him. thats a divorce mentality.  dogs  eat , drink, pee, poop,love , play and sleep. if you want him to do anything else you need to train him.if you don't have the patience to do it, your not a pet person and don't ever get a pet again. they sell dog statues at the mall, put it  by  your door and buy an electronic dog barker, so it will bark when someone is at the door. |`|nN5o4djIaa	Well seeing that you're using the word "rid" in your statement I would say to you find that poor dog a new home.

Dogs are happy as long as you give them some attention - any thing (including kids) can be a hassle, but some things are worth being a hassle (like a dog) as they give you unconditional love. Just my opinion.|`|2Mug8KaBaa	Before you get rid of him, you need to make sure that you don't have any time you could be making for him.  At times we get so busy even at home we don't sit down and pay attention to our animals like we should... even if you play with him while you're watching tv!  If you HAVE to get rid of him, try to give him to someone you know would give him a loving home!

Z0v6G0Kgaa	1.  The website www.dogfoodanalysis.com will give you objective evaluations of dog food.  Aim for a 5 or 6 star rated food.<br>  <br>  2.  Generally speaking, foods that are high in protein with no grains or corn will produce smaller turds because the dog will convert more of it to use (and produce less waste).  The way this was explained to me is that a dog's gut or intestine is shorter than a human's.  So food that we (humans) would digest, dogs poop out.<br>  <br>  3.  FWIW (and I suspect this is a trait that varies with each dog), my dog poops less and has smaller turds eating Innova Evo (small bits).  Substantially so.  This is not very scientific--and other individual dogs may get different results.  But I can tell you from picking up my dog's turds, they're smaller when he eats Evo (I rotate food every couple of months to avoid allergies).|`|EwNstMcwaa	A natural raw diet.

He should still be fed puppy food for the added nutrition. Feed him the puppy food for the first year. In some larger breeds even into the second year.

AzJ8t1ZTaa	The key to rock-solid housetraining is to start the day your pup comes home and stick with the program. Using a crate is the easiest method. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/housetraining-for-puppies.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/housetraining-for-pup...</a>|`|AA11729393	Buy some puppy traing mats you can use these outside or inside, or there is drops u can buy that you sprinkle on the ground whre you want puppy to go and let him smell it.  When taking the dog outside do it every 20 minutes and take him out on a lead, take him to the same spot over and over again when takig him out and stand there until hes done.It may take you 10 minutes or longer, when taking him to the same spot i tell our puppy go to the toilet and when she goes we give her the biggest praise 4 going! our puupy generally poops 10 mins after peeing so you may need out stand there longer, we have a golden retriever puppy at moment it took 2 weeks of persivrence of doing this but now she comes inside and runs out herself goes where she was trained to go and comes back inside! good luck :)  Try my advice we have used it all our 3 dogs and works very quickly!|`|LCQCWWnoaa	Patience is key! Just keep working w/ him! Some breeds are notoriously hard to potty train, so just hang in there :D|`|uNrf8CHKaa	My Chihuahua has the same problem! She is house trained & will come & tell me when she has to pee but her problem is she doesn't like the cold or the rain. Could this be why? She WONT go pee outside when its cold or raining, won't even ask us to go either. She is very stubborn. Some dogs need to be rewarded. We use a treat system with her. Because she can understand what 'pee' 'outside' & 'treat' means it is a little easier for her. She now knows if she pees outside she will get a treat as soon as she is done. Takes time a patience but I recommend buying say 'pupperoni sticks' cutting them up nice & small & leaving the jar or bag by the door. Let your dog outside every hour to two hours max especially in the beginning & reward him when he has done what you've wanted him to do. When you're not home crate him he will not want to pee in him own bed unless of course you've crated him for too long. It is also a good idea to do this at night because when you can't watch him he will pee on the floor & with him getting away with it at night he would continue to do so. Good luck!|`|1qPy275Baa	Puppies need routine. What has worked for us is knowing that after each meal it takes approximately 20 minutes before they'll need to go to the washroom.So 20 minutes after each meal we'd take them outside and then make a big deal when they went.<br>  <br>  Another thing  we did that helped was using newspapers. Many puppies are used to going on newspapers either because the breeder used it to line their crate or because they have a certain appeal to them. Either way we would put down paper close to the door so they would get used to heading in that direction. Eventually we'd move the paper outside and they would then associate the act of 'going' with being outside.<br>  <br>  Good luck and be patient - it definitely gets better.<br>  Ann-Marie Fleming<br>  <a href="http://www.k9kloud9.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.k9kloud9.com</a> | <a href="http://www.DogQuality.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.DogQuality.com</a>|`|8zWYFv6Maa	persistence. be patient!

Instead of being online, take the dog to the emergency vet's, right now!|`|4a73767a5f54ac9f1a8d6b2ed34c56bbaa	As previous posters have noted, this is most likely an allergic reaction, whether to the fire ants (most likely culprit), or something else you're not aware of.  But you do need to get the little guy to the vet's ASAP, as an allergic reaction this severe may cause a swelling in the throat/windpipe, causing respiratory difficulties.  Call the vet, at least,  and ask if you should administer some Benadryl or other antihistamine.<br>  Best luck!|`|C0yErs0Uaa	was your dog vaccinated recently? it could be a sign of side effect to vaccines, or an allergy reaction something.

zTeLhroWaa	I just keep mine in a tupperware container with a UTH underneath.  They breed/grow faster with the heat. I put a paper towel in that covers 1/3 of the area and that's where I put the fresh food or Flukers Orange cube..whatever I have handy.  <br>  <br>  I have no idea where the beatles lay their eggs but I think it must have been in the substrate (which is mostly rolled oats).  The first time I tried this I changed the substrate and subsequently lost all of the eggs/baby mealworms.  I never changed the substrate in my second colony.  I only added to it when it looked low.  I have a thriving colony now with thousands of little mealworms.  Some people say they'll lay their eggs on the paper towel, too, but I'm not sure mine did.  Then again, I'm not sure mine didn't either...<br>  <br>  Since they're so small it's almost impossible to tell.  If you don't change their bedding, you'll be fine.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Just do as the other poster mentioned and leave the substrate alone. I just keep adding to mine when I need too and stir the old around and mix it with the new. I use sweet potatoes in mine for moisture. Just cut them in piece and drop them in. They are easy to pick out when they have been used up and then just put more in. Remember to keep them warm as they do much better. I have never used the paper towels in mine|`|6q79ZU5Iaa	Raising mealworms is REALLY easy. <br>   Just fill a container (margarine tub,plastic shoebox...whatever's handy) about 1/3 of the way with wheat or oat bran (this is their bedding and their food) Throw in a baby carrot or chunk of potato for a source of water(peeled works the best) and your mealworms (I'd start with at least 50) and wait a couple of months.Replace the carrot/potato as needed and add a little more bran if it needs it.  <br>  The mealworms will become pupa and then turn into darkling beetles which will lay eggs in the bedding for about a month before dying. <br>  The babies are really tiny and you won't see them but believe me..they are there. =)<br>   To grow the fastest you can keep them at temperatures in the low 80's but they will breed and grow at lower temps. <br>   Good luck!!|`|o66jqnraaa	take dirt like from wal-mart the cheap stuff but it cant have bug killers in it and just keep it moist and they love that stuff for laying eggs.

The shelter near me charges $35 and that includes the spay or neuter.

They don't generally like to be handled and they are not afraid to let you know either. Some can be very nippy (most aren't) and it hurts when they bite. They need a lot of out of cage time.

Then your weekily things like food,hay and treats. <br>  <br>  Luckily with rabbits they make toys out of everything old cardboard boxes they will find things around your house. When you first get your bunny look at what he likes to doeg, chew,throw athings around, hide,climb then make toys accordingly. So toys dont really cost alot although you can buy some.<br>  <br>  The most exepensive part of owning a rabbit is the vet bills so getting pet insurance is the best option. <br>  <br>  House rabbits actually cost less in the long term, you dont have to buy a hutch which can be over ￡100 or you dont need to buy a run or huge amounts of sawdust, hay and straw.<br>  <br>  I have a outdoor rabbit you spends the day inside and in the ummer plays in the gardedn and sleeps outside in the night.

Try to stay away from pet stores.  Look in the shelters or for a breeder.  I wouldn't worry about the breed so much but dwarfs tend to be more skittish.<br>  <br>  Housing can get pricey depends on what you do.  Pet store cages are honestly too small for most rabbits.  If you do get a store bought cage get the biggest you can possibly get.  I have no idea how much those even cost.  You can build a pen out of storage cubes.  It's less expensive and you can build them bigger than bought cages.  You can also make them to fit your space.<br>  <br>  Your rabbit will need to be neutered.  Male rabbits tend to spray when they mature.  It's foul and trust me, you won't want to deal with that in your house.  It will also make the rabbit more calm, less territorial and easier to handle.  Since you have kids this is a good thing.  Females have a high rate of uterine cancer so spaying is best.<br>  <br>  If you get a shelter bun then that will most likely be taken care of.  <br>  <br>  Spay/neuter prices vary depending on where you live.  I had both of my rabbits taken care of at the same time and paid $270.  Of course, that didn't include the initial well exam.<br>  <br>  It can get pricey but if you know what your getting into then it's worth it.  I don't really recommend rabbits as pets for smaller kids (you didn't mention how old your's are).  Just please be sure to do your research and be prepared to take care of it 100% if you're kids can't.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|l7kyxFsLaa	You can get a good french lop earred rabbit for about ￡35<br>  <br>  These are the most friendliest and cute|`|BY0cV4kRaa	Between ￡25- ￡30
339NqJ84aa	Fur is a deadly luxury that animals can't afford. They are killed not out of necessity (for example to keep people warm: synthetic materials are warmer and cheaper), but for money and fashion - to make $10,000 mink coats, fur collars and frivolous fashion accessories. Most fur-bearing animals are raised in fur mills, kept in wire cages with as many as 100,000 "livestock" in a single facility. Trapped in cages, wild fur-bearing animals are denied their most basic natural behaviors. After a life of confinement, farmers commonly break their necks or insert an electrified rod in their anus or vagina, literally frying them from the inside out. <br>  <br>  Millions of coyote, raccoon, bobcats and other species are caught in the wild using spring traps with metal teeth that smash bone and crush muscle. Animals can linger in excruciating pain for days without food or water before a trapper kills them. About one quarter of trapped animals escape by chewing their own limbs off. <br>  <br>  An estimated two million cats and dogs are also killed for fur every year. Recent investigations into the Chinese fur industry document cats and dogs being skinned alive, their eyes still blinking and heartbeats visible beneath exposed ribcages. Consumers have no way of knowing whether they are buying dog or cat fur because these products - jacket collars, gloves, hats and toys - are almost always deliberately unlabeled or mislabeled. Animals pay the true price of fur with their lives.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.furkills.org/true_price_of_fur.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.furkills.org/true_price_of_fu...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  FUR FACTS<br>  The Price of Fur<br>  The real price of fur must be measured in deaths--not dollars. To make one fur coat you must kill at least fifty-five wild mink, thirty-five ranched mink, forty sables, eleven lynx, eighteen red foxes, eleven silver foxes, one hundred chinchillas, thirty rex rabbits, nine beavers, thirty muskrats, fifteen bobcats, twenty-five skunks, fourteen otters, one hundred twenty-five ermines, thirty possums, one hundred squirrels, or twenty-seven raccoons.<br>  <br>  A Dying Industry<br>  Every year, the well-organized fur trade spends millions of dollars to glamorize fur coats and accessories and to mask the real price of fur: pain, mutilation, and death for millions of animals. But as more people learn the truth about fur, growing numbers of furriers are going bankrupt. Less practical than alternatives and increasingly seen as offensive, the status of fur is status is slipping. Saga, a Norwegian fur manufacturer, in a bleak attempt to bring fur back in fashion, resorted to giving fur to students to work with in hopes of breeding a new generation of furriers. <br>  <br>  The fur industry, which once only included the price of full-length coats in their numbers, has resorted to including fur storage and trim in their statistics to beef up sales reports. Actual fur sales decreased from $1.35 billion in 1990 to $648 million in 1993. The number of U.S. retail locations in 1993 alone fell from 192 to 46, and fur apparel imports dropped a staggering 48% in 1995. A February 1994 issue of The Trapper noted that, “from Alaska to Maine the number of those trapping, fur hunting and buying fur has plummeted to the lowest level yet recorded.” This trend has already saved millions of animals--but the anguish continues for millions of others. <br>  <br>  Trapped in Agony<br>  There are several methods used to trap animals in the wild. The most common is the steel-jaw leghold trap. Animals caught in a hidden steel jaw trap suffer a slow, excruciating death. The trap snaps down on the limb of an unsuspecting animal, sometimes breaking the limb. The trapped animals often freeze to death or are attacked by predators from whom they cannot flee. Many frantically chew off their own legs to escape the agonizing pain. If they are still alive when the trapper returns to the scene, they are bludgeoned or strangled to death. The method for killing a trapped animal, as described in, "Fur Trapping: A Complete Guide," is to "Hit the trapped animal just forward of the eyes with the stick. While it is unconscious, use your knee or the heel of your shoe to come down hard behind the front leg. This ruptures the heart, and the coyote never regains consciousness."<br>  <br>  The leghold trap is not just cruel; it is also indiscriminate. Trappers discard millions of "trash animals" not wanted for their fur, including domestic pets and endangered species. Trapped animals sometimes leave behind dependent young who are doomed to starvation, adding to the death toll for each coat. Companion animals, such as dogs and cats, have been trapped and killed after wandering into a trap.<br>  <br>  The Horror of the Ranch<br>  Animals raised on ranches are kept in cramped confinement and deprived of anything resembling a natural life, until finally they are killed, often by crude and painful means. Methods used include gassing, suffocation, or electrocution through the mouth and anus so that the “product”—the pelt—is not singed or stained with blood. Far from being “humane,” fur ranching is characterized by barren wire-mesh cages, isolation, and environmental deprivation so intense that animals often go insane, as animals used to roaming 15 miles each day go crazy from life in a cage. Animals are forced to endure all weather extremes, and veterinary care is typically non-existent since it is not cost effective to treat an animal whose fate is to be turned into a coat. Animals who are naturally solitary are caged together, often resulting in cannibalism, and animals are often left to decompose in cages with live animals. <br>  <br>  Environmental Devistation<br>  Nothing Natural about Fur<br>  In the face of causing such notorious, unnecessary cruelty to animals, furriers desperate for positive things to say about their product often resort to the claim that furs are “natural.” In fact, turning an animal’s skin into a coat involves preserving it with toxic chemicals, such as formaldehyde—a known carcinogen—in order to keep the carcass from decaying. <br>  <br>  Furriers also claim that fur trapping is a necessary tool for wildlife management. However, trapping as a commercial enterprise can never be a wildlife management strategy. Proper wildlife management needs to be based on highly specific local circumstances, recognizing the delicate balance of a particular ecosystem. But the book "Fur Trapping: A Complete Guide" shows the true motivator for trapping—money. "The trapper should trap the fur most in demand. If bobcats bring a high of $400, as they did in 1976, he should concentrate on them." Is this wildlife management—or slaughter for profit? Wildlife populations follow natural fluctuation curves. Unchecked hunting and trapping of certain animals have disrupted these fluctuations. The furriers’ and trappers’ scientifically baseless claim that they are “managing” wildlife is a thinly disguised ploy to kill the most profitable animals. <br>  <br>  Once a symbol of glamour and success, fur is now a symbol of insensitivity, vanity, and greed. World-famous designers such as Giorgio Armani, Stella McCartney, Donna Karan, Geoffrey Beene and Calvin Klein now refuse to include fur in their collections. Leading retailers including Harrods of London and I. Magnin have stopped selling furs altogether. <br>  Each of us can make the compassionate choice to not support such unnecessary cruelty to animals and to speak out on the animals’ behalf. <br>  <br>  What You Can Do:<br>  <br>  If you’re ever in a store that you see sells real fur, please express your displeasure to the manager and ask them to stop carrying fur. To view contact information and write letters to notorious companies that sell fur, please visit www.furkills.org/wycd.html. <br>  Write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper informing consumers of the cruelty inherent in every real fur product. Learn more about the cruelty of fur at www.furkills.org. <br>  Never let anyone wearing fur pass you by without politely informing them of the cruelty of fur. <br>  Contact IDA for a supply of leaflets to distribute or leave in heavily trafficked locations. We can also send you small pocket cards to hand out to fur wearers. – <br>  Organize a protest. We can help! Contact furkills@idausa.org or visit furkills.com for more information. <br>  Persuade friends and family with fur coats to donate their coats to IDA so that we may use them in anti-fur demonstrations, or to wildlife rehabilitators, who use the fur to provide bedding for injured or orphaned wildlife. As an extra motivator, donors can write the fur donation off on their taxes.|`|zGid9wJBaa	I'LL MAKE A FUR COAT OUT OF YOU!!!!!!!<br>  THEN YOU'LL SEE WHY EVERYONE SHOULDN'T!!!!!<br>  Stop Animal Cruelty Now!<br>  <a href="http://www.aspca.org/fight-animal-cruelty/cruelty-pledge.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aspca.org/fight-animal-cruelt...</a>

There are some dogs that can fit your lifestyle. It all comes down to what suites you best. Different dogs have different qualities.

Dogs only sweat through their feet, so if you are noticing dampness anywhere else then it is NOT sweating but something else.  Shar-pei are highly prone to skin issues and pretty much all shar-pei have a genetic skin deformity called "shar-pei skin"  (no kidding!) that causes their skin to ooze, particularly if irritated (for example, if you shave their fur).  Because of this property, shar-pei can be prone to a condition called cutaneous mucinosis (see link in my source).  It could be that something is aggravating his skin and you are seeing this oozing as a result.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I used to raise and show Chinese Shar-pei. I do not remember them sweating. Is the dog panting like it is too hot? Is it drinking lots of water? Normal house temp should be fine. Take the dog to the vet for a physical exam.|`|3p3otDlXaa	It's too high. 66-69 is perfect for the average dog.
JfBzzXQ4aa	Have the vet check her thyroid. She could be be hypothyroid. This will cause her to gain weight quickly. If her thyroid is low they can put her on thyroid replacement. It's not expensive. Then you need to feed her less & exercise her more. She won't be able to run yet, esp with all that extra weight. She'll have to start out walking, lose some & build up her endurance over time. Have a serious talk with your brothers about all the extra people food. Maybe you could keep some low cal treats around they could offer her, like baby carrots or green beans. This way they would still be able to spoil her some without adding too many calories. Get her on a decent weight management food & measure her food. Feed her twice a day a set amount. No free choice feeding. If she still acts like she is starving, you can add some green beans or plain pumpkin to her food. That will help fill her up & not add many calories. Hope this helps. Good Luck.|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	We put our dog on this diet<br>  -green beans added to the dog's regular food can make a dog feel more satisfied as if it had a big meal.

Check dogfoodanalysis. Give the brothers the bag and a measuring cup. Make it a grain free food. Don't run her without the advise of your vet. To stress her with too much exercise could cause a heart attack. Start slowly. As She build up stamina and slims down she can have exercise increased.|`|UqvGKax1aa	ask a vet|`|26PPwzrWaa	Start slow with the runs. She has to get used to the exercise slowly or you risk injury. <br>  <br>  Feed less of her food. If your brothers want to feed other foods, cut back her other food. <br>  <br>  And I think I need to make this clear: There is no such thing as human food. It is species appropriate food. Humans have an array of diets in the species. Some eat whale, others are herbivores. It is what the species eats, not dog food, monkey food, pig food, turkey food, etc. but meat, fruits, veggies, etc. (we tend to get those mixed with not being appropriate for other species when most diets from the millions if not billions of species on earth can not possibly eat different foods). <br>  <br>  Dogs are by science listed as carnivora and therefore are listed as carnivores. As seen with dog anatomy, they fit that listing very well: <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/2062/ana.HTML" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/2062...</a> (an article actually explaining to us with things we can see, directed towards humans going vegan, but is capably of proving dogs as carnivores). <br>  <br>  First off make sure you are feeding a good diet: <br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com</a> <br>  If you are not, the diet will not help her thrive, she will merely survive(not taking into account her genetics or environment). <br>  <br>  Food besides dog food is not bad. It is a diet choice. I feed raw because I choose to, some chose homemade others go with processed to 500 degree plus temp to feed their dogs. (kibble has only been around 60 years or so)<br>  <br>  And a little insight, the menu foods that caused dogs to die recently, every dog in the feeding trials died yet they still allowed it to go on the market. <br>  <br>  Feed a good quality diet and lower her amount if they want to feed her healthy foods on the side(if its meat or organs that is good. Grains are bad, veggies and fruits should be kept to a min. If you dont believe me feed raw carrots for a few days and take her out to go. Her waste will have orange chunks in it.

Try to explain to your brothers that she doesn't need human food at all.  Cut back on her kibble too.  Table scraps have a ton of calories compared to what dogs get in their dry food.  Try to keep in mind that you're not being mean to her by not feeding her leftovers, you are saving her life.  Good luck!|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	Purina Pro Plan has a weight management food, you can also try to add veggies to her diet (canned green beans mixed in her food will help fill her up) and tell your brothers if she blows out a knee it is usually over $1000 per knee for the surgery which alot of people can't afford to do and end up putting their pet to sleep|`|8zptGqLEaa	well you can get it a special kind of food and it will lose weight thats what i did my dog was 30 pounds and now its only 12 pounds my dog is a yorkie and you could also try walking it whenever is possible several times|`|kt9iXMWUaa	Walking is very good exercise, if she refuses to run.  You can also purchase a bike jogger that goes on the side of your bike.  This manner you ride and she trots/runs along with you.  It is VERY important that the dog does NOT have table food.  It is hard on your dogs stomach and shortens the life span.  Agility equipment can be purchased or make your own with jumps, tunnels, dog walks, A frame and weave poles.  There are many sites to go onto the internet for more info.  My dog loves agility and it's great exercise too.  It takes some time for training, but well worth it in the long run.  Good Luck!

D5N8s7weaa	I just recently took in a abused puppy of 8 months old. My older dog was very jealous at first and also started to pee in the basement. I took her to the vet because of her age.( I had a diabetic dog a one time also so I was worried.) It turns out that my older dog was eating her puppy food and it wasn't sitting well with her. I now sit at the table and make sure they eat their own food. (my older dog is allergic to chicken, which was the problem) they sleep in the same room and are in the back yard fine together. But they are just like kids and need equal love. Make sure to play and hug the older dog as much as the puppy and praise her for doing things well. Then she knows she is not being replaced but has a new friend.|`|AA12205365	I don't think you are doing anything wrong.  Dogs like company.  Sure the puppy will annoy her, but she is most likely bigger.  I suspect that the 2 will grow to enjoy each other's company.<br>  <br>    Most likely she is just drinking more water, or not peeing enough.  Make sure you take away both dog's water 2 hours before bed, and then take them for a walk right before bed.  Insure that she exhausts her bladder.  If the puppy is interfering with her feeling comfortable peeing walk her alone.<br>  <br>    Also make sure she is getting a lot attention.  Greet her 1st, and say goodbye last to her.  Feed her 1st.  Spend time each day without the puppy present.|`|mtoUep7Iaa	introduce them with leashes on|`|Kzg4wau3aa	the best thing to do is just give both pups the same amount of attention. since your dog is 10, he/she is pretty old. if i were u, i would actually use wee-wee pads for the time being. surprisingly, my old parakeet did the same thing when i brought home my puppy! if he/she does this for a long period of time, i would consult a vet. it may be depression, luckily it isn't...good luck!

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    This unfortunately sounds like neglect on the part of your boss.  Ask him if you can have some time with the other volunteers to teach them how to properly care for the animals.    You shouldn't be the one responsible for everything.    If things don't get better, maybe suggest that the children's farm looks for a local 4-H group that can either come in and help volunteer as well - or take some of the rabbits.    If visitors see bad conditions, your boss could get turned into the ASPCA or humane society.    I'd have a serious talk with him, explain your concerns, and possible solutions.    If you have any other questions or want more advice, please feel free to msg me!    Daisy    Edit:  Since there is not specific "area" for lagomorphs, almost all rabbit (and cavy questions too!) get asked here in rodents - I don't think she needs a lesson on that ;)|`|nd2shkoEaa	Just ask him to give you less work!      Also, rabbits are not rodents.  They are lagomorphs.  Along with pikas and hares.
yZkOeAgRaa	Goooooooood mornin' m'lady!<br>  <br>  Well, there's the old squirt bottle to chase 'em away with.  Feliway, as previously mentioned, can (strong "can") be halpful, but is very expensive and may not do much (not to mention it is a 1 room thing, so they could stop using it here, but start scratching there).  A catnip post is a great idea...just put it right where they usually scratch and it should help.<br>  <br>  I have also heard, but not tired, orange oil.  Might even be able to accomplish by zesting and orange and then rubbing it on the door frame.  Apparently they don't care for it and should leave it alone.  Worth a shot--and helps the room smell citrusy!  You can't lose!<br>  <br>  Best luck with the good ol' kee kats!|`|Rw7gi86Naa	A cat needs to scratch, that's natural behavior and should not be punished at all!  Sometimes though, this behavior can interfere with our lifestyle and we don't want our best sofa or newly fitted carpet being used as a scratching ground.  Cats scratch to keep their claws in good shape.  Layers of the claws are shed and underneath sits a new and sharp nail which provides the best protection possible for self-defense.  Scratching is also a form of territory marking.  Every time a cat scratches, it leaves its personal scent behind.  Small glands between the toes make that possible.  You can watch how a cat stretches itself while scratching.  This helps to keep the muscles in its legs, back and paws in good health.  The claws act as a sort of anchor, and are buried into the surface of the scratched item.<br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right:<br>   The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope.<br>   Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household.<br>   Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk.<br>   While catnip can make a cat attracted to the scratching post, what you really want is to have the cat’s scent on it. Cats scratch to mark their territory. Their scent is left where he scratched because of sweat glands between the pads of his paws; once that scent is left the cat will return to re-mark it again later. So rub your cat down with a towel, and rub the towel all over the scratching post.<br>   If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, gently carry your cat to the desired post. If the cat still hasn’t used the  post, demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.<br>   Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and affection.  The point is to use positive reinforcement, not punishment.<br>   When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>   Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself.<br>   Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas.<br>   Be persistent and don't give up.<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a>|`|ZxV8FeiYaa	sounds like they just need something harder then a scratching post, you could try buying the same wood that your doors made of, leaning it against a wall and spraying some catnip on it or something else to attract them to it more then the door<br>  <br>  good luck, hope this helps|`|9NHTI6Nuaa	HI .........I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH MY 2 CATS  SO I DECIDED TO BUY MY CATS A CATNIP SCRATCHER AT WALMART...........IT REALLY WORKS.......<br>  <br>  CHECK OUT THE LINKS I SEND YOU SO YOU CAN SEE THEM... GOOD LUCK|`|Nt7exGYAaa	Vet clinics sell a variety of products that you can spray on the things the cats are scratching, one such product is "Feliway" which is pheromones used to improve behaviour of cats.
iGYGJfgsaa	they preferred to be called "little people hamsters"|`|og7fFZdAaa	First of all you need to take out the female that is not the mom!! Then dont make any loud noises because that can scare the hamster and she will eat her babys!! Plus... wait till they are large enough where the mom can not fit them in her mouth and then you can hold them!! It is normal for the adults to be carying thier babys also!! The will fling them around but dont worry!! I would get a new carge for the other female that is not the mother too!!
fGwZMglGaa	I would get a male rat to keep yours company.  If your mum ever complains about noise etc just tell her that he needs a friend and that it won't cost much more to keep because you will need to buy food and bedding for your current rat anyway. But don't get a girl on purpose, because that would mean they would hardly ever spend any time together because you must seperate the male from female when she gives birth and then as soon as you put him back in he will get her pregnant again and the whole process of seperating them comes back. Plus they can be often hrd to sell and after a while you can't find anyone who wants them so you will be stuck with a load unwanted babies.  But good luck anyway if you think you can handle it but make sure there will be people ready to look after the babies!|`|Wfpf8efnaa	well i CAN SAY THAT THE BEST WAY TO PERSUAID THEM IS TO DO SOME WORK AROUND THE HOUSE maybe save the money and tell them youll buy the rat and i kan kinda relate  i have 2 rats both girls and they were cheap my choice if you want to tell your parents you will pay for it is to get a fancy there cheaper then all the rest|`|uxHLVj5qaa	Well the gerbil i am against you giving away. It shows you are a irresponsible pet owner. When you buy a pet, you take on the responsibility to look after it, even if things don't turn out as planned.  As far as convincing your parents, im on their side when it comes to getting a female one. They might not want loads of babies, research breeding rats.  And one more thing...Don't buy a rat, rescue one. Cheaper, more choice and saving a life.    Bitsy  xxx|`|daa680251e1ac5c7e34e280c16168adaaa	rats have a shorter lifespan if they go without a cage mate. when my rats cage mate died she got depressed, obese and died a week later.      Don't get a female though. if you can't handle the current pets without leaving your gerbil with your brother,  you shouldn't be thinking about babies. please be responsible.|`|614f441d409d6912be8c96b43fdac75daa	Young male rats often introduce well to adult males.    Do not get a female. Back to back pregnancies would kill her as well as too young or too old pregnancies. So she'd have to be seperated from the male most of her life anyway. You'd then have two lonely rats instead of one.|`|nd2shkoEaa	I completely agree with BiTsY.
YFTZM86maa	it's called Ort.  basically any leftovers that you have.  Banana peels are not recommended, from what I've experienced.  Any other fruit skins, cores, vegetables, bread etc..toss it all into a bucket and feed it to them.  Also hay and corn and grains, as you may never have enough slop for a pig.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Pigs will eat any and everything you give them. They don't really understand the concept of "healthy."|`|X1jupF0paa	All the stuff in the fridge thats going to be thrown out.|`|eMFwMQGHaa	Slops. haha|`|R4gWNdvgaa	pigs eat every food possible, and no they really dont give them garbage, its just lots of leftovers mushed together, but they LOVE it!!|`|64hKLGjpaa	pigs are herb overs so feed them lots of veges|`|PEXTM3Wuaa	its old leftovers|`|355buvKGaa	Pig Food or McDonalds!|`|ROFzgbiJaa	They will pretty much eat anything they can. For treats i'll give my pig mini marsh mellows he loves those also cheetos is another favorite. It depends though if they are raised for meat or as a pet. Usually for a pet it can be anything such as slop which is just a mixture of a bunch of different foods together. On the other hand if they are raised for slaughter they are usually on a more concise diet of an oat mixture type stuff that has the right amount of nutrients so that the consumer can receive the best out of the product. Truthfully they will eat anything they can get there hands on though.
9F76AUgfaa	This is my favourite category in Yahoo Answers, it's where you find good people that are asking about their pets,advice and stuff.Folk that care enough about their animals to come here and ask questions. And i love you for caring.  My dog hates dry food and to be honest i was worried his diet was boring for him, so i give him tins of dog meat.But i know that it does suit some better to feed dry food.  And to answer your question, yes, i think you have done the right thing in the way you have encouraged him to eat the food.I know you are not a moron,but please make sure he has plenty of fresh and clean water available at all times cuz they get really thirsty a while after they have eaten, as the food digests and their body is looking for fluid to cope with the hydrated meal.|`|8jhtjNGoaa	My two huskies are the same way. The easiest & cheapest way I found was to save the grease when you cook meats, bacon, steaks, stuff like that in a jar and melt some on their food - then they are just eating their food.      When the last bag of dog food ran out I switched to a premium dog food - one of them was having issues with diarrhea and neither were gaining enough weight (rescues). With the new, yummy food, I just mix in hot water to make it mushy and smelly  (ew for me).      I agree with the person that said it sounds a bit overkill - but at least you're doing whatever you can to keep your baby happy and healthy. Just be careful not to give him anything dangerous. Here's a link to a list of people food BAD for dogs - from the ASPCA:    http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/poison-con...    And yay for you for taking so much time and effort! Good Luck!|`|3wJGXfkKaa	Ya sounds good to me as long as he's eating something healthy|`|GSf09ALBaa	I'd eat it.|`|oRr9SOIqaa	Haha yes.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Sounds good to me!  Good for you for trying to get him to eat better!  Your patience is going to pay off!!!!!  Also, praise him when he is eating the new stuff.

At first maybe cooked as he is a picky eater, but later raw vegies. Is ther something about the biscuit or kibble he doesn't like?

6mVNAg6saa	Yes, I would recommend the Innova Dry. My parents own a dog boarding facility and sell Innova and California Natural products.  I really like the EVO myself, but I'm sure the regular Innova would be just fine.

AM7CgQ4daa	I have a hose connection to my laundry, so I can regulate the hot/cold water to warm, then I wash her on the paving outside.  But I live in a warm city, in winter I still wash outside, but choose warmer days.  Always use dog shampoo, human shampoo is bad for their skin.  I dampen them down with the hose all over, then turn the hose off and put a long squirt of shampoo down her back, then use my hands to rub it all over her body.  I don't use shampoo on her head as dog don't like water being poured over their faces, instead I use a damp small towel and just wash her face with that.   I massage the shampoo for about 5 minutes, then rinse it all off, I rinse until the water runs clean, be careful to wash the tummy and underarms well.  I don't use any other products as I think natural is best.  I have a towel ready and give her a good towel dry for a few minutes, then she is done, but make sure your dog does not go and lie in the dirt, I often take mine for a walk while she dries.|`|qPd5G3dSaa	they also have doggie shampoo so you can take care of ther skin as well... i usually wash for a good 10 minutes and also condition for 3 then let then air dry... along with towell... also make sure all hair is out of their eyes which im sure you have no problem with... this may also sound gross but on the german shepherd make sure the "trap door" is clear of hair which might result in some nasty dingle berries lol and also make sure their claws are trimmed back to a good length|`|mRevWUxlaa	I wash my pit in the rub. I wash him twice. Its to cold to wash him outside. They have doggie collegne you can buy in pet stores like Petco. Because you cant wash them every day, try that. Also, If you have children and they use that tub for bathing, it is IMPERATIVE that you scrub out the tub before using it for your children. Good Luck!!!!|`|aHoeG6f5aa	This is pretty funny, because we have a german shepherd and a pit bull.  (both mixes).  We generally wash them on the back porch (warmer climate).  If you do wash them in the tub get a strainer for the drain, or else it might get clogged with hair, especially from the shepherd.  We use the water hose to wet their body down,  Then put on some dog shampoo, make sure it's dog shampoo, not human.  Scrub it in really good.  If it is their first bath you might leave it on for a minute or two, if they dog will let you.  Then wash the face, being very careful not to get soap in the eyes or ears.  We spend more time on the face. Rinse the face first, then the body.  Hold the hose close to their body until the water runs clear.  And while the dog is still wet, run your fingers though it's hair to make sure there are no more suds.  Let them shake off, and towel dry.  We never use any kind of blow dryer on our dogs, but i know some people do.  Just don't let them get too cold afterwards.  Then clean their ears, expecially the shepherd if he has pointed ears.  Get a good ear cleaner at the pet store and follow the directions exactly.  We only wash them once.  You probably won't have to repeat unless the dog is extra dirty, or it is a special shampoo for skin problems.  Just remember not to wash them too often, because the oils in their skin is good for their fur.  Once a month is usually good for a dog.  Unless the dog is extra smelly or extra dirty.  Don't forget to trim the nails, too, if needed.|`|ZVP7348Naa	eat pie
ADjeuxIiaa	I would ask about the ACL, however, keep in mind that active dogs are prone to a variety of different injuries. Larger dogs can twist their stomach, others can get joint problems. However at the young age of two I would say she may have just landed wrong and sprained something. The injury wouldn't have time to heal over the year if she runs and jumps every day. If it isn't bothering her, I wouldn't stress, just be sure to ask your vet about it at the next check up.|`|0UxjzoUxaa	It can be a ACL? you should discuss it with your vet it can be a very serious problem especially for a big dog like herself.. good luck!|`|01odBlpjaa	i'm going to guess it's a torn ACL also. take her to a specialist.|`|GSf09ALBaa	I have no idea but I can tell you what it was with one of my dogs.  My Terrier mix started limping on his right front leg after doing the Indy 500 in our back yard with several other dogs.  I took him in and x-rays were done.      My vet x-rayed both front legs and after he and I stood looking at them for a few minutes we both saw it about the same time.  A tiny bone in his right front leg was about 1/8th inch shorter than the left.      No surgery needed.  Supplemented his food with joint lubricate and he does the Indy 500 with no limping.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Maybe because you never mentioned that she was limping before she got hit by the cars.  Poor dog - limping, gets weights put on her instead of being taken to the vet to see why she's limping, then gets hit by cars --- you're really quite the wonderful dog owner.    Take her back to the vet, tell him what you wrote here - we're not vets and don't have a crystal ball to diagnose your poor pooch - that's what vets are for.  There are great anti-inflammatories for dogs, there are pain meds, and there are ways to fix her limp, but first you need to find out why she is limping in the first place - that's the job of your vet, not strangers online.    Please - keep her safely on leash or in a fenced area so she doesn't get run over again.   Yikes.    No, no,just saw that about her being a great frisbee jumper --- with an undiagnosed limp - you really want to cripple this poor beast don't you?   Have some sense man --- no weights, no frisbee, no hard exercise until you know what the problem is.    Kind of like expecting you to get out of your wheelchair (if you were in one) to play hockey or football - you sure haven't thought this through.|`|AA11625368	She may have a torn cruciate ligament. You should talk to your vet regarding that. It is very common in larger breed, active dogs. If the vet only examined your dog after being HBC, then they may not have checked for a ruptured cruciate. The vet may have considered the lameness a result from soft tissue trauma. I think you should have her rechecked by your vet. Be sure you go to an orthopedic vet. Good luck!|`|J3UOc8Npaa	Maybe a pulled muscle or something on her leg that is causing her displeasure?|`|XT4MPPewaa	i dont know but you are FIT !

Zh1Y6lFIaa	Parakeets are very fast learners, but the best method to use is touch training. This type of training doesn't betray your bird's trust and allows you to begin training while he is still INSIDE the cage. And you never get bit using this method of training.    Here is how to do it: http://jamiesparrothelp.wordpress.com/20...    Once you touch train your parakeet, you can get him to come out of the cage using the same method, even get him to step up using it too. The best reward to use for training a budgie is millet, so make sure it's not already in his daily diet.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Give him more time.  Allow him to come to your hand at the door.

Do not try to tame him by holding him like that. Then he will come to fear that every time you put your hand in the cage that you are going to grab him. The easiest thing to do, is to just put your hand in the cage for a few seconds when changing food or water. If he flaps around, then take your hand out right away. If he doesn't flap around, leave your hane in for longer and longer each day. After he learns that you aren't going to hurt him, then you can start training him to sit on your finger. To do this, put your finger against his chest near his feet and say "up." Don't say it too loud or be too commanding, or he will be frightened. If he climbs up, (which he should since when you put your finger near their chest, they feel like they are falling backwards, so they step) praise him and tell him what a good bird he is. Do this acouple times a day. After he has got the hang of "up," with your finger against his chest, put your finger next to him and say up. He should climb onto your finger. When he gets that tame, he should let you stroke him. Then he will be tame=)  Hope I helped
enC9TvxUaa	_Let her try to sue!  If the money is that important to her, then let her fight the battle!  Will cost you the original amount, plus the filing fee, but you will probably win!|`|AA11457471	You are correct. It would be a different story had your dog started the fight in the neighbors yard.  I think paying half is very fair. My best advice: Ignore them & let the chips fall where they will.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	If the fight took place in the middle of the street and neither dog was leashed then both owners are responsible for failing to control their dogs.  In most places you are only responsible for half of the vet bill.  However, the laws regarding dogs vary greatly from place to place and may be different in your area.  Your best bet is to contact your own attorney for legal advice so that you can be prepared to face this woman in small claims court.  It is obvious that she is not willing to drop it, so you'll either have to settle with her out of court or take it up with the judge.|`|NAbioaNmaa	you could blatantly get the bill paid for|`|GSf09ALBaa	Both dogs were off leash.  Both dogs were on neutral territory when the fight began.  The fight ended up in your neighbor's yard with their dog getting hurt.    If I were you, I would feel obligated to pay the whole bill.

Both animals were unrestrained, but which one attacked which one, is really a judgment call.    When the case goes to court, and if the judge finds one party "overwhelmingly right," meaning he/she is entirely right, they the judge can order the defendant to pay for the claimed amount AND court cost, attorney's fees (if any), and all the expenses.  In another word, you could end up paying a lot more than the other half of the cost.  You might also end up paying a fine for having an unrestrained animal.    When you settle outside of the court, you pay for what is demanded - which is $189.    It's up to you.  Sometimes, it's cheaper to forget who's right and pay anyway.  Another time, you might end up not paying anything.|`|fba40d6b496629b6d627a579ba3eb661aa	I think you should give her another 6 dollars to actually make it half of the bill and tell her to take it to court, both of you had dogs at fault. If you ever watch judge shows on TV, they would tell you that you would have to pay half, not the whole bill. Why was her dog running lose? Maybe you should tell her the same things about the fence etc. I watch ALOT of daytime court shows and I believe as long as you are telling the truth, that you do have a good case, just pay the 6 and make it exactly even.|`|ZkYxdlTeaa	Most communities have leash laws, it seems you are both at fault and therefore both should be subject to a hefty fine regardless of which dog was injured.

I know there is no vet near you, but if you don't make the effort to go the distance, when the leg heals is wont heal properly. Or it will get gangrene from not healing right. It needs to be wrapped in the right position so it heals correctly, or else you're looking at a life time of complications and possibly early death from infection.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Who takes care of your horses??

How did your dog get its shots if there is no vet.  Not taking him to a vet is no excuse.  If you couldn't walk on your foot, would you just "wrap" it?  No.  Take the time and find a vet even if it's an hour away.|`|Ka1vewkjaa	don t listen to anyone you must take him to a vet|`|pvgwJwxvaa	your sad dog needs to go to the vet!  if you try wrapping it yourself you could end up doing more harm than good.  you are not a vet do not try to play one.|`|JREyMH4zaa	why lie? it only makes you sound even more lame then before..here's a hint..any vet..large or small animal, knows at least enough about both to know if a leg is broken, or to make some educated guess as to what is wrong.  Just take the poor dog to the vet and pay the money..and stop with the absurd excuses...
98213410df5614ac2608fd2a80978670aa	Next time i adopt, it will be an older cat. A lot of people like kittens, and the older ones get pushed a side and forgotten.<br>  If you go to a animal shelter, it sometimes says weather an older cat will get on well with a younger one. <br>  But age doesn't always matter, it's going to be cat/cats. If they like each other good, if not ?................lol<br>  I have 4 (3 are older and 1 is still a kitten) 1 of the older ones freaks when the 2 other older ones come near her, yet she's cool with the kitten.<br>  Where i live here in Vegas, one of the local Vet clinic has about 25 cats that live 24/7 (they walk about the clinic all day or eat and sleep)<br>  and they all get on well. All the cats seem easy going and very mellow (they are all also up for adoptions) see if the town you live in offers a animal clinic. Where cats get to walk around freely, that way your get to see how any cat you might like there acts towards others.<br>  Good luck...........|`|fKYi3IJ2aa	I would lean more towards an older cat because kittens are so popular. With older cats though they have already formed a personality and will be hard to train (ex if they dont like dogs they most likely wont ever like dogs) I adopted an 8 year old cat from the shelter and he's one of the nicest cats I've ever had. Whoever you choose just make sure they can get along with the cat you already have.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	I have had a number of wonderful cats in my life.  One was 15 years old and had lived outside all her life.  I rescued her from neighbors when she was dying from hyperthyroidism.  She was treated for that and spent the next seven years living in my home.<br>  <br>  Another cat was 17 - he had been abandoned at a local cat boarding facility for six months.  He was beautiful and such a loving cat.  Unfortunately he developed oral cancer three months after coming into my home which caused his death 10 months later.<br>  <br>  You don't have to have cats of that advanced age (shelters would just euthanized those senior citizens).  All cats are wonderful and none deserves to be abandoned by owners who tire of them when they are no longer kittens.<br>  <br>  You should probably look for a cat close in age to the one you have now to find the best match.  I got two kittens this summer (another rescue story) and they live happily in my home with my "seniors" - 16, 14 and 13.|`|9b8278b3a9a556138153fbad211d8c67aa	i just adopted an older cat tonight!!!! she is really shy so far. i'll tell you how it goes|`|4zvjt5Cnaa	Definitely go for a senior.

Hid, hissed and would not let anyone touch. Gave her a piece of turkey. Stickers instantly fell in love and I so did I. I had the most wonderful cat in the world until she passed at nineteen years of age. This cat was already litter trained, so affectionate and gave me kisses everyday. I wil always miss her and learned that my next adoption will be an older cat.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Adult cats all the way!  I have three I adopted as adults and they're the sweetest, most loveable and most playful cats I've ever known.  Adult cats adapt SO quickly to other pets, too.  Meanwhile the only not-so-friendly and hides-from-strangers cat in my house is my fourth cat - a cat who's 12 that I've had since kittenhood!

zeTGmB3faa	If your cat is home alone during the day, it is best just to cat proof the house. This way you get rid of the headache and the cat stays out of mischief. <br>  As I've gotten older, I've learned that simplicity is the easiest way.|`|dYluozLHaa	spray bottle works best|`|QL56syElaa	Ha..thought I was the only one to use the spray bottle..but yea that deffinetly works... now wen there about to do something bad, I show em the spray bottle and they take off.|`|GNq2rmrNaa	spray her with water every time that it does something wrong and eventually it will learn.|`|7fVr3q0kaa	I faced the same dilemma with my two active kitties, and finally hit on the right balance of kitty-proofing and training. It's best to keep plants out of kitty's reach, as well as anything breakable.<br>  <br>  Cats love high places. Does she have a cat tower or something else "way up there" that she is allowed to climb on? Scatter some catnip over it and encourage her to use it...she may come to prefer it (most of the time) to counters and other taboo areas.<br>  <br>  Kitty also needs adequate space to play and run. Do you exercise her daily? If not, spend at least 20 minutes a day enticing her to chase a favorite toy (the kinds that dangle for a rod are best). Encourage her to leap in the air, run up and down her tower in pursuit, etc. Think of it this way: the more time you spend helping kitty use all that great energy, the less energy she'll have for unwanted behaviors!<br>  <br>  Another things to consider is how much time she spends alone most days. If you work a regular 8 hour job, then likely she gets really bored and makes her own mischief. Adopting a second cat to keep her company might be a really good step. Two cats are not much more expense to care for than one, and they play with each other. Having a little friend to keep her company might go a long way toward eliminating "boredom" behaviors.<br>  <br>  Hope these suggestions help!<br>  <br>  -KittyMamma<br>  <a href="http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com</a>|`|IuYekkPVaa	I'm not a fan of the spray bottle, I prefer saying "no" in a firm voice or hissing (it reawakens memories of mother cat's discipline) as a way of telling them off.  Any form of discipline needs to be carried out immediately, otherwise she won't understand what she did wrong.<br>  <br>  She's a young cat with lots of energy and I don't think she's being naughty, she's just looking for things to amuse herself whilst you are out.  Along with cat-proofing areas of your home, you need to find activities that provide an alternative outlet for her natural behaviours.<br>  <br>  In nature, cats would spend much of their time hunting for food, so divide her food into smaller portions and place the dishes in different locations around the home so that she has to go "hunting" for it.  Buy a treat ball and place a handful of treats or dry food inside as another way of keeping her occupied.  Being so small, cats like climbing to get a better view of everything around them, so a cat tree or jungle will keep her off the kitchen counters.  A window seat with a view of somewhere busy can keep cats entertained for hours.  They can quickly become bored with their toys, so rotate them on a weekly basis and use catnip or honeysuckle spray on them to renew her interest in them.  Most cats love playing in cardboard boxes, so make her a "frantic" box.  Take a large cardboard box put shredded newspaper in the bottom along with a few food treats, balls made from scrunched up paper etc. and encourage her to play in it.  A ping-pong ball inside the bath tub is another game kittens enjoy playing.<br>  <br>  One of the best and cheapest toys that I've bought for my cats is a pop up play cube.  Even though they're adult cats now, they never seem to get bored with them and I often give them as gifts for friends' cats.  See the link and video clip below for details.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/YELLOW-CAT-KITTEN-POP-UP-PLAY-CUBE-ULTIMATE-FUN-TOY_W0QQitemZ290295004971QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUK_Pet_Supplies_Cats?hash=item290295004971&_trksid=p3911.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1683%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/YELLOW-CAT-KITTEN-...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this gives you some ideas on keeping her occupied and out of trouble whilst you are out.|`|FBuVwYBSaa	Keep up the spray bottle and be a little more patient, especially if your cat is still a kitten or is under the age of 5 yrs.<br>  <br>  sydnie|`|e1bc9ee12a586a97194ed85c52656355aa	Bah! to the spray bottle! Buy a can of compressed air, it spooks the bejeezeres out of them. Use their name when you scold them in a hard tone. It's very important to have a strong connection with your cats name, it is the base of all cat training. Also, you can place your fingers over the little straw from the can to make a high pitched scream. <br>  As far as when you are away, until good training is established with the compressed air can, the behavior will continue. Once you get their attention that you are boss, cat proof the house a little more. <br>  With time and consistancy any thing is possible.
enC9TvxUaa	-I am so sorry!  Talk to other vets, and to the local humane society.|`|3wJGXfkKaa	I agree with the others I would definitely call around to any vets in your area even an hour away explain the situation and see if they offer payment plans there is one is my area that does.  If not call a shelter, ASPCA, or some humane society try everything I'm sure someone will help.  Good Luck.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Call the aspca or humane society and ask for the name of a low cost vet.  Just because that vet said "no" doesn't mean that others will.  As a last resort you could surrender the dog to the humane society to save it's life, but you would not get it back.|`|kDv1uC1raa	Their are other vets in your town , im sure, call around see about financing payments and I would try to get some laxatives for the dog might help... dont let the dog suffer though.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Well hopefully your pup will just require an enema to take care of the problem which is inexpensive.  But if the bill does go up and you can't pay then legally they cannot keep your animal, although they may refuse to release him until you pay.  But they may allow you to post-date a check for payment on a date you know your checking account can handle it.  In the end you need to make good on your bill and pay what you owe.  You don't want to have to deal with them turning you over to collections.  In the meantime call around to other Vets and see if they do something like "Care Credit" which is a credit card just for Vet use.  That would definitely be something you could handle.|`|AA12148328	If you dog is attempting to go , and not going there are a couple of home remedies you could try . No they wont hurt the dog . I have done theses myself and got good results . You can give the dog a teaspoon full of liquid  cooking oil . He wont like it , so keep his mouth closed and gently rub his neck till he swallows . Should take about 30 minutes to work . Another one is one raw egg  given the same way .Both will help make things move along . Neither is toxic for dogs .  My terrier was sometimes unable to move , and my vet told me to try these two things . The liquid  cooking oil worked the best .|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Well the dog will die, if you can not afford the care of the vet.. Try a different vet, ask around , if you can't get help for the dog today, You need to release her to the ASPCA in your area.|`|mwVCFlLTaa	See if you qualify for a carecredit card, and find a vet who will handle it.  Many offer this service, and once you have the card,  you can use it again and again (as long as you keep paying it off, of course!)    I am not a vet and therefore reluctant to offer suggestions, but I did give one of my dogs an enema once, and that was all he needed.  However, dogs can get into things and need to have socks, pieces of rawhide, all sorts of things removed.
Rw7gi86Naa	Young kittens between the ages of 3 weeks old and 8 months old will be teething off and on, and will have very strong needs to bite.  Just like baby children, kittens are born without teeth, start getting their first baby teeth at about 3-4 weeks old, then they will lose their baby teeth and have their adult teeth come in up until the age of about 8 months old.  So the trick here is not to keep them from biting; but rather, to provide them appropriate items to bite.  We use heavy-duty plastic drinking straws with our kittens, (being careful to cut off any bitten ends and discard the entire straw before it becomes dangerous, as with any toy), and train them from the start that toys and straws are purr-rectly fine to bite, but human body parts are off-limits!  If a kitten learns this from the start, there is hardly ever an inappropriate biting behavior as an adult.  Some cats start biting out of frustration after they have been declawed.  Some cats start biting out of misplaced aggression, which usually can be countered by providing the cat a feline playmate, and/or providing them more cat toys, cat furniture, and making their environment more stimulating for them.  Any time the kitten bites you make a loud “yowling” sound. If you’ve ever witnessed a cat get hurt, you will probably know what this sounds like. After you yowl, walk away and ignore the kitten. Never yell at or hit a cat. At all times, it is critical that you be thinking and acting on the firm belief that "toys and straws are for biting; human hands are for giving and receiving love.” <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't assume automatically that cats that bite are vicious creatures.  You must distinct between play-biting and real aggressive biting.  Kittens for example like to play, and sometimes pretty rough.  They use their claws and teeth to wrestle with each other.  This is how they learn to hunt and catch prey, so that’s normal.  They usually go unharmed because their fur protects them from serious wounds.  However, human skin is a different story, but kittens don't know that.<br>  <br>  When you stroke your kitten it can take it as an invitation to play and clasps your hand and bites.  That might hurt a little but is generally nothing to worry about.  Some cats make a sport out of leg biting.  They jump up on you and dig in.  Research has show that it’s a sort of unsatisfied hunting and prey instinct and lack of activity.  <br>  <br>   Teach your kitten from an early age that hands are for feeding and stroking and NOT a toy!  <br>   Avoid playing with your bare hands <br>   Use a fluffy toy or a feather on a string instead <br>   In case it grabs your hand, draw it away slowly and do NOT punish your cat, it will understand it as an attack and make matters worse.<br>   Anytime your cat scratches or bites you, make a loud yowling sound to show that you have been hurt, (even if you really aren’t hurt). Your cat will understand. <br>   If your cat is a "leg biter" try to spend more time playing with it and redirect its attack to a toy.  Leave toys lying around so that he can also amuse itself, particular when you keep your cat indoors. Cats need a wide variety of toys to keep them interested, so don’t expect a couple toy mice to help.|`|EEouPbDyaa	well its pretty much a kitten and its what they do i would just get it some toys and with what my bro did with our cat is twist its ear,it seemed to work.<br>  <br>  hope it helps|`|QL56syElaa	Well neutering him will calm him down. But as soon and he attacks you hit him on his nose and yell at him..Eventually he'll realize you do that every time he attacks you and he'll get the point!|`|GNq2rmrNaa	tap it on the head or spray it with a bottle of water and if that doesn't work try just ignoring it until it stops|`|XG7zVTIsaa	I am suggesting that you get this cat neutered, you may find that he will calm down, I am surprised that the animal shelter did not insist on this before leaving.<br>  <br>  This biting business? how long has this been going on? What are you feeding? are you giving enough?<br>  <br>  Try encouraging with a toy.. cat nip.. ball, and a scratching post <br>  <br>  Cats that do this sort of thing, may have physiclogical problems.. discuss with the shelter where you obtain him from. What was the history?<br>  <br>  Dont frighten the cat by spraying water or hitting an animal that is cruelity- even light taps can cause damage. The skull is very thin layer of bone that protects the brain, any knock to any animal or even a human being can cause hemerages, fractures and internal bleeding that could cause death.<br>   <br>  Cats have long memories and associate the owner/feeder.  you could be doing more harm than good.<br>  <br>  Talk to your local vet, he may need a dis-temper shot. Are his shots up to date?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps  (cheers vet nurse)|`|6E64SKmDaa	May the kitty is bored and needs more attention and toys to bite and play with dnt give it back the kitty loves you.|`|zeTGmB3faa	He is not attacking you to be mean, he is just a rough player. I can't understand why a shelter would let a cat be adopted without neutering him. This should be done right away because he could start spraying the house at any time. It will be hard if not impossible to stop once it starts. Neutering will calm him down some and he may not continue this. Don't wave your hands at him or entice him into play as he will just follow through with play attack because he thinks that is what he is supposed to do.
FvAl3UgQaa	I just wanted to reply and say thank you to you for listening to all the reasoned arguments from the various experienced answerers and for being willing to change things for the better for your pet leopard gecko. It's so infuriating when people post questions and then totally ignore the answers because they think they already know it all.

Bettas are from the south coast of china and the surrounding countries. The air is always humid and dense. Having a fan on will lessen the humidity in the air, making it less natural.

AA11887983	Metacam can be used in cats,  but it is not labeled for this use.  There is tons of anecdotal evidence.  But if your cat is sick, you need to get her in to see the vet.

Sometimes the bunny can attack the ducks, and it could go the other way around.|`|JAdNkzENaa	i clicked on this question thinking it was a joke. lol now that i know it is a serious question i can honestly say i have no idea. yes? no?|`|94idwoK2aa	No! and here's proof:<br>  <br>  One day, a rabbit went up to a duck and asked, "Got any carrots?" The duck answered, "No!"<br>  <br>  The next day the rabbit went to the duck again and asked, "Got any carrots?" The duck replied "No!"<br>  <br>  Next day the rabbit again asked the duck, "Got any carrots?" The duck shouted, "No! And if you ask me again for carrots, I'll take nails and hammer you to a tree by your ears!"<br>  <br>  Early the next morning the rabbit came back and asked, " Got any nails?" The duck answered, "No!" Then the rabbit asked, "Got any carrots?"<br>  <br>  So therefore, they just can't get along.<br>  <br>  The End. : )|`|KvmjaU86aa	They're not natural enemies, the duck will not eat the rabbit and vice versa so I don't see why not. Are you trying to get ready for easter? lol|`|EUGoxWXuaa	yes they do.<br>  but that all depends on the personalities of the two animals<br>  <br>  =)|`|776e689c6bcb3bd7689f1c9c6994e898aa	I had 3 puppys and 2 ducks with a rabbit and a ferret<br>  and they all got along well! <br>  Oh and i had fishhies also, anddd the ducks would go after the fishies tank..<br>  haha its cuteeee|`|Grb85RJuaa	The first time you leave a rabbit and a duck alone together you will come back to a bloodbath.|`|88KRRWPzaa	Sure do!<br>  <br>  ...........duck and rabbit and french role bread with sides of spuds and green beans|`|RhzWwYI6aa	i think they're ignore each other. mine did.|`|P6l9Kwmyaa	its an ecosystem in ur house
O36UwsH9aa	Well I'm a Hamster breeder..(4 Years :D..The way i pick Up my hamsters were 1I'll let them know that im there..2 Your sent is different from there's so put your hand in the hay/bedding so the sent can be the same(may work )3 Let the gerbils smell  your hand after You rub your hands with the hay/bedding try petting it....if that works "and it doesn't bite you"try picking it up..cup your hand under the belly  secure it...If it doesn't work plz keep trying or find other ways btw Wash ur hands be4 u pick it/them up...1 more thing Try carrying some of there food in your hand:D|`|lLHtM6jvaa	Aww. I'm not sure about the best way to pick them up, but i'd imagine by cupping both hands gently around them.<br>  <br>  Definitely handle them as much as possible, even if they're older i find gerbils & hamsters are comfortable with familiar things.<br>  <br>  Trust me they're happy as long as they got a good wheel, a bed & some grub. Occasional piece of banana,apple or cereal and you've got a euphoric gerbil!|`|d4f9ed600d9f018a94f306bb535b0856aa	I think he has plenty of room to run around.I am not sure how to pic the hamster up.But he should become more social if you hold him more often.

5oHQgdThaa	This is going to sound a bit strange, but is it just this one table leg (wood?) that he goes after?  <br>  <br>  If so, you have it good.  Leave the cat tree near the table where you have it, and rub it down good with catnip.  <br>  <br>  Then get some aluminum foil and wrap it around the table leg.  Cats hate the feel of aluminum foil.  The table won't be pretty for a few weeks, but it should work.<br>  <br>  I do know whereof I speak-- I bought a new chair last year and the cats fell in love with it -- not to sit on, but to scratch!  They scratched on the front, and up the back, on the corners.  Clipping their nails helped, but then when the nails started growing, the urge to scratch was still there.<br>  <br>  I ended up putting clear plastic tape, like the kind you use for mailing boxes, on every corner of the new chair, AND covering it with a heavy  piece of fabric (denim).  <br>  <br>  They are finally discouraged, but I keep an eye out -- they use the tree, but still like furniture when they think I am not looking!|`|atrObg5saa	cat nip|`|zeTGmB3faa	You could put a little catnip on the tree. This will attract him to it.|`|VwmaWcp9aa	We rubbed the wood and sissal parts of the tree with catnip.  Her food is on the top flat level so the puppy can't get it.  Our kitten took to it quite quickly.  Whenever we see her scratching on something appropriate (a scratching post or the tree), we give her lots of praise by saying, "Good girl."|`|JRRsjByCaa	every time you see him scratching at your table you need to go over and move his paws to the scratch post and move them in the motion like he is scratching. its a lot of work and will take a little while for him to catch on but he will gradually move to the post.|`|b37f2b23a440d20ba2b99b465d00d138aa	Get a bag of treaties - take her frontpaws and scratch the cat tree. Then give her a treat or two. Cats are very smart and she will soon run to the tree and scratch when she see's you. But you have to give her a treat everytime.|`|QL56syElaa	Cat nip would work... ha, the spray bottle works great for me|`|jyds7SxGaa	maybe put food on top?

8RrNrjFPaa	Yes they do, they do not molt its more of a constant shed, I have one. But if you keep them brushed you won't have to deal with nearly as much. And they will have some of the softest fur, they are great.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	More than you can imagine!|`|ofUe4hBkaa	LOL yes  tons and tons of bags filled with it each week  alot of grooming each day.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	LOL!  Heaps and heaps of it!|`|24CFl7sjaa	oh yes.  lots.  Mine just has to look at the carpet and the hairs jump off him|`|vGP1ZXUuaa	Are you serious?!?!?  Holy moly, of course they do -- and look how big they are!      You could knit several sweaters with the hair that comes off of a Newfie!|`|iLrp65oXaa	Yes, and tons of it!|`|Dxlt3jcqaa	Yes they need at least 15mins grooming a day. My parents have a Newfoundland cross and she constantly needs brushing.  BTW i'd recommend one of these brushes they are expensive but work a treat and save alot of arm ache!!  http://www.furminator.com/|`|ADjeuxIiaa	Yes. Especially during the transition into summer and into winter.|`|PwqzKCkkaa	yes! it will cover the floor like a carpet or blanket!|`|P3vZh1ajaa	OMG yesssssssssss, the worst!!|`|NRYTCejYaa	Absolutely. I am a professional pet bather (not yet a groomer, since you aren't allowed to cut their fur where I work until you've completed a second round of training) and the only other breed of dog I have ever washed with fur that thick and long would be a Great Pyrenees. If you cannot stand fur in your home, you should not get one of these dogs as there is not anything you can do to completely eliminate shedding. People sometimes have their dogs shaved, thinking this will solve the problem, but the dog will continue to shed, and the fur will be shorter and somewhat prickly to the touch as it grows in. The best way to reduce the amount that your dog sheds is to keep him from radical temperature changes (which will trigger heavier shedding) and to use a shampoo/conditioner which will reduce shedding, as well as brushing as often as possible. The Furminator may be expensive, but their brush and creme rinse work wonders on dogs. If you would rather not make that large an investment, I would recommend buying a similar model of a different brand, which will work in a similar manner, although it may be a bit rougher on the dog's coat.|`|nc4SbvfRaa	They shed (blow coat) twice a year... and you will not believe how much hair they can loose and not be bald! If you know anybody that spins wool they maybe interested in helping groom your animal in exchange for the shed hair
CdRlOsnyaa	get a burmese mountain dog there medium size or a siberian husky|`|bIaywrBCaa	Need more info, what size dog, what type dog do you like, activity level, etc. Here are some ideas    Small: min pin, Jack Russell, Beagle    Med: Border collie, australian shepherd    Large: Rottweiler, Doberman, German shepherd    Also if you don't have a particular breed in mind, go to a shelter and find one that suits your personality.|`|kfgx4PjUaa	Well it depends on your lifestyle. If you are very active and want a pooch that can keep up with you I would recommend a pitbull. My fiance and I have a pitbull and a German Shepard and they go everywhere with usl bike rides, car rides, hikes, to the lake ect. If you are a more laid back type person and just want a snuggle bunny maybe try a lab, my friend has one and he is really chill.|`|enC9TvxUaa	_More information would be good!  Big/small?  Inside/outside?  Playfullness?  Long/short hair?    Have you tried going to the SPCA and see what dogs catch your eye?  Which ones might have the personality you are looking for.  Finding a new friend is more about the individual, not the breed!    Good luck and ENJOY your new little friend!|`|xEyyFrPhaa	depends on what you want, a small dog, medium dog, or a large dog. also do you want a pedegree or a mutt, if you want a pedegree dog find a good breeder and never buy a dog from a puppy mill/pet store/or a back yard breeder (those dogs will only cost more in vet bills), if you want a mutt/cross breed go look in a animal shelter also do some research on what breed/cross before you buy a dog and get all the supplies you will need before bringing your dog/puppy home|`|6Ehb9r1kaa	I went through all the same decisions weeks ago. I went with a golden retriever.. I wondered to myself why most of the handicapped dogs are golden retrievers, and did some research.. and in my opinion are the smartest dogs out there.

Most gentle, loving dogs ever.|`|nc4SbvfRaa	Whenever considering a new dog start with the AKC or other nation kennel club. Most have descriptions and links to help you find a dog matching you and your circumstances. They have links to the various national and state breed clubs and rescue organizations. They work together to police their own ranks and help keep you contact reliable breeders and rescue people. Be prepared to travel or be patient. Local animals from reliable sources are not always available. I would never, ever consider any other "puppy search engines" found on the internet. In my experience most of them are backyard breeders at best and puppy mills at worst. I always visit a breeder in person or by proxy and talk to multiple references.|`|8RrNrjFPaa	My personal favorite is a Newfoundland, but they are large, 125-160 pounds, but they are gentle giants, great companions, never hyper, and great with children.  They are also great swimmers.|`|oRr9SOIqaa	I have a mini schnoodle and I love her to death! We got her shipped (perfectly safe!) and she is the sweetest, most playful and fun dog ever! Plus, she is hypoallergenic.  They have other schnoodle sizes so if you don't want a small one you should get a big one! We got her here, and there were other breeds like her also. http://www.mixedbreedpups.com/  A pic of her as a puppy:http://s414.photobucket.com/albums/pp230...

enC9TvxUaa	-Altough you'll get several opinions here, the best thing you could do is see a vet!  You're doing this, so good for you!!!!|`|cnZlMojUaa	I hope you can get some definite answers today at the vet and she has something easily treatable. You are doing the right thing to pursue this.    I an understand how worried you are though. My little dog quit eating when she had kidney failure. It is odd how your whole day revolves around just getting a few bites down.... One thing I was told to try was to add some warmed low sodium, low fat chicken broth to the kibble. Warming the broth brings out a stronger smell and may tempt her to eat. Good luck. (And make sure the broth doesn't contain any onion or onion seasoning.)|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Have they done anything in the way of x-rays or an ultrasound looking for any obstructions or growths.  I hope your pup gets her appetite back!|`|DXz6gIeuaa	Try getting her wet dog food. Or putting milk in her solid food and micro-waving it so it becomes soft. Also tell the vets to check her mouth. There could be something lodged in there that would make it uncomfortable for her to eat.|`|b51294b275ea3556e31d66e62f7ce701aa	Since you are doing the right thing and taking her to vet for tests then we cannot really offer suggestions. Your vet is the one to ask about this. It could be so many causes and the suggestions are only guess work.    Hopefully it is nothing serious and the vet will be able to diagnose and advise of further actions on her behalf.|`|SO9zZ7nzaa	It kind of sounds like it may be cancer. Loss of appetite and weight loss can be a sign of cancer. But it might be a cancer that is treatable. You need to get more tests done or find a better Vet who can actually diagnose something. The fact that your Vet has found nothing and just sent her off home, shows he/she is not taking it seriously. Seven pounds  is a lot of weight to lose when an animal is only 35 lbs.
BxkBXsocaa	it an incubator & your eggs need to be fertilized before you can hatch them.|`|xwG6e7IQaa	It's called a microwave...Yummy eggs in the morning!|`|YhH0PNupaa	If you have that many chickens, you really should learn something about them. What you are referring to is an incubator? It will only incubate fertile eggs. Honestly I think you might be better off letting your hens do the sitting if they will. Unless you plan on being a lot more educated. Incubating is a science, you can't just pop them in and expect them to hatch 21 days later. If you do decided to learn how to incubate the eggs, you can buy incubators of all kinds. Or you can make one. Visit backyardchickens.com, and you will find loads of info. I have a homemade cabinet incubator. To buy one like it would cost you around 500-600 dollars, the one I am going to purchase soon is going to be around 650. It all depends of how many you want to hatch. I can hatch over 100's at a time. I really hope you try to learn about this, even if you don't end up buying or making an incubator. Education is important, and learning should be never ending.|`|7IVrBiT1aa	Its called an incubator and there about $100-$400|`|pQEyYU7qaa	It is called a incubator and i would suggest asking your local feed store what is a good price and what is a good brand to buy. Or you can look it up on ebay. Link below.    Good luck|`|AA11640918	Its an incubator. Wouldnt you know this if you own chickens. I myself own an incubator and chickens. i absolutly love chicekens to death.    You can buyy them at tator supply company.    costs very 50 plus bucks|`|46Ni9IHKaa	first of all do you have a rooster?  If you do not have a Rooster, there is no point in buying an incubator because your chickens will not be fertile.  You have to have a rooster to get baby chicks.  Hens will lay eggs even if there is no  rooster....
XxU94aKlaa	If she can even carry these pups to term she would need a C-section, and there's a possibility even that she would not be able to properly care for these puppies due to their large size.  The best course of action here would be to go get her fixed now and abort the puppies, if you're unwilling to do this you need a good chunk of money laying around (minimum of $1,000), and time to take about a month of work.|`|RZAjrv8Xaa	No. You need to see a vet and talk about a C-section! Plus make sure she is healthy anyways. Hope for the best. You should get her fixed after this litter. Please do! Good Luck.|`|Z0v6G0Kgaa	Depends upon the size of the rat terrier (decker lines get up to 40 pounds) and the size of the pups (if they take after the dam or the sire).  But given those caveats, probably not.      None of my dogs have ever had C-sections (I've always neutered/spayed and when we were living on the farm, deliberately bred one litter from a dam and sire that were our two best working dogs--and then neutered him and spayed her).  But the two prices I've heard of for C-sections of litters were $1,200 and $1,800.  So I hope you have some cash laying around.    Second option is to have the litter aborted (most vets can do this) and then have her spayed.  That will be significantly cheaper than the C-section prices.    Third option is to do nothing, hope that she's in the 20% of females who end up with small pups regardless of a larger sire.  And if you're wrong, then be prepared for a very ugly, painful and prolonged death by the female who will be in trauma and you'll probably lose the litter as well.    Wish I could give you better news but the odds aren't good on this one, especially if your rattie is a miniature or toy.|`|24CFl7sjaa	Highly unlikely to have the pups without vet intervention, also risky to carry the pups. Id see a vet now and get them terminated and her speyed at the same time.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	absolutely not!  get her spayed and abort the pups or she will likely die whelping them. How could you let that happen?  Shame on you!|`|p7swtBYzaa	No, speak to your vet - probably better to have her spayed and the fetuses aborted before they come to term.|`|OA7cPgGNaa	Go to the vet and get your b*tch spayed. They can abort the pregnancy.    Do you really want to have your b*tch die during birth? The babies heads a lone can get stuck in the birth canal and kill her.    Do you really want to put the unborn pups at risk? A rat terrier and pit mix isn't exactly a good combo.     Do you really want to pay a $500+++ to get an emergency C-section? Pay $150 to get the puppies aborted.    You were silly for letting your b*tch out when she was in heat. I am going to HOPE she wasn't be watched. Letting a male pit (or any male) mount her and get tied up is irresponsible.     Hopefully you don't own both intact dogs. If that is the case, get them both fixed.    Ugh. This is what you are CONTRIBUTING to if you don't abort spay.    http://www.michianapetadvocacy.org/yahoo...    http://i146.photobucket.com/albums/r269/...    http://beverlytang.com/found/euthanized_...|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	No, its a small dog. She would need a vet in order to have those puppies.|`|mRevWUxlaa	It depends on how big the dogs are. She probobly will need a c-section if she carries them. How...... did this happen?
NnYB9eXiaa	Edit: You also said just *5* days ago that not only did you need parental permission to even GET a hamster, but that you're in college (which means you're very busy) and you were going to purchase a dwarf, not a Syrian.  This is NOT a GAME.  Please, I'm begging you....    NEVER EVER BREED A HAMSTER PURCHASED FROM A PETSTORE!      The fact that you just asked the age question, as well as purchasing breeding animals from a pet store shows that you aren't ready to breed.  I'm sorry if that sounds blunt, but PLEASE read my whole post.    Talk to a local breeder, see if they'll mentor you - you can't learn everything you need to know about breeding on the internet, a mentor is the best possible resource you can have - even if you find one who can mentor you VIA the internet if there isn't one near you - but please find a mentor.      Go to the library, get some books out on hamsters.      The following list may look like all negative things, and the first section IS a list of reasons not to breed unless you are completely prepared, the second section contains information you need to know if you still decide to breed.    Please keep all the following things in mind BEFORE you breed:    Don't breed if your hamsters are from a pet store.    Why?    Poor breeding causes things like shortened lifespans, susceptibility to illness, and poor temperement (i.e. aggressive hamsters).    Well bred hamsters are not aggressive; this does not mean they won't ever bite, but it does mean they won't go out of their way to bite and will be generally more receptive to handling and be quite a bit friendlier.    Second, if they are from a pet store you don't know their genetic background.    You may be passing along undesirable traits such as aggressiveness and tendencies towards cancers, illness, and physical deformities.    Third, hamsters can have 14+ babies per litter.    Selling them to a pet store guarantees their death; they will be sold as feeders for reptiles and snakes.    Unless you can line up 14+ homes ahead of time, DO NOT BREED.    Fourth: Hamsters are already seriously overpopulated in pet stores; many go for feeders, many more die before they leave the store.    Unless you have an exceptionally rare mutation, and know its (and its prospective mate's) genetic background and pedigree, you should not breed them.    There is no good reason to breed already poorly, and over bred hamsters.    Please do not breed your hamsters for their sake and the sake of any offspring.    If you want more hamsters, adopt one from a shelter, buy one from a breeder, or as a dead last resort, buy one from a pet store. [Edit from Daisy - try petfinder, freecycle and craigslist as well]    Good breeders breed to improve the temperement, health, and markings/color/coat of an animal, not just because they were able to buy a male and female.    http://www.pet-care-experts.com/archive....    ----------------------------------    Important information before making a big decision:    1. You'll need quite a few cages, bins are preferable as breeding cages but there is money involved in setting up a hamstery.    2. You generally need a room just for the hamstery, you aren't going to want a lot of disturbance with the pups or pregnant mothers - especially if you have other animals or small children in the house.    3. You'll be spending a lot of time with your hamsters, you need to make sure that you have time with school and other activities to balance this out.    4. You need to be prepared for visits to the vet.  These aren't always inexpensive visits.    5. You'll need lots of research on genetics and health history.  Good breeders breed to improve the temperement, health, and markings/color/coat of an animal.  You should never breed a hamster bought from a pet store, so you'll need to find a local breeder - perhaps they'll mentor you - again, this will take a lot of your free time.    6.  You need to make sure you have homes lined up *before* you begin breeding.  It's safe to assume a minimum of 2-4 pups and it can be upwards of 14 in a litter.      7.  You really shouldn't try to sell the pups until you've bred multiple times and built up a reputation.  This means you won't be earning money from the pups, so there will be money involved that you won't be able to recoup for awhile.    As far as the actual breeding, and logistics and all of the technical aspects of things, there are many good breeders on this site that can help you.  I'm sure one of them will chime in on that portion of things :)    Just remember, study, research, think, then breed! Try to possibly find an breeder online that will mentor you. Home breeding, when done responsibly is perfectly fine - just be sure you're ready and you start with 2 healthy animals whom you know the genetics and health history of :)|`|07qFHL6iaa	You can get a hamster, great idea. But it bugs me how little u know about them...  You need experience with a pet to breed and you need to to research more. Take my advice and get 3 syrians before you actually breed one.   Also, don't get any pet from petco. Get one from a local store that's not chain.|`|ho7Z4th3aa	normally at a good pet shop they are 4 to 6 months some other shops sell them at 1 year which is much too old. my hamster had 4 healthy babiess|`|ZxZsVUiFaa	syrian hamsters average babies are 6- 12 but some syrians have been known to have 20+    i hope you knw exactly what your doing when you breed them and should expect to see some deatch in the first litter    ssyrian hamsters are very gentle and when tamed have a very nice temperament  they are also prone to wet tail and can catch colds of humans so make sure you wash your hands when feeding it and dont hold them when you have a cold      they might even sleep in your hand   here is a video of a syrian i absolutely love  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=OQZ6WuMHr2...    goodluck with your hamster|`|jq7TWEqfaa	hey.. .syrian hamsters are really hard to breed.. it took me ages ( my girl was neva in heat)   finally they mated and she gave birth too 13 hamster. which is extemely unlikely.. but good luck x|`|BaNrweQ4aa	syrians are supposed to have quite a few babies and they should be seperated and all that; but you've obviously researched all of that :)    when i have bought my hamsters from pet shops they have been about 12 weeks old or something like that, which is really young and you pretty much have to teach them things; and get them used to you. it takes time but it's worth it :) hamsters are awesome. mine have all been around 12 weeks old; not too young and not too old.    i've never tried breeding my hamsters. it seems like a lot of hard work and way too many cages to buy :)|`|680ceb9ae3a1a539087fa7d9352af23daa	you should go in with a note pad and ask all your questions but ask if you may hold one to see how they are they will be shy but will get more friendly my gerbils are always eager to get out of the cage so give your hamster treats out of your hand and it will know that you are a nice person they can tell and now you can make your hamster the happiest hamster ever|`|v3dN1sSaaa	hiya i got all 3 of my hamsters from pets at home and they told me that when you buy them they are around 4 weeks old hope i helped|`|OjUil3fAaa	I think They Will Give The Hamster To You when Its About 5-7 months old It will have about 0-4 babies if the pregnancy goes well any more information Im Here as i have 6 syrian hamsters all in one house|`|38B9AkVjaa	when you first get them they are about 5-7 weeks old ,    if you are breeding first make sure when you are sorting it out the hamster is not stressed as it may hurt its young or kill its self.      hope i helped    x|`|SeWffWCHaa	they are about 6-9 weeks when they are being sold, it is best not to breed ones from pet shops they are forced to breed in te back of the store get them from a hamster sancuary they maybe a bit more expensive but if you want to breed then that is best or buy them of an experienced breeder and some pet shops hamsters are left overs from where people couldn't sell them

Looks like you'll have to stay with her so she tends the pup properly.    Please have her spayed so this doesn't happen again.    EDIT: Sure pampered family pets CAN make great moms.    But often they would rather be with their families than isolated with a bunch of squirmies.  Sounds like this is the case here.|`|AA11625368	how old is she? Is this her first litter?

If so, then she's new to this and doesn't really know how to take care of it properly. If she had more then one puppy, the mother will do this sometimes if the puppy is the runt of the litter. (Runt=weakest or smallest) Make sure to keep extra watchful eyes on the puppy. Even when the mother is with it. First time mothers tend to make mistakes, and we don't want anything bad to happen.|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Most young dogs wont take care of puppies.

The instint the puppie starts whining i garuntee she will be there for it. but if not just make sure that your female sleeps with it at night so the pup has the expeirence of having a mom. If your mom is young then it might not have a natural instinct. but it only hapens every once in a while. keep an eye on her and make sure the pup stays warm.|`|NMQWAFkTaa	If she is young and/or if it is her first litter. Then her mothering instincts just have not clicked in. You better start nursing it with a bottle or you will loose the puppy. Or she could possibly not be a good mother. I had a poodle want to leave her puppies at 2wks. So we got her spayed. Some dogs are not meant to be mothers.
tMlwcim8aa	It is normal. Mollies can mate several times and with several mates, and can choose when to give birth, because she stores the genetic information. Most likely, she mated with two different Male Mollies. This is normal.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	This is very common with black mollies. The exact genetics are more than we have room for here, but there are several genes controlling color in mollies, and the combination of these genes each offspring gets will determine whether it is all black, black speckled, gold, or gray (gray is the common wild type).    As for your second question, ask your mail carrier.  I'd look to the meter reader, though, if I were you.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	its normal|`|QbcnDDxUaa	Fortunately Mollies of all types are extremely easy to breed and will breed freely in any aquarium. different types of mollies can be crossed together as they are all the same species. It would be very interesting to cross fish such as a Dalmation with a Black molly like you said or a Gold Dust molly with a Silver lyretail, just to see the outcome of the fry. Be very careful though, or you will be overrun with many, many babies in just a month or two depending upon how many female mollies you have.     With Mollies, you have to get to know each individual's behavior just before they give birth so you can watch for it next time and be ready. Some females may stand out in the open and drop their fry. But most of them tend to seperate themselves from the rest of the others in the aquarium and may hide themselves in plants or other secretive areas.|`|xvQHCNwmaa	That whore!!!!      ;-)
Gta9wO3taa	I am not sure, but I think its only for freshwater. I would buy a cheap 20 gallon tank for quarantine. Tangs are know to take down whole tanks with their sicknesses.     Ten gallons is not enough for a quarantine. It stresses the fish out and makes more harm than not quarantining. What is your tanks info ie: water quality and size?

Other causes are cardiomyopathy and also hairballs in an attempt to expell them.    http://cats.suite101.com/article.cfm/rea...

Ulff1hcDaa	I add a little of the water from a can of tuna and my dogs love it!|`|6qsocyK3aa	I've just had the exact same problem! The trick is to experiment. Try adding a little water and microwaving it as this makes it more aromatic and dogs are mainly attracted to things by scent. I ended up mixing in wet food, grated cheese, gravy, dairy free spread and leftover black pudding with the dry food before my dog would eat it.|`|a1343f058c3dec40fe918611b8bc0ceaaa	add warm water to the food.|`|Ke7eHQTRaa	add warm water or ceaser mushy dog food|`|OA7cPgGNaa	Being in animal rescue, many dogs come in and aren't interested in their food. They may be depressed and scared. Though I highly doubt your dog is like this, its important that they eat their food.    Try these.    1. Moisten the food by adding Lukewarm water. Add enough so his kibble is barely floating. Let it sit for a minute until the dry food gets a little softer and starts to expand and then give this to your dog.  OR  2. Add a tablespoon of plain, low-fat yogurt. The probiotics and live cultures are great for the intestines and stomach! This will not upset their stomach and its a great treat!  OR  3. Try moistening the food with low sodium chicken-broth (diluted with some water) in the kibble. Or, you can try low sodium beef-stock. Do what you would do with step 1 by letting it sit for a minute so it gets the dry kibble soft.    Give any of these 3 options to your dog. Put the food bowl down and walk off. If after 15 minutes he still isn't interested, pick it up. Sometimes dogs go through spells where they just aren't hungry. Eventually he will get hungry enough and gobble it down.    If after 3-4 days your dog is not eating any of the above tips, see your vet.|`|Wvb08bniaa	Dry Dog foods are really good food for your dogs. You must check this before buying any dry dog foods ------->    Remember that protein, ideally, according to an experienced specialist in animal nutrition, should be listed as at least 30 percent.  Keep in mind that dogs utilize fat well and some nutrition specialists think that at least 18 percent is ideal.       Moreover, you may check dry dog food product that follows all above stated nutrition.    Check this one >>> http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c3...|`|NMQWAFkTaa	Add water or I heard adding a little bit of garlic works and then warming the food. So it will have a smell. Dogs like smelly foods.|`|loEiJ241aa	Same with my dogs. they arent wanting the dry food. they have wet food but that gives them diarhea. and we have tryed over 40 different brands of dog food. but i would guess that not feeding them during the day would help. like if you feed them in the morning at like 7-12 any time between that. then at like 5-8. then they will want to eat and they will maybe eat it. That is what my vet told me and they are only supposed to have 20 minutes to eat. My dogs dont really care about haveing to eat at 7 then at 6 because my brother feeds them table scraps and everything between the times.|`|8ss15aSOaa	We had 2 labs that were best buddies.  When one died the other completely stopped eating and started to lose weight rapidly.  Concered, we consulted the vet.  He recommended we cook him up a stew that would be tasty and provide the ncessary nutrition he needed.  The stew consiseted of chicken and assorted veggies.  Consult your vet to get the proper mix for your breed.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	try a different food.  what are you feeding now?  try a brand without any corn, wheat, soy, by products, or digest in it.    example:  when we adopted our big dog she was eating nutro lamb and rice.  she would eat it, but it would take her awhile.  she would pick at it and walk away from it several times before eating all of it.  we changed her to california natural and she actually gets excited about meal times and eats it all in one sitting.    also, make sure it is an appropriate sized kibble for your dog.  this more applies to small dogs.    feeding your dog in meals will help also (as opposed to free feeding).  and make sure you are not over feeding.|`|l3uwgV29aa	add warm chicken or beef broth to you dogs food. it gives them more protein and makes it more yummy!!!!    i always add warm broth to my dogs food, she LOVES it!! even my vet recommended it!!

TSc8OE4vaa	I like his eye and his legs.  His legs look good and solid and he looks like he'll stay sound.  I like his hooves and his chest looks good.    He's a bit too thin, his wither juts up and I'm not a fan of that shoulder- high shoulders like that sometimes make gaits choppy.  Another problem with such a high shoulder is that it might give him a sway back when he's a bit older.  He has a bit of a ewe neck too.  His body is a bit too long, that will make it hard for him to make tight turns.    Looking at his pedigree, he is Impressive bred.  Just from looking, there is a 1/8 chance that he has HYPP, the disease that impressive had because Impressive is his great grandfather.  Get him tested for HYPP asap.  HYPP is a very bad disease which can be extremely harmful to your horse.  There is a very slim chance he has it (12.5% chance) but it is possible because of his pedigree.    http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/hypp...    All in all, he looks like a solid trail/pleasure horse, probably won't do well at barrels because he's so long but might be good for western pleasure.  I like him, he has a kind eye and a good expression.|`|AA10986942	Point missed..... if this horse is registered it has to be tested for HYPP.  The results will be stamped on his papers  If he is good for you and you love him you are lucky to have such a wonderful horse.  Why do some of you always have to be so negative when someone asks for thoughts on their horse?  If she is not showing him who cares if his back is a little long ect ect....  what counts if you are not showing is a lot different than if you are getting a horse that needs to perform in front of judges.

44kEtDvIaa	Ball Python, Corn, Milk or King snakes.  And their natuarl diets do include mice, so you're not going to totally get away from this.  Check site below for more info on snakes, their care & feeding and health issues.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	I would recommend a garter snake. They get to a max of about 2 ft and can eat live rosy red minnows from a shallow bowl of water. If you want a snake that doesn't eat other animals, then get a toy snake.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	Why can't it feed on mice or rats? I know it's kind of gross, and sad... but now your snake breeds are very limited. I have garter snakes all over at my camp, and personally I don't find them very attractive snakes. They might be wonderful pets, who knows, but personally I don't like them. You should maybe consider feeding frozen/thawed mice. It's not sad, or gross really. They come in nice little baggies, you place the baggie in hot/warm water and feed it to your snake off tongs. Also, feeding something like a garter snake is a lot harder than a rodent eating snake.  If you do happen to reconsider, I suggest a corn snake to you. I only have a ball python, but you might find them too big. Corn snakes come in a bunch of different colours, and stay a manageable size.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	you are really limiting yourself not wanting 1 that doesnt eat mice and rats.almost all of them do.garter snakes would probably be your best choice then ,but i know nothing of them.others all you do is buy frozen mice and thaw it out.its not as bad as it sounds.then your options would be endless.there are some-my honduran milk snake that like lizards-but that gets expensive,just got him changed over.|`|jDPULfjKaa	your only option is a garter snake, being as it is all other domestic pet snakes are rodent eaters.

H20Qz1Tvaa	Eh, I would put it off. I've had two cats living in one room before and it makes them kind of crazy.|`|zeTGmB3faa	Cats don't like to be confined to only one room. I would wait until you a space that is all yours so the cats have room to run, play and explore.|`|dc62df18143b5ef5e34608a91b490411aa	Hi!<br>  <br>  I have two cats which I have adopted two years ago when they are 7 - 9 months old. Most of the time I keep them in my room, door closed, window meshed up. They are ok with it, very healthy and still playful.<br>  My room is small. About 4m x 6m.<br>  <br>  When there is no human traffic at night, I let them out of the room within my house everyday from about 1am to 6am -- sometimes shorter or not at all. I closed all doors and windows -- leaving a small gap at the edge.<br>  <br>  When my brother and family comes to my house to stay, I "confine" the kitties in mu room. This "confinement" can be up to 2 weeks. Totally fine and no diiference in their behaviour. I actually believe I can keep them in the room forever without any problem to their mental and physical health. When I am in the room after work I play with them.<br>  I have tall cat tree that lead all the way up to the top of my ceiling and bookshelf, hence they have the vertical space in addition to the follor space.<br>  <br>  I guess my kitties are able to do that because they started to live with me since young. Older cats might find it hard if you try to change thier routine to the one I have for my kitties (e.g. outdoor to indoor).<br>  <br>  As for the room smell? No, my room does not smell. I feed them raw meat and keep the litter box in the room. Fresh or freashly thawned raw meat actually have very very faint smell. I used to feed my cat dry and can food and those smell ARE strong. If you can change little it once a day, there should not be any smell at all in the room.<br>  <br>  Trust me. I have the same exact concern that you have when I am thinking about keeping cats. But I know my method is fine.<br>  <br>  Let me know!!<br>  <br>  Thanks!<br>  Sim|`|yLiOgVEYaa	well, it will work. but they might be a little cooped up. i would just get one if that's all the space it will have.|`|GNq2rmrNaa	its not really ok they would like to get outside and explore|`|QL56syElaa	Yea one would do..plus you don't want you room to start smelling!
wLgGD63raa	If it's already falling off it will more than likely come off the rest of the way on it's own. If it is due to stuck skin from previous sheds I would soak it in luke warm water for a couple of minute. Also apply a triple antibiotic WITHOUT PAIN RELIEVER to the area and switch your substrate to something solid like paper towel so you can monitor it and make sure it doesn't become infected.|`|NX9eLbNuaa	did he possibly have trouble shedding last time? just let the tip fall off on its own accord its the safe way.

Assuming you are just using earbuds. Yes, there is the danger it could get caught on something, or wrap around your throat if you fell, but such things are slim. Assuming you keep it low, you can still hear the things around you, then there shouldn't be much wrong.|`|zj8HLXI3aa	listen to "ghetto cowboy" har har har|`|6irSIW7xaa	it's fine but I like to only put one headphone in so I can still concentrait on my horse.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	Yeah! I do!|`|xzJi0bcSaa	I wouldn't recommend it, if you fall off (which could happen because you are more distracted) you can break it (aside from the obvious problem of falling off). I prefer to have a radio on when I ride, that way I don't have to worry about anything and can tune it out if needed. My theory is that if you wouldn't do it while driving, (headphones are illegal in a lot of states), you shouldn't do it while riding. Hope that helps!|`|wk94gNnWaa	I think it's fine. As long as you can keep aware through your eyes and are on a very reliable, safe horse in an enclosed space. If you are out with someone, either turn the music down low or only have it in one ear. If you do the second, make sure it's tucked in somewhere and that the rest of the cord is secured too. So, if you have a mishap you don't get caught nor need a new ipod.<br>  <br>  Of course, just judge the situation. If you're on a nervous horse (or even one you don't know completely) you shouldn't consider it. Your hearing could help prepare you on with better judgement in a noisy or windy situation.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps and good luck. (:|`|TTLIp8Beaa	i do sometimes XD<br>  but only when i'm working my horse alone and i keep the volume on low.<br>  if your with other riders then no, especially because you have to talk to one another so there aren't any accidents. <br>  also, the reason for keeping the volume on low is because there are things you can't hear with the volume up that might spook your horse. (dogs barking, cars back firing, an atv revving.)<br>  as long as it doesn't interfere with your focus and you follow the above i don't see a problem with it.|`|5rEWdAuxaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with that BUT:<br>  1. Make sure to keep the volume down low so you can hear for things and still concentrate on what you are doing. Make sure the iPod is on tight.<br>  2. Only use it if you are sure your horse wont spook. <br>  3. Only use it when you are alone. When riding with other people you should always be talking to them and checking for danger. <br>  I dont though because I would much rather hear my horse's hhoof beats|`|uDl5lUtdaa	I don't see anything wrong with it if you're just going for a "joy ride", but if you're practicing for something..I would at least leave one headphone off so you can stay more in-tune with your horse.  <br>  After all, they have those shows where people ride their horses to music..kind of like making them dance to it (not sure what they're called :)) so I guess they have to practice for those somehow, right?|`|RQWyYV6Laa	It depends how experienced you are.

XJEGTZJqaa	The answer to your question is very simple. Pets have unlimited love, and are not afraid of you. Pets are always there for you and help your deprissional issues with calming you down. Pets also are happy when you love them. So it gives you the feeling of loving your pet.|`|VwmaWcp9aa	Because they give unconditional love.|`|SK4qj3ZEaa	Because they are their for you no matter what.|`|EUGoxWXuaa	because they cant talk back and they need you
ncPT0jnVaa	Why aren't you sad?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't blame this on bad luck: I'd blame it on not having an indoor cat. Outdoor cats are much much much more likely to die younger. <br>  <br>  Fat? Indoor cats still have to exercise. <br>  <br>  Talk to your vet.<br>  <br>  And the "having the cat choose its own name by walking on a paper" thing works pretty well.<br>  <br>  You still might want to consider a fish.|`|Nt7exGYAaa	Perhaps you should give it a rest for a while before getting another cat.<br>  <br>  An overweight cat isn't a healthy cat and would undoubtedly have had health issues.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Maybe you should not get any more cats you sound like a bad luck type of person.|`|aysOuR83aa	Maybe you should get a fish.|`|B0x2zJvyaa	I would name it Runts or Starburst|`|fQbvlAWWaa	wel maybe you sould stop getting cat cause its just not working....you sould try a dog... maybe dat will work.|`|kHEFi3ttaa	Wow... I've had a lot of cats (try over 30 (I've taken in lots of strays)) and I've never used the same name twice. I'd name the new cat a different name, or try a hamster this time.|`|CdRlOsnyaa	i would stop with the skittles it sounds like that name has been tabooed. but hey cats have 9 lives so work you way up to skittles nine if you have to. sorr yabout your cats|`|SVuYaK8maa	Be careful of fish.  Mine just had babies.  Silly thing just had some less then 2 months ago.  They need safe sex!! <br>  <br>  But really you could let the cat chose.  Place it in front of two pice of paper one with a new name on with skittles5.  Let the cat pick.|`|rUMGPXqwaa	dont name it skittle! bad juju! get a whole new kitty and a different color and size and everything and name it differently. dont let it outside!!!|`|zopegiT4aa	Taste the rainbow....<br>  <br>  maybe you should stop letting your cats go outside...mine are all indoor cats b/c I don't want them to be cold, wet, run away, or get hit by a car.|`|vqmainCJaa	id stop naming the cat skittles<br>  name it another candy :)
i94Vpk47aa	Cats usually get upper respiratory track infections, usually it's viral. I would recommend taking her to get antibiotics just make sure no secondary bacterial infection occurs but most of the time their immune system has to ride it out. I would defiantly make sure her appetite still stays good b/c most cats when they can't smell don't eat. Maybe you should spoil her with some canned food or you can try a meat flavored baby food. <br>  You are right in that it could be allergies either way your vet will be able to tell you what's happening.|`|zAhBlMQLaa	Most probably, but there are other causes why cat sneeze. Maybe it is due to foreign objects that clogs her nose or allergies that makes your cats nose irritated. Observe your cat for any discharges that comes out from her nostrils. And always seek vet advice for any problems regarding your pet.|`|ufypilYZaa	Hey SFF<br>  <br>  Your cat may be sneezing because of dust of any other impurities aroundher bed, just get it cleaned and try for some more reliable cleaner like crypton. Your cat will like that and get well soon<br>  <br>  All the best for her|`|bkr5Nm6aaa	Cats have very sensitive nasal passage. it is advisable to take him to a vet just in case he has a problem . i found the following link would help you a lot. <br>  <a href="http://www.cat-health-behavior.com/why-cats-sneeze.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cat-health-behavior.com/why-c...</a>|`|sa5bBAdsaa	probably|`|KLMo9jbzaa	You shouldn't think if your cat is sick, if you really want to help it. Take it to a Vet.
wq6lfHIBaa	take her to the vet now, usually they will keep the pet until they get your payment....if you are only waiting to get your bf's check then take her in asap and then just pay them when you pick her up!!!! If the infection spreads it wont be good!!!! best wishes and prayers your way!|`|gpEoXZNtaa	sounds like she may have got hit by a car and the wound got infected or could just be a simple apses sorry don't know how to spell it but your sister should use a stick and gently push the cat where someone can grab her and take her to the vet. hope this helps|`|5uLDqE0maa	It sounds like she may have an infection of some sort in her mouth. This would cause her to not eat and be painful around the face. You are right to be concerned and it is very nice of you to offer to take her to the vet.|`|wEiHz1Llaa	Blood Tests- Blood tests- Oh ASAP, she is Definitely sick ! And or possible x-ray ? I don't know where you live- but I'm in Ontario- Niagara Region. Here we help people with Costs for Sick Cats, through Animal Assistance  Society. If you are in my area- and need help- give me a shout ! <br>                      Good Luck !! Chewy and HipHop .
dPRWWDazaa	ebay<br>  we sold all our saddles on ebay they can be quite cheap because ebay is were everything cheap is.|`|5M57TTfpaa	thats just where i was going to say to look, so im no help. is there a used tack shop or something in your area? maybe some sort or flea market? i have seen saddles in flea markets around here, but it might be hard finding an exact saddle.... not sure|`|WVyP2I4saa	Definitely check with your local 4H clubs.  Our club holds a used tack sale yearly.  You could also place a "wanted" add in trade papers and online.|`|yKGKsWMsaa	thats what I would say to use but you all ready looked there.........sorry :(|`|b4UXXXp9aa	Are you sure that you want a Bob Marshall?  I barrel and pole race and 2 years ago I bought a Crumrine saddle.  I always liked Billy Cooks, but this Crumrine that I got I LOVE.  It is very light weight but yet it has enough support and padding so that it won't be uncomfortable for you or your horse!  Look them up online.  I purchased mine from two friends of mine that also barrel race Vic & Christa Conway.  They sell the saddles and are very helpful and willing to aid you in picking the right one!|`|bcdd4f8be0919abf4d12a2ad2a87de6caa	Usually feed stores will have some used saddles.  Also check with any local boarding stables or if you have a fairgrounds in your area they will often have people advertising on a bulletin board. Your local 4H may also be able to give you some information.  I've heard of some good deals through the breeding ranches too.  Good Luck!|`|u65h6DN6aa	Check at your nearest saddlery, feed stores etc as they usually have used saddles for sale. Also you could post a wanted ad for it, you never know, someone might reply to it!!!|`|xi6avrGgaa	I think you can get your required saddle from Saddleonline Inc, which specializes in Quality Western Saddles, English Saddles, Horse Saddles, and Pony Saddles. Try this.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|b299edc40bfec7da51e76575d6b08d9daa	keep checking craigs list, but have you tried boarders and breeders I'll bet someone has one sitting in barn closet etc that they would be glad to sell you
uVBrBGh1aa	yes you can feed them bread,  but you cant feed them only bread.  they still need their regular food.  you can feed them cooked meats like chicken beef pork shrimp, but try to stay away from bacon hot dogs and sandwich meats.  avocado and chocolate. for the most part they can have anything you eat only in small portions.  try not to do many sweets unless they are some kind of real fruit treat or something.  but im sure a nilla wafer now and then wouldnt hurt either.|`|yMbw0Osnaa	as OR said.whole grain breads are ok.but everything in moderation.i sometimes give mine toasted whole grain bread just to make it different for them.a quarter slice for a pair of budgies is plenty.more for bigger parrots.a small amount of cooked pasta is also enjoyed|`|dlOiB0cyaa	Yes you can. Parrots love breads and pasta. Just remember to feed foods like that in very small amounts/moderation.|`|iiKZYO6kaa	ya u can|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	yes you can but it's not good for them, processed flours, sugars and such.<br>  <br>  100% natural organic whole grains, beans, and whole foods are excellent for them. fruits too. just be cautions and know what is safe and what is not safe before you do this.|`|beTBfCkTaa	sure.
6KxBqnstaa	Most hawks go after bigger prey than a cockatiel. They go for Doves and pigeons as a rule. But a smaller hawk could show interest I imagine. I would worry more about bully birds which will chase it out or hurt it to get it out of their territory as they do not recognize it. I would put up posters and talk with people as often the lost bird will look for food source and end up in someones back yard that feeds birds.|`|dlOiB0cyaa	Did he get away somehow? If so, hawks will not be the only predators. If he got away and his wings where not clipped, well, his chances wouldn't be good.<br>  But nonetheless I hope you find your cockatiel! <3|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Unfortunatly any domesticated bird in the wild for that long has little chance of survival.  This is especially try when there are a large number of predators.|`|a9566babe49bd6c6c2241df582840786aa	Erg, I am sad to say not very good. Besides predators like hawks domestic birds have trouble finding adequate food and shelter. If he became desperate and searched out human help he's probably in good shape but otherwise chances are slim. <br>  It also depends on your area though. We live near a bunch of school and there is always extra food laying around so the school behind us now has a flock(25) of wild cockatiels that fly around making noise.<br>  We mainly have kestrels here which are tiny hawks so they most likely wouldn't go after them.
nugOKrqaaa	well i do know they eat bugs. thats a start! and i think they are really cool, them and walking sticks!  my best guess would be an aquarium with a screened in top.grass or hay/straw for bedding, and feed them lots of bugs. flys,grubs,crickets etc. good luck and let me know how it works out. might wanna have a few for pets myself!
Z31SvRXqaa	Hey sweetie!  It sounds like a cataract to me!  I have had this happen before but my hamster didn't seem to be blind.  He had it on both eyes but could still get away from me without bumping into things and find everything with no problem!  It could have been his senses but it really seemed like he could see to me!!|`|gpEoXZNtaa	2 is like a 90 year old man so if he just got it it might me cater act meaning he is going blind watch it and if it gets bigger and turns white it most like is cater act|`|3tiH3rEZaa	Im sorry to say that he might be going blind in that eye
3pEqG4ewaa	if they are young.. its kinda normal. to "practice" and establish position in the pack|`|P4yttgPoaa	when some dogs get fixed they feel a little weird so maybe he is just trying to cheer her up. it will probably end in a few days but you should get him fixed as well|`|7HTke81zaa	He dose it now because he did it before. Don't worry it will stop soon once he notices ! Some dogs stop right away some don't it just depends on the dog!|`|mVM7DYPZaa	he's horney, have him fixed
