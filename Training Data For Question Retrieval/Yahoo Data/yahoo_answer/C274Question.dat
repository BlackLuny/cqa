20090219230116AAwsJlu	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Really Funny Joke xD?	Brian invited his mother over for dinner. During the course of the    meal, Brian 's mother couldn't help but notice how beautiful Brian 's    roommate, Jennifer, was. Brian 's Mom had long been suspicious of the platonic    relationship between Brian and Jennifer, and this had only made her    more curious.    Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between Brian and Jennifer than met the eye.      Reading his mom's thoughts, Brian volunteered, 'I know what you must    be thinking, but I assure you Jennifer and I are just roommates.'       About a week later, Jennifer came to Brian saying, 'Ever since your    mother    came to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy   ladle.   You don't suppose she took it, do you?'       Brian said, 'Well, I doubt it, but I'll send her an e-mail just to be    sure.    So he sat down and wrote:    Dear Mom,   I'm not saying that you 'did' take the gravy ladle from the house,    I'm not saying that you 'did not' take the gravy ladle. But the fact remains    that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.   Love, Brian   Several days later, Brian received an email back from his mother that read:    Dear Son,    I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with Jennifer, I'm not saying that    you 'do not' sleep with Jennifer. But the fact remains that if Jennifer    is sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now.   Love, Mom       LESSON OF THE DAY - NEVER LIE TO YOUR MOTHER

20090219230615AABfFUB	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Jon and Kate Plus 8 new house -- what do you think?	Here are pictures of their new house:    http://tv.popcrunch.com/jon-and-kate-plu...       I haven't kept up with the show for the past few months, but I had heard they moved into a new house.  So I looked it up and this is what I see.  I was shocked -- and disgusted frankly.  I used to LOVE the show because they seemed so down to earth and like a real family living in amazing circumstances.  But now they seem like a huge sell-out -- exploiting their children now to live in a million dollar extravagant mansion.  I just don't think I can watch the show anymore.  They are no different than Nadya Suleman and her octuplets now in my mind.  It's no wonder she wanted to have all those babies after seeing what a money pit having all those children can be if you land your own reality show.  It's just very disappointing to me how Jon and Kate have changed.        Any opinions?

I'm looking for this song that I recently thought about, but can't find anything on it through extensive research. It's by some San Francisco rapper from the Mission district, young kid, something like that. The title I think has to be something like 'the bay', 'born in the bay' or something like that but I've found nothing. anyways, the lyrics go:      "I was born in the bay with the seals and the fishes   raised by a pack of sharks taught to be vicious   came upon the land and now I'm living in the mission   but I'm still cold watered at heart, I never listen."      You'd think that if I had the chorus down, someone would have lyrics posted but no.

Hey guys, ok so a while ago i was having a look around my local borders store and i saw a picture of what i presumed was an anime or manga that looked quite interesting. I dont know what it's called, or what it's even about but i recall that there was an anime picture of the cover of a boy with a baseball cap on who kinda looked transparen-tish and had a hockey stick in his hand, or was it a baseball bat?? one of the two..lol. I'm pretty sure that he has a smug look on his face too and looks like he's giving the "evils" hardout Lol!. It's been ages since i've seen that picture, and i hope my description is fairly accurate, i'm just curious to know what it is called and what it's about, coz i wouldn't mind watching it (or reading if it's Manga) . Can anyone help me figure it out? your help will be much appreciated. Thankyou

20090220003852AAZ3grn	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	A joke in memory of Vampire Bat do you like..Once upon a time there was a famous sea captain Max Power?	. Captain Max was very successful at what he did; for years he guided merchant ships all over the world. Never did stormy seas or pirates get the best of him. He was admired by his crew and fellow captains.   However, there was one thing different about this captain. Every morning he went through a strange ritual. He would lock himself in his captain's quarters and open a small safe. In the safe was an envelope with a piece of paper inside. He would stare at the paper for a minute, then lock it back up. After, he would go about his daily duties. For years this went on, and his crew became very curious. Was it a treasure map? Was it a letter from a long lost love? Everyone speculated on the contents of the strange envelope.         One day Captain Max died at sea. After laying the captain's body to rest, the first mate led the entire crew into the captains quarters. He opened the safe, got the envelope, opened it and...   The first mate turned pale and showed the paper to the others. Four words were on the paper, two on two lines:   ``Port = Left, Starboard = Right''

20090220004711AArbrRe	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Heard the jokes about the 6 affairs?	The 1st Affair    A married man was having an affair    with his secretary.    One day they went to her place    and made love all afternoon.    Exhausted, they fell asleep    and woke up at 8 PM.    The man hurriedly dressed    and told his lover to take his shoes    outside and rub them in the grass and dirt.    He put on his shoes and drove home.    'Where have you been?' his wife demanded.    'I can't lie to you,' he replied,    'I'm having an affair with my secretary.    We had sex all afternoon.'    She looked down at his shoes and said:    'You lying bastard!    You've been playing golf!'       The 2nd Affair    A middle-aged couple had two beautiful daughters    but always talked about having a son.    They decided to try one last time    for the son they always wanted.    The wife got pregnant    and delivered a healthy baby boy.    The joyful father rushed to the nursery    to see his new son.    He was horrified at the ugliest child    he had ever seen.    He told his wife: 'There's no way I can    be the father of this baby.    Look at the two beautiful daughters I fathered!    Have you been fooling around behind my back?'    The wife smiled sweetly and replied:    'No, not this time!'       The 3rd Affair    A mortician was working late one night.    He examined the body of Mr. Schwartz,    about to be cremated,    and made a startling discovery.    Schwartz had the largest private part    he had ever seen!    'I'm sorry Mr. Schwartz,' the mortician    commented, 'I can't allow you to be cremated    with such an impressive private part.    It must be saved for posterity.'    So, he removed it,    stuffed it into his briefcase,    and took it home.    'I have something to show    you won't believe,' he said to his wife,    opening his briefcase.    'My God!' the wife exclaimed,    'Schwartz is dead!'       The 4th Affair    A woman was in bed with her lover    when she heard her husband    opening the front door.    'Hurry,' she said, 'stand in the corner.'    She rubbed baby oil all over him,    then dusted him with talcum powder.    'Don't move until I tell you,'    she said. 'Pretend you're a statue.'    'What's this?' the husband inquired    as he entered the room.    'Oh it's a statue,' she replied.    'The Smiths bought one and I liked it    so I got one for us, too.'    No more was said,    not even when they went to bed.    Around 2 AM the husband got up,    went to the kitchen and returned    with a sandwich and a beer.    'Here,' he said to the statue, have this.    I stood like that for two days at the Smiths    and nobody offered me a damned thing.'       The 5th Affair    A man walked into a cafe,    went to the bar and ordered a beer.    'Certainly, Sir, that'll be one cent.'    'One Cent?' the man exclaimed.    He glanced at the menu and asked:    'How much for a nice juicy steak    and a bottle of wine?'    'A nickel,' the barman replied.    'A nickel?' exclaimed the man.    'Where's the guy who owns this place?'    The bartender replied:    'Upstairs, with my wife.'    The man asked: 'What's he doing upstairs    with your wife?'    The bartender replied:    'The same thing I'm doing    to his business down here.'       The 6th Affair    Jake was dying. His wife sat at the bedside.    He looked up and said weakly:    'I have something I must confess.'    'There's no need to, 'his wife replied.    'No,' he insisted,    'I want to die in peace.    I slept with your sister, your best friend,    her best friend, and your mother!'    'I know,' she replied.    'Now just rest and let the poison work.'

Who do you think will win? Devon Aoki is wearing scarlet red Elektra leather costume and armed with two Sais and maybe a Katana hidden somewhere in her not-much of a garment, and McGowan is wearing.. well, Red Sonja outfit with two piece bikini scales and armed with a Conan-like sword.

20090220003940AAm9vHx	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	What are the greatest weaknesses of Jupiter in Gemini?	I have Jupiter in Gemini and I've been trying to work on some of my least favorable behaviors associated with the planet's placement and I want to know what you think is the placement's biggest weaknesses are and how one with this placement can improve themselves.   SO PLEASE!!!  HELP!!!         I've been studying astrology on and off for 4 years and I've known since I started about this placement in my chart.  But not until now have I seriously tried to do something about it, to change myself for the better permanently.      I figured since Jupiter is the ruler of saggitarius and pisces I would try to expand on those traits in my personality, but I've felt as though I've been doing so in vein.      So I thought maybe Instead of acting in ways that's not natural for me I woulod instead act out parts of me or my chart that are. So...  looking at my chart I have saturn and uranus in sag and mars in pisces.  I thought I could learn to express one of those planets more fluently in place of my jupiter.  Or more clearly, I was excited and feeling adventurous I would act out my sag planets or depressed and sensitive I would us my pisces mars, but It never really worked out.      I decided a week ago that I would act on my moon in cancer in the twelfth house, being jupiter is exalted in cancer, and see how that goes but I'm not sure if that's a good idea either.  So far though I've seen more luck and happy times though, even if it is only a week. :)      So basically I want to be more jupiterian and wish to do it by expressing my moon in cancer more-being sensitive, nurturing, loyal, more perceptive to moods.      Do you think it's a good idea?  Should I stick to my gemini tendencies?  PLEASE HELP ME!!!I'm a good person wanting to better myself!!!!

I am 15 years old   im not just another one of those kids who want the job just for the fame it really is my passion and there is no other job i can see my self doing.      please dont tell me you need to get an agent because that is not true. i know a producer and he told me once i get some experience he will try to get me on some projects he is working on. He has done many things like hannah montana, that's so raven, the suite life of zach and Cody and also some stuff on lifetime like the nanny. now here is where the problem kinda is, im home schooled so i cant take theatre. i told the producer that and he told me to try to get in stuff where you dont need experience like being in commercials or an extra. i had an appointment to meet with this one agency in orange county that would help me get into big names but i never found the place so eventually my mom said we had to go home and they never called me again. i always look in my local penny saver and i always see extra no experience needed but they always want money so i think there are scams.my mom supports my dream and i really wish i could take some lessons for piano, guitar, and drums oh yea and vocal lessons but with the economy so bad right now we only have money to pay the bills and other basic necessities since they lowered my dads pay check.      please no rude comments.      thank you all

I am new to techno and have heard a few songs, but am looking for new bands to listen to. Here is what I have enjoyed:   I really enjoy Mysto & Pizzi's remix of Somebody's watching me & Love Lockdown      I enjoy The prodigy.      I never Thought of NIN as "techno" but I adore them and the electronica beats and sounds they use, I would enjoy a band that did sound like that as well.      I like the song Escape by Dj KayCee (The fast remix)   Yakooza - Cocaine and ecstasy   PPK  resurrection   I enjoy a lot of the sound behind Darude, but don't really like him singing with it.        I don't much like talking in my techno, I enjoy good dance beats and trance like music that sort of makes me feel like I'm "tripping". If you know what I mean...      So if anyone could please throw some good recommendations based on what I have given you then I would appreciate it. Thanks

20070508110847AAcsNbe	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What did you think of Blood Diamond???	I thought it was amazingly good. It was a very accurate story based in facts but at the same time it was a very real heartfelt story that was very believable and tapped in to all of our emotions. I thought it was very well-done. I got a tear in my eye when Dia held the gun up to Solomon. The pain in both of their eyes was just tragic. The actor who played Solomon was very good and played such a vulnerable character that you wanted to help him. He is amazing. Overall, i think ppl really do need to think about what their jewels means to them...it's silly to want something only to look a certain way, feel special..when you know where and how we get them here to our safe little world..where nothing matters but what we have. I reccommend this movie to everyone! A+++

I was working today in the Recovery Room at the hospital when a woman came to the nurse's station asking where a patient was located. She proceeded to tell me that his name was Mi Wang and that she was sorry she was running so late.    “No big deal” I said, “I can help you find him.”      Anyway, I searched the bed roster thoroughly but my search came up empty. I thought perhaps the woman made a mistake, but she assured me that he was here. Well, because the computer was no help, I decided to physically look for him. Perhaps he just transferred here but wasn’t put in the system yet.      So I decided to go up the halls and search room by room to find him. Well, that was pointless. No luck finding Mi Wang.      I began to think that maybe people knew of this person because when I asked them if they had seen Mi Wang or knew of Mi Wang - they all began to act funny!

Por favor! se los suplico, se los imploro, :D este sujeto es el mejor comico de todos los tiempos y a mi nunca me ha dejado de hacer reir cuando era peque?o (a pesar que estaba restringido para menores de edad creo, por su contenido) hasta el dia de hoy. Pero tengo viendo el unico DVD que compre hace mucho por un rincón de mi pais (Peru por cierto) ya mucho tiempo y quisiera gozar de más de esas parodias, imitaciones, skechts y otros pero el problema es que no encuentro videos de él aqui en mi pais, si alguien fuese tan amable (os suplico de verdad) de brindame alguna dirección, o si me obsequiara via este medio tan util (internet-chat) otras secuencias de este gran personaje de la comicidad que yo considero asi.   De antemano se los agradezco por los archivos.

20070213235045AAaPENb	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Who would win Inu Yasha vs Sesshomaru?	I think the answer is obvious.  Sesshomaru.  It's not a question of good or evil.  It's whos a better fighter with more abilities that would come out on top.  First off Sesshomaru is a full blooded demon with many more years experience.  He also has the upper hand in abilities.  Not to mention is intelligence when it comes to battle and the ability to remain calm.  All those things which he posses Inu Yasha lacks.  Inu Yasha is not a brilliant tactician and all he does is scream "wind scar".  Not to mention he's impetuant and ignorant.  True his Tesiaga is the most powerful weapon but I still don't think it's enough to defeat Sesshomaru.  Also it is made clear that Sesshomaru is suppose to be the strongest demon along with Naraku.  Let me know what you think.

Now I wake at night and call your name(baby)   And I reach for you again.      CHORUS   Every time you leave it's like the last time   Every time you go along the way,   Something in my heart will let it happen   How can I make you stay?   Every now and then I hear you whisper   Every time I look you disappear,   Your the only one I've ever cared for   How can I make you stay?      Happens every time I close my eyes   Forever read within my dreams.   Holding hands beneath a golden sun   Don't you know I'm still in love   But oh so sorry I wronged for you   Little me with my broken heart      THEN CHORUS AGAIN

Voy a contarles mi historia, no es una historia de amor ni tiene un final    feliz, pero es la única que tengo por haber nacido así, feo, muy feo.      Cuando nací, el doctor fue a la sala de espera y le dijo a mi padre, "hicimos lo    que pudimos, pero salió".      Mi mamá no sabía si quedarse conmigo o con la placenta.      Como era prematuro me metieron en una incubadora, con vidrios polarizados.      Mi madre nunca me dio el pecho porque decía que sólo me quería como amigo. Así que en vez de darme el pecho, me daba la espalda.      Es por eso que debo haber quedado petiso, tan petiso que en lugar de ser enano, soy profundo.

John Travolta has recently spoken out and said that he feels a lot of school violence/shootings were caused by the prescription anti-depressants the students were on. It is true there have been many kids/teens who became suicidal while on depression meds. . .and supposedly MOST of the teens involved in school shootings were on some form of anti-depressant.      What's your opinion? Could John be on to something here, was it the effects of the drugs that played a role in school violence, or were these teens just suffering from other issues/disorders (and nothing to do with the meds they were on.)?

I didn't catch the title and I just can't seem to find it, but I want to know the name. It was about a little girl, like 13ish, who was chatting with an older man online, photographer, and they met, we think she is all inocent and what not in the beginning, but she turns 'evil' at the end and she tortures the man and I think they said she kills him. Supposedly it was based on a true story, about girls in Japan who would troll around online and then meet men who wanted sed and then beat them up... Thanks in advance!!!

VIRUS EN LOS VIDEOS DE YOUTUBE    La técnica de los piratas consiste en prometer un video muy tentador y esconder, detrás del típico link de los videos de YouTube ( www.youtube.com ), una dirección IP que conduce a un sitio que instala el virus en la computadora. En principio, para saber si un link de YouTube es seguro, debe dejarse el cursor sobre él (sin hacer clic) y mirar en la barra de estado del navegador (abajo). Si aparece la dirección de YouTube, es seguro. En cambio, si se ve un número, es muy probable que sea el troyano.

Why would he want all these crabby women around , I know I would be a little irate if I were undead. So who wants a woman around forever, especially one with fangs?

20070820032316AA2yn7v	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	A question about comedy...?	Why are we (meaning Australians) the un-funniest people on the planet, now im not claiming to be Comedy's Messiah but i know whats funny - WE are not funny and there are no funny people.   Lets look at our "comedians"   - Rove McManus, the root of all evil, the worlds unfunniest man who uses childish jokes to make himself seem appealing.   - Dave Hughes, the man with the annoying voice, he is repetitive and very lame.   - Fiona O'Loughlin, probably the worst out of the bunch. Uses sex jokes constantly and never shuts up about her kids.   There are more - Cameron Knight, Justin Kennedy, Gary Eck, Mick Molloy etc.      The only funny one i can think of is Peter Helliar, he is funny. Laid back, doesnt try too hard and has a hilarious alter-ego ... Strauchanie!      So Australia, should we just stop trying to do comedy?

Cierto dia en el Pentagono deciden jubilar a tres generales entraditos en a?os, proponiendoles como contrapartida USD 100.000 para cada metro que midiesen entre 2 partes de sus cuerpos. Estas fueron las medidas de cada un: El primer general deside que el examinador le tome las medidas desde la planta del pie hasta lo alto de la cabeza. Despues de medirle,el examinador le atribuye una cuantia de USD183.000. El segundo general decide estirar los brazos hacia los lados y pide ser medido desde la punta de los dedos de la mano derecha hasta la punta de los dedos de la mano izquierda, el examinador le mide y le atribuye una cuantia de USD 205.000. Cuando llega el turno del tercer general, para espanto de todos, pide ser medido desde la punta del pe ne hasta los testiculos, a lo que los presentes responden con una sonora carcajada. El examinador intenta disuadirlo, pero no logra convencerlo.   Coloca la cinta en la punta del pe ne y exclama: Donde estan los huevos? y el gen.responde:en Vietnam

Inconscientemente tienen un gran deseo de ser aceptados y eso lo encuentran, lo consiguen llamando la atencion, a traves del Show, la mayoria de homosexuales son muy glamourosos.

20070819230532AAsrQd6	Entertainment & Music;Movies	How private are Netflix profiles?	I have a Netflix plan with 3 movies, which is perfect for me, just enough to get a movie every day that isn't hindered by those lazy postmen and their days off. But my dad expressed an intrest in getting some rentals for himself but only wants one about every week. So I offered to upgrade my plan by one additional rental and set up a profile on my account for him and my mom. But I don't really want them knowing what I watch. Yeah, I'm an adult and I can watch what I want but I don't want them giving me a hard time about it. So from their profile, will they be able to see what movies I have out, what's on my queue, and what I've watched on the instant viewing thing? Also, can I set the account up to only allow me to use the instant viewing hours?
20070905154915AAXuKhl	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Why did Netflix send me an extra movie?	Not that I'm complaining but I'd just like to know why. I have a plan with 4 movies (3 for me and 1 on a seperate profile for my parents). As of this morning, my parents still have their movie lying around somewhere and I had put 2 movies in the mailbox yesterday and the day before and still had one, Shock Corridor, half-watched in the dvd player. When I went to check on my queue and see what movies they were sending me next, it said I still had out two (one I had put in the mailbox yesterday that hadn't reached them yet and Shock Corridor) but it also said they were shipping out two! Shock Corridor had a plus sign next to it were the number usually is.       My first instict was since I usually send my movies back the day after I recieve them and I had kept Shock Corridor for an entire week, they sent out the next in line on faith, expecting that they would be recieving Shock Corridor soon. But when I thought about it, that seemed pretty silly.       Does anyone know what really happened?

20070605103043AAJK3DB	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Dealing with a Momster?	A friend of mine - a guy - is 26 years old and his mother refuses to let him live his own life.  Recently, he actually had to run away from home in the middle of the night - to another state - and his mother became hysterical and threatened to kill herself.  She was such a basketcase that they told her, at work, to go home and not come back until she'd seen a shrink.  She tells him that he promised to stay with her 'forever', but he made that promise as a small child.  Since she's been known to do outlandish things (for example, she said that if they reinstated the draft and he was called to service, she'd shoot him in the knees - and she was serious!), he's actually afraid of what she's capable of.      He caved in and returned, but he's miserable.  What would YOU do if you had a parent so controlling and dependent on you?      (In every other aspect, she seems to be a normal, intelligent woman.)

They are lined up in a row side by side.    - In each house lives a person with a different nationality.     -These 5 owners drink a certain drink, smoke a certain brand of tobacco and keep a certain pet.     -No owners have the same pet, smoke the same tobacco, or drink the same drink.    you have to find out who owns the fish.      The Brit lives in the red house    The Swede keeps dogs as pets    The Dane drinks tea    As you look at the 5 houses from across the street, the green house is adjacent to the left of the white house    The green house owner drinks coffee    The person who smokes Pall Mall raises birds    The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill    The man living in the house right in the center drinks milk    The Norwegian lives in the first house    The man who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats    The man who keeps horses lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill    The owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks juice    The German smokes Prince    The Norwegian lives next to the blue house    The man who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks water.

ARGENTINA es un PAIS con todas las letras, con una vasta extensión, todos los climas y todas las geografías , un país que jamás le cerró las puertas al mundo, un país habitado por gente cálida y amena , un país con cultura y folclore, un país que hizo y vá a seguir haciendo historia, un país con científicos y profesionales de distinta índole mas que reconocidos en el exterior , en todo el mundo.   ARGENTINA es un país, por sobre todo, que tira siempre para adelante, que tiene aguante y esto es para recalcar.   Por cuanto deseo que recapaciten y terminen con las ofensas y agresiones infudamentadas hacia nuestro país y como escribí en el encabezado VAMOS ARGENTINA, o juremos con gloria morir...   nada mas, muchas gracias.

20090203115235AASQqmY	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Call me Mother-Joke gotta read?	A young man was walking through a supermarket when he noticed an old lady following him around. He ignored her and continued on. Finally he went to the checkout line, but she got in front of him.  "Pardon me," she said. "I'm sorry if my staring has made you uncomfortable. It's just that you look like my son, who recently died."  "I'm very sorry," replied the young man. "Is there anything that I can do for you?"  "Yes," she said. "As I'm leaving, can you say 'Good bye, Mother?' It would make me feel so much better."  "Sure," answered the young man.  As the old woman was leaving, he called out, "Goodbye, Mother!"  When he stepped up to the checkout counter, he saw   that his total was $127.50. "How can that be?" he asked. "I only purchased a few things!"  "Your mother said that you would pay for her," said the clerk.       LOL

20081001190856AAtnRsd	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	What do you think of Noelle Beck (Lily ATWT) lately?	Just curious how others are adapting to Noelle taking over Martha's role. It was such a hard role to step into and I applaud her courage. I'm hoping she is gaining support, but I'd like to hear everyone's opinions!      Personally, I love her. She isn't a Martha Byrne, but no one will ever be. I find myself loving her acting more and more each day. She has brought a personality that Martha didn't bring to "Lily" in these past storylines. I find her emotions believable, and I can actually say that in most aspects I prefer her over Martha Byrne. That is not at all to say that I think MB is a bad actress; I miss her dearly but believe that Noelle was the perfect addition to the cast. The scenes with Lily screaming over Ethan when Lily was about to run Carly over were the best scenes that I have viewed in years on ATWT. Not to mention, Noelle is such a sweet woman-I have sent her some e-mails and she has personally responded.       What do you all think?
20081019205947AAdMpWo	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	(ATWT) Who do you think are the nicest (and rudest) people in real life?	On "As the World Turns," which actors/actresses do you think are the nicest and "meanest" in real life? Has anyone had any run-ins with anyone from ATWT?      Personally, I think that Noelle Beck (Lily) and Michael Park (Jack) would be some of the nicest people I'd ever meet. Noelle has kept in contact with me since I last e-mailed her, and she is such a nice lady. Michael just seems hilarious and really mellow. I've heard that Van Hansis (Luke) is one of the nicest guys too; he seems pretty cool.      I can't really decide who I think would be the rudest person on ATWT (they all seem so nice on the show!). I guess I would have to say that Roger Howarth (Paul) kind of seems arrogant, but then again-that might be his person. The portrayer of Tom, his name escapes me, also seems like he might think he is "a little better than everyone else." I honestly can't say....I would love to meet them all!

20080925090459AA9Brqn	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	When SHARON And NICK Get Back Together, What Kind Of Wedding Will They Have (FOLLOW-UP) ...?	I asked this question last week, with some very interesting responses!  For anyone who missed this question, feel free to answer!  MEANwhile, here is MY take on this very great occasion:      The Celebration will take place at the Newman Ranch.  Nick and Sharon will be dressed as one of these three:  Antony and Cleopatra, Lancelot and Guenevere ... or Orpheus and Eurydice!  Nick will ride in on a Black Stallion, and Sharon will ride in on a White Arabian!  Victor will stand up for Nick, while Doris, Sharon's Mom, will stand up for Sharon (yes, she will now be walking)!      Nikki will be there in full habit, for she will now have joined a convent, and will be happier than she has been in years (DEFinitely happier than she's ever been with Victor) ... Grace, Sharon's former friend, will be a novice, also in full habit!  Jack and Phyllis will be together; however, just when Phyllis tries to rekindle things will Jack, Jack will reveal that he is back with Diane, where he intends to stay (OUCH!)!  In addition, Jack reveals that he and Diane expect full visitation rights with Summer, since he has now discovered that he - not Nick - is really Summer's father!      J.T. and Victoria will wish the Bride and Groom BEST WISHES ... and Cassie's Spirit will be there as Nick and Sharon's GUARDIAN ANGEL!  She will be in the background, smiling her Blessings on the Nuptuals!      It will be beautiful!  What d'y'all think?

20080419004456AA3Qv7h	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	You CBS Fans Are Aware That There's A Big *** Tidal Wave Coming?	Did you guys see B&B thoday, if not Tiny (Pam's dog) died from the lemon bars that Donna Forrester gave him on Thursday's episode. Donna apologized sincerely, but Pam wasn't hearing it and said that the fued between them has now become PERSONAL. So you know the panty anty pranks Pam pulled in the past is NOTHING in comparison to what Pam's going to do to avenge her dog's death. It's going to be good next week, or hell maybe the next couple of weeks because Donna Forrester is going to get it, and she's going to get it good. Unless she dies or moves away letting no one know where she's going (which I know she won't) there's no way in the hell she's not going to get it, yaw know it's the truth right?      Also: On ATWT next week, I believe Carly's going to end up with Holden. I hope not, but I seen in a clip where she was rubbing Holden's shoulder rather passionately, then in another she had told Jack that she wanted him to move out.

20090203113807AAL5mnN	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What will you do when you retire?	I'm gonna do something like this:      The next time someone asks you a dumb question wouldn't you like  to respond like this?      Yesterday I was at my local Wal-Mart buying a large bag of Purina dog chow for my loyal pet, Biscuit, the Wonder Dog and was in the checkout line when woman behind me asked if I had a dog.      What did she think I had, an elephant? So since I'm retired and have little to do, on impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, I was starting the Purina Diet again. I added that I probably shouldn't, because I ended up in the hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.      I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pants pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so it works well and I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story.)      Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the dog  food poisoned me. I told her no, I stepped off a curb to sniff an Irish  Setter's *** and a car hit us both.      I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard. Wal-Mart won't let me shop there anymore.      Better watch what you ask retired people. They have all the time in the world to think of crazy things to say.

20081025084405AA7FEQc	Entertainment & Music;Music;R&B & Soul	What happened to music?	I'm sitting here (not wanting to actually get up lol) listening to old school RnB my ipod. The first thought that comes to my mind is why isn't music made like this anymore. Most RnB now a days isn't the same. Back then they talked about love and making love. These cats now a days talk about whatever they can think of. I'm in love with a stripper? And people liked it wtf? This stuff is all about sex what happened to the good ole love music.      Then you got hiphop. It's a d@mn shame. Half these rappers ought to be shot for the music they making. Rick Ross claimin to be real, yet he lyin about being a CO? Come on now, And all most of em talking about it how much money they got, how many ho's they bangin, and how well they living. That ain't the life for the average person living. We struggling just to get by. Where the realness at?

So what is it about the music you listen to that makes you love it so much?      There is music that I love to listen to, music that cheers me up, music that makes me want to dance etc. but then there is the type of music that dances with my soul. It sounds weird but it is the best way I can explain it. The lyrics, the voices of those who sing it, the music played along with it. Hanson in particular does it for me. There is something about their music that touches me so deeply.      What music does that for you and why?

20081009113225AARwbIR	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	I only know Negative Facts about Sharon Abbott, so what do you think her Positive Qualities are as a Wife?	These are that facts I know about Sharon: From the beginning of her relationship with Nick, Sharon was hiding the fact she had a baby & gave up Cassie for adoption at the age of 16. Sharon was the first one to cheat on Nick with Diego Guittierrez, when Nick tried to confront her he caught Sharon kissing his Father, so she abandoned Nick & her children.      During this time Cassie almost died by drowning, but Sharon continued to have an affair with Cameron Kirsten. After returning home, Nick felt sorry for Sharon and took her back & Sharon decided to become a Stripper, so Nick had to give her a job at Newman Enterprises so as not to embarrass the family, even though the company could not afford to pay her.      In 2005 Cassie, died as the result of a car accident. This traumatic loss caused a tremendous strain on Nick and Sharon's marriage. Sharon turned to her, soon to be brother-in-law; Brad Carlton. Sharon and Brad were having an emotional affair long before Nick cheated with Phyllis.      Sharon married Jack, but turned once again to Brad who insisted many times that He and Sharon were meant to be. Now Sharon is turning to Nick, even though she is still married to Jack, which proves she has not changed her ways & does not know how to be emotionally & physically faithful to her husbands. Know this I am just curious why there are viewers that want to see Nick & Sharon get back together when time & time again Sharon has proven she can't be trusted.       Maybe I'm missing something that all the Sharon Fans believe & maybe I will change my view of Sharon, so I'd like to see a list of all Sharon's positive qualities she has displayed as a wife, I've already listen some of the Negative ones. Please list all Facts of the Positive reasons Nick should take Sharon back together again & why you think she can be trusted this time? Do you honestly believe she will not turn to other men for comfort like she has always done in the past & is still doing right now in her marriage to Jack?

Art is eternal, forever immortalized through the passion of the artist, and lives on through the message it has to convey. Artwork has stood the test of time, and even though some arts forms haven't been practiced lately doesn't mean that form of art is dead…there are still so many amazing artists out there, who remain eloquent poets, even though they’re hard to come by…but idk, I think as a genre, it’s either dead or dying a slow painful death.

Carly takes Jack for a walk to talk some sense into him. While they're near the pond, Carly argues that saving him from drowning wasn't a sign that their love is inevitable and proves it by pushing him into the water and leaving him there!   Furious, Jack follows Carly home, and their anger turns passionate as the couple make love. When Janet arrives in Milltown, Jack hides, and Carly lies that she has another man in her bedroom. Later Jack heads to the diner to share some pie with Janet in an attempt to make peace.   When the guilt gets to be too much, Jack informs Janet that he was the one in Carly's bedroom, and she flips, refusing to be second best. Vienna calls to ask Janet to take the diner's deposit to the bank, and she's grateful for the opportunity to get away.    When Carly avoids Parker's questions as to whether she and Jack are back together, he reminds his mom that the constant back-and-forth in their relationship isn't good for the kids.

Jack and Carly finally get together and decide that they need to make a decision about their future together because they're hurting everyone around them. Will it be the end for the couple, or an entirely new beginning?       (CBS Soaps Magazine)      So, do you want Jack and Carly to reunite or do you think he should stay with Janet?

It looks like Nick and Sharon may get back together..I always thought they would...I just didn't think it would take so long...I can't stand Phyllis..It would serve her right to have no one..except Jack..they are two of a kind.. I would also love it if Charges from the past would come back to haunt her...Re...the time about 15  years ago when she tried to kill "Christine:" and accidentally hit "Paul" Instead..I could never figure out why Y&R let her get away with this..it would prove what a  danger she is to society..she is a psychopath..evil witch..and needs to be in jail for life...She acts so righteous all the time..like everything she does is justified..she is jealous of "Sharon" she was jealous of "Christine"  she will always be jealous of someone...and and when she is jealous..watch out.. she is dangerous...She is a terrible mother for "Daniel" ..She is even jealous of his girlfriends..The way she got "Daniel" to break up with "Amber" is criminal..She calls "Amber" a  s***..and look at her..she completely uses "sex" to get her way and her man..."Lock her up and through away the key:....

It looks to me as if (evil) Phyllis is starting to show her true evil colors... She is not for Nick at all..She had a down moment when Cassie died and everyone was blaming Daniel for her death..   I don't think he ever really loved Phyllis..It was always just the "sex"..I think he felt guilty for being hard on Phyllis regarding "Daniel" and there was a spark..I really didn't think they would stay together this long..but Phyllis can't be decent for too long.. Sharon was a little hard on him because he allowed Cassie to go to the party, but he ended up punishing himself more..Phyllis is not good for him,,he is too good. I never liked them together..

I've had a yahoo email account for 4 years and I signed up for AT&T DSL.  They forced me to link my yahoo account to their sbcglobal/AT&T mail.  All was fine until I canceled my AT&T DSL then they locked me out of my yahoo email account. I called AT&T customer service and they said there is nothing I can do except pay to restart using my AT&T DSL then I can use my email again.  Or they said I could go to TrueSwitch.com and switch to a new email account. So basically they are using tactics that seem illegal to get customers to sign back up to their DSL. They won't release my original yahoo email. I may be forced to start over with a new Yahoo email account. Does anyone know what do or have you had this happen to you?

I wasn't around while she was growing up in the 70's, but I'm willing to bet that some of y'all were.  Any good/amazing songs I should include?  I've already got "American Pie" and "Rocky Mountain High."  I know she loves the Beatles and the Beach Boys, but I feel like they each deserve their own CD, so I'm thinking more along the single biggest hits route.  Oh, and she's also a huge fan of worship-style Christian music, so I've included some early Amy Grant ("Sing your Praise to the Lord" and "I Have Decided").   Suggestions would be much appreciated!!!

I just cant get into new music for some reason. I've noticed throughout most of my high school life and even now that many kids are only into the music thats popular now. Most girls only seem to like RnB, Rap, Hip Hop and Pop. Now i will say that its weird that a few guys other than me like 80s bands, but girls never do. Im talking mainly about hair metal bands or hard rock bands like Aerosmith, G'N'R, Whitesnake, and Motley Crue. The only new bands i like are Nickelback and Hinder that have the 80s influence. To me the 80s was the best decade ever for music, even though i was born in 87 i still grew up around that music since my parents used to listen to it.

Don't get me wrong that was a good story line, But when nick cheated on Sharon i was like ok they solve it or work it out but he married Phyllis i was like OK. This is my take on this he married phyllis because of summer and i do believe he love her in his own way.   And when they did took this story this route I was like ok i might could get use to Phyllis and Nick but I, Maybe it just me the only thing i see hot between these two are sex that it i am sorry i just cant get this couple right in my head and i think he should be with sharon or who ever beside phyllis. I did like Phyllis and nick at some point but now they dont get my vote as good couple who agree or maybe it just me.

20081008164954AArJGA5	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	The Bold And Beautiful Soap tv spoiler.?	What do you think about these spoiler i just wrote to see what you think.       RIDGE AND Taylor KISS!      Last week, Taylor made a whopping confession to Brooke: She's still in love with her former husband Ridge, who Brooke is scheduled to marry. Now, Brooke is more convinced than ever that Taylor isn't ready to marry Rick, but Taylor orders her mother-in-law-to-be to butt out. Good luck with that because Brooke hightails it to Ridge and blabs that his ex still has feelings for him.      "Ridge is completely caught off-guard when Brooke says Taylor is still in love with him," explains Ron Moss. "He had just told Steffy that Taylor doesn't have those loving feelings for him anymore. So when Brooke explains that Taylor accidentally called him 'the love of her life,' Ridge realizes that she still has true emotions of love for him."      Which is why Brooke urges her fiance to have a heart-to-heart with his ex. Says Moss, "Brooke feels that Ridge is the only person who might be able to get through to Taylor about not marrying Rick."      Ridge agrees, but his agenda could be deeper than just granting Brooke's wish. "I think inwardly, Ridge is also curious to hear what Brooke has repeated come straight from Taylor's mouth," Moss notes. "He'd like to hear it for himself."      Ridge gently confronts Taylor, who's mortified. "He tells her that he's glad Brooke told him," smiles Moss. "Ridge is coming from a place of honor and integrity and asks Taylor if she still loves him and wants him; he listens intently as she says that she does. That moves Ridge, because he, too, remembers that he and Taylor were once the love of each other's lives."      Not surprisingly, the discussion leads to a walk down memory lane and a nostalgic Ridge invokes a pet name. "He calls her Doc," says Moss. "It's been years since he used that term of familiarity and love with her. She lets her defenses down and admits that she will always love him. Ridge tells her that he will always love her, too; although I think they are talking about two different levels of love."      Or maybe not, Ridge pulls Taylor into a comforting embrace and she kisses him! "He allows it," chuckles Moss. "I think it takes them both by surprise. What could be termed an affectionate kiss suddenly becomes a bit more passionate."      And enter Brooke...         SPOILERS      Donna and Owen unite.      Stephanie offers comfort, then meddles.      Rick refuses to believe Brooke's outrageous story.      October 15 - Ridge sees red when he witnesses Brooke and Nick in family mode with Jack.      October 16 - Rick has a peculiar day as he waits for Taylor to help him plan their wedding.      October 17 - Owen tells Stephanie the truth to protect the woman he loves.

20081016151500AAsYFO4	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	The young and the restless spoiler.?	What do you guys think about this spoiler. Partnertship is the new black on The Young and the Restless.      Phyllis: Radio Red finds Sharon in a sticky situation      Adam: The scorned Newman child starts to ponder the choice of teaming up with Jack.      Katherine: The Grand Dame reunites with Marge      Karen/Neil/Olivia: Ms. Taylor makes a startling confession to Neil that has him pondering a life altering choice. Later Neil's stunned to find out that Olivia's familiar with Karen.      Billy: In the coming weeks there's a new character, Rafael. arriving on the scene. Rafael is a lawyer who is a old buddy of Billy's. It appears that Billy wants to have Rafael help Lily in a legal matter that pertains to Devon and Ana.      Now Rafael starts to wonder what is Billy's angle in all of this and deduces his old friend has real feelings for Lily... Billy's not the only one that Rafael mixes it up with. Rafael meets with, "Heather," in regards to a modeling contract where Rafael starts to flirt with, "Heather."      Now we all know the mole er Heather's not a model (some say her alter ego's a hair model) so the word is that the person in question is really Jamey's new, "it," girl Colleen. Rafael's identity is starting to come into question also. Many are wondering if Rafael's not a smokescreen for Raul Guittierez. I'm going to go out on a limb and say its not. Going off of the scenes, wouldn't Colleen know Raul or are those two just playing some flirtation dance.....      Nov Sweeps info      Noah/Eden: The teens will invade your screen during the Paris location shoot (yuck!). Noah and Eden are in France for a school field trip. This is where the duo's relationship takes a turn on the romantic side.      Phyllis/Nick/Sharon: Look for Nick and Sharon's relationship to get a bit steamy and for Phyllis to bust in on them..      Jack: Things start to look up for Smilin' Jack. Could it be Jabot or finally getting one up on Victor?      Katherine: Kay runs into her old look-alike Marge who's heavy on the booze these days. Katherine makes the choice to help Marge out but keeps her family out of the loop. Fans needs to remember that in AA, everything's anonymous so Katherine's unable to let her family in on who she's helping out and this leads for them to worry. As a result of Katherine helping Marge karma rears its head for Kay and those around her....      Victor/Nikki: Nikki's makes a huge sacrifice in order for Victor to get out of his Sabrina-funk. Even though the two are at odds, don't count out the feelings they have for each other.      Ashley: When she finally comes back to the canvas at full swing, she fights being pulled back to the past.
20081030125236AA6HCt5	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	The young and the restless Adam Jack spoiler.?	WHat do you think about these spoiler explain.Next week the journal that Victor supposedly wrote is published. Jack tells Adam he needs to stay out of it because given his history with Victor if it was known he was involved the credibility of the information would be questioned. With Nikki in London to see Ashley Nick, Phyllis and Victoria try to figure out who was responsible. Sharon becomes involved as well and concludes it is Jack who is responsible. She rips into Jack and tells him she does not want him accompanying her to Paris. Phyllis gets confirmation from someone at the magazine who published the journal that Adam was involved. When Victoria confronts Adam he lies and says he found the journal at the Newman ranch. Adam does tell Heather the truth and then proposes to her. Heather accepts the proposal. Chris Engen says that Adam's relationship with Heather is a bit "dodgy." CE says he thinks Adam really loves Heather but proposing to Heather is a way of "distracting" her from what he did. According to CE Adam is motivated by revenge. He really wanted to be part of the Newman family but they all, especially Victor, rejected him. CE said "for those who really hate Adam, they ain't seen nothing yet."

20081002165533AA4BqYI	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Why does everyone think Hip-Hop is dead?	All you ever hear these days is how dead hip-hop is. I honestly don't feel that it's dead. I will agree that MAINSTREAM hip-hop is dead. I can't even stand to listen to these jokes like Lil' Wayne that have songs filled with lyrics that have absolutely no substance to them. I mean, half of the time I think he is just making words up (not that you can understand them). However, there are TONS of great artists out there. In fact, I feel that hip-hop is in one of it's purest forms these days. The internet has allowed so many great underground artists to build a fan base. Here are a few of my favorites:      Blu & Exile - So(ul) Amazing  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq-crVkXc...    Army of the Pharaohs - Bloody Tears  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTg-rW3JF...

20081008162127AAjC6rn	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	How funny is this joke to you?	There was a dentist, a librarian, and a general. They were all in a       plane that was about to crash. The dentist says, "I want someone to       remember me when I die." So he throws a giant tooth out the window.       The librarian says, "I want someone to remember me when I die." And       so she throws a huge dictionary (approximately 10'x8') out the       window. And then the general says, "I want someone to remember me       when I die." And he throws a cherry bomb out the window. When the       plane finally crashes, they found out they all survived. A week later,       the dentist sees a little boy crying. "Why are you crying?" said the       dentist. The boy replied, "A giant tooth fell on my mom's head!" The       next day, the librarian say a little girl crying. "Why are you crying?"       asked the librarian. The girl replied, "The biggest dictionary in the       world just fell on my daddy's head!" The next day, the general sees a       little boy laughing really hard. "Why are you laughing so hard?" asked       the general. The boy replied, "When my dad farted, the house blew       up!"         Now rate this on a scale of 1-10 (1=lowest 10=highest) and give it a star if you liked it.

20081013120341AAvA7Kj	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	I Think I Have Vocal Nodules...Can Anyone Help?	Singing is one of my hobbies and I practice very often, usually for an hour or two after school. I've been singing since I was five, and use to singvery high notes (i.e. Mariah Carey high), especially as my voice was changing (age 13 and 14). After my voice changed I was not able to sing as high in my chest voice, but I was able to hit very high "whistle notes."   Anyways, I had managed to expand my range a lot by daily practice, and I was doing very well. However, I began to notice that my voice was very weak and that it would become thin and tired half way through a song. I didn't think anything of it and kept practicing. Then a few weeks ago, I was trying to sing while I had a cold (stupid, I know) and the area in between my neck and my chin began to hurt badly. Now, even though my cold is gone, that area still hurts when I sing high, and I often become hoarse now, especially when I try to hit whistle notes---I can no longer go as high or as long as I used to. I'm not sure what to attribute this "ailment" ,for lack of a better word, of my voice to...I'm not sure if it's just improper singing technique or something bigger like vocal nodules.       Can anybody tell me how to go about finding out what is causing my vocal problems?

I had so much fun, so I would like to tell you the highlights of my evening.      I was dancing to "American Boy" by Estelle, very wildly with my friends and we were dancing in a circle. I was like crazy, so I didn't notice who was coming into the circle. I felt someones hand and just held onto it. I opened my eyes, and guess what. It was a dude. At first I thought it was a girl because he had super long hair, but then i actually noticed, and it was a guy. Also, rumors came out. Probably the funniest one was that this guy raped this girl. I was talking to that girl about 5 minutes before the rumor started, and she looked perfectly fine. SO now that I told you my funny story, You tell me yours. Im in the mood for a good laugh. THANKS!

"Take a pencil and paper," the teacher said, "and write an essay with the title 'If I Were a Millionaire' "      Everyone but Little Johnny, who leaned back with arms folded, began to write furiously.      "What's the matter," the teacher asked. "Why don't you begin?"      "I'm waiting for my secretary," he replied.      --------------------------------------...   The Sunday School Teacher asks, "Now, Johnny, tell me frankly do you say prayers before eating?"      "No sir," Little Johnny replies, "I don't have to, my mom is a good cook!"   ---------------   At Sunday School they were teaching how God created everything, including human beings. Little Johnny seemed especially intent when they told him how Eve was created out of one of Adam's ribs. Later in the week his mother noticed him lying down as though he were ill, and said, Johnny what is the matter? Little Johnny responded, "I have a pain in my side. I think I'm going to have a wife."   -----------------------   The teacher wrote on the blackboard: "I ain't had no fun in months." Then asked the class, "How should I correct this sentence?"      Little Johnny raised his had and replied, "Get yourself a new boyfriend."   -----------------------   Little Johnny's chemistry teacher wanted to teach his class a lesson about the evils of liquor, so he set up an experiment that involved a glass of water, a glass of whiskey, and two worms.      "Now, class. Observe what happens to the two the worms," said the professor putting the first worm in the glass of water. The worm in the water moved about, twisting and seemingly unharmed.   -----------------   The teacher asked little Johnny if he knows his numbers.      "Yes," he said. "My dad taught me."      "Good! Can you tell me what comes after three."      "Four," answers little Johnny.      "What comes after six?"      "Seven."      "Very good," says the teacher. "Your father did a good job. What comes after ten?"      "A jack," says little Johnny.      ------------------------      He then dropped the second work in the whiskey glass. It writhed in pain for a moment, then quickly sank to the bottom and died. "Now kids, what lesson can we derive from this experiment?" he asked.      Little Johnny raised his hand and wisely responded, "Drink whiskey and you won't get worms!"      -----------------------------   Little Johnny was getting bad grades in school. One day he stepped up to the teacher's desk, and announced, "I don't want to scare you Miss Finch, but daddy says if I don't get better grades... somebody is gonna get a spanking."   ------------------------   Little Johnny's teacher asks, "George Washington not only chopped down his father's Cherry tree, but also admitted doing it. Do any of you know why his father didn't punish him?"      Little Johnny replies, "Because George was the one holding the axe?   hope u like them ;)

20081120204730AAvLUSO	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Isn't This Joke Funny!?	   A few days after Christmas, a mother was working in the kitchen listening to her young son playing with his new electric train in the living room. She heard the train stop and her son said, "All of you sons of bitches who want off, get the hell off now, cause this is the last stop! And all of you sons of bitches who are getting on, get your asses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks." The mother went nuts and told her son, "We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language." Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, "All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon." She hears the little boy continue, "For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today." As the mother began to smile, the child added, "For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the ***** in the kitchen."

20081123110423AAELmgN	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	A riddle, for Christians only?	Monday, November 23rd; 10:55 AM, in the city of Los Angles:   A man walks outside, from his bank, where--although he does   not realize it--he'd dropped his wallet, just before leaving.   Suddenly, he's arrested! He is handcuffed, because he's told he   matches the description of a man who robbed the  liquor store,   across the street last night.   He isn't the same man--and he tells the policemen this. But,    even though he told the truth, he remains in handcuffs.    Despite having told the truth, but the truth did not set him    entirely free!   Okay. Why not?   (A clue: the policemen were right not to uncuff him.)            
20081111090844AAVte5X	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Joke of the week - What do you think?	   'The Will of God will never take you       where the Grace of God will not protect you'.      The Next time you think your hotel bill is too high, consider this:       Husband and wife are traveling by car from Key West to Boston .      After almost twenty-four hours on the road, They're too tired to continue, and they decide to stop for a rest.       They stop at a hotel and slept for four hours and then get back on the road.       When they check out four hours later, the desk clerk hands them a bill for $350.00.    The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high. He tells the clerk although it's a nice hotel, the rooms certainly aren't worth $350.00! When the clerk tells him $350.00 is the standard rate, the    man insists on speaking to the Manager.       The Manager ap pears, listens to the man, and then explains that the hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center that were available for the husband and wife to use.       'But we didn't use them,' the man complains.       'Well, they are here, and you could have,' explains the manager. He goes on to explain they could have taken in one of the shows for which the hotel is famous. 'The best entertainers from New York , Hollywood and Las Vegas perform here,' the manager says.       'But we didn't go to any of those shows,' complains the man again.       'Well, we have them, and you could ha ve,' the manager replies.       No matter what amenity the manager mentions, the man replies, 'But we didn't use it!'       The manager is unmoved, and eventually the man gives up and agrees to pay. He writes a check and gives it to the manager.       The manager is surprised when he looks at the check.       'But sir,' he says, 'This check is only made out for $50.00.'       'That's correct,' says the man. 'I charged you $300.00 for sleeping with my wife.'       'But I didn't!' exclaims the Manager.       'Well, too bad,' the man replies.  She was here and you could have.      Bob                                  --------------------------------------...                    Bob works hard at the office but spends two nights each week bowling, and plays golf every Saturday.      His wife thinks he's pushing himself too hard, so for his birthday she takes him to a local strip club.      The doorman at the club greets them and says, 'Hey, Bob! How ya doin?'      His wife is puzzled and asks if he's been to this club before.       'Oh no,' says Bob.  'He's in my bowling league.      When they are seated, a waitress asks Bob if he'd like his usual and brings over a Budweiser.      His wife is becoming increasingly uncomfortable and says, 'How did she  know that you drink Budweiser?'      'I recognize her, she's the waitress from the golf club.      I always have a Bud at the end of the 1st nine, honey.'      A stripper then comes over to their table, throws her arms around Bob, starts to rub herself all over him and says,      'Hi Bobby. Want your usual table dance, big boy?'      Bob's wife, now furious, grabs her purse and storms out of the club.      Bob follows and spots her getting into a cab.      Before she can slam the door, he jumps in beside her.      Bob tries desperately to explain how the stripper must have mistaken him for someone else, but his wife is having none of it .      She is screaming at him at the top of her lungs, calling him every 4 letter word in the book.      The cabby turns around and says,      'Geez Bob, you picked up a real b! tch this time.'         BOB's funeral will be on Friday.

20081122125923AAoYfdZ	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	What is this all about?	They Hurt Her   About six years ago in Indiana, Carmen Winstead was pushed down a sewer opening by five girls in her school, trying to embarrass her in front of her school during a fire drill. When she didn't submerge, the police were called. They went down and brought up 17-year-old Carmen Winstead's body, with her neck broken from hitting the ladder, then the concrete at the bottom. The girls told everyone she fell... They believed them.      FACT: About two months later, 16-year-old David Gregory read this post and didn't repost it. When he went to take a shower, he heard laughter, started freaking out, and ran to his computer to repost it. He said goodnight to his mom and went to sleep, but five hours later, his mom woke up in the middle of the night from a loud noise and David was gone. A few hours later, the police found him in the sewer, with a broken neck and the skin on his face peeled off.      Even Google her name - you'll find this to be true.      If you don't repost this saying "They hurt her," then Carmen will get you, either from a sewer, the toilet, the shower, or when you go to sleep, you'll wake up in the sewer, in the dark, then Carmen will come and kill you.

20081105031858AAw8aDf	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	What about this joke is it funny ?	A group of primary school infants, accompanied by two female teachers, went on a field trip to Cheltenham races to see and learn about thoroughbred horses.       When it was time to take the children to the toilet, it was decided that the girls would go with one teacher and the boys would go with the other.       The teacher assigned to the boys was waiting outside the men's toilet when one of the boys came out and told her that none of them could reach the urinal.       Having no choice, she went inside, helped the boys with their pants, and began hoisting the boys up, one by one, holding their willies to direct the flow away from their clothes.       As she lifted one, she couldn't help but notice that he was unusually well endowed. Trying not to show that she was staring, the teacher said, 'You must be in year four.'       'No, madam,' he replied. 'I'm riding Silver Arrow in the 2.15.'

The doctor then hands him a second dose and tells him to do the same thing in six hours.       So, the man goes home and later that evening tries to get the second suppository inserted, but he finds that he cannot reach himself properly to obtain the required depth. He calls his wife over and tells her what to do. The wife nods, puts one hand on his shoulder to steady him and with the other shoves the medicine home.       Suddenly the man screams, "DAMN!"

Their almost daily screw fests are bad enough but now we get to be treated to corny scenes on the beach to hammer home that they are so in tuned with one another they both show up at the same place? Yeah right!      Except I happened to be watching live when that wedding happened and I distinctly remember Ridge going to that beach cliff on the morning of the day of his wedding to remember and dream of Taylor..who was being held captive in Morrocco by Prince Omar.      Funny how Brad Bell & Co leave out pesky little details like that in their five year quest to re-write history-the great BELL SENIOR'S HISTORY-and to feed audience the drivel that it's Brooke Ridge always wanted.      From perusing other B&B Boards it isn't working, and it isn't working for me either.
20081114131115AAl2XOP	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	AS the world turn spoiler.?	What do you think about this. Related article:      Kiss gives Brian a new spin in 'As The World Turns'   By CAROLYN HINSEY      Lucinda marries the much-younger Brian at her hospital bedside next week on "As the World Turns," but what he does next might kill her.      "Brian's relationship with Lucinda is genuine," says Laurence Lau, who plays Brian. "They challenge each other and make each other laugh."      They also just met, but since Lucinda has cancer, she doesn't have time to do her usual due diligence.      "Lucinda [Elizabeth Hubbard] is recovering from a mastectomy," Lau says. "She wakes up with Brian by her side and says, 'I don't want to live alone any longer. Marry me.' Brian says, 'Ask me again when the drugs wear off.'"      Lucinda insists that she means business, so Brian has her sign a prenup to prove he's not after her money and then gives her his Princeton class ring.      "She calls her friend the judge and they get married," says Lau. "It's the real deal. But while she's in recovery, Brian drives back to her house to pick up some things for her. On the way, he sees her grandson Luke staggering on the highway, drunk out of his mind. He pulls him into the car and takes him back to the house to sober up. In the process of comforting Luke, something happens."      Brian gives his new step-grandson a reassuring hug ... and then kisses him!      "I think the moment is as much a revelation for Brian as it is for Luke," says Lau. "Brian has his arm around the kid, saying, 'You're going to be okay.' And then Luke's, like, 'Oh my God, what are you doing?'"      Good question.      "I played it that this was Brian's first awareness that he has feelings for a man, and it just happens to be the grandson of the woman he just married," says Lau. Even though Luke is drunk, "he remembers it. Things ensue."      Like the quickest divorce on record?      "Brian genuinely wants to stay in the marriage," argues Lau. "He loves Lucinda. ... He's just not sure what to do with Luke!"

The waiter later realizes that the there order only costs 25 dollars,so he run back up to them to give the money back. Then in half way he realizes he can't split 5 dollars between 3 men evenly, so he pockets 2 dollars, and gives each man one dollar. So now, each man has payed 9 dollars (paid 10, got 1 back). 9x3 = 27. The waiter pocketed 2 dollars. 27 + 2 = 29. Where'd the last dollar go?

20081115114029AAuaHUr	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Why is this the funniest joke in the world?	apparently this is the funniest joke in the world "Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps, "My friend is dead! What can I do?". The operator says "Calm down. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead." There is a silence, then a shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says "OK, now what?"      could someone please be so kind as to explain to me why this joke is so funny? i found this one to be funnier:       A woman gets on a bus with her baby. The bus driver says: "That's the ugliest baby that I've ever seen. Ugh!" The woman goes to the rear of the bus and sits down, fuming. She says to a man next to her: "The driver just insulted me!" The man says: "You go right up there and tell him off – go ahead, I'll hold your monkey for you."      and this one wasn't the funniest in the world only in the UK!      what a corny joke. (the first one i mean) .       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funniest_jo...
