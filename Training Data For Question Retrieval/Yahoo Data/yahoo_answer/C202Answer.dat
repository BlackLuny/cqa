45c23f244ab64e8dad2252d4c037a046aa	First off, you should NEVER be alone with any children who are not yours.  The risk to you is too high.  A mixed up child could decide you were molesting them, and they ARE believed.   <br>  Second off, are you having inappropriate urges?  If you are, you must stop any and all contact immediately and get some help.  Most adult men don't choose to play with children on any sort of regular basis.<br>  Thirdly, I don't think a father should EVER stop having appropriate contact with his daughter, no matter what age.  A daughter always need his father's love and affection.  That is how a girl gets her basis for how men should treat women they love.  <br>  When I was about 12, I went to sit on my dad's lap and he kindly told me that I was too old for that.  It broke my heart.  I still felt like a little girl and still wanted my dad's affection.  He probably was just doing what he thought was best, but it hurt.  I wish he could have felt comfortable with hugging me and tickling me like he always did.  But if he was having inappropriate urges, then he did the right thing.  <br>  I don't want to imply that you are doing anything inappropriate.  But if you are alone with children that are not your own, you could be in serious danger of having your life seriously ruined.  There are children out there who need a male influence, and if that's the case, just make sure you're never alone or in a position that could make you look inappropriate.|`|607694db3a85a07dc15d51d88b6776b5aa	u don't wish to have hugs from Ur daddy all the time? it sounds ironic!|`|6124d56f9ab1934186d5427b7de84980aa	For a man who knows the family well, and who is genuinely only playing with the children, there is no age limit. Kids like fun.<br>  But I would say, watch for hesitancy or the child's posture, they will generally let you know if they are uncomfortable with it.<br>  A man should never stop hugging his daughter. She needs a male who genuinely has her best at heart to affirm his love to her so that she does not have to seek it elsewhere. A woman who had an affectionate father is a well adjusted, confident woman.|`|ded0101cc8b1db8a239fcd4ef6aba8eaaa	This is a touchy one, but I would say if the child is not his, never.  The reason I say this is too many parents have been or know someone who has been molested, therefore they are always looking for it.  They assume because a man shows any attention to their child then it must be bad.  I'm a mom of 4 & have to say that I wonder at times with people who are close to me, well knowing that this is not what is going on.  Most moms figure, better safe than sorry.<br>  If the child is his, 10.  Discuss it with your spouse, her answer should be the law on this one.<br>  Good Luck!|`|8fb9d98c6d80fafbf9c4639d675c3af9aa	I agree mostly with Ronda, that if the child is not yours, do not have any physical contact. Even if you deem it innocent, the child or another adult can see it differently. <br>  <br>  With your own daughter I kind of agree with age 10, but by no means should you withhold any kind of affection with her. Hugs and kisses are important from a dad. You as the adult should know what the boundaries are and know when to back off, especially as she gets in the teen years it may be a little weird for both of you, even for a hug.....<br>  <br>  But as long as you and her are both comfortable (especially her), then play with your daughter! They are only young once, and when she's a teenager, she probably won't even want to be in the same room as you! :-)|`|5b5fa537c6df44c01d1c3b4124a7fdc1aa	The charge of pedofile can be laid if an adult man touches any female, intended or otherwise, below 16.<br>  The charge of assault can be laid if the female is over 16, and even under 16.<br>  Do not touch any female without parental permission at any time.<br>  <br>  You can play with your own daughters until they are sufficiently mature about your physical and emotional intentions.  This age varies but is usually about 12.<br>  A daughter at 12 knows a lot more today than in the past.  So perhaps before physical contact (such as a hug) - always ask "Is it OK to give you a hug?".

b2c732da858f5f556fa981dad3f163d7aa	You might very well be pregnant. :-(<br>  The light spotting is actually one of the symptoms of pregnancy; many women mistake it for a period. Even if home tests are negative (make sure you do them in the morning), you may be pregnant, especially considering that you are having unprotected sex so often. You need to get to a gynecologist right away, and decide what your options are. <br>  On the other hand, it might be something else, possibly more sinister, possibly not, in which case you still need to see a gynecologist right away.<br>  Planned Parenthood can probably give you a free consultation regarding all of these things, if you are strapped for cash. <br>  You might also want to start taking birth control pills; they'll interfere minimally with your sex life, but if taken correctly, have a very high prevention rate.<br>  Above all, don't put any of this off.|`|AA10241742	Okay get another pregnancy test , First response and take it in the morning.  The first urine is the most potent in hcg if you are pregnant.  If the test is negative make sure you look at it very good because any line what so ever means you are pregnant.  If negative then wait a week and retake.  If not pregnant then i would assume you are not.  If you have any doubts check with your doctor.  The cramping may be do to the stretching of your uterus.  I had that and my preg test was very faint.  You may only be 5 weeks pregnant.  So test in the morning.|`|eda02ec91bcfbcf8b05c49a3ecdaa2a0aa	Go straight to a doctor.  If you are not pregnant obviously you want to know what the heck made you miss a period for two months and cause light bleeding.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are indeed pregnant, you of course want the best prenatal care possible so go to a obgyn asap.<br>  <br>  Call a doctor, make an appt, your regular gynecologist will suffice, she/he can refer you to OB if necessary.  For now make sure you don't have an infection or something else wrong with you.  If you are pregnant you will have to get a pap and everything anyway.  And they can give you a blood test to reassure you either way.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!
AA11713224	AIDS is one of the most serious, deadly diseases in human history.  More than 20 years ago, doctors in the United States identified the first cases of AIDS in San Francisco and New York. Now there are an estimated 42 million people living with HIV or AIDS worldwide, and more than 3 million die every year from AIDS-related illnesses.<br>  <br>  AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV destroys a type of defense cell in the body called a CD4 helper lymphocyte (pronounced: lim-fuh-site). These lymphocytes are part of the body's immune system, the defense system that fights infectious diseases. But as HIV destroys these lymphocytes, people with the virus begin to get serious infections that they normally wouldn't — that is, they become immune deficient. The name for this condition is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).<br>  <br>  Half of all new HIV infections in the United States occur in people under 25 years of age, and thousands of U.S. teens become infected with HIV each year.<br>  <br>  As the medical community learns more about how HIV works, they've been able to develop drugs to inhibit it (meaning they interfere with its growth). These drugs have been successful in slowing the progress of the disease, and people with the disease now live much longer. But there is still no cure for HIV and AIDS.<br>  <br>  <br>  HIV can be transmitted from an infected person to another person through blood, semen (also known as "***," the fluid released from the penis when a male ejaculates), vaginal fluids, and breast milk.<br>  <br>  The virus is spread through high-risk behaviors including:<br>  <br>  unprotected oral, vaginal, or anal sexual intercourse ("unprotected" means not using a condom) <br>  sharing needles, such as needles used to inject drugs (including needles used for injecting steroids) and those used for tattooing <br>  People who have another sexually transmitted disease, such as syphilis, genital herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or bacterial vaginosis are at greater risk for getting HIV during sex with infected partners.<br>  <br>  If a woman with HIV is pregnant, her newborn baby can catch the virus from her before birth, during the birthing process, or from breastfeeding. If doctors know an expectant mother has HIV, they can usually prevent the spread of the virus from mother to baby. All pregnant teens and women should be tested for HIV so they can begin treatment if necessary.<br>  <br>  How Does HIV Affect the Body?<br>  A healthy body is equipped with CD4 helper lymphocyte cells (CD4 cells). These cells help the immune system function normally and fight off certain kinds of infections. They do this by acting as messengers to other types of immune system cells, telling them to become active and fight against an invading germ.<br>  <br>  HIV attaches to these CD4 cells, infects them, and uses them as a place to multiply. In doing so, the virus destroys the ability of the infected cells to do their job in the immune system. The body then loses the ability to fight many infections.<br>  <br>  Because their immune systems are weakened, people who have AIDS are unable to fight off many infections, particularly tuberculosis and other kinds of otherwise rare infections of the lung (such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia), the surface covering of the brain (meningitis), or the brain itself (encephalitis). People who have AIDS tend to keep getting sicker, especially if they are not taking antiviral medications properly.<br>  <br>  AIDS can affect every body system. The immune defect caused by having too few CD4 cells also permits some cancers that are stimulated by viral illness to occur — some people with AIDS get forms of lymphoma and a rare tumor of blood vessels in the skin called Kaposi's sarcoma. Because AIDS is fatal, it's important that doctors detect HIV infection as early as possible so a person can take medication to delay the onset of AIDS.<br>  <br>  How Do People Know They Have HIV?<br>  Once a person's blood lacks the number of CD4 cells required to fight infections, or the person has signs of specific illnesses or diseases that occur in people with HIV infection, doctors make a diagnosis of AIDS.<br>  <br>  Severe symptoms of HIV infection and AIDS may not appear for 10 years. And for years leading up to that, a person may not have symptoms of AIDS. The amount of time it takes for symptoms of AIDS to appear varies from person to person. Some people may feel and look healthy for years while they are infected with HIV. It is still possible to infect others with HIV, even if the person with the virus has absolutely no symptoms. You cannot tell simply by looking at someone whether he or she is infected.<br>  <br>  When a person's immune system is overwhelmed by AIDS, the symptoms can include:<br>  <br>  extreme weakness or fatigue <br>  rapid weight loss <br>  frequent fevers that last for several weeks with no explanation <br>  heavy sweating at night <br>  swollen lymph glands <br>  minor infections that cause skin rashes and mouth, genital, and anal sores <br>  white spots in the mouth or throat <br>  chronic diarrhea <br>  a cough that won't go away <br>  trouble remembering things <br>  Girls may also experience severe vaginal yeast infections that don't respond to usual treatment, as well as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).<br>  <br>  How Can It Be Prevented?<br>  One of the reasons that HIV is so dangerous is that a person can have the virus for a long time without knowing it. That person can then spread the virus to others through high-risk behaviors. HIV transmission can be prevented by:<br>  <br>  abstaining from sex (not having oral, vaginal, or anal sex) <br>  always using latex condoms for all types of sexual intercourse <br>  avoiding contact with the bodily fluids through which HIV is transmitted <br>  never sharing needles <br>  How Is It Diagnosed and Treated?<br>  If you think that you may have HIV or AIDS or if you have had a partner who may have HIV or AIDS, see your family doctor, adolescent doctor, or gynecologist. He or she will talk with you and perform tests. The doctor may do a blood test or a swab of the inside of your cheek. Depending on what type of test is done, results may take from a few hours to several days.<br>  <br>  People can also get tested for HIV/AIDS at special AIDS clinics around the country. Clinics offer both anonymous (meaning the clinic doesn't know a person's name) and confidential (meaning they know who a person is but keep it private) testing. Most AIDS testing centers will ask you to follow up for counseling to get your results, whether the test is negative or positive.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure how to find a doctor or get an AIDS test, you can contact the National AIDS Hotlines at (800) 342-AIDS (English) or (800) 344-7432 (Spanish). A specialist there will explain what you should do next.<br>  <br>  There is no cure for AIDS, which makes prevention so important. Combinations of antiviral drugs and drugs that boost the immune system have allowed many people with HIV to resist infections, stay healthy, and prolong their lives, but these medications are not a cure. Right now there is no vaccine to prevent HIV and AIDS, although researchers are working on developing one.<br>  <br>  Reviewed by: Steven Dowshen, MD<br>  Date reviewed: February 2005<br>  Originally reviewed by: Joseph Masci, MD|`|AA10241742	That is great.

Look for a week period right in the middle where your temps were low for a while. Then look for a time after that when they went up, and they stayed up.

If you don't see any sort of pattern, then get on Clomid|`|c7ac21419f01562f137aa731d61a9b50aa	I didn't do the BBT thing.

I was also on the Depo shot and My ob/gyn said it could take up to six months for my period to come back and to have "normal" cycles again.  My period came back in 5 months and at about 7 months things were as "normal" as they could get.  If you ovulated 2 times this month, consider yourself lucky!!!  When you are fertile your cervix will be soft and open, also your cm will either be very watery or most likely like raw egg whites.  Sticky cm is hostile to sperm and not considered fertile. I would chart for a couple more months and see how things progress and chart out.  You will have a much clearr picture as to what is taking place by then. I wish you lots of baby dust!!|`|9609c92ffa7f748567531a28be71b568aa	What do you mean...Are u trying to get pregnant?|`|1b29c8c82dc9a9aa4e3fbb6ee386b365aa	depo is kind of bad to get... i bled forever it seemed... esp after i got off of it... MOOOD swings....!! if your tryin to conceive in some ladies it can take up to 10 months to get pregnant and up to a year for the symptoms to go away...i dont get ur question though|`|5e6d4226ffaca95cf8e6c9f0234b2bc2aa	well it took me 6 months after I stopped using it to get pregnant ...     I used it for five years and I loved it ... <br>  I had no period because it kind  of makes your body believe its pregnant so you don't ovulate but a the beginning I remember for the first 6 months I had a period every 2 weeks and it slowly got lighter and lighter till it went away ....<br>  <br>  but I now that they do not recommend being on it for more than two years because you can have bone loss so I can no longer use it and boy do I miss the no periods<br>  <br>  good luck|`|dab686736d10d68dbfe569f86aaafec9aa	Yes depo really screwed me up made me not ovulate anymore i suggest going in and get checked out. Make sure that your ovulating in the first place. And its going to take about  a year to get back on track depending on how long you been on it. Best of Luck... Baby dust to you..|`|ddd309e64fdde4649ae85f528ac30bd4aa	what exacatly is your question?
0cab0b79c9a339657cc486006e4465d7aa	It sounds like you are fertile now.  The creamy eggwhite CM is a sign of fertlitly.  You bd so I thinks its a good chance you will get at BFP.  I used deprovera and it did not take me a year to get pg again when I got off of it.|`|07ed156485a380063f77d8959d47cb82aa	Start having sex every other day after your period ends keeps hubby happy and try to chart ovulation & BBT|`|5894e8a3cae3d66ba09603dc285cdff5aa	i was on depo for 3 years and then the pill another 3 years and i am not pregnant and i think the shot and BC in general mess up your system cause think about it you are told not to ovulate or realase an egg by medicane.  Some people are lucky and get pregnant right after and some people like me have been ttc for a year an a half and nothing.  Good luck I hope this helps.  You might be pregnant see if your period comes and take a test and if negative then give another week if still negative then go to the doctor
AA11210405	It worries me to see all these woman asking all of these basic questions about their bodies and their cycles….and then getting all these different answers – and usually most of these answers are WRONG! <br>  This is my standard answer......... go get a book called Taking Charge of your fertility by Toni Weschler<br>  This book will help you with all of your menstrual and conception questions.  It covers everything from temperature to mucus checking, etc..  It will help you understand your body and all the myths about it.  It will help you time when you are ovulating and the best times to conceive – or not! My husband and I tried for a year and nothing happened. The first month I used the book we conceived right away.  Now I am due Feb 2.   It's about knowing your body and knowing when you are fertile or not.  You can pick and choose what you do with your info.  Good luck and don't listen the all the myths!|`|AA10092567	It means that you're almost done with your cervix (survey) and a fabulous gift will be yours. he he ha
571aba0ad387ac46759004136e5a72e2aa	it is very possible that this is normal for you.  everyone's body is different.  and it is possible that the other one will join it soon.  just do breast massages and apply warm washcloths to help relieve the pain.  when you go see your ob/gyn ask them if it is still just the one breast.  good luck and lay on the non-hurting side!|`|7e423f3bf2e4df6b55a543b80412404daa	i suppose|`|ef052ed4eaa1096031a4f3eebe21e85faa	See your doc, how far on in ur pregnancy are u?|`|AA11572429	Rub some cream on that breast Girl

It wasn't until after I missed my period and took a pregnancy test that I realized why I was getting them.  For me, they pretty much ended by the time I hit the second trimester.  I don't remember having them with my second.|`|17b0b18050395a13a4774879f38d41c8aa	I did. I started having them in my 3rd month. Of course I was also pregnant both times in the summer too.
817915fe9e6b9e3aec5734920c1f0aafaa	No I never experienced any of that coming off the shot. I was on it for 4 yrs , when you get off it takes 3-4 months to go back to your regular cycle (you can't get preggo in that time) while the depo wears off , but it could take up to a year to get pregnant if you rtrying , so likely you arent. <br>  The thing with depo is it tricks your body into "thinking" your pregnant so its very normal to have some symptoms of being pregnant but they usually wear off quick and arent that bad.|`|022b7c03b1e2c2b715d9685a39a2db9daa	No it wont. But it usually takes anywhere from 12 to 18 weeks to get pregnant after you have received your last shot. Also if you get pregnant while on Depo then there is a greater chance that it will be ectopic.

A month and a half after my last shot i travelled overseas and got ill, i saw my doctor when i returned home.  What he discovered i couldnt have imagined in my wildest dreams, i was 5 months pregnant with a healthy baby boy. Anything is possible the best thing to do is to see your doc and tell them everything.  Sometimes the unexpected does happen.  Good luck with everything.
9f0f3965f68047e407ed3e9acf4eb2f9aa	I have PCOS and when I became prego the hpt's all came back positive. However, I know that when you become prego the placenta produces the hormone hCG and that hormone is what the hpt is meant to detect. PCOS can cause a low amount of hCG to be produced. Also, some hpt's on the market are better than others at detecting hCG. Check out these sites, or try googleing PCOS. Hope this helps. If you have any other questions feel free to e-mail me!|`|AA11666466	wthell is pcos and hpt? I might be able to help if you spell that stuff out for me ;)|`|7aa9e659a19dc98d28c50d5e985d25c2aa	Prego?

Don't let all these people scare you with this at least a year talk.....it really just depends on your body and when your cycle goes back to normal.

AA12387077	Let him go without that meal, and he'll eat when it's time for the next meal.  My 6 year old daughter is a picky eater.  If she had her way, she'd only eat junk food.  She tried to pull that mess on Thanksgiving last year.  Everyone else was eating, and she kept saying she wasn't hungry.  She had seen me make the pies, and called herself "holding out" for pie, even though I'd made it clear to her that she wasn't getting any pie until her dinner was eaten.  She sat on my couch looking at cartoons pretending she wasn't hungry, but her stomach was practically beating her back!

AA12381247	<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/symptoms-of-pregnancy/PR00102" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/symptom...</a><br>  <br>   Early signs and symptoms of pregnancy: Things you might notice before you start prenatal care<br>  Could you be pregnant? Before you test, read this list of classic clues. <br>  Are you pregnant? The proof is really in the pregnancy test. But you may suspect — or hope — that you're expecting, even before you miss a period, if you experience one or more of the following signs and symptoms of pregnancy. These early clues may begin in the first few weeks after conception.<br>  Tender, swollen breasts or nipples<br>  One of the first physical changes of pregnancy is a change in the way your breasts feel. They may feel tender, tingly or sore. Or they may feel fuller and heavier. As early as two weeks after conception, your breasts start to grow and change in preparation for producing milk. The primary cause of these changes is increased production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Changes in your breasts are often most dramatic when you're pregnant for the first time.<br>  Fatigue<br>  Many women feel wiped out during pregnancy, especially in the early stages. This may be nature's way of persuading moms-to-be to take extra naps, in preparation for the sleepless nights ahead. But there's also a physical reason for fatigue.<br>  During the early weeks of pregnancy, your body is working hard — pumping out hormones and producing more blood to carry nutrients to your baby. To accommodate this increased blood flow, your heart pumps harder and faster. Plus, progesterone is a natural central nervous system depressant, so high levels of this hormone may make you sleepy. In addition, the possibility of pregnancy can bring about a range of feelings and concerns that may sap your energy and disturb sleep.<br>  Slight bleeding or cramping<br>  Some women experience a small amount of spotting or bleeding very early in pregnancy, about 10 to 14 days after fertilization. Known as implantation bleeding, it happens when the fertilized egg first attaches to the lining of the uterus. This type of bleeding is usually a bit earlier, spottier and lighter in color than a usual period and doesn't last long.<br>  Many women also experience cramping very early in pregnancy as the uterus begins to enlarge. These cramps are similar to menstrual cramps.<br>  Nausea with or without vomiting<br>  Morning sickness is one of the telltale signs of early pregnancy. Most women feel some sickness around four to eight weeks of pregnancy, but the queasiness can begin as early as two weeks after conception.<br>  Although nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is commonly called morning sickness, it can occur at any time of the day. It seems to stem from the rapidly rising levels of estrogen produced by the placenta and the fetus. These hormones cause the stomach to empty somewhat more slowly, which could be part of the problem. Pregnant women also have a heightened sense of smell, so a variety of odors — such as foods cooking, coffee, perfume or cigarette smoke — can trigger nausea.<br>  Food aversions or cravings<br>  Turning up your nose at certain foods is often the first hint that you're pregnant. Even the smell of some foods may cause a wave of nausea in early pregnancy. One study suggests that pregnant women experience a unique aversion to coffee in the early weeks of pregnancy. Meat, dairy products and spicy foods are other common objects of repulsion.<br>  Food cravings are common, too. Like most other symptoms of pregnancy, these food preferences can be chalked up to hormonal changes. Pregnant women typically find that their food tastes change somewhat, especially in the first trimester, when hormones have the strongest impact.<br>  Frequent urination<br>  Many pregnant women find themselves running to the bathroom more often than usual. During the first trimester of pregnancy, this is caused by the enlarging uterus pushing on your bladder.<br>  Headaches<br>  If you're pregnant, you may be troubled by frequent, mild headaches. Early in pregnancy, headaches may be the result of increased blood circulation caused by hormonal changes.<br>  Constipation<br>  Constipation is another common early indication of pregnancy. An increase in progesterone causes digestion to slow down, so food passes more slowly through the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to constipation.<br>  Mood swings<br>  You're a no-nonsense kind of woman — so what's with this crying over Hallmark commercials? The flood of hormones in your body in early pregnancy can make you unusually emotional and weepy. Swings in your mood, from bliss to deep gloom, also are common, especially in the first trimester.<br>  Faintness and dizziness<br>  It's common for pregnant women to be lightheaded or dizzy. These sensations usually result from circulatory changes as your blood vessels dilate and your blood pressure drops. Early in pregnancy, faint feelings may also be triggered by low blood sugar.<br>  Raised basal body temperature<br>  Your basal body temperature (BBT) is your oral temperature when you first wake up in the morning. This temperature spikes slightly soon after ovulation and remains at that level until your next period. If you've been charting your BBT to determine when you ovulate, its continued elevation for more than two weeks may mean you're pregnant. In fact, BBT stays elevated throughout your pregnancy.<br>  Are you really pregnant?<br>  Unfortunately, these signs and symptoms aren't unique to pregnancy. Some can indicate that you're getting sick or that your period is about to start. And, conversely, you can be pregnant without ever experiencing these symptoms.<br>  Still, if you notice any of the tip-offs on this list, make plans to take a home pregnancy test, especially if you're not keeping track of your menstrual cycle or if it varies widely from one month to the next. Also take extra good care of yourself. You just might be taking care for two.<br>  <br>  <br>  Our teenwire.com experts get hundreds of e-mails a week asking the same question: "Am I pregnant?" It's a really nerve-racking thought. But before you freak out, take a deep breath and take the following steps.<br>  <br>  Assess the Situation<br>  <br>  Don't panic. Ask yourself if it's actually possible that you could be pregnant. What did you do, sexually speaking?<br>  Pregnancy can happen any time ejaculate ("***") or pre-ejaculate ("pre-***") is spilled inside the vagina or on or near the vulva. Here are some examples of sex play that do NOT cause pregnancy:<br>  Kissing ,masturbation ,body rubbing, oral sex, anal sex.<br>  These are types of outercourse, and they won't cause pregnancy — unless ejaculate or pre-ejaculate comes into contact with the vagina or vulva.<br>  <br>  Did You Get Your Period?<br>  <br>  It isn't possible to have a period and be pregnant. But it is possible to be pregnant and have vaginal bleeding that may seem to be a period — but this is rare.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that while a missed period is a symptom of pregnancy, there are many other reasons why a girl might miss her period — such as stress, illness, or a diet that's too low in fat. Of course, if you've been having unprotected vaginal intercourse and you've missed a period, a pregnancy test may be the wisest choice you can make.<br>  <br>  Take a Pregnancy Test<br>  <br>  If a woman thinks she might be pregnant, the first thing she needs to do is find out for sure, either by going to a health clinic for confidential testing or by taking a home pregnancy test. She can call 1-800-230-PLAN to schedule an appointment for a pregnancy test at a Planned Parenthood health center.<br>  <br>  Home pregnancy tests are available at pharmacies, and they usually cost about $8-15 in the U.S. Pregnancy tests are effective early — as soon as a few days after a missed period. But be sure to follow exactly the directions on the package in order to get an accurate result.<br>  <br>  Women who take home pregnancy tests often go to clinics to have the results confirmed by a health care provider. Also, if the test is positive, and the woman is pregnant, the clinician can offer counseling on the woman's pregnancy options.<br>  <br>  It's All in the Timing<br>  <br>  If you've had unprotected sex within the past five days, there's still hope. Emergency contraception (EC) can reduce the risk of pregnancy after unprotected vaginal intercourse. Emergency contraception pills (ECPs) can reduce the risk of pregnancy if started within 120 hours (five days) of unprotected vaginal intercourse. The sooner they're taken, the better. If started within 72 hours of unprotected sex, they can reduce the risk of pregnancy by 75 to 89 percent.<br>  <br>  For more information on emergency contraception, call 1-800-230-PLAN for the Planned Parenthood center nearest you, or 1-888-NOT-2-LATE. You can also ask about emergency contraception at any public or women's health center, or your clinician's office.<br>  <br>  Be Prepared Next Time<br>  <br>  Why go through all that drama again? Besides, partners often find that sex is a lot more comfortable and enjoyable when they aren't worrying about pregnancy. Teens who have vaginal intercourse need to make choices about birth control. To learn about your options, check out Birth Control Choices for Teens, Facts about Birth Control, and Your Contraceptive Choices.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.teenwire.com/infocus/2003/if-20030514p178-pregnant.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.teenwire.com/infocus/2003/if-...</a><br>  <br>  Videos about childbirth, pregnancy, and parenting, birth control.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGT5wLTQeSg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGT5wLTQe...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwQiZBgCDjE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwQiZBgCD...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search=childbirth%20birth&sort=video_avg_rating" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/results?search=ch...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=childbirth" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=ch...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/video/search?p=childbirth&x=30&y=16">http://video.yahoo.com/video/search?p=ch...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=parenting" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=pa...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=teen+pregnancy" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=te...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5048185419106590466&q=birth+control" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5085187650154662430&q=birth+control+is%3Afree" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a>|`|aace5a5d2e678289f56d60cfde135e4caa	they say if you feel that you may be pregnant there is a good chance you are. you know your body.

(right up untill your water breakes in the US)<br>  For an elective abortion it depends on the state law and the doctor, I know of a clinic in flordia that will do abortions as late as 28 weeks (7 months)|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	If you live in the States you will have to check EACH state's laws concerning abortion.

Most states go up to 24 weeks.  Around that timeframe, you may have to prove that the baby is a danger to your health or is in danger itself.  You can actually have an abortion up to term in some states if there is a serious fetal anomality or you can prove that the baby is killing you.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you will get all sorts of criticism for asking this question but make sure that you make the decision that is right for you.  I was in the same position so I know what you're probably feeling right now.  Don't let any attacks on your character make you feel worse than you already do.|`|AA11226053	It depends on your state, Michigans law requires abortion to happen before 12 weeks.  Check your state laws, they vary.  Also consider adoption, aren't you gald your mother did not abort you?|`|bd89d3b4d5c57307017658104ee3dc51aa	i believe it's 12 weeks.  so 5 months is not possible.|`|AA12276199	Down south it's 24 weeks (how awful). What you really should be asking is how they do the abortion. If you're early on they dilate your cervix and use saline to flush the baby out. Which burns the baby's skin, then basically they just let them suffocate. If you're farther along they dilate your cervix( but it's not as simple as just flushing the baby out) then they puncture the baby skull so they can just rip it out. How Humane!|`|a930acaa5c2e2a1a34f1837e69f650d4aa	i think 12 wks which is 3 mos. so 5 mos is killing a baby. there r states willing to do it but if u don't want it just put him/her up for adoption! but it's a baby u already know the gender, if u're for real please just give it up for adoption! or do the infant surrender act. as soon as u have it leave it at a hospital, police station or fire station!|`|b15cf6c81e03ae2c8f9205ad4dfa7ca5aa	I don't know where you live but in D.C. it is hard to find a place that will do it that late and if they do, they will charge you thousands. I know of a place in NJ that will do it for a very low price. I was 6 month and wanted it done they told me 1800. I think. I couldn't do it though. Don't feel bad, do whats right for you. We all have our reasons.

You probably just pulled a muscle.

The baby really can't do that at this point in the pregnancy.  You're on the right track.  Stay calm.  Relax in a warm bath.  Drink a cup of hot tea.  Wait a little while and try to call your doctor back.  If you are really worried you should go to the ER.|`|AA11830777	Call a nurse on the maternity ward. You need to talk to someone now.

E7MgO2pZaa	Well this is the most information I could find in my brief search for you. I hesitate to put this link up though because it mentions an "oriental" girl. Ugh. *shudder*<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.canadiancrc.com/Child_abandonment.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.canadiancrc.com/Child_abandon...</a>|`|2wyDALHgaa	I would put it to you that children are not like forgotten dry cleaning or a car that was parked on a side street for too long before being towed and sold off at a Crown Assets auction.  The fact of the matter is, in the case you are speaking about, the child was not abandoned since it was left with a responsible adult and at no time was the child's life in danger or was it neglected.<br>  <br>  Check out the links below.  They may help.  Of note is CC Sec 218 which clearly would not apply.  Hope it works out well.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Hi! <br>  <br>  <br>  Criminal Code of Canada, Section 218: "everyone who unlawfully abandons or exposes a child who is under the age of 10 years, so that its life is or is likely to be endangered, or its health is or likely to be permanently injured."<br>  <br>  I tried looking through the Canada Justice site and running a search on "child abandonment" and I couldn't find a specific statute. There is some information contained in the Divorce Act and the Family Orders and Enforcement Act but as I said, nothing specific. Here's the link - perhaps you can find something I didn't.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/result" rel="nofollow">http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/result</a><br>  <br>  Of course none of this information concerns childcare arrangements.<br>  <br>  I think as long as people have suitable childcare arrangements for limited periods, everything in writing and keep to the agreed stipulations of the agreement, there is little that can be done to claim that someone has abandoned a child (ie Temporary Guardianship). <br>  <br>  There are cases of children being abandoned while in the care of others and I think that becomes different situation and is generally decided on an individual basis. <br>  <br>  You might want to check with social services and/or a legal professional.

This is normal.  Your stomach is shrinking as your uterus expands (less room for your stomach and lungs!)  I'm currently 31 weeks pregnant with my 3rd child.  I, too, have been having trouble with depression and exhaustion!  I've lost about 20 pounds during this pregnancy.  I lost weight during my other 2 pregnancies also.  The doctor isn't worried because I was overweight to begin with  but the babies grew (and is growing) normally.  I only eat about once a day right now and have to force that sometimes.  I take my prenatal vitamin and an extra calcium at night (less heartburn that way) every night.    I do worry about the baby getting proper nutrients but if I don't feel like eating it makes me sick to try.  My advice is keep doing what you're doing..eating small snack type meals (say peanut butter and crackers, piece of fruit, piece of cheese, carrots, etc.) throughout the day.  Just a bite or two every once in a while is better than not eating at all. I need to start doing this as well.  As long as your baby is doing fine then its getting what it needs from you.|`|cc1e967560e442dd72e60aa3228acd0aaa	Don't worry a bit!! You are doing great and it's nice to hear what you are eating is healthy. In your last trimester your stomach is so squished by that babe you are bound to lose your appetite. My girlfriend just had a healthy baby girl last week and also lost weight towards the end.  Keep up the great work and enjoy your last bit of freedom while you can (geez I always wanted to punch people out when they said that lol) Congrats and good luck!|`|AA11226053	You are perfectly fine, I did the same could not eat, but forced myself.  With my first 2 pregnancies I gained 10 lbs & then 11lbs total.  My OB told me to aim for 15lbs trhis time (we will see) Oh but try to avoid the peanut butter every day, pregant women are told to eat it in moderation or not at all as it can lead to your baby having a nut allergy.|`|c558eaec781c6371a8fc920a36a87043aa	I am 37 weeks pregnant with my second baby and I have the same issue both times at the end I do not have and appetite and I have to force myself to eat which is a horrible feeling but I dont eat as much as I should probably and my first baby came out perfectly fine and i had the right weight gain.
967aae0d16dea5cecb00409736b6dcb0aa	First off, I would contact the Department of Children and Family Services. I don't know what the proper name of it is in Colorado but that is what it is called in Florida. They will. be able to get you on Medicaid since you are unemployed and pregnant. That way the baby will have insurance until it's first birthday. Also, they will go retro-active for 3 months so all of your medical care will be covered and you will not run up any medical expenses. They will also be able to lead you in the right direction of any other assistance you may need or be entitled to. <br>  <br>  Good luck and my thoughts and prayers are with you.|`|0afc78cc33f29223f9dc8f7f7a8dbe99aa	I don't know about the disability, but I know about the lawsuit... you've got a great one.

687b7bb3139a282d071b39990a16045faa	You are right all labors are differant. I had two kids and both were very differant, the first one I didn't notice anything differant, I felt the urge to go to the bathroom barly got in there and my water broke.  The second pregnancy there were alot of changes, two nights before birth, my nipples were swelled, and leaking, very painful back cramps. The very night before birth, I felt burning and stinging in my ovaries and went to the hospital, and they told me to go home get lots of rest cuase my daughter is letting me know she's ready to enter this world.  Now the very night I had her was strange, I gained 4 pounds over night, from retaining water, and my back cramps moved to my ovaries, and upper abs, Plus the leeaking breats, and the tender swelled nipples.|`|5daf4267d9aa1a38f9fb56a22854af64aa	i had more energy.

Please remember you are on an emotional roller coaster. Even thought you are prepared, there are many new responsibilities facing you. Along with questions about the your babies health. Yes, you feel everything, every change. When you hold your baby for the first time, all these cramps, pains, fears will melt away.

Also, use the sites Ovusoft.com, Fertility Friend.com and Babymed.com.....it will help you and help you understand what is going on while TTC|`|AA11457761	It seems that you are confused about the whole BBT ordeal! Get the book "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Weschler! It will help you out tremendously! The first day of you period should be when you temperature is low! Your temp. should go up when you ovulate! It should stay up until you have you period again...which will make it go down again! I you have a consistantly high temperature for 16-20 days after you ovulate, then most likely you are pregnant! Hope this helps & good luck with TTC...

My daughter pretty much sat still during contractions, but I never had Braxton-Hicks with her either.  This pregnancy is totally different.|`|AA11920812	Mine moved when I was having braxton hicks. That's one way I knew they were braxton hicks. When I was in real labor he didn't move. Actually, that scared me.  But, once in the hospital on the monitor the nuse was telling me that it was normal. The baby is in position and just ready to get out at that point.<br>  <br>  How does your contraction feel? Usually the real thing is intense and starts in your back and moves across your belly. I felt like my body was pushing this baby out and I was a bystander. Kinda like when your sick and throwing up (sorry to be gross) but, it's intense and you can't stop it.<br>  <br>  Does it form a pattern?<br>  Does it stop when you lay on your left side or take a break?|`|1575cb5c5859bedf1e0c82c0bf3ff029aa	babies can move during Braxton Hicks contraction, but generally do not move during real contractions because they are more powerful and squeeze the baby so tight that they are unable to move.|`|22ff0e123ffb20f91023f4e47ce57b20aa	With my first, she did not, but I had to pee after every one up untill she came out. With my second she moved like crazy everytime.  I think that made them worse when the baby is all moving and wanting out of that place.  <br>  <br>  I guess it all depends on the baby and how they react to the stress.|`|928b5221ebd91e5612ed8c3c5651f672aa	No, They get stress out and usually they stop moving.|`|d4dca7c7989dd8831ea829fc7d93402daa	My last baby did actually move yet during a couple of my contractions.

AA10242664	Do whatever you need to do to regain control.  She has control right now and you don't.  I remember the bed time thing as if it were yesterday.  I have 3.  2 Girls ages 11 and 9 and a boy 3.  When my girls were younger I used to dread the thought of bedtime.. It was ALWAYS a fight.. The thought  of bedtime was enough to send me into a anxiety attack.. It would be 11pm if not later and I would still be fighting them..  I would finally get them asleep and a few hours later one if not both of them would be in bed with me.  UGH... Anyways.. I started to immediately take them back to their own bed with a hug and a kiss and an I love you but you need to stay in your in own bed.. Bedtimes themselves got easier when I started letting them pick out a bedtime story to read.  I would read it and then they would know it was bedtime.. It was also a calming effect for all of us.. Maybe the calming effect will help for you?<br>  As for the demanding of breakfast and the doors closed/open.. Tell her and more importantly SHOW her that YOU are BOSS..I can not stress this enough.. I have a friend that has 3 boys who totally run the show.  They are demanding, unruly, and a lot of the time just down right disrespectful.  She is beside herself right now with absolutely no control.  It will be alot easier on both you and your child if you set the boundries now and follow through with them instead of trying to gain some control when she is older.. One thing that I notice that works with my 3 yr old is taking something away from that he enjoys..He has to earn it back by behaving.. If he throws a toy.. it goes in the garbage.. If I have to pick up his toys they go in a bag that hangs in the closet until he earns it back..Good Luck to you!|`|80578b521ef7675f058613b674088db7aa	If she's not getting enough sleep she's probably crankier, but it's hard to get a kid to sleep more than they want. Do you block the light out of the room? Maybe she wakes early cuz she's hungry? Do you have those child proof doorknob covers- I would just close it and let her freak out. My son eats cat food and tissues but not anything nutritious so i don't know what to tell you there. I wouldn't bother attending an old sore either.<br>  <br>  If you trust her to be up early alone, you could set out a breakfast she can get out of the fridge and then watch some tv.<br>  <br>  maybe if you run her around a couple of hours before bedtime she'll go to sleep and if you do it for a couple of days she might get used to the timing. Every kid's different, but anything's worth a shot when it comes to sleep.|`|820a73cf560f113ec7b4b70fb5270d0baa	Sounds like you have not only pampered her beyond belief but also let her do what she wants, meeting her every demand.  Obviously it is time for other forms of discipline since what you do already is not working.  You need to set rules and stick to them.  Be consistant and let her know for a fact that there are consequeces for her if she does not follow those rules.  It will be hard because you let it get this far.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	First a 3 year old can not DEMAND anything.  She is 3.  <br>  <br>  Im sorry but I do not know what a mucous is.  I would suggest stop feeding it to herif you dont want her to have it. <br>  <br>  She will eat what you put in front of her if she gets hungry enough.  I know it sounds mean but you may have to let her learn by going hungry for an hour or two . <br>  <br>  Try to comprimise with her about being in her bed and not yours. Find something she wants and if it comes down to it bribe her with sleeping in her own bed.  <br>  <br>  And when it comes to closing a door that you want closed. CLOSE it.  Remember you are bigger then she is.  And the one in charge.. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|bf621e05dd1c4f89ff36b9fdce162254aa	Have you looked at any of the Super Nanny material?  She has a great getting them to bed routine.  Plus heaps of other very sensible advice.<br>  <br>  You child is ruling the roost because you are letting her.  You and your husband need to set consistant boundaries, explain them to her, and stick to them.  Children need boundaries - if you don't set any, the child keeps looking for them and in so doing becomes more badly behanved, while you are at the end of your tether.  No-one is happy.  <br>  <br>  It is impossible to write a child rearing book on Yahoo Answers, so my advice is to seek out some Super Nanny material.

This triggers a release of leutinizing hormone that stimulates the follicle to develop & release an egg.  Usually, a woman will take it for 5 days, starting on the 5th day after her period begins.  <br>  <br>  I think a doc would prescribe it after an exam & history if you have been trying to conceive for a while & haven't been successful.<br>  <br>  Careful, though, the major side effect is pms.

It will keep your period on a stricter schedule similar to the birth control pill, but it won't prevent pregnancy. Its a common drug prescribed for women who do not have a regular menstrual cycle and are trying to conceive. A doctor will probably want evidence of an irregular menstrual cycle before prescribing it. If you are having regular periods and are still not conceiving Clomid is probably not the drug you need. Unfortunately I do not know the cost of this drug without any kind of insurance or discount prescription plan coverage, but your doctor or pharmacist should be able to help answer that question to let you know what you would be getting into financially.

You can have that LH surge enough to detect on a test, but then your body just doesn't push that egg out and can result in an anovulatory cycle.  <br>  <br>  I think OPKs can be useful, but not can't be a sure-fire way to really tell IF and WHEN you ovulated exactly.  <br>  <br>  I used them in conjunction with charting my temps (BBT) for FREE at fertilityfriend.com.  That will tell you if you are ovulating or not.

Hope that helps :)|`|c471fa209a2314bcb613c5a1aab602afaa	Yes, sleeping with your mouth open will affect your temp, however if you are charting, you should know how long your luteal phase is (which can be anywhere from 12 - 16 days) and you would know when to expect your period and hence the temp drop.<br>  From my experience, this could be exactly that (my hubby tells me I catch flies when I sleep (sleep with mouth open)) and this affects my temp reading, but note it on your chart when you wake up with that dry mouth..  <br>  DO NOT DRINK WATER and then take your temp, that will give you an incorrect reading.  <br>  Wait till after your period is due (if it doesn't arrive) before taking the HPT, but again, if you are charting you will notice the 18+ days of high temp indicating pregnancy.

Do not continue TTC until you are sure all of the Depo is out of your system. Having even trace amounts of Depo in you during pregnancy can lead to serious birth defects. <br>  <br>  "The book Contraceptive Technology says: "It is not possible to discontinue Depo Provera immediately. Weight gain, depression, breast tenderness, allergic reactions, and menstrual irregularities may continue until Depo Provera is cleared from a woman's body, about 6 to 8 months after her last injection. After discontinuing Depo Provera, women may also have a 6 to 12 month delay in return of fertility"

Yeb2nZTFaa	Most private preschool programs are for three and four year old children, and most expect the children to be potty trained.  There are daycare programs for younger children that are not potty trained.    Head Start is a bit different and eligibility is based on family income.  Age when a child can start Head Start is frequently tied to how much funding the program has.  Here in my area of Southern California, the age to start this year was 4 but the previous year they accepted many 3 year olds when they had a stronger budget.  It never hurts to apply.  Your pediatrician or local school district should have information on where you can apply.  <br>  <br>  The most important thing you can do for your son is to read, read, read!  The books for his age should be very simple.  He will probably want the same book over and over, and that's fine.  You are building his vocabulary, language skills, narrative skills (story structure), sequencing skills and prediction skills.  The books don't have to be fancy, I got most of my kids books at garage sales and thrift stores.

If you are passing clots or seeing heavy bleeding or extreme cramping go to the hospital it could also be an eptopical pregnancy. Be very careful! Listen to your body and drink lots of water right now to stay hydrated.

But despite sexual intercourse without birth control, you've been unable to conceive a child.<br>  If you've been trying to conceive for more than a year, there's a good chance that something may be interfering with your efforts to have a child. Infertility, also known as subfertility, is the inability to conceive a child within one year. Infertility may be due to a single cause in either you or your partner, or a combination of factors that may prevent a pregnancy from occurring or continuing.<br>  Infertility differs from sterility. Being sterile means you're unable to conceive a child. With sterility, you or your partner has a physical problem that precludes the ability to conceive. A diagnosis of infertility simply means that becoming pregnant may be a challenge rather than an impossibility.<br>  Read the whole article with the link.<br>  Infertility links:<br>  <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/infertility.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/infer...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.asrm.org/Patients/faqs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asrm.org/Patients/faqs.html</a><br>  <a href="http://infertility.about.com/cs/clomi1/a/Clomid.htm" rel="nofollow">http://infertility.about.com/cs/clomi1/a...</a><br>  <a href="http://infertility.about.com/" rel="nofollow">http://infertility.about.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mymonthlycycles.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mymonthlycycles.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-37,GGGL:en&q=infertility" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=na...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.womenshealthchannel.com/infertility/" rel="nofollow">http://www.womenshealthchannel.com/infer...</a><br>  <br>  Watch these videos, they may help!<br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5753182808696748538&q=infertility&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-27890337830851718&q=infertility&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5672477436384714085&q=infertility&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1309836638206029947&q=infertility&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2144696109012136940&q=infertility&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5930049855274157754&q=infertility&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5123513760188352336&q=infertility&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5753182808696748538&q=miscarriage&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a>|`|2b9ffa184266370272bbaf5dbc3f00e1aa	usually 10-14 days after your period you can buy ovulation tests at the drug store to know when youre ovulating|`|a757034ea981167678ea8872d86271c9aa	hey its usually one day between days 10-14 the best thing to do though is set yourself up an ovulation calendar on www.babyzone.com this can then tell you when you will ovulate and when are the best times to have sex.

lN0GkKgaaa	I think you might be mistaken... more and more women are having babies later in life than they were before. Now women who are 35+ are having babies sometimes their first ones.<br>  <br>  Teen pregnancy is actually declining in the last 10 years. And of course their is a lot of young mothers who get pregnant in their early 20s. But it seems like more and more women are getting pregnant way later in life.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	I'm in college so for me I think moms are becoming older; personally I think anybody having children under the age of 25 is young. But maybe that's because I associate with people who aren't sex fanatics, I'm patient to get a boyfriend because I want a real relationship not something that is rushed and I want to know that he is right, and who put education first instead of marriage. Personally; I want to have a career and a hubby for a few years before I have children and I will probably be done having kids in my mid 30s I'm 19 now and there is NO rush to give up my young adulthood. =] Being pure is the way to be. Oh and it really bothers me when people say oh I'm 19 and a mother and so much more mature than you; having babies early does not make you mature.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Excuse me "More than a stay at home Mom" some of us want to raise our kids at home, did you ever think of that?  That statement is very offensive to me!  I have always wanted to have kids young and my husband has a great career which lets me stay at home with our daughter and raise her.  I was under the impression that women got married and had kids straight out of high school back then.  I guess its a personnel choice...........Some "Young Moms" choose to have kids <br>  young.  I am so sick of being judged for my decisions!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Its not that serious sweetie.........nobody on Y!A has ever pissed me off!  Your statements where just a little offensive and closed minded not to mention WRONG!  Everybody is different and I have a life plan like anybody else would it just involves babies, then school and a career for me!  There is no cookie cutter way to be in society we are all different and nobody is right or wrong!  I am just a little oposite from main stream.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	I think that it is in face the ways of the new generation. The media makes it looks that moms' have to be hot and the perfect parent and the perfect life. And mistakes too. Kids had sex in high school for many years but people just became careless as the years went by. There's a lot of reason of why some girls have three children by the age of 22. But those are the top in my thought.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I'm thinking that most of the younger women who have babies, the pregnancies weren't planned. (Not all of them) There's nothing really wrong with that, but that's basically the reasons. I was young when I got pregnant (not THAT young), but I was 21 when I gave birth to my first.. and it was an unplanned pregnancy.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	honey kids are having kids now they start at 13! i am pregnant with my first and when i have him i will be 19.

I would work except who is going to hire a 6month pregnant woman!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I mean not all women want to be working mothers. I personally would prefer to be a SAHM while my husband is the main bread winner. Even after i graduate from college i would prefer not to work and just take care of my family (just having the knowledge i gained from my college experience would be fine with me). It just depends on what that individual sees as being right for them. I always said i wanted my children young so i would be able to relate to them better. By the time i'm 30 i want to be, if not finished, almost done having kids. And you never know what extremes those women in the 70's and 80's went to to not have babies. I'm personally doing all i can to be more that just a working mom and provide the best for my child.|`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	I think it's due to a lack of parents teaching their children sexual education. Most of the young parents get pregnant by accident.<br>  <br>  Granted, mine was an "accident" too, but I have a great career and wonderful benefits and I'm fully prepared to have this baby (due in a few days!). Unfortunately, the father cheated on me multiple times so i'll be doing it alone... nonetheless, the baby is a blessing!<br>  <br>  I'm 28, so don't feel old :)|`|AA11827582	If you think about it, back in the day men and women were getting married at 14 and having children....  so its not that they are getting younger and younger.. its like we are rewinding time...<br>  <br>  mostly because if you aren't having sex you aren't "cool" <br>  watch Secret Life of the American Teenager,... they are spot on|`|q2Y9SzpXaa	Strange.

a78ab1ccafe267343a3f67eee3d0b42aaa	Personalmente yo no me haria un aborto, pero estoy de acuerdo en la legalizacion. Argentina, mi país,  en esto es hipocrita. Le dan mucha bolilla a la iglesia, la que dice no al aborto, la misma que cuando una adolescente decide seguir con un embarazo no deseado la expulsan del colegio religioso. La iglesia es incoherente, debiera darle contencion espiritual. Lo único que hace es se?alarla con los dedos, es una pecadora para la iglesia por haber quedado embarazada. en fin no hay p....que les venga bien. No por legalizar va a haber mas abortos sino que moriran menos. Me olvidaba tambien la iglesia se opone a la educacion sexual, ahora ya la implementaran pero a la curia le molesta. en fin seria largo explicar mi punto de vista. pero a buen entendedor sobran mis conceptos. yo apuesto a la vida pero cada uno sabe donde aprieta el zapato.

Sí uno es maduro para tener relaciones sexuales puede ser maduro para resolver un embarazo, pero en la mayoría de los casos esto no sucede o sea que la sociedad debería aportar un poco de solidaridad ante algo que no se sabe si te tocará de cerca. Y tampoco somo tan idóneos para culpar o absolver a quienes tengan que tomar la decisión de abortar. Me parece que lo más sano para una sociedad adulta y solidaria debería ser unirnos para que esto se haga realidad, tanto el control natal y la educación sexual, como legalizar el aborto. Me parece un poco hipócrita juzgar a alguien que crea que su solución es abortar, sin estar en sus zapatos, no te parece. Todos los argentinos nos llenamos la boca de ética y buenas costumbres, pero quien no conoció a alguien que se acostaba con su mucama, y para que no se entere nadie le pagaba a un buen médico amigo de la familia para que le haga el favorcito, y luego todos los domingos iba a misa para lavar sus pecados.

BPNAcSpVaa	Yes, you can get pregnant then, right then is when you ovulate. Which is when people have sex while TTC. Sperm, depending on individual factors, can stay in your body up to a week. The boy sperm die off first and the girl sperm die last. That is why is is usually harder to try for a boy than a girl. But, the boy sperm can swim faster and farther at first, but other factors can interfere and they can die.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	You can get pregnant right before, or right after your period. Sperm can stay from 3-5 days, so they say..|`|KzmrWzOJaa	Ovulation is different for everyone. You could be pregnant. I believe sperm can stay inside of you for up to a week. If you think your pregnant, see a doctor or get a pregnancy test (they even sell them at the dollar tree where everythings a dollar) but I would just wait it out. You probably just going through changes.|`|831cf80630eaa5c9cdbb28536f2027d5aa	You can get pregnant anytime, but it's most likely during ovulation. Ovulation is usually about 2 weeks after your period.
AA11664639	It can take a while for the HPT to show up positive.  Wait a week and try it again.  Also check at www.peeonastick.com to see how much hcg (pregnancy hormone) you need in your urine for your specific brand of test to detect pregnancy.  Some tests require more and some less.  <br>  <br>  You can also request a blood test from your doctor's office.  This will show pregnancy regardless of how far along you are.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!|`|40bcdaa097df401f333ec2ff5a794c36aa	sounds like implantation bleeding.  wait awhile and test again.|`|8cb3b0df1e4b5a7b542a71bb54cadc52aa	i would wait and see if u bleed anymore- go bk to the doctors and see what they say. it could be nothing or u could be pregnant. i think its just implantation bleed , but go bk to doctors and see.|`|6bfd6331fbc212b9ae381f6478c62c12aa	wait another 5 days and test again if no period. sounds like implantation.

f34f4f025cc56607001373270581d5b2aa	Mine just was a little blood, not much at all.|`|AA10923333	It can be a tiny amount or almost like a period but (usually) lighter. Mine lasted several days and I just thought I had a light period until a week later when I took a pregnancy test because I was experiencing other symptoms. <br>  <br>  There are other also reasons for bleeding in early pregnancy - see website below.|`|66bd767be67bea218c2dc8dbbe34d98faa	Mine was off and on for a day or so. Sometimes fairly heavy.
PPNlNc92aa	Firstly I am so sorry for your loss.  Personally I think you should be going in for a d&c .  The bleeding should have stopped by now as it usually only lasts for about 10 days or so.  Something could be wrong.  Do yourself and body a favour and have the procedure.  The sooner this ends for you, the sooner you will be able to move to the next phase and try again! Best of luck for you|`|UUysEV0yaa	Im sorry to hear about your loss. <br>  Go back to the doctors, make them check you over. This isnt right whats happening to you. Maybe see another doctor this time.|`|98WKYtfwaa	When i miscarried i bled for about 3weeks in total from start to finish. When i got my period i was heavier than my usual one and lasted the full 7 days instead of my usual 5. <br>  <br>  I had to go into the hospital for an ultrasound to make sure everything was cleared out my body and it was, so it was just my body readjusting itself. <br>  <br>  I suppose you should call your doctor and get checked out again, if there is some left inside you, you'd want to get it out ASAP incase it causes an infection.|`|sY6ZI2Ooaa	Hunnie regardless you should of had a D&C just to clear the remaining of anything out. I don't know why your doctor would even suggest the you do it naturally. especially if it's been weeks of bleeding. You could actually be back on track with your period but how can you fully know if you've had the same reoccurring problem?! Call the doctor just to be safe. Good luck|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Go to the ER. Your doctor is being lazy there is no reason it should be lasting this long! Go to the hospital and explain it to them. They'll do what's necessary. Wish you the best of luck sweetie. Sorry your going through this!|`|480ff50399638bdbe136120b22e6085eaa	I'm sorry to hear you going through that. If you're TTC, you should let your body rest for several months before trying again.<br>  I can imagine that could be very stressful. <br>  Good Luck.|`|AA11830777	You need to call the doctor. You shouldn't be bleeding that much. Call now.|`|XIuQyB7oaa	Hi there, I'm sorry to hear of your loss and I'm sure you have heard that a million times. However, after a miscarriage, bleeding does usually calm down after about 2 weeks, but from the symptoms you are showing, I would say that it was a little more serious than that. I am stunned to hear that your Doctor told you, that you did not need a D & C. That is usually a requirement after having a miscarriage as you can get infections and so on. This I think may have happened to you, but the Doctor should be able to tell you more on this as I am not an expert. I hope you get this resolved soon as I can see you need closure. Be sure not to rush into another pregnancy too soon though, it could damage you even further. I know this sounds horrible, but honestly, you need your body to recover.
bc2d55ee2ecf2976fa1ef4fb122746acaa	I went through this with my husband and I went on strike all I did was take care my chid. No dishes. No laundry.

He should have thought about how much work it'd be before he decided to have a baby.  Make him help you.  You could also get a family member to help you out for a couple of hours so you have some free time to yourself
7XBoIgd6aa	No there is no link to miscarriages or deformities from BC because the pill tricks your body into thinking it is pregnant there fore you don't ovulate. <br>  <br>  "If you are in this situation and plan to keep your baby, you should stop taking the pill immediately -- but there shouldn't be an increased risk of miscarriage or any other problems with the pregnancy due to the accidental exposure. A large 2008 study examined a registry of 92,719 women and found no evidence of increased risk of fetal death in babies exposed to artificial hormones during pregnancy."|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	well, my stepsister was taking the pill, switched to another brand, and didn't get her period. So after about 6 weeks she went back to the doctors and complained she didn't get her period. The doctor told her this happens and is quite normal. Well another 6 weeks went by and still no period. Her doctor is clearly an idiot, because he said again this is common. Well a couple weeks after that, she went to a walk in clinic and told the doctors her concern. She said her belly was starting to get big, but thought it was from bloating from not getting her period for so long. The doctor decided to take a pregnancy test which was turned positive. She was totally shocked and had no idea how far along she was. This whole time she continued to take the pill to make sure she didn't get pregnant. She had an ultrasound scan a few days later and to her surprise she was 19 weeks pregnant!! She was terrified and thought something was definitely going to be wrong with the baby, but that wasn't the case. She had a healthy baby girl! Crazy story but very true. i think things will be just fine.

397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	I had mine at 16 weeks and they said girl. it was right., then again we saw the '3 little dots' that indicate its a girl.|`|plI0WOrUaa	If they see genitalia, its 100% or around there.  If they don't really see anything, they can make an educated guess, which is obviously not 100%.  Maybe ask for a 3D ultrasound a little later in your pregnancy if you want to know for sure.
ITu6gONdaa	The baby tends to drop a little later in pregnancy. The actual "dropping" is the babys head engaging into the pelvis. Im almost 39 weeks and my daughter is still really high. My dr has a hard time even reaching my cervix as she is so high. I think it varies from woman to woman.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	It is the baby engaging...a little like dropping but not as dramatic...my son never dropped but once it happens you usually have that famous "pregnancy waddle"
Y8ZmuWwgaa	Mia Harlow Dawson is okay -- I'm not crazy about it, but I don't think it's bad either. Mia is pretty, but I think it's much better used as a nickname for Amelia. Using a more formal form simply provides more options, and it's good to give your child a name with options. <br>  <br>  Onto Harlow, it's a pretty name, but it's very celebrity-associated right now. While it's of course the last name of pinup Jean Harlow, it's much less associated with her than with Nicole Richie, who many people find somewhat trashy. Have you considered using something with old-Hollywood glamour but with a more neutral association?<br>  <br>  My last observation is that the flow may feel a bit monotonous, as all three names are two syllables. I'd suggest varying the syllable structure a little -- two names with two syllables is okay, but to break the pattern, it might be nice to look for something with one, three, or four syllables. <br>  <br>  From the list you've provided, here are some combinations I love:<br>  <br>  Amelia Pearl<br>  Lyla Gwendolen (the -en spelling of Gwendolyn looks better here since Lyla has a -y. Lila Gwendolyn also looks great, but I wouldn't repeat the -ys.)<br>  Ruby Sophia<br>  Sophia Olive<br>  Ruby Gwendolen<br>  Gwendolen Ruby<br>  <br>  If you want some names with the sparkle and glamour of Harlow but less of the association, you might think about using:<br>  <br>  Isla<br>  Scarlett<br>  Greta<br>  Vivien<br>  Evangeline<br>  Audrey<br>  Faye<br>  Daphne<br>  <br>  Good luck -- I hope I could help!|`|14RumPPvaa	I love the name Mia Harlow Dawson.

3Yfp3QUfaa	11? 11 year olds really shouldnt date or anything I dont think. But, yeah she likes you she probably thinks you dont like her? Is she unpopular and you are popular or the other way around? That could make her nervous and scared to talk to you if you are popular cause she wont think you like her...shes not your 'type'. Is she pretty? You know cause that could be some of it...how about you ask her to hang out or something so that she will feel less 'nervous' or Im not sure...you know I think you are too young to have a girlfriend anyway, so if it works out, yay! and If not theres always another chance later in life...<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|ZX2so3twaa	she probably likes you but is shy/doesn't think you like her back.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	She is shy.She likes you. Just be yourself. You don't have to talk all the time. Just hangin out is fun too. You will both find something to talk about. Be confident.Good luck!|`|cdAQZJGpaa	i think she likes u!|`|EfugZbYhaa	You need to chill for a bit.  Being older and a woman (24) believe me I know how little girls work.  For her to be interested (if she even is) you need to focus on other stuff right now and let her come to you.  You don't want to be the one to work more.  You always want to be in a relationship where the other person likes you more than you like them.  Plus you are way young and don't need to be stressing about this.  Girls like the calm, cool, confident guys, not the obsessed, sweaty, nervous guys.  Trust me, you listen to this advice and girls will be lining up.|`|PTWnWkPRaa	talk to her more, dont come on too strong. But she might like you. Give it time. give her hints that you like her but dont make it too obvious

EeGgovyCaa	Yes (for me at least) that feeling is so real. I never thought I could feel this way for anyone, even boyfriends that have been in my life or even my SO now. <br>  <br>  My babies are my world, those feelings are for real. It's sad to me when parents don't feel that way about their kids.<br>  <br>  Edit: when I was your age I thought the same thing, thought no way would I feel that way towards another person. You will be surprised how much room your heart has when you have your baby.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Yes. I'd give my life for my children. i love them with a passion i didn't know existed. Just as i'm sure your parents do. You never stop loving your kids no matter how old they are. i know my grandmother still thinks of my mother as her little girl, and my mom is in her 50s. i have a huge respect for my parents after becoming one myself.|`|DBKV3g4baa	My daughter isn't due for another 2 weeks, and already I can tell you that I would do anything for her.  Even though she was an unplanned baby (I'm a college student, early 20s) I can't imagine what my life would without her.  You really develop a strong bond after carrying a baby inside you for so long.  I cannot wait to finally meet my daughter.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	First off, please dont have kids now at 12 or 13 or 14 or even 18. Wait. Secondly, yes you do feel that much love for that little being.|`|DvWGTzLUaa	Yes very true. The love for a child is so great it cant really be put into words. You wouldnt think you could love someone this much. I would die for my daughter... Shes the only one in the world who means that much to me, including my mum and sisters. You will never know unless you have a child yourself.|`|chUxLFidaa	Yes. There is no better feeling!|`|YJNql5Mgaa	Yes, when you have a child, that baby IS your world.  Imagine how your parents feel about you.  Just ask them.  I'll bet your mom will tear up and tell you that she loves you more than anything.  You'll know when you grow up and have your own children.  I know I didn't feel like that until my daughter was born.  I had a quiet moment with her (in the hospital) while my husband was out getting me some food.  I remember it so clearly and it makes my heart melt and I almost tear up when I think about it.  You'll feel like that too. :)  Just give it 15 years. :)<br>  <br>  PS. Life is never like movies and books. :)  There's a quote that goes something like, "The difference between fiction and real life, is that fiction needs to make sense". :)|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	Yes, that is the feeling of unconditional love that most parents have when they have children. For some, it can take time to feel that way. On day 1, they may not have that instant connection, but it does happen over time.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Makes sense to me. I have three kids, and I love them more than I ever thought it humanly possible to love another human being. I love them unconditionally and they are my whole world. They are a part of my husband and me and the love that we share. When I look at my son who is 2, I'm amazed. He looks and acts just like his father, and I love my husband so much. My love for all of them grows so much every day. They make me very proud and I would do anything for them.
03172d36a9cfb033762c161d5e89c091aa	Sounds like it is implanation bleeding to me.  Could also be from a sensitive cervix since you have to BD so much when you are TTC but I would wait until a few days b4 ur period is expected and take a test.

e031799fce803fd1d7d883e839ab2f92aa	Sounds like it could be!!! The spotting sounds like implantation bleeding as well, but if you are thinking about being pregnant your body can sometimes do crazy things.  Try and relax until the 2nd and if no friend then take a test. I know it is stressful but try and relax.   Good luck.|`|1c86c64e56bd555cb51ea69d6899cec2aa	honey if you haven't had your period yet you can't really tell i sympothize about the breast pain your feeling and bleeding out your vagina isn't fun i know and if your having alot more sex being wetter and bleeding is expected.|`|6b7bb73a9131dd622e25dab3f544dda0aa	It sounds very possible you are pregnant.

e74043596dcc70891787ab67e2f3247baa	I have teenagers. It is so important at that age to spend as much time with them as possible. The problem is they don't want nothing to do with their parents at this age. Set good examples, remain calm and patient but let him know that you do care and stay very active in his life even if that seems like something that is aggravating to him. They act mad when you take an interest in their lives but deep down they do know that you care. Ask questions, know his friends and where he is at all times. But most importantly, try to stay sane through it all.

It was basically the people I was hanging around with. I had friends that never went to school didn't respect their parents and it rubbed off on me. Then bad things started happening to me and I realized what it was like to be without my mom and know that my father didnt really wanna deal with me so now at 19 with a son & step son I treat my mother the way I wanna be treated. Plus my mom believed I was "bipolar" which I am not and she took me to a hospital to get checked out, that helped talking to people. Also search for bootcamps that might help although it could make it worst. But, your son would know how it feels to be apart from you and maybe he'll wake the hell up. Good luck!|`|fb6ec2566c08405ae43ea9fbfaffbc5faa	Teenage is a real problem for both the children themselves and for parents. You need a good deal of your own childhood experience to be applied while you are parenting. Try to remember your childhood days and this works very well. If your son is too rude and disobedient, he needs a proper parental guide, treat him as a friend at home and try to understand him. Sometimes, mythical stories and good literature also helps. If you can draw his attention to indoor games that he can play with you, this might also be helpful.|`|4890a49b8ab1e4193636420001306589aa	so am i but doesn't mean i'm goin to juvi|`|5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	no, just remember he is going through the worse time of his life too.
avdgNTMfaa	your children would be placed in foster care until the volunteer was investigated such as their home, finances, and everything else. if they were deemed fit to raise a child by the state then your child would go to them unless someone else you knew was fighting for custody and then the courts would of course be involved.|`|57IDs4byaa	It doesnt matter who wants him or what you have arranged.

gvLjbVFJaa	It could just be a case of baby acne, and if it is there really isn't anything that can be done for it. It normally just clears up on it's own. My daughter got it around the age of 2 months old, and she had it all over her face, forehead, cheeks, and on the back of her head and neck. It only lasted a week or so. Although, it can last for months according to my doctor. As for heat rash (since someone else suggested that) It doesn't have to be actually hot to have a heat rash. She could just get it from being dressed too warmly. If she isn't acting sick, or running a fever, I'd assume that it might just be baby acne. If you are really concerned about it, you should definitely contact your doctor.  <br>  <br>  Sophia is totally cute in your avatar picture! I love the little hat she's wearing!

I will get thumbs down, but I am right.|`|mFEevGRXaa	its possible but i doubt it. usually it takes a lot more than that to get pregnant, but maybe if you don't want to get pregnant you should get on some birth control and then you won't have to worry about stuff like that.|`|rOfFOcwpaa	I don't think so.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	Very small chance.|`|bGRexKPyaa	Yuuppp, Its sure can!<br>  <br>  Those little ******* swim, very very fast...Thats why they have tails..
TJ4q7X8Vaa	I was on the pill when I had Chlamydia. I continued having a normal period every 28 days. The only thing that changed was I stopped spotting after sex. I got off the pill about a year and a half later. It was October and I got a period that month, in November, January, and spotted roughly once a month until September. I was irregular before I was on the pill and got chlamydia but I at least had periods rather than periodic spotting. June was a little heavier but not quite a period. I was surprised to find out that I was pregnant at my annual exam in September and that I had actually conceived in July. The doctor said not to worry about the spotting and I ended up having a very normal pregnancy with a perfectly healthy baby.|`|BPNAcSpVaa	Chlamydia affects everybody differently. i do know that is you have it for a long period of time it can make you infertile. You should wait on trying for a baby until your body recuperates from the STD. If for some reason you get pregnant and somehow you get it and your doctor doesn't catch it...your baby could be harmed.
b2fa05197b219768dfb8f2f5b55ef852aa	i never had any noticible contractions with my first child and the day before i had him the doc said i was thinning a little. the next morning at 6 am my water broke!!so you never know.i know the last few weeks you are anxious but dont worry nobody ever stayed pregnant forever!and getting induced isnt that bad.you still have a few weeks left before you have to worry about that!so good luck i hope you have him/her soon!!|`|1443ac90b31a81ae579f11d475c71b7caa	You are 3 weeks away plently of time left for all that stuff to happen. My son didnt drop until the week he was born and my cervix didnt thin until then either.  I think its total normal.|`|4ae0a840c79d78b4acd2b7ae1eabe7beaa	if this is your first baby then yes. i didn't drop with my first one until two hours before i had her.  they were about to do a c-section b/c of that.  if your doctors not worried about it and if your baby's healthy then you shouldn't be worried about it.  i also had a scheduled inducement with my second and i loved it so much more b/c i could plan things around it.  just listen to the doctor and everything will be fine b/c their no.1 concern is always for the baby and you.|`|efae9f9b599f38d79bdd28362462dde8aa	Everyone is different. So babies don't drop at all. If your cervex is thinning it's a good sign. Just be patient...it will happen when he or she is good and ready!|`|bf621e05dd1c4f89ff36b9fdce162254aa	You are only 37 weeks.<br>  <br>  Contractions will not start until you actually go into labour and that may be ANY time between now and about 42 weeks.<br>  <br>  Stop worrying.<br>  <br>  You MAY get the odd Braxton Hicks (false) contractions in the meantime.<br>  <br>  You are not meant to get contractions for weeks beforehand.  I suggest you get a book and read about the last weeks of pregnancy so you have a better understanding of what to expect.|`|278340cf5360c3c9d3e835e823275889aa	36 to 40 weeks is full term.  If the doc says your cervix is thinning,  everything should be going normal.  <br>  I carried all three of mine high, right up til labor. <br>  Have you had your spurt of energy?  This usually happens a week or two prior to labor.<br>  Congratulations on your baby!  Best wishes to you and your family.  May God bless all of you!
8oAlBL91aa	When you figure that out let me know how you did it lol. I've bee trying for 6 years lol.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	put her in her bed, leave the room, let her scream, won't kill her<br>  do this every night and she will get the idea|`|51dd79ad81d73891cb8b8b0d303e4e4daa	My daughter was 3 when we FINALLY got her to move to her bed. We were lucky because we were remodeling our house and she got to help me paint and decorate her new "BIG GIRL" room. We also got a her night light just in case she was scared at night and that helped. We also got into the habit of reading a bedtime story. That helped a lot. And that is "OUR TIME". We talk about things that happened or tell funny stories and I think that made her feel more comfortable in her room. I also reassured her that I was only a few steps away in case she needed something. I think that helped her feel safe, knowing she would be sleeping on her own but that we were there for her in case she needed something. Just remember to be consistent.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	i think the best way, that i have seen, is rewards. im not too agreeable with bribing, but this you can do, without actually bribing them, becuase they do deserve it, lol! <br>  get a calender and make a plan date-name it something interesting like "childs name's big girl day!!" make it about 4 days from the day you do this, get stickers. then have her put stickers to caount down the day. on that day, take her out and get a bed friend, stuffed animal of her choice, and a night light, or a bedtime story book. something to mark it as a special occasion. (i got my son a sports drink bottle, and he painted it. -i thought this would help with trips for a "drink") then on that day, set her bedtime, and thats it. make stickers for a week, have her mark the days off, and tell her in one week, if she is a good, big girl, take her to a mcdonalds and get her a special gift. this has worked for my sisters 3 kids, and one of mine. ( my first, then from then on they only slept in cribs. much easier!!) good luck!<br>  <br>  i actually just noticed she was only one-the above thing probably won't work, she is too young. at this age, the best thing, is to harden your resolve, and let her fuss. rock her and when she wakes, rock her and walk around. you will have to probably do this the first couple of nights. once she keeps waking up in her bed, she will become used to it. the point is to have her asleep when you put her to bed, the first couple of times. and then after a few nights, you can try to lay her in there at bedtime, when she isn't asleep.  a good thing to get would also be mabey the things you hang on the crib with the lights and music? my son falls asleep to that everynight. whatever you do, don't put her back into your bed. if you do it once, it becomes an option in her mind, and you don't want your bed as an option for her. if she absolutely won't do it, put a playpen next to your bed, and slowly move it out and into her room. but this is only if she fusses. that way, if you get her out, she doesn't think fussing will get her back into mommy's bed, see what i mean? try that, hope i have helped-|`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	Watch Supernanny on www.abc.com  (episodes are free to watch).<br>  <br>  She has some good methods for breaking co-sleeping and she deals with it on almost every episode. Good Luck!
CrmCHVI0aa	Just do it every other day and dont stress. Also after having sex raise your hips up with a pillow for around 15 mins to keep most of the sperm in there. Use positions like missionary and doggy to make sure the sperm is deposited close to the cervix|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	The best thing to do is have sex every other day.|`|bmrQQOJjaa	My husband and I tried every other day on our first cycle, we were using ovulation prediction kits so we could pin point ovulation. We had everything timed out just right that first month and I still didn't get pregnant. The second month we just used the ovulation prediction kit and we just did the dead every night and we got pregnant. It really doesn't matter that much if you wait to do it every other day as long as your husband has a normal sperm count.|`|BPNAcSpVaa	Buy an ovulation test. That is your best bet if you are irregular. When you are ovulating, have sex every other day, but don't let him get off any other times other than having sex with you. The reason to do it every other day is to let his sperm build up, because he has to reproduce him sperm after every time he ejaculates. Good Luck!|`|Wzws8v8daa	i have irregular periods too so i never know when i'm going to ovulate. my doctor told me to have sex every OTHER day (he specifically said not every single day - every other day is best for sperm quality). <br>  and yes it's normal for a lot of sperm to fall out even after raising your legs|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Since you don't know when you are ovulating then it is hard to say when the best time to have sex is.  I would try every 1-3 days between cycles.  And that should do the trick!  Remember the average healthy couple have a 25-30% chance of conceiving each month.|`|JoCPiWLeaa	I am very irregular also, and yes I did do the leg raise and it worked! You can also try to get on birth control with your doctor and take it for the first month ONLY. Your period will become regular and you will know when you are ovulating. I work for a family planning clinic and see it done all the time. Goodluck|`|n2leN4ewaa	I am VERY irregular too and I have 3 kids!! Have sex every day around 2 to 3 weeks after your period STARTS. You should have NO problem getting pregnant :) good luck|`|S1t4e9E0aa	everyother day
Coc593Ikaa	Are you sure about the immediate protection? Every brand of pill that I've taken (about 6 over the years) have required a full cycle to take effect. So I always had to use condoms as well for the first month.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, the pill is 99% effective if taken properly. Follow instructions and always ask the pharmacist before taking new medications with the pill (especially antibiotics) to be sure that they don't reduce the effectiveness of the pill.<br>  <br>  Many women still like to use condoms on top of the pill just to be sure. I did not. I took the pill for over a decade with no unwanted pregnancies. I only used condoms when I was on antibiotics or when I missed a pill.|`|V8wUAVdyaa	my doctor told me that I could become pregnant if I don't take it around the same time everyday|`|YZ3RbfVvaa	my doctor said you're supposed to go through an entire months worth first before you stop using condoms or other forms of protection. the thing about not taking it at the SAME TIME everyday isn't what'll get you pregnant. of course you're supposed to take it everyday but why they mention taking it around the same time each day is so you don't have mood swings or an imbalance of hormones.|`|AA11830777	Yes you can get pregnant. Have you only been on the pill for 20 days? Never taken it before? You are not immediately protected if you just started taking. Just like you aren't protected right after you stop taking it.<br>  I use condoms as well as the pill, it eases the mind.|`|1WBimx1laa	Yes ma'am you can. You are suppose to take the pill for at LEAST one month before you have unprotected sex or you run a risk of getting pregnant. If I was you, and didnt start your cycle when you are suppose to, you need to go get a pregnancy test. Good luck girl|`|VhbEwlUgaa	Yes, it does happen. You need a check up to know if you are.|`|37obEKCOaa	Yes u can get pregnant even tho u take the pills everyday because it has happen people take there pills everyday same time on time and still gets pregnant its just if ur real fertile or not and if ur ovulating or not the pill is suppose to stop u from it but it doesn't always work its not 100 sure u wont

6bfd6331fbc212b9ae381f6478c62c12aa	NO. IMPLANTATION ISNT SUPPOSE TO LAST MORE THAN A DAY. ALOT OF WOMEN DONT EVEN GET IT. ALOT ONLY SEE A STREAK ON TP WHEN THEY WIPE. IT IS NEVER HEAVY OR "GLOBS"EITHER|`|AA11657209	No. I had it with 2 of my pregnancies and it lasted just half a day, and only half a tampon was filled. That was it.
5d0533ba830536f7242b9641ace4fb68aa	Yes.  It is possible to start the lactation process by stimulating oxytocin naturally in the body.  A lot of lactation nurses have information about this for adoptive parents that have never given birth but still want to breast feed their children.  It's a controversial topic, but adoptive parents can and often do breastfeed their kids.<br>  <br>  Also, certain anti-depressants can cause you to lactate.  I was reading about Lexapro on crazymeds.com and it mentioned lactation as an unusual side effect of the drug (even in men).  Some of the anti-psychotics out there have the same effect.|`|5186da1d62e44bb29c4928dfefff1bfbaa	that's weird, go to your doctor and get some pills to stop that.|`|AA11451360	Yes it is, I used to lactate sometimes even though I was not sexually active, but my cycles were highly irregular and my OBGYN explained that my hormones were out of whack. Basically I had slightly high levels of testosterone and this delayed my period and my body thought I was pregnant. But after I had my son I haven't had it happen and I am completely regular.

AA11871343	My second son was breech. My doctor explained that many of those techniques don't work well. I was also having blood pressure issues, so she didn't want me doing these things. I have heard from other that they work in the past though. They also didn't want to move the baby...so I had a C-section.

There are different methods, including a partial birth abortion in which the baby's head is "evacuted" prior to induced birth. It's a pretty bleak thing to imagine, but it happens very rarely and is a very traumatic experience for the mother (therefore not something people jump to do).<br>  <br>  In abortions babies are not killed /after/ they've left the womb (although there's controversial practice of failed abortions where the baby at whatever stage of development "neonate" isn't dead and the standard procedure is to just let it die). A lot of talk and word of mouth surrounding abortion is melodramatic and usually spun to influence you politically. It's good that you're looking for facts and information on the matter before forming strong opinions.<br>  <br>  The diabetes bit of your friend's story is false. People including legislators are fighting for the right to use stem cells (cells extracted from viable embryos before they develop into a fetus or baby). Stem cells help docs research diseases like parkinsons and potentially diabetes i without experimenting on sentient beings.|`|AA11546175	i have never heard of that....but im sure it does happen. that is just so wrong!|`|6c8a22b74c2faeee8dfa6582580cfcf7aa	It is true.

China though officially they deny this and throw people in jail if they publish info about it - see link below) than the USA, but it does happen. <br>  <br>  In the United States, 1.4% of abortions occur at 21 weeks or later (approximately 18,000 per year). In 1997, the Alan Guttmacher Institute estimated the number of abortions past 24 weeks to be 0.08% (approximately 1,032 per year). (wikipedia - link below)<br>  <br>  But, ethically, killing a baby that has reached term and could survive outside the womb without medical intervention is the same as killing it after birth. I'll let you all decide how ethical/moral other abortions are.|`|ede4775f5ade5346e6baca02b194d7ffaa	No, it's not true.  Late-term abortions are illegal in the US.

b774d04c2b65cc1269ae055e8e4e03b7aa	The cramping should be lighter than you normal cramps. <br>  <br>  The bleeding should be very minimal, pink & brown colors.  Normally, woman find it when wiping after a BM or urination.  Sometimes, it does require a pantyliner (possibly pregnant woman shouldn't use a tampon), and lasts for a short period (1 time seen to 2 days).  Again, very light bleeding, pink & brown colors (no bright red).<br>  <br>  It's normally seen around the time you would have your period.  That's why so many woman mistake it for a light period.|`|AA11603761	Implantation bleeding is not all that common.  Only 1/3 of women get it.|`|6bfd6331fbc212b9ae381f6478c62c12aa	You dont feel implantation. It's basically like cramping. implantation spotting is like a very light period or just a spot or two that you wont need more than a pantyliner for.
6bfd6331fbc212b9ae381f6478c62c12aa	yes, your bbt stays higher than normal the entire time you are pregnant. your temps sound like you are either ovulating or you are pregnant. you should try charting on babymed.com . it is very helpful and there are alot of ladies to help. my screen name there is kimgurski. you should have at least 18 high bbt -that usually shows you are pregnant.|`|13f714b5ba67567790a2982701d064c5aa	Yes, possibly.  Assuming you had all the ingredients in place then.<br>  <br>  Higher temp does not indicate pregnancy, it indicates ovulation.  Unprotected sex during this period could lead to pregnancy.|`|d06b0c4b879b2727ae3364eb624188c4aa	I have had 2 children and i have never heard about your temp. increasing, but i dont know evrything.

I don't feel different at all.|`|AA11920812	Yes.<br>  <br>  I bought it when they told me they were going to induce. I took it off and on that week. I ended up going into labor on my due date! My son was big that's why they didn't want to let me go over.  Once I went into labor I took it every 3/4 hours. I bought the highest dosage in gelcap form and I took it as a suppasatory.<br>  <br>  A doula/midwife friend suggested this to me.<br>  <br>  She told me it was perfectly safe. And, advised me to walk, do pelvic rocks on my excersize ball (just rock back and forth it also moves baby into position), and have sex.<br>  <br>  To be honest, the day I started using it every 3 or 4 hours was the day I went into labor.  I'm sure if I had done it regularly before that I would have been in labor! That night I was in the hospital and by 9:55 the next morning my son was here!!|`|15e22e28107f582bcdd1db8b2599c68baa	I just asked this question a few days ago with no luck with any answers. all I can say is someone i know took it a little over 36 weeks pregnant (vaginally) and her water broke about an hour later.

5d0533ba830536f7242b9641ace4fb68aa	I tried Black Cohosh and it did give me contractions, but nothing strong enough to bring on labor-still trying it a little but I'm backing off on it because I don't want to hurt the baby.  Evening Primrose used as a suppository seemed to soften my cervix a bit and the baby has started to move down a lot.  I tried Castor Oil too and OH MY GOD, it was HORRIBLE!  Not only didn't it work, but it was the nastiest stuff EVER!  I'm 40 weeks exactly.  One thing that I noticed that has seemed to make a difference is eating raw pineapple followed by Dole Pineapple juice.  You're supposed to eat 3 entire pineapples and then a glass of the juice every hour.  It has been bringing on stronger contractions and it won't hurt the baby.|`|f65e4d88e4864aeb622a06e622b5385daa	Please don't take the cohosh, it can be dangerous even late in pregnancy (the original reason for taking it was to induce abortions early on).<br>  <br>  As for the castor oil, I just had horrible diarrhea and abdominal cramping.  It didn't help at all and I wouldn't ever try it again.  It made me feel more miserable (if that was possible).<br>  <br>  The primrose oil I also took and I think that it helped to soften my cervix a bit, I started taking it at 38 weeks.  I don't know that it made me go into labor any faster but once I did having softened up a bit helped.|`|532bce269d03335858dc0d192a6d2eceaa	i took castor oil on my original due date i will never ever do that again i had such bad contractions for 4 days it was horrible i was in and out of the hospital it hurt so bad  i was in labor just not progressing it was not worth it believe me just let nature run its course it will happen sex makes it happen faster too
5d0533ba830536f7242b9641ace4fb68aa	Usually they administer antibiotics during labor because if they treat it now, the chance of nodes re-developing is pretty common.  I would ask if your doctor intends to run you through a course of antibiotics during labor as well.|`|5f2395b4420ffaa28860feb71af3a947aa	Sounds like your doctor is on target.  Just make sure to request the antibiotic right before delivery.  That is the most crucial time for it.|`|94984ec38b601bbbffa6ef2c6cfcb29baa	B-strep usually isn't tested for until 3rd trimester. If your dr found it in the urine sample, then it sounds like he's on top of it. Don't worry. As long as your dr is taking care of it, you (and your baby) should be fine.|`|d2583e95d4d4519b876d402f5e6dc9b6aa	yes this is okay i had this also you just need to make sure when yougo into labor that the nurses know to start you on antibiotics and all so the baby does not get it if it does then it would be a cold aor eye infection or something and it will be okay i had it both times it is just extra bacteria down there when you get pregnant a that dont hurt you but you dont wantt the infant to get it  none of my children caught it just dont forget about the iv of antibiotics and youwill be fine

8f85dcd92e8f3f82943075a31b9dd135aa	Allow me to disagree with the vast majority of posters and say...you don't have to buy everything that everyone else buys! What I mean is, as new parents, we all go rush out and buy a crib, bassinette/cradle, infant carrier car seat/stroller/base system, bouncer, swing, high chair, exersaucer, johnny jump-up, baby bjorn, etc. We seem to think babies need a ton of stuff. I'll share a secret with you that I seriously wish someone would've shared with me when I was pregnant: THEY DON'T NEED ALL THAT STUFF! lol babies don't care. There's actually very few things a baby really needs:<br>  1)a car seat. This is a tough shopping decision, especially if you're short on money. One important thing, that again, I wish someone had told me, you don't HAVE to get a carrier car seat! Yeah, most people do, and those same most people get ticked off that they're out car seat shopping again when the baby is 5 months old and has outgrown that carrier that only goes to 22lbs. They're hard to carry around. They're awkward and heavy. And to top it off - they're bad for babies to spend all the time in they do. Go anywhere and look around: any baby you see will be in one of those stupid seats instead of being held. Too much time in those seats can actually cause developmental delays, a flat head, and fussy babies not getting the holding time they need to develop properly inside. <br>   It is really completely up to your preference, but, here's my 2cents. Personally, I'd pick out an awesome stroller (since the ones that come in a travel system often aren't all that great!) b/c the stroller is the part that you will be using for the next 3-4 years. You really need to like it, and have it be quality so you don't find yourself with a busted stroller in a year. Also, you can save money by purchasing a high quality used stroller, whereas if you buy a travel system, you can't get it used b/c it is not safe to get a used car seat. You could however, get a used stroller and check its compatibility, and get a car seat new that would work with it. That's what I did.<br>  <br>  All that said - as a single parent on a seriously limited income, I now realize I should've completely skipped the infant carrier stage. Its not a 'needed' stage in car seats, its just a convenience thing, and a recent - as in the last 15 years or so - invention to have a stay in car base and separate carrier. Here's why I think its a waste: doesn't last babies very long at all. You spend $60 and up on this carrier that is only going to last 5-8 months! And then you have to purchase a convertible car seat, and somewhere down the line a booster seat. If you skip the carrier phase, you just eliminated one seat. There is now one carrier on the market that promises to fit 99% of babies up to at least their first birthday - Graco SafeSeat1, goes to 30lbs. However, there are limitations to this awesome seat. It really will fit most kids that long, but that's a catch-22. You really going to carry your 25lbs baby in a carrier?! My son was a BIG baby (still is a BIG kid!) and outgrew his carrier at 4 months. And, after baby gets above 10lbs or so, they are a pain in the butt to carry - quite awkward. So its not as convenient as it may at first seem. And some of the 'convenient' ways people use them aren't good.<br>  Carriers should NEVER be placed on grocery carts. It makes the carts unstable and they can tip over, seriously injuring the baby. Also, not all car seats fit all carts, and they don't lock on, they're just sitting there, posing an obvious threat. And some of the carts are shaped or sized in a way that it puts the carrier at an unsafe/uncomfortable angle for the baby. I've seen babies laying in carriers on carts with their head lower than their feet - not a good idea for digestion or spit up.<br>  The American Academy of Pediatrics says Parents and caregivers should never Place an infant carrier on top of the shopping cart. "Many infant-only car safety seats lock into shopping carts, and many stores have shopping carts with built-in infant seats. This may seem safe, but thousands of children are hurt every year from falling out of shopping carts or from the carts tipping over. Instead of placing your baby's car safety seat on the cart, consider using a stroller or front pack while shopping with your baby. "<br>  <br>  So I highly recommend skipping the carrier phase. I think they are more a pain than a blessing, and a wasted of money if you don't have a lot to throw around. Instead, get a convertible car seat that will fit a newborn (more on that later) and a sling, pouch, or wrap. Not one of those silly snugli or infantino carriers, but something like a ringsling, moby, or maya wrap. Wearing your baby gives everybody what they need. Babies get much needed closeness to mom (or dad, or anyone else for that matter!) and  you get your hands free to do what you need to do, as well as you can even breastfeed in one! They offer many different positions to use them in, too, and go higher than carrier car seat weights (20-22lbs). Most go to at least 35lbs, so you will get much more use out of it for your money. <br>  <br>  OK - so if you choose to skip the carrier phase, be careful about the convertible car seat you choose, b/c not all will fit newborns well. You want it to have low bottom slots.<br>  Perfect options:<br>  The Evenflo Triumph Advance (not the original Triumph, make sure it says Advance) is a great seat. $150 version at Babies R Us has padding similar to Britax seats, top slots of 17", harnesses to 35lbs rear facing, and 50lbs forward facing. $120 Walmart version just has little less plush padding. Wide open belt path, easy to install, though it doesn't have built in lockoffs. The harness adjusts at the front of the car seat, you don't have to take the car seat out of the car just to raise/lower the straps. and it has infinite harness adjustment so the harness always fits perfectly until its outgrown. You tighten and loosen the harness using knobs on the side of the seat. It can be used in a recline position even in forward facing mode. <br>  <br>  Cosco Scenera - $50 at Walmart/Kmart/Target. Great seat for the price. Goes up to 35lbs rear facing, 40lbs forward facing. Great rear facing seat, but is outgrown very quickly forward facing b/c of short top slots and short shell. You'll still get you're $50 worth out of it, though, as it will last most kids to at least 2 years, quadruple the amount of time of an infant seat!<br>  <br>  As you're shopping, remember these rules about seats:<br>  1)the BEST seat is the one that fits your child, fits your car, and will be used correctly 100% of the time. (This is why convenience features DO make a difference and ARE worth the money! If its easy to use, you're more likely to use it correctly.<br>  2)Children should stay rear facing AS LNOG AS POSSIBLE!!!! The 20lbs/1 year rule is outdated and provides a bare minimum for turning kids forward facing. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration both recommend keeping kids rear facing as long as possible, up to the limits of their seat, preferably until at least 2 years of age. For good reason: A forward-facing child under 2 years old is 4 times more likely to be killed or seriously injured in a crash than a rear-facing child of the same age. A child's vertabrae do not fully fuse until 3-6 years old, before then, she is at great risk for internal decapitation. The spinal column can stretch up to 2 inches in a crash BUT the spinal cord can only stretch up to 1/4 inch before it snaps and baby is gone. In other countries, rear facing 2 - 3 - 4 year olds is standard, they understand that its safer. <br>  3)Once you do turn them forward facing, they need to stay in a 5 point harness as long as possible. 4 years/40lbs is the minimum for riding in a booster, and most 4 year olds have no business using one yet. If they can't sit upright for an entire trip, they need the harness of a car seat still. And, even if they do sit properly, a 5 point harness is safer, so you want to keep them in one as long as possible. This is important to consider b/c most car seats only forward face to 40lbs. <br>  If you choose to go with an infant seat I would pick the seat you (stay away from Evenflo infant carriers, too many recalls, crappy recall fixes, overall a very cheap seat) and get a universal car seat stroller like Baby Trend Snap n Go, Combi Flash EX, Kolcraft makes one, too. That way you can spend a little less, sell it when you're done, and get a higher end stroller that will last better.<br>  <br>  <br>  DANGEROUS ON SHOPPING CARTS:<br>  <a href="http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/aug06shoppingcart.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/aug...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.medem.com/search/article_display.cfm?path=n:&mstr=/ZZZT24LYQMC.html&soc=AAP&srch_typ=NAV_SERCH" rel="nofollow">http://www.medem.com/search/article_disp...</a><br>  WHY REAR FACING:<br>  <a href="http://www.carseat.org/Resources/633.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.carseat.org/Resources/633.pdf</a><br>  In the foreground is a forward facing seat, in the background a rear facing seat.

Unsafe models are pulled from the store.<br>  <br>  If you have tons of money, buy whatever looks nice. If you want to save money you can get great used stuff on craigslist... or walmart sells inexpensive stuff. You can get a crib there for under $100, an infant car seat for $40, etc|`|aJLx0nhNaa	The book Baby Bargains is invaluable for making these decisions.  The title implies that it's all about saving money, but the reviews are really about value for dollar.  They review every type of item, in all major brands.  The reviews include aspects like safety.  It really helped me work through these decisions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Bargains-Furniture-Equipment-Maternity/dp/1889392049" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Bargains-Furn...</a>|`|oXIYHsDaaa	It really depends on what you need. <br>  All carseats have to pass safety regulations in order to be sold. <br>  The longer a child can remain rear facing in a carseat the safer they are. It is the law that children must be rear facing until they are 1 year old but if you can leave them rear facing for 2 yrs or more they are much safer. If you can afford to have both a infant carrier car seat and a convertable car seat once baby gets bigger then that's the most convientent wayto go, if you can only buy one car seat for baby then buy a convertable car seat that can be rear facing untill baby is strong enough and then forward facing until baby is big enough to go into a belt positioning booster seat.<br>  Strollers very in design, function and cost. <br>  <br>  If you walk everywhere everyday and are planning on having more than one child that will use the same stroller then it pays to get a more expensive model. <br>  Cup holders are important, once baby comes you will never have enough hands to hold everything you want to have with you. <br>  If you jog or rollerblade you will want a jogging style stroller with a hand brake - warning a lot of jogging strollers will not fit in the trunk of a car so if you drive a car and want to be able to use the stroller at the mall you may need a smaller one. <br>  Travel systems are the most convient, they are a regular stroller that allows an infant carrier seat to attach to it. You can take sleeping baby from the car to the store and back to the car with ever touching a seat belt.<br>  If you plan to use a stroller for a small - average amount of walking for only one child or at the most two, by a regular store brand one, I've had good luck with both graco and safety first strollers.<br>  Lastly if you need to be able to get the stroller through snow or gravel you want over sized wheels, bike strollers that can be used behond bikes or pushed by hand are great for snow but you can't use them with babies who can't sit up by themselves yet and they're big and hard to turn.<br>  There are basically two types of cribs, regu;ar and convertable. Convertable cribs let you turn the crib into a toddler bed and then can be used as a double head and foot board. Great if you're only having one kid but not so great if you need the crib again in a couple or years and have to buy another one or kick you older kid out of the toddler or double bed. I have a basic $180 walmart white crib, it's been through 4 kids now and still is like new.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I have a graco system that the stroller attaches to the base in the car and the stroller. So nice during the winter because then I don't have to put my baby in the cold. She can stay covered up. We bought that one for like $80. My father bought my crib when I had my first daughter who is now 5. He bought one of those one's that convert into a toddler bed and then a full size bed. He bought it for like $350. So worth it though. I've used it with my first two. My baby is still in a bassinet that I got for $150 but I will use that crib with her.|`|be3e5b583c027426a0f22b62804479f0aa	I use a Graco system as well.  It comes with a car seat and stroller. Don't worry about the crib for a few months because the baby probably won't be sleeping in it right away anyway.|`|V8wUAVdyaa	I got a used Graco system.  Why pay hundreds!?  Just make sure they are up to currents safety standards.|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	I would not buy a used car seat. You don't know if it's been in an accident or what. As for a crib and stoller, used is always good. I am not sure where you love but even Wal-mart sells in-expensive stuff. They have a 4 in 1 crib there for like $199.00 and it converts into a toddler bed and full size bed. You can also get the travel systems which include the stoller, car seat and base. The base will stay in the car so you just moe the car seat. Once they get past 20 lbs or what ever the weight restriction is then you have to change over to a larger car seat and those stay in the car but you can get those cheap at wal-mart too.|`|JvM44Bx5aa	I would suggest the following stores for your review.

They aren't necessarily better.  They just seem to have more of a selection for a decent price.  <br>  <br>  Also figure out what your needs are before you go shopping.  If you are never going to use a stroller, you may not need to buy a travel system.  You may be wanting a toddler seat that can be used in reverse from 5 to 20 pounds, instead.  Or look at the pack-n-plays instead of bassinets.|`|WmzFCSO5aa	Britiax. Their car seats are the highest safety rated. Why skimp on your child's safety they do cost more than most but it is well worth it!! You won't be sorry! Get a snap and go to put the baby seat in they are really cheap and really light. So you won't even need a travel system. You can buy a nice stroller when the baby is out of the infant car seat.|`|Agke8iBGaa	Go with Graco. And make sure the car seat and stroller ar 5 point harnesses. They keep baby safest if you are in an accident.<br>  <br>  Crib cannot fit a soda can between the bars. Other wise use your better judgement.|`|YJNql5Mgaa	I use Graco.  I've got the 3-1 in set: Stroller, car seat and car base.  Love it.  It's so handy and really easy to use.|`|chUxLFidaa	Graco is great and reasonable.

This is, like, the saddest story I've ever heard. How can you NOT realize "you hadn't used protection" until it was too late? Were you blindfolded?<br>  <br>  Fortunately, you seem destined to have an early period this time, and you are probably NOT pregnant. It is only 11-12 days since the risk, however, so pregnancy cannot be ruled out altogether. Take a pregnancy test at the end of next week.<br>  <br>  And dump your boyfriend, because you obviously can't trust him to put your interests ahead of his pleasure.|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	if you got your period i wouldn't worry so much but if it is spotting then that could be the embryo implanting. with headaches and cramping I'd say it was PMS. if you want piece of mind take a pregnancy test. remember that it is also your responsibility to be protected.|`|TCzvigiuaa	test to be sure...good luck.|`|qIl3SABqaa	k, you had you're period so it's a good sign. Go get a pregnancy test, because sometimes women can get their period during pregnancy, like by example, a women not to long ago didn't realize she was prego with twins because she had her period during the pregnancy. <br>  Stop worrying about it, you're probably getting stress related headaches and cramps. But seriously next time hun, use protection or go on birth control. The method of contraception you guys used, is definitely the worst. Anywayss, good luck :)|`|vk3CsYJ9aa	if you think that you are you can find a planned parent hood somewhere near you and they will test and give you an exam for free, or you can buy an over the counter test and take it when you first get up in the morning. Even if he pulls out it doesn't mean that you can not get pregnant. Things to look for, was your period like a normal one, or did theflow getet lighter or shorter, are you breasts tender, Is there tenderness in your abdomen. <br>  Sometimes a female can start her period early if she is around alot of other females, like at school, work, at home, and when younger and my mom went through Menopause my period cycle changed as welfemales not uncommon for younger female's cycle to change.
GTnvALxQaa	I really don't think that you will get pregnant because you need sperm to get inside the sex cell in order to get pregnant. But to make sure, research signs of pregnancy and discover if you (in the future) have them.|`|gEE6UOnUaa	Based on your asking variations of this question for the last several days; I think you're either goofing around, or really need some education as to how the reproductive system works....  this is a great site that could help <a href="http://www.bigeye.com/sexeducation/reproduction.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigeye.com/sexeducation/repro...</a>|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Um you dont have any sperm so no you cant get pregnant from maturbation.

2qijKZQeaa	If you are expecting your period so soon, I think your ovulation period has passed. The period usually comes 2 weeks after ovulation, and the ovulation window is only open for about 3-5 days. <br>  <br>  Regardless, you should probably go make an appointment with a doctor for a pap smear and get a prescription for birth control pills. If you are not monogamous though, keep using condoms. I work in the egg donation industry, and too many of our donors are turned away because they didn't know they had an STD and we found one. Don't trust a guy to say they don't have any because with many STDs, they may be a carrier and not know it. This is what happened to all of our girls.|`|M21c8MQ9aa	ok, I am an obstetrician, and I can tell you this. Your eggs are more riper four to five days before your period than they are the entire month, so if you had sex on the 26th, then yes, you need to watch for signs. if you don't start your period three weeks after you were supposed to, then you should take a pregnancy test, but wait at least three weeks, because if you are pregnant, they pregnancy test won't detect the pregnancy hormones
be8c602306eaf16065afb6b58a3d5739aa	Yes. I'm normally not much of a drinker but 2 years ago my best friend was getting married. So for about a 2 month span we had quite a few parties. One time, which I'd like to forget about I had a run in with tequila, my first and last time to do tequila shots! I was so smashed I passed out in my friends driveway and they joke that they came out there ever couple of hours to kick me to make sure I moaned to know that I was still alive. <br>  14 weeks into my pregnancy, 8 weeks after the tequila incident I found out I was pregnant. I have a condition that made me not realize that I was pregnant.<br>  Needless to say my little angel was born just fine. He is now a thriving 20 month old with lots of energy and a beautiful smile. <br>  Just no more drinking! Good luck to you.|`|3d2a90e81b5f44d0e68203472d1a273faa	Lots and lots of people have done the same thing.

The risks of drinking while pregnant are real, but the odds of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome because of one occasion are truly pretty remote.  <br>  <br>  There's a section that discusses the effects of alcohol and other drugs in the book "What to Expect When You're Expecting".

c8b82effda4779b8eb5a150602a0a539aa	you sound pregnant to me, but you might want to give it about a wk. The reason i way this is b/c the blood could be implantation and your body won't produce hcg until that is through.  I know because i had cramping and 3wks. late and i showed up neg. on blood and urine until i missed my second period. then i showed up preg.

ad50efdb74a312c691125cabe689a4a4aa	You have good chances of being pregnant since you intercourse during your ovulation period. Doctors say that sperm can survive in fertile cervical fluid for maximum 5 days but on average is 2-3 days.

You can tell when you are ovalting not only by the fact you are 'horny' but the discharge you will find. It is rather thick, sort of like egg whites. Usually 2 weeks before your cycle is to begin.

417c9aa98806eb0070b8d5e90badadb2aa	There is something called the Shettles Method that has a couple of theories about that...<br>  <br>  According to this guy, boy sperm swim faster and die quicker, and girl sperm swim slower and live longer.<br>  <br>  So to have a boy, you have intercourse within a day or so before ovulating, and the boy sperm will get to the target before the girls and fertilize the egg. <br>  <br>  On the flip side, to have a girl, you'd need to have intercourse 2-3 days before O (and not immediately before O) and the boys would still get there first, but would die before your egg was released. Then the girls have time to get there and still be alive by the time you O.<br>  <br>  (All of this is closely connected with you knowing when you're ovulating though! And, since you're not having sex on all of your fertile days, you're likely to increase how long it takes you to get pregnant.

It is said that the sperm with the chromosome for boys swim faster but don't live as long.  So if they get there and there is no egg to fertilize yet they will die off.  The sperm carrying the girl chromosome swim slower but they live longer so they can hang out for a while. So if you know when you're ovulating and you can time it correctly, try to have sex before ovulation so the "boy sperm" don't have an egg to fertilize yet. This is not 100% fool proof but its one story I have heard.
AA10161959	Even if you could be pregnant, you shouldn't have a problem on your spa day. it won't be affected in any way. and you seem a little anxious. I suggest that you take your time with this, and you will be blessed with a baby when it decides to come. Many women that try to concieve stress themselves out. This alters your hormone level, decreasing your capability of becoming pregnant. just relax hun.<br>  <br>  If you were pregnant now, it wouldn't be dangerous to use the sauna and jacuzzi, because the egg was just newly fertilized, which means that it is still in the fallopian tube. the cervix acts as a barrier. it won't allow water to flush anything out of your body. You will be okay<br>  <br>  I believe that your facts apply to the baby when it is a growing fetus in your uterus. True, but in your case, not at the moment|`|6bfd6331fbc212b9ae381f6478c62c12aa	talk to your dr about it. see if you can get pregnancy test done. or blood test, even.

0a00f9fe79ff0e6062d02e990f59a703aa	I would have another doctor run tests- one particular test you need (and shouldn't have to ask for) is a blood test. Blood tests are the most accurate pregnancy tests there are. You may be a rarity out there that is having a difficult time finding out because of hormone levels (I've heard of this problem before- women taking a pregnancy test and for months it being negative so they didn't think they were pregnant and found out too long into the pregnancy.) <br>  <br>  If the blood test comes back negative, make sure they find out what the situation is because it might be something pretty serious. Good luck!|`|6bfd6331fbc212b9ae381f6478c62c12aa	Go and see your family dr and have them run a blood test on you. Let them know that you have irregular periods.

You are still so young. That way you wont have to worry about pregnancy or STD'S.|`|843ade04da74a1fa663d8282e3c51105aa	I would get a second opinion for sure.....good luck!|`|08dbb956af9e763dc556636f980d54aeaa	Have your doctor run tests. You wrote the symptoms I had while I was pregnant. If the tests still come back negative, make sure your doctor runs more test to find out whats wrong. If he won't find another doctor. You know your own body so listen to it, and find a doctor that will listen to you.

uctXfP2Saa	Un anticonceptivo de emergencia, también llamado píldora del día después o píldora postcoital, es una clase de píldoras anticonceptivas con alta concentración de hormonas, la cual es efectiva después de un coito sin protección o en caso de un fallo en algún otro método anticonceptivo (como rotura del condón). La implantación del cigoto ocurre sobre el día 6 después de la fecundación. éstos fármacos tienen diversos mecanismos de acción dependiendo del momento en el ciclo menstrual cuando es tomada. éstos fármacos puede inhibir o atrasar la ovulación, inhibir el transporte del ovocito o del semen, interferir en la fecundación, o, después de haber fallado alguno de éstos, alterar el endometrio, pudiendo inhibir la implantación del cigoto, lo que no ha logrado ser demostrado. Estas pastillas trabajan activando los mismos cambios hormonales en el cuerpo que las píldoras anticonceptivas regulares, sólo que requieren una mayor dosis y son menos efectivas que otros anticonceptivos hormonales.Por los motivos anteriores no pueden ser usadas regularmente como un metodo anticonceptivo, y solo deben ser reservadas para la emergencia.|`|37a2e8246d995fece8e76b779a3a2952aa	no se me informas, porfas|`|ANwggAnnaa	esta pildora sirve para que el ovulo si ha sido fecundado no se pegue al utero o si ya se pego pues que salga <br>  <br>  se le considera abortiva si ya esta pegado al utero<br>  <br>  pero como saberlo... lo unico por el tiempo en que la tomas despues del acto<br>  <br>  saludos<br>  <br>  pd no es un metodo anticonceptivo es malisimo para la mujer|`|TyyV869Aaa	Es una pildora que la tomas despues del acto sexual si no usaste medidas de prevencion, es como un "limpiador" que hace que el ovulo no quede fecundado|`|e463dfb7cecbd58d885a9ed2ea0aae6eaa	se toma un dia después de tener sexo, para evitar el embarazo o mejor dicho truncarlo por que si se dio la concepcion al tener sexo entonces si lo truncas al dia siguiente con la pildora es un metodo abortivo.|`|sABWT45Caa	Es la píldora que se toma después de haber tenido relaciones sin cuidarse para evitar el embarazo.|`|cc337558fbc550713ff27d3d32fe5e80aa	Las píldoras anticonceptivas de emergencia, también conocidas como "píldoras del día después", son un método para prevenir el embarazo en el término de pocas horas o días después de haber tenido relaciones sexuales sin protección o cuando se haya producido la rotura del condón . <br>  <br>  sm|`|74db0b1a9917c581169bfd40b03ff275aa	es una pildora que se toma despues de tener relaciones hasta 48 horas despues, hace que la mujer se le aledante la mestruacion.|`|0a110fb21ffd22489607d6e60e86bfb5aa	la que se toma toda las mujeres que tienes relaciones contigo, para no engendrar un ser tan ..... como tu|`|1d7d60c225432be74a5befc988fd4e0daa	Pildora abortiva.|`|5fec9ed234042a4c6d0607a7e0045d6baa	PILDORA QUE SE TOMA AL DIA SIGUIENTE DE TENER RELACIONES SEXUALES, SIEMPRE Y CUANDO NO QUIERAS TENER BEBE|`|b1ba11c7aa2dc71654007790bc4ac1feaa	Es la salvacion luego de una noche de borracheras?<br>  <br>  Saludettes<br>  Kanec!

JIqiUSg2aa	It's normal...  Did your doctor check your progesterone level?   If this level is too low, then may need to supplement with medication or vaginal gel.  What about blood testing to check for genetic defects for both you and your spouse?   You need to put your focus on possitive, them more you dwell on this the more anxious you'll be.

1g6SK34qaa	Here's how it works: Fertilization happens in one of the fallopian tubes, which carries an egg from an ovary to the uterus. It can take up to seven days after intercourse for sperm and egg to join and become a fertilized egg. Usually, it's because the sperm gets into the fallopian tube before the egg is released. <br>  <br>  Here is more input an advice: <br>  <br>  <br>  I would say at least a couple of hours, but it could take up to three days. Depending you your body and where the egg is in the cycle. <br>  <br>  2 TO 3 DAYS <br>  <br>  The sperm that will be able to fertilize the eggie will leave the cervix, at the most, 30 minutes. It does not take 3 days for the sperm to get to the fallopian tubes to ovulation. It can take minutes for at least some of the sperm to reach the fallopian tubes where they are stored waiting for the eggie to pop out if it hasn't already popped out. <br>  <br>  As a general rule, less than three days. <br>  <br>  It takes about two hours to make the entire journey to the egg; however, some sperm are Olympic swimmers and can reach the egg in a half an hour. I looked this up and this is the article that I found if you are interested in reading it. <a href="http://www.mjbovo.com/Contracept/NO_Contracep.htm#long" rel="nofollow">http://www.mjbovo.com/Contracept/NO_Cont...</a> <br>  <br>  Well from what the Doctor told me when I got pregant, it can take anywhere from the moment it happened to 8 days after the moment. Sorry if that doesn't help any just what I was told. <br>  <br>  I don't know the answer, but I will tell you what I do know. Sperm travels about 1/8 inch per minute. Sounds pretty slow until you realize Sperm is about 1/600 inch long. If you scale that up to "human" size that's about 4-5 miles / hour -- slow jogging speed. The penetration of the penis and location of the egg in the fallopian tubes is only two factors that will affect time. Not all sperm swim in the correct direction. Some "hang back" (don't know the right word) and may not move into the fallopian tubes for a 2 or 3 days. This is why you can have intercourse before ovulation and still get pregnant by sperm from a few days ago. <br>  <br>  Sperm can last 3 to 5 days inside a woman. Every woman ovulates differently. People will tell you the average woman ovulate 14 days from the day you start your period|`|0R345HDiaa	If fertile cervical fluid is present, sperm can move an inch in 15 minutes...  and it's about 7 inches from cervix to the outer fallopian tube where fertilization usually occurs...  so 1-1/2 to 2 hours!|`|AA10372597	I like 2 know myself  because I'm trying 2 get pregent 2 iam 36 and i only have3 more years and i am wanting 2 have my little girl a little brother or sister within this comeing up year(sence it takes 9 months,well my little gril was born @7 months) good luck i have been trying for avout a month or 2|`|p77IaBoIaa	The egg must be inseminated in the first 1/3 of the tube closest to the ovary.

Há uma possibilidade, ainda que remota, de as extremidades cortadas dos canais deferentes se unirem espontaneamente, o que abre caminho a uma gravidez. Essa possibilidade é de apenas 1%, mas existe. Assim como a reversibilidade da opera??o, mesmo sendo dito que n?o ha como reverter, isto é possível nos primeiros anos; quanto mais tempo se passa, mais difícil reverter, mas n?o impossível.

This hormone increases during pregnancy so it is common to measure the rise in level using Home Pregnancy Tests ( or HPTs, which measure hCG levels in the urine) or a hCG Beta test (which measures hCG levels in the blood serum). The hCG Beta is much more sensitive then the Home Pregnancy Test and you can usually get a positive result much earlier with a blood test than with the HPTs. <br>  Usually the reference values for hCG Beta are as follows:<br>  <br>  Men:         less than 5.0 mIU/ml - Normal<br>  <br>  Women:        Non -pregnant  -   less than 5.0 mIU/ml - Negative/normal<br>  <br>                      *Borderline - Between 5.0 to 25.0 mIU/ml (you could be pregnant)<br>  <br>                      *Positive - Higher than 25.0 mIU/ml<br>  <br>                      (*) These are values within the first week and few days after conception.<br>  When you are pregnant the level of hCG increases and usually doubles every two to three days. It then reaches a maximum level by the second or third month of pregnancy, followed by a decrease occurring in the third trimester.<br>  <br>  Here are typical hCG Beta values in pregnant women up to 22 days post-retrieval (DPR) or days post-ovulation (DPO).<br>  <br>  DPR or DPO         Amount of hCG in mIU/ml<br>  <br>  10                                             5 - 50 <br>  <br>  12                                            10 - 100<br>  <br>  14                                            20 - 200<br>  <br>  16                                            40 - 400<br>  <br>  18                                            70 - 800<br>  <br>  20                                           140 - 1600<br>  <br>  22                                           180 - 3200<br>  <br>  Here are the hCG Beta values given by the number of weeks after ovulation:<br>  <br>  after the 1st week and 2 days                   5.0 to 50.0 mUI/ml<br>  <br>  Between 1st and 2nd week                         5.0 to 500.0 mUI/ml<br>  <br>  Between 2nd and 3rd week                        100.0 to 5,000.0 mUI/ml<br>  <br>  Between 3rd and 4th week                        500.0 to 10,000.0 mUI/ml<br>  <br>  Between 4th and 5th week                         1,000.0 to 50,000.0 mUI/ml<br>  <br>  Between 5th and 6th week                        10,000.0 to 100,000.0 mUI/ml<br>  <br>  Between 6th and 8th week                        15,000.0 to 200,000.0 mUI/ml<br>  <br>  Between 8th and 12th week                       10,000.0 to 100,000.0 mUI/ml<br>  <br>  Note: The levels of hCG for pregnant women with twins or more are usually higher than the values above, which represent the typical values for just one baby.<br>  <a href="http://www.praying4ababy.com/hCGlevels.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.praying4ababy.com/hCGlevels.h...</a>|`|6bfd6331fbc212b9ae381f6478c62c12aa	WHy didnt you ask your dr this??

No faint line, it was very bold.<br>  <br>  Surprisingly, cheap tests purchased at dollar stores or on the Internet are often more sensitive and reliable than expensive store brands. HPT's are like soda: very cheap to make, and marked up quite a bit for retail. <br>  <br>  If you do not chart or monitor your fertility in any way, and you think you may have conceived, you should wait 19 days (or longer) after having sex to test. Why 19?! Sperm can live approximately 5 days in the proper environment; if the sperm managed to live until you popped an egg, the actual conception could have taken place several days after the sex act that got the sperm there. To make sure you're not testing too early, assume the sperm had very long lives (5 days is considered a very long sperm life) and that conception occurred then. Then allow 14 days for the embryo to implant and develop enough hCG to show up on a pregnancy test (96% of pregnant women will test positive by then.)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peeonastick.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.peeonastick.com</a>|`|6bfd6331fbc212b9ae381f6478c62c12aa	YOU CAN GET WALMART BRAND(EQUATE) OR DOLLAR TREE BRAND.

e56f4af0392a97bead7ec4a8be859bbaaa	Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy: What causes it, and what should you do?<br>  Vaginal bleeding or spotting during pregnancy has many causes. Some are serious, and some aren't. Know when to call your health care provider. <br>  If you're pregnant, even a small amount of vaginal bleeding can be scary. Sometimes, bleeding does signal trouble — but not always. In fact, many pregnant women experience light vaginal bleeding at some point during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester. Often, such bleeding is the result of a normal event during pregnancy, such as the embryo's implantation in the uterine lining a little over a week after conception.<br>  <br>  Bleeding shouldn't throw you into a panic. At the same time, you should always take bleeding seriously if you're pregnant, monitoring it closely and taking note of related symptoms, such as cramping. By understanding the most common causes of bleeding during pregnancy, you'll know what to look for and when to call your health care provider.<br>  Finish reading all of this important info here:<br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bleeding-during-pregnancy/PR00087" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bleedin...</a>|`|6bfd6331fbc212b9ae381f6478c62c12aa	Sounds like implantation to me.

WE3EJkFdaa	Unless you are having regular contractions (spaced the same amount apart & getting closer together) you have nothing to worry about.  I'be been having painful contractions for 3 weeks, but as they are not regular they are called braxton hicks contractions.  They are just "warm up" contractions.  By the way at 34 weeks if you baby was to be born more than likely they would be fine.  Pretty much all of their vital organs and functions are done forming.  They might be a little on the smaller side, but they'll be fine.

NE0ac2IWaa	I have always heard that male sperm swims faster and dies faster and the female sperm swims slow but lives longer. So what I have heard is if you want a boy you need to have intercouse on or the day before ovulation so it will beat the female sperm. And if it was a girl you need to have intercouse 2-3 days before ovulations so by the time the egg is ready the male  sperm has already died off. Good Luck|`|AA11920812	Find your ovulation day. Have sex that day as many times as possible. <br>  <br>  Timing your ovulation is key to conception but even more crucial when trying for a certain gender.  If you wait a mere 12/24 hours you likelyhood of a girl increases.<br>  <br>  Also, it depends <br>  <br>  1. The potenancy of hubby's sperm, and<br>  2. Your reaction to his sperm<br>  <br>  But, if you time it correctly you'll more than likely end up with a boy.  It's what I did and I'm 22 weeks pregnant with a boy.  The day I saw the surge I grabbed my hubby and pulled him to bed, lol.  Made hime late for work, but it was worth it.  The next time around I'll wait 12-24 hours and abstain the week of my peak day in hopes of a girl.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|9b90ade54d2f521859ac0446c6daac04aa	Nothing, unfortunately<br>  It all depends on the man's sperm.......so you have a 50% chance of having a boy........nothing you do will increase the odds|`|2b6ce4f0223842564712464f18b130e6aa	I heard if you have sex on the day of ovulation, you could have a boy, a day or two before, you would probably have a girl.

Male sperms are faster, but die sooner then female sperm. So the chances are, if you have sex day or two before you ovulate, the female sperms will "wait" there for the egg to become available, but the male sperms die.

Foram feitos quatro cruzamentos, sendo analisados um total de 1052 col?nias obtidas a partir de suspens?es de conídios provenientes das col?nias heterocarióticas. Sessenta e oito col?nias recombinantes foram analisadas quanto às marcas de auxotrofia em quatro gera??es de crescimento, sendo observado que 58 mantiveram o fenótipo recombinante, enquanto que as col?nias restantes reverteram para um dos parentais. A maioria das col?nias recombinantes se mostrou instável. Entretanto, após 4 gera??es de crescimento estas col?nias se tornaram estáveis para as marcas de auxotrofia avaliadas. As col?nias recombinantes instáveis apresentaram bordas de crescimento irregular, esporula??o esparsa e a freqüente forma??o de setores. Estas col?nias recombinantes foram analisadas quanto aos marcadores RAPD, tendo mostrado grande similaridade, em rela??o ao perfil de bandas apresentado, com a maioria dos primers analisados. Somente com um primer foi possível visualizar a presen?a de uma banda polimórfica entre os recombinantes e a presen?a de bandas nos parentais n?o existentes em alguns recombinantes.

2DhoYMhiaa	Your bbt is used to confirm ovulation. The changes in the hormones are what causes the changes in body temperature. If you do not ovulate than the temperature should not change. As a result the answer would be no.<br>  <br>  Your goal in temperature charting is to find the typical biphasic pattern in the daily plotting of temperatures so you can determine when ovulation occurred. For most women, 97.0 to 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit (36.1 to 36.3 Celsius) is considered to be a normal pre-ovulation basal temperature. A temperature increase to 97.6 to 98.9 Fahrenheit (36.4 to 36.6) will usually occur at the time of ovulation. This rise in temperature is usually only about 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.21 degrees Celsius), but the rise could be as slight as 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit (0.11 degrees Celsius) or even less in some cases. Use a quality thermometer and carefully document on your fertility chart. Make a point of using the same thermometer throughout your charting (at least throughout each chart), if at all possible. If it breaks or the battery dies, and you need to make some changes, make a note on your chart. Noting the small, one-tenth degree difference can help you determine when you have ovulated. Typically, a rise of 0.4 to 0.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.2 to 0.4 Celsius) will take place after ovulation. Your temperature will continue to rise 24 to 72 hours after ovulation, at that point it should level out, fluctuating some what until menses. Some people will see a fairly abrupt increase, while others will notice a slow gradual increase. Time will, and charting, will tell you how your body will react to hormonal changes. At the time of menses, your temperature will drop off to your normal follicular phase temperature. Some people will notice this just before menses, and be able to use it as a warning, others may not notice it as can be more of a decline instead of a sudden drop. The actual temperatures are not important; they are different from woman to woman. What is important is to check for the pattern of elevated temps that stay up for at least three or more days.  If you are lucky enough to be pregnant, you should find that your temperature will remain high.<br>  <br>  Careful charting of your BBT is the key to effective charting. If you are not pregnant, your temperature will reflect two phases (biphasic) during a cycle, three phases (triphasic) if conception has occurred. The first phase occurs before ovulation and is known as the proliferative or follicular phase, it is during this phase that the egg matures and develops. The second phase occurs after ovulation, or during the post ovulatory phase, and is recognized by the fact that temperatures are higher than the first phase. This second temperature phase is known as the secretory,  luteal or corpus luteum phase. Many women experience a triphasic phasic pattern, with temperatures climbing approximately 0.30 to 0.40 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.16 to 0.21 degrees Celsius) during the Luteal Phase. This third phase is a result of the presence of hCG when conception and implantation has occurred. It is crucial that you remember temperature charting can only tell you when ovulation has already occurred in the present cycle, but it gives you an idea of when it may occur in future cycles. It does not give you any concrete evidence of what is happening in the present cycle, until it has already happened. BBT testing is most effective when used in conjunction with other testing methods. Immediately before ovulation, your temperature may drop briefly.  Remember that your temperatures often rise and fall, before a dip, this can make it difficult to know when the lowest point will be. It is important to realise that your lowest temperature may not be a result of pre-ovulation. If you are fortunate enough to notice this drop, and you are charting other indicators that support it, use it to plan your next (as in now) sexual encounter. Within 12 hours of ovulation, you will notice that  your BBT will rise, this is a result of the increased progesterone released from the corpus luteum after ovulation. Your temperature should remain in the higher range throughout the luteal (post-ovulation) phase until the next cycle begins. When your temperature remains high for three days in a row, you can believe that your fertile period is over and the infertile time has begun. This increase will remain until you begin your next menstrual period. Another point of interest here is that your temperature will often drop just before menstruation, a heads up that your period is about to begin. There are always exceptions, you could be one of those people whose temperature does not drop until a few days into menses. Your temperature will stay elevated for 10 to 16 days, until the corpus luteum regresses. At this time, unless there is a pregnancy, progesterone levels drop dramatically and you get your period. You temperature should also drop at this time, but some people are known to have erratic temperatures during their periods. If you are pregnant, the temperature will remain high since the uterine lining begins to put out the needed progesterone instead. <br>  <br>  While measuring your BBT can help you to pinpoint, or confirm ovulation, it is important to measure this fertility sign in conjunction with other fertility signs. Observing multiple symptoms allows for cross-checking, in case one signal is affected by outside factors. Charting your temperatures tells you when you have ovulated, but it does not tell you when you are going to be most fertile in the current cycle. Your fertile days are the few days proceeding ovulation and the day of ovulation. Once your temperature has shifted, it is too late to use your chart to conceive in the present cycle. But it can tell you if you managed to time sexual activity at your most fertile time, and when you are best to time it for future cycles. Confirmed ovulation dates, from previous cycles are used to predict ovulation dates of future cycles, if you display some sort of a consistent pattern. Charting your temperature, along with observing your cervical fluid, can give you great peace of mind. You can actually see if you read your other fertility symptoms correctly and if you timed intercourse well, than you can stop worrying about your fertility for the rest of the present cycle. After ovulation is confirmed, you can take a break from planned sex and just enjoy each other. Confirmed ovulation can reduce stress for the end of your cycle, you know when you can reliably expect your menses or a reliable test for pregnancy. If your charts are well done, and your cycles are ideal, you should see a biphasic temperature change that clearly shows ovulation. You want to see your temperature rise in a single, abrupt, shift that remains through the luteal phase. Don’t stress, if this hasn’t happened, Remember your cycles are as individual as you are so things may still be fine.|`|AA10010096	I would say No. When you ovulate, your body produces progesterone which causes your BBT to rise between .5 to 1 degree. If you found that your temperatures stay low, chances are you didn't ovulate.

6e1884100ea01ca5c165183590f92363aa	WOW! I think you should get a different doctor, hon. Seriously. This is not her choice, it's yours. And complications aren't the issue because twins are not considered "complications" in the medical field.<br>  <br>  When it comes to twin births, two times the fun doesn't always mean twice as many complications. Cesarean surgeries are NOT requirements for women pregnant with multiple babies. Not only is it possible for mothers of multiples to give birth vaginally, but research shows that it often is the SAFER option.<br>  <br>  Please, find a doctor or midwife who is willing to let you try a vaginal birth because it will be better for you and the babies. C-section is major surgery carrying many risks with it, and your recovery time might nearly double. It will also require thousands more dollars and a longer hospital stay. You will be in a lot of stomach pain afterwards and your activities will be severely restricted. It will make your milk come in late and so might interfere with breastfeeding. Worst of all, they will take the babies away from you right after the birth and you will be whisked away to the recovery room - ALONE.<br>  <br>  The Public Citizen Health Research Group in Washington, D.C., estimates that half of the nearly one million cesareans performed every year are medically unnecessary. Don't become another one of these statistics.|`|SHcLsRXUaa	My daughter had one,,,,it wasn't painful during, but she did have back pain after...and naturally it's sore for awhile..she said she'd do it again....|`|6a0709b6e7524eaa69398ae12852bd90aa	First, you do have a choice.  They cannot legally force you to have a surgical procedure if you don't want it.  Women deliver twins vaginally all the time.  <br>  Recovery from a section is not easy.  It is painful and long.  I could not care for my twins by myself after my section, let alone another sibling.  You will need extra help.  YOu cannot drive for two weeks after.  The incision site may still be painful for up to a year later sometimes more.<br>  A c-section is major abdominal surgery.  The risks are far greater in a c-section, than with a vaginal birth.  Proven fact.  I learned all kinds of great info from the women on here when my own doc tried to push another C-section on me.  Never again.  If you feel strongly, fight for your rights.  Get the facts and present them to your doc.  C-sections can cause PTSD in some women.  I am still emotionally scarred from mine.  Don't want to scare you, just don't want anyone to ever have a forced C-section.  Best of luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  *****EDIT****** not trying to sound, well, like a grouchy pregnant person but, a multiple delivery and a singleton delivery are very different.  Same for the recovery.  While I was offered pain meds after the delivery, I could not take them as I could not function well enough to care for TWO infants.  All I could take was Aleve.  Just wanted to make the point for the people saying "oh its not that bad, plus they give pain meds."  It's different with more than one! Best of luck.|`|SDNjTs0Haa	I've heard that you wont really feel anything during it, apparently it feels a little tickely but thats it<br>  It does normally take a bit longer to recover though x|`|YPsBEwlDaa	Keep your doc if you trust him/she.<br>  <br>  It won't be painfull during, they will numb you wast down.<br>  but yes after the med's fade away you will be in pain. Be prepared to start walking the next day and then your needing to do a breathing treatment to make sure your lungs are strong. that's a pain in the ***. I have had 3 c-sections 1st c-section  w/ stitches and the 2nd c-section w/ staples. When I had my 4th baby I requested to get stitches. I didn't like the staples w/ my 3rd child.

My 1st c-section I was 23 yrs old, recovered w/ 3wks, 2nd c-section I was 30 it was about the same 3 wks. w/ my 4th I was 33 and that one hit me hard.<br>  <br>  I truly wish you the best, it will be worth every pain.

Without getting into the pros and cons of an elective C/Sect (which this is because there is not a medical indication) I find irresponsible of your doctor to say you don't have a choice if they are both head down. There is a small risk however to the second baby.  After the first twin is born, the 2nd may have enough room to turn around to a breech or transverse (sideways) position or the 2nd baby's cord could slip out after the first is born. Because of this, most twin vag deliveries are done in an OR with a team standing by in case an emergency C/Sect becomes necessary. Is there possibly another medical factor involved? Most doctors have you see their associate at least one time during the pregnancy just in case they are not on call. If so, ask their opinion. If your babies are both head down and there are no medical problems with either you or the babies and you want to deliver vaginally, you should get another doctor. If you do have a C/Sect, you should not feel any pain during. You will notice pulling and tugging though. There will be plenty of meds available after. Be sure to ask for them before your pain becomes unbearable. It is better to take them round the clock the first day or two to keep the pain in check, then after that only when needed, usually every 4-6 hours.|`|V2DE1GJJaa	i am 34 weeks with my twins and have had a strong recommendation from my doctor to get a section because the presenting baby is breech, if it was the other baby that was breech they would try to turn him. i know that if the babies are sharing an amniotic sack they should always be sectioned, but if both are head down you can usually deliver vaginally successfully with a shorter recovery.|`|d43AqLygaa	I am the mother of a 7 year old boy and 1 year old boy/girl twins. Actually, twin pregnancy does put you at higher risk for complications!!!! If you do a little research online you will find that there is a higher chance that a  twin pregnancy will result in an emergency c-section. I know several (4) twin moms who had the first naturally and the second by c-section b/c they turned during labor or failed to progress. There is also an increased risk of bleeding w/ twin pregnancy, especially if you have 2 placenta. They can better control bleeding during a c-section as well. (This was always a concern for me w/ both pregancies). You will also typcially, have less bleeding after.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you are having a normal, uncomplicated pregancy (no blood pressure issues, no placental issues, normal birth weights, development, growth, and go past 36 weeks) and your doctor doesn't have a medical reason for a c-section, I would challenge it. Be prepared however to end up w/ both vaginal and c-section recovery.<br>  <br>  I had DS by c-section after a long labor(26hrs) and almost 3 hours of pushing. It was horrendous! The c-section recovery was a piece of cake. I decided before I knew I was having twins to have a c-section again. My babies both ended up being breech so really there was no decision to be made.  <br>  <br>  With the twins recovery was a bit harder. I think due to the fact that they were both breech and the DR had to do a lot of tugging and pulling to get them out, and the fact that everything was so much more stretched out. I also had stitches the first time and staples the second. The stitches were much less painful (staples poke you) and the scar was much thinner and even. <br>  <br>  I was awake during both c-sections. With DS I had already gotten an epidural, so they administered the spinal through the cath. With the twins, I walked into delivery. My husband was with me during both. The staff was extremely supportive. I did not feel a thing. It did not hurt at all. It was not uncomfortable, just wierd! They do give you paid meds through the IV until you can take them orally. You will have a cath for about 24 hours. It will be difficult to stand and walk the first few days, but it gets better and easier each day. As long as you take your meds you should be fine.  Baby boy was healthy and stayed with us the entire time. He was not whisked away. Baby girl needed oxygen and to be monitored. They took her to a transitional room where she had her own private nurse. He brought her to me every 2 hours so I could see her and nurse her.  Unless there is a problem with your babies they should be with you. Mine were born at 36 wks and 1 day. We all went home together on the 4th day after delivery. Twins is a completely different story thatn a singleton. Hospital stay will be determined more by your babies than by you. Because twins are normally born between 36-37 weeks your "milk" issues will be different than with a singleton regardless of a normal or c-section delivery. <br>  <br>  You will need help for at least a few weeks. But the most important thing is the health of your babies and you!  Twins are amazing! They are so much work. Your world will be a little upside down for a few months, especially with another little one! :) <br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  <br>  Mom of Twinkies!|`|xbu7WDlOaa	i had a csection on February 15th 2007..its not painful during the csection at all..you wont be able to feel any pain at all. Its actually a relaxing feeling. After you will be in alittle bit of pain, they will give you pain medication whenever you are in pain..and trust me the pain medication worked. Just tell them when you are in pain after the csection and they will give you medication for it. Congrats btw!
xJjguDfcaa	Stand up, hold him across your body and rock gently from side to side.  This copies the motion of being in the womb, and will make him feel more comfortable.  Rub his back while you do this, and it will help bring up any wind he has trapped.  Sing very softly to him...he won't care if you sound like a strangled cat, it will be a gentle familiar voice that will help to soothe him too.  <br>  <br>  If all else fails, and you can drive, pop him in the car and DRIVE!!!  ANYWHERE!!!  My daughter is asleep within ten mins of this!  And then they are sleepy when you stop so it is easy to lift them gently back into bed without waking them up again.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!  I'll be thinking of you!|`|aB5frgtBaa	If it is wind/colic then have you tried a product called colief in his milk?  I think you are UK based?  This is available to buy or on prescription - its expensive but it works.  For a shorter term solution though I would go with the rocking whilst holding him across your body, and when he is calmer, then a tummy massage in clockwise motions across his tummy, and also cycling his legs to try and get everything moving around.  |`|5779d5fcce95be477c5f331e69a3c5d6aa	Obviously calpol hasn't touched it and you're sure he isn't teething (his cheeks don't have to be red for it to be hurting him).  Perhaps a bath might help, if he has wind or stomach pain it'll relax the muscles and ease the wind, plus it may distract him.  <br>  <br>  Is he going through a growth spurt and wants some extra milk?|`|ffb3431f207b4e2a19fd9106e766c2bbaa	every baby is different, my 13mth was like that, we got told when feeding her to rub her belly in a clockwise motion helped wind and move any trapped air.<br>  have you tried infacol? think i have spelt it right, fantastic product. like colief but 10000x better, ￡10 for a small pot but if you go to your docs and say you have tried everything and got recomended this and it works they should give u it on prescription to save you the ￡10.<br>  hope this helps<br>  carl|`|yrV8f6vEaa	if u have tried everything else like feeding,diaper changing etc. n still is screaming take him to the er u might not know if hes sick from an infection or something else,my 6 month baby shes very quiet n there was this week she was all crying n fussin n i coudnt no more i took here to her doctor n she had ear infection...so if u have tried everything else n is not workin take him 4 a checkup...|`|2be9yTJFaa	If you think it is gas, try rubbing his tummy in a circular motion--briskly, but gently of course.<br>  <br>  Try have him do bicycles... Also, hold him very close to you--tummy to tummy--and pull his legs up high--in a sitting position. <br>  <br>  If it's gas, you'll need to solve THAT problem before getting him back to sleep.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SuuChXG6aa	best best see doctor 1st thing in morning, cos if he sleeps between 7pm to 7am then he could be ill, check his head for fever (hot) and check his feet (cold), but then again am no doctor so, so see the doc 2moro, or take him to the walk in centre|`|y2VLQsDfaa	try giving him a warm bath or feeding him a bottle if he is hot give him some juice. just walk around singing to him and rocking him i would ask the doctor about it next time you go to make sure nothing else is wrong|`|IdwqojCJaa	a drink of water with a bit of sugar or apple juice in might shift the wind. You could also try him with fennel or peppermint tea, cooled. Unfortunately, this is just a kid thing, and it happens from time to time. Take him out for a walk in the pram, or a ride in the car? Good luck.|`|rGt6X7QYaa	It might be warm out, it might not be...but my son does it too so I just take his clothes off and leave him in his diaper, swaddle him i a warm blanket and rub his back.

Or sit him up lean him forward whilst putting a little pressure on his tummy and rubbing slightly. If these dont bring wind up then sit him up and gently rotate him.offer him some cooled boiled water, or a little bit of milk to help break the wind.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|014NXPfFaa	I don't know what Calpol is.  How do you know he's not teething?  He's 8 months so he probably could be...<br>  When my son is pretty fussy I check his temp.  If he doesn't have a fever I hold him and rock him and give him attention. feed him if he seems to want to eat. it keeps me up a little longer, but it makes it easier for him... and as his mom, that's my job. :)<br>  <br>  I assume wind is gas - do you have something like "infant gas drops" here they are called mylicon - maybe thats what calpol is.  My son had gas and was constipated, at 4  months  the doc told me to give him 4 oz undiluted juice (any kind of baby juice - i chose pear) and he had runny poop the next day but it worked.|`|27262b2b6359761e91d02601633c75a2aa	He may have gas.  You can try giving him mylicon.  Its really safe to use.  He may actually be teething and you just dont know it.  Try rocking him in a rocking chair or hold him close and sing to him.|`|3SbM0E9Raa	it could be colic, go to your local pharmacy tomorrow and ask for advice|`|b1781263f22827b145fd1ea69c55fcfbaa	he might be caliky, try burping him and then take him out for a drive.

0OX9gAApaa	It sounds to me like you are going to have to get a carpet cleaning machine, (you can rent one), and professionally clean the carpet.  This is the only way you are going to get the cat urine out of the entire carpet without using nasty, harsh chemicals.  The machine uses carpet shampoo.  I have used one before and haven't noticed any smells from it, and I have high sensitivities to smells and perfumes too.  Definitely do not use the carpet cleaner sprays, because they do have a bad odor to them!|`|Nh48PtBRaa	I've had cats for 30 years.  One day I discovered a pet odor removing product that was basically hydrogen peroxide and water. So now for years I have just used 3% hydrogen peroxide straight from the bottle onto urine, vomit and poop stains and it works every time to completely remove the stain and the odor. To me it is a miracle discovery.  Apply, let sit a minute, don't rub but press paper towels onto stain until you've soaked up all liquid.  Repeat if necessary till stain is gone.  For urine apply, let sit a minute, then soak up, then let the area dry and see if the odor has dissipated, repeat if necessary. <br>  <br>  Thing is you will have to locate where the urine hit the carpet and work in that area.  Thing is it has soaked into the underpadding too.  I have never had a problem with it changing the color of a rug but you should probably test in a small area first to see.  Supermarkets now carry a hydrogen peroxide product that is to be used in the place of bleach in washing your clothes so I am assuming it is color fast.  <br>  <br>  When I smell urine I just get down on my hands and knees and crawl around sniffing till I've located the source.  Sometimes it is on the walls or baseboards from spraying.  Hope this helps, good luck. I am extremely sensitive to smells so I know what it is like.|`|pN2qGp4Iaa	id be asking the landlord or real estate to get them steam cleaned. i don't know where your from but over here in australia it is a requirement that the carpets be steam cleaned professionally before you move in and then you have to have them done when you move out to get your bond back. if they refuse to do it then i suggest you pay to get them done yourself, if you cant afford that then you could probably hire a machine and do it your self. it really needs a good scrub and steam will kill all the germs. its extremely unhygienic, and could make your little one sick. after you have them cleaned, id try one of those shake and vac carpet sprays or talc powders. that should get the germs and the smell out. <br>  but seriously, id be asking your landlords to do it for you. i don't know how its even legal to rent out a place when it smells like that. <br>  best of luck!!<br>  |`|1cb9d97fc5fdf9070b04aad8d907f1fcaa	First of all you need to tell your landlord the conditions are unbearable. And make them either replace or clean your carpet themselves perfessionally. In the meantime go over the carpet with some cleaner meant for dog/cat pee and see if that helps but honestly its not going to be something you can realistically do yourself you need to have the carpet cleaned profesionally and they should pay for it because it should have been done before you moved in...no offense to you but I dont know why you would move into something with conditions like that...Good luck|`|xgZAKO8Jaa	Cat urine odor is very tough to remove. If the cause of this happened before you moved in, your landlord should have replaced the carpet. If you haven't done so already, rent one of those steam cleaning machines from a hardware store or supermarket. <br>  <br>  A vet or a pet store may be able to offer you some sound advice as well. <br>  <br>  If all else fails, the carpet will have to be replaced.|`|258c563e8aca956a45e3da648b87079aaa	Have you tried baking soda?  Try sprinkling is generously on the carpet, letting it sit for about an hour and then vacuuming it up.  Really, you should be able to complain to the landlord and have them replace the carpet though because cat pee is one the hardest smells to get rid of.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Ipv3WoIcaa	I had the same problem. I found this stain remover at wal-mart in the auto section and it seems to work for odor. the other thing that works is bleach|`|3mCHTrHyaa	this is what i did i would either get a carpet cleaner or go to a specialty store|`|SrCH1nP5aa	If you can't Pull the carpet up try mixing a tiny bit of bleach in a bucket with hot water, dish detergent fabric softener and scrubbing it, but don't use too much water, you don't want to soak the padding.

If that does not work saturate the carpet with Freeze and let it air dry.|`|pbV96jlGaa	i had the same priblm i steam cleaned the carpets with a steam cleaner... aka a carpet shampooer.....also after u do that get some natures miracle(u can buy it at petco and places like that)... just sprinkle it over the floor and then shampoo again is shoul;d totally get the smell 99 %m out if not all the way|`|9XZaqaySaa	Nature's Miracle all the way.  Put some in a carpet shampooer - if you don't have one you can usually rent one at the supermarket for about $20.  Good luck!|`|PUZCNqSGaa	I have a dog with bladder control issues, so I know the feeling.<br>  <br>  Go to a pet store and get a couple of gallons of "simple solution" or other enzyme-based urine-cleaning solution.  It will cost ~$20/gal.<br>  <br>  Dilute it maybe 50% with water, and really soak any area that smells.   You have to get on your hands and knees and find the really gross spots.  You have to soak these areas through to the pad.<br>  <br>  Rent a carpet cleaner, and use this dilution instead of water in the carpet machine, and clean the whole area.  <br>  <br>  Once this is done, let it dry out naturally.  It won't be pleasant to be there while its drying, but once its dry, there won't be a residual chemical smell.  <br>  <br>  If you still smell the urine,  you did not soak the right spot, or soak it enough, so go through the exercise again -- put your face right above the carpet and find *the spot* where its really stinky, and soak there.  You'll get it though.<br>  <br>  ---UPDATE AFTER YOUR ADDITIONAL DETAILS---<br>  <br>  By all means, get the landlord to replace carpet if you can.  (And be sure to mop down the floor with an enzyme solution after the carpet is gone and let it air out for a while before the new carpet is installed -- it can get into the floorboards, too.)<br>  <br>  Failing that -- you need to get the enzyme solution soaked into the pad on exactly the spot(s) that stink the most.  They will break down all of the biological contaminates.  Trust me, I've been through this.  <br>  <br>  Just cleaning the carpet, or putting down soda or cleaner and vacuuming will *not* do it for more than a short time -- it will come back again and again.  Even if you have it professionally done, just the normal "lightly wet the carpet" technique will not do it.  That's probably what the landlord had done already.<br>  <br>  Nature's miracle is another brand name in addition to simple solution. (I prefer the latter.)   A pet store will have one or the other, but be sure to get an enzyme-based cleaner, and soak the carpet through to the pad in the worst spots.|`|T48smu01aa	you should ask the manager to get someone to clean it thats gross and they should be the ones to take care of it...I don't think much will work unless you get a professional to come out and clean it.

ifgsaCVaaa	Hi! I looked but I couldn't find it...but we had a bottle warmer and I took it back.<br>  <br>  Granted, I breastfeed, but when I pump and feed her with a bottle, I use the microwave. It's faster!|`|qMYypscCaa	Website....best answer...|`|909ba7c765e96de54c9f1a6fd7bdbd5caa	i just looked it up , found it at walmart ,in the instructions it doesn't say anything about putting any water in it just says for warming a baby bottle , a disposable baby bottle w/ bag and baby food jars. IF NEED MORE INFORMATION go to walmart.com look up the product you bought it will tell you in the features & specifications colume OR whatever store you may have bought it from. SUGGESTION- i never put the baby's bottle in microwaves it's too hot and it doesn't fully heat up all the liquid and food i used a little pan w/ water filled half way in pan. keep in eye on it, shake the bottle squirt alittle on your wrist each time for feel for temp you'd want .(luke warm)!!!SAFEST WAY!!!|`|eMV8vLBaaa	I am a new grandma - here is my answer:<br>  Throw that bottle warmer in the trash;  it takes too long to work anyway when baby is hungry and crying.  (Keep in mind  4-5 minutes can seem like HOURS when you are holding a hungry, crying newborn at 2:30 in the morning)!! Heat their feeding formula, breast milk, etc. in the microwave in a glass measuring container for as little as 10-12 seconds on high for 4 ounces.  BE SURE TO STIR IT AROUND AND TEST IT WITH YOUR FINGER BEFORE pouring into bottle and offering to your baby.  NEVER HEAR THE BOTTLE WITH ITS CONTENTS IN THE MICROWAVE.  This process is sooooooooo much faster and much more efficient.  Test the heating times of your microwave when your baby is sleeping or when he/she is not feeding.  Good luck!

Si es necesario una cesárea no te quedará otra alternativa que someterte a ella por tu bien y el de tu bebé. Siempre es recomendable someterse obedientemente a lo que dicen los médicos ya que ellos son los que saben como ayudarte. Además con la cesárea no debería haber ningún problema. A mi estuvieron a punto de hacérmela y sentía temor igual como tú lo sientes ahora, pero lo mejor es que estés tranquila ya que la tensión que estás sintiendo no le hará ningún bien a tu bebé.<br>  Saludos y buenos deseos.|`|be2cac09260ecd875805ceb50f899a17aa	Hola! mirá, no creo que haya ninguna forma de que tu bebé se encaje, ningún secreto mas que él mismo sienta que se tiene que dar vuelta.<br>  De todas formas, no te preocupes!! En el caso de que vayas a cesárea, todo va a salir bien!! No es nada grave ni mucho menos, es más, algunas mamás prefieren tener cesárea...Una amiga mía es obstetra y ella eligió tener a tu hijo por cesárea.<br>  Muchísima suerte!!! tenés varios días para que el bebe se de vuelta!!!

bMyq2nOTaa	Kody/Kodi sounds fine... Choosing a name is important, for sure, but to argue about it, and create stress over it? It's not *that* worth it... If Gary's only reason, is that he'll be the only one without a K name, well, I think he needs to get over it... Maybe he can choose the middle name, without any input from you. Seems fair to me... Many guys already feel disconnected to their babies/women, during pregnancy, cause they can't feel the baby, like we do, and they don't understand what all a woman goes through, so, including him as much as possible, is important to the connection he will feel to the both of you... Making your own decision, 'no matter what' will create strife... How worth it is it to both of you? Compromise, or lose.|`|NroZQN5vaa	I hate when people blame irrationality on hormones. The child came from both of you and you should both have a say in it. You have to teach your children that compromise is a part of a relationship.|`|9x9WPoNHaa	Yes, you do carry the baby 9 months, but it's his child too and you should BOTH come to an agreement for the name your child will have for the rest of his/her life. And although you may not see it that way, it IS selfish to say "whatever I say goes and you don't have any say in the matter, I don't care what you want, it's what I want". Don't you see how selfish that is? I don't know if it's hormones but if you don't want to push him away you'd better at least try to hear him out. <br>  <br>  To him, this sets the tone for how you will raise your child: what I say goes and you don't have an opinion a voice and much less any authority because the child is MINE and all you did was donate the sperm. I'm sorry, but that's what it sounds like and I'm sure that's in part how he sees it. Would you want to be with someone like that for a very long time? Try to relax; wouldn't it be better to find a name you both love and are happy about than to start raising this child like this--each pulling on opposite sides of the issue? You know what's gonna happen? If the kid ends up hating the name, dad will say "oh that was your mother". And if the kid loves it you'll be like "it was all ME" and either way it's not healthy for the child.<br>  <br>  In regards to "friends", who cares what your friends did or didn't do? This is your baby and your boyfriend's, not theirs! Maybe your friend's partner/husband/boyfriend didn't give a rat's *** what they called their baby, or was too lazy to come up with anything else so he left it all to mom (which by the way sets HIS tone when it comes to anything to do with baby-let mom deal with it).<br>  <br>  But you're blessed and fortunate to have a partner that actually CARES enough about you and the baby to want to participate in everything, including naming him/her! You should celebrate that, not shut him down. Good luck!|`|W0d6NsGBaa	I have to agree with everybody. This isnt only your baby! Its his too! What would you do if he insisted that you name your baby some name you didnt like?? Maybe he feels very left out because you want the kids names to all be K! Why dont you name this one with a G to go along with him? That way you will have one kid with your K and he will have one with his G.  Just dont force him to do that...its not right at all no matter HOW much you love a name!|`|clmIFtP2aa	I personally think that you guys should sort out your personal issues offline!!!  And for baby name picking, it should be considered by both parents.|`|66iddKHxaa	I guess it would be a little bit selfish because it should be a name that both you and your partner agree on but Im doing the same thing so I guess Im just as selfish my name is Heather and I want my son or daughters name to be an H name so I have Hayden picked for a boy and Hallie picked for a girl. I told my partner my name choices he hasnt disagreed with them. Were in more of a disagreement over the last name he wants it to have mine I want it to have his and the easiest way to solve it is to have an alternative last name which s a combo of both but I have my heart set on the baby having his last name and an H name plus if its a boy it will have his first name as a middle name. |`|94CenvOZaa	yea i think it is the hormones. Well i don't think you are selffish my godsister married a guy who his name starts with a J and in his family triadition his children name's should start with a J. They both decided a name for J and their middle names. Which I think it's awesome, it's ok if you like the names that starts with K he could choose a middle name for them. You can also conveince him to choose a name for girls and boys that starts with the letter K, you could alway go to babynames.com and they will show names for girls and boys that starts with the letter K. Good luck and Congradulation for your pregnancy.|`|KHcCtJbCaa	This is rediculous.  Grow up, your in a relationship and you need to learn to compromise and to be able to teach your child how to compromise.  Instead of insaulting Gary and what he likes for names, you need to listen to what he has to say.  You can't get everything you want in life.  This is the time that you need to put your child first, how can you do that when you can't even compromise and are being selfish, you just care about what you like.<br>  <br>  If you can't agree on a name that just you pick (which is rediculous) how in the world are you two going to parent this child.  You're going to argue at everything, what to use on a diaper rash, what brand of detergent.  Give and take, that's what it's about, it's not about you, grow up and start thinking of what's best for you child.  You can't get everything you want, you're just going to teach your child to be selfish and stubborn just like you.  That's great parenting.|`|jXG0m5zsaa	I think you are being really stubborn. This is a child you both help make. This is the name your child will have his/her whole life. Naming a child is something both parents should be a part of. Our daughter's name starts with a K. It is a somewhat common name but we spelled it a little different from normal. We agreed on first and middle name. I don't understand why you are being so over the top about this. Saying your child WILL have this first name and your partner will have to live with it is selfish. Being in a loving relationship and having a child is all about compromise. Why not let him have a say in his child's name?<br>  <br>  |`|ryvO8DMaaa	You sound like you are being very selfish to not even consider Gary's feelings on this.  Why can't you pick a traditional name that starts with a K?  When my husband and I were naming my daughter there were tons of names that I loved, loved, loved but I wasn't about to force him into naming her something that he didn't like just like he wouldn't do to me.  You need to compromise with him and stop thinking only of yourself. |`|AykczQleaa	At first I was very confused....<br>  <br>  My baby will have my bf's last name no matter what.  People can just be rude.|`|ZusC87WBaa	I think you need to take into account what the father wants too.  If you truly have a partnership then you need to compromise.  It's not just your baby to name.  I do understand if you just love the name....but if he doesn't, then you need to show a little understanding for that.  Why make this into such a big deal?  Parenting is a hard job and you are not starting off on the right foot here.  I truly think you are making him feel like his opinion doesn't matter and that he doesn't have as much say as you do.  If you're not careful, it could lead to more problems.

You won't be certain until you take a pregnancy test. That happened to me, and I really thought it could be implantation bleeding but a few days later I got my period (it was just early) I even tested, just in case, and got a negative. <br>  I still wish you luck, hopefully you'll get a positive.|`|909ba7c765e96de54c9f1a6fd7bdbd5caa	i'd advise you should really call your ob and ask them that question their the baby professionals!!!!!|`|bbYW0nSmaa	It could be implantation bleeding, but I would take a HPT and call the doc to make sure.

7IkY8Wplaa	You probably injured your vagina during sex. If the sex was painful, you may need lubrication. Not to be negative, but it could also be a sign of endometriosis.|`|26SqFq6Iaa	i read somewhere that it can be a sign of cervical cancer or period about to start. usually caused by rough sex or too much sex.

Xhgq35dNaa	I am hoping you called your doctor and told him what you wrote here first.  That aside, I would get pinching sensations in my cervix around 28 weeks, all the way up to almost delivering.  My daughter would stretch and wiggle and her hard little head would push on my cervix causing that pinching feeling.  I am not sure if this is what you are experiencing...I hope that is all it is.  Good luck!|`|beGSQMAYaa	Yes, you should be worried. If the pain keeps coming you shouldn't wait go to the ER. Something could be really wrong it's better to be safe than sorry. I hope every thing goes well!|`|d5a4001754ac965fab128bbf38b4a542aa	You really should talk with your doctor.  That's what you pay him/her for after all.  They'll be honest with you.|`|2b5dd3581135b61e32cf9d6f56212bb0aa	Discomfort is normal in pregnancy.  Pain is not.  You need to go to the doctor and don't take no for an answer.  God forbid something terrible happens because you waited too long.  Look, it could be nothing.If they give you an ultrasound, this could tell you the proble.  heck, that baby of yours could be laying on a kidney, bladder, or something.  As babies grow, it gets to be tight quarters in there.  Good luck.  I hope it is nothing but a big baby trying to sleep!|`|kRqm2X2Baa	You need to immediately contact your doctor. Most have an emergency service. This could be a bad sign.

Que repercuss?es tem esse desequilíbrio hormonal?<br>  H.Halbe – Ela produz andrógenos em maior quantidade. O principal problema que o desequilíbrio hormonal provoca está relacionado com a ovula??o. A testosterona interfere nesse mecanismo e, ao mesmo tempo, aumenta a possibilidade da incidência de cistos, porque eles resultam de um defeito na a??o dos horm?nios do ovário e isso impede a ovula??o.<br>  Os cistos, na verdade, representam a parada do desenvolvimento dos folículos para ovular. O folículo, normalmente, atinge um estágio em que arrebenta e expele o óvulo. Quando isso n?o acontece, líquido se acumula nesse local. Como mais ou menos dez folículos se desenvolvem todos os meses, surgir?o dez ou quinze pequenos cistos característicos do ovário policístico.<br>  No entanto, essa mulher n?o ovula porque lhe faltam condi??es endócrinas para tanto. Na mulher normal, esses dez folículos ou desaparecem ou liberam o óvulo. <br>  <br>  Drauzio – Na verdade, o cisto n?o é a causa do problema, mas a conseqüência desse desequilíbrio hormonal?<br>  H.Halbe – A causa desse desequilíbrio hormonal é justamente o sistema que n?o consegue fazer progredir a ovula??o porque os folículos n?o se desenvolvem a contento. Além disso, o tecido ovariano onde os folículos est?o localizados ajuda a piorar a situa??o. Ele se chama estroma e também produz andrógenos. Por isso, o ovário típico da síndrome tem maior volume e estroma aumentado.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Drauzio – Poderíamos dizer que o ovário fica masculinizado?<br>  H.Halbe – Ele fica masculinizado em sua fun??o, pois n?o deveria produzir a quantidade de andrógenos que produz. <br>  <br>  Drauzio – Normalmente os ovários policísticos s?o achados no exame de ultra-som?<br>  H.Halbe – No de ultra-som ou no de toque realizado no exame ginecológico de rotina. às vezes, basta examinar a paciente para localizar os dois ovários aumentados.<br>  O ovário tem mais ou menos 9cm3. O ovário policístico chega a ter 20cm3, quer dizer, o dobro do volume. Além disso, sua aparência é típica: fica coberto por uma capa branca semelhante à albugínea que envolve o testículo, e os cistos formam uma saliência na superfície.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://drauziovarella.ig.com.br/entrevistas/policistico6.asp" rel="nofollow">http://drauziovarella.ig.com.br/entrevis...</a>|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	Podem ser muitas causas...inumeras.

Aunque tu y muchas personas no lo crean, ese desequilibrio hormonal, hace que vivamos "calientic@s" y "ganos@s".<br>  <br>  Ojalá todas las personas "tuviéramos conciencia" de que cuando impulsivamente deseamos mas y mas y mas sexo, es debido a un desequilibrio hormonal.<br>  <br>  Cuidate mucho... y suerte !!!|`|thiyJV5Laa	bueno se escribe VUELVO y VER, te casaste a los 15 a?os, muy joven, bueno organiza tu vida, ve bien lo que quieres y como lo quieres...|`|1TsMRySCaa	Hola:<br>  <br>  deberias de analizar que pasa contigo, no manches estas muy chica para estar viviendo asi,  no amas acaso lo suficiente a tu sposo?? que es lo q buscas en los demas??  te gustaria que el actuara de la misma forma que tu lo haces??  mira no creo que aqui encuentres la respuesta que buscas, la respuesta que necesitas te las vas a dar tu misma,  o en dado caso acude aun psicologo tal vez te pueda ayudar a orientarte mejor y encontrar el porque de las cosas!! pero en buena onda te lo digo! comienza por respetarte..... ok? suerte y saludos...|`|58610ddfecb6d670036eb1923050ace6aa	Supongo que no tienes hijos, verdad?

KrySoxkPaa	Olha Lucimara, eu n?o sou médica para te dar certeza. Mas quando em um teste de farmácia a segunda cor sai clarinha é pq vc está grávida e a intensidade da cor vária com a contagem de horm?nios de Beta que vc tem em seu organismo, e mesmo estando grávida vc pode menstruar, s?o casos raros, mas acontecem. O melhor que tem a fazer é pedir ao médico um exame de sangue de betahcgh.

Em rela??o á menstrua??o existem mtas mulheres em k tal sucede e pode n?o ser nada de grave mas sim simples limpezas k o organismo tem de fazer, digamos k s?o os restos. Mas o meu conselho é marcar 1 consulta pré-natal e falar com seu médico para fazer outro teste e se este voltar a dar positivo fazer um exame de sangue k nunca falha.

Sempre que meu bebê chora, atendo prontamente. Estou certa em fazer isso?<br>  N?o. Está errada. Ao contrário do que pensam os pais, o choro do filho nem sempre está associado a sofrimento. às vezes, ele só quer chamar sua aten??o. Nesse caso, n?o faz mal deixá-lo esperando um pouquinho. Só dê pronto atendimento em caso de doen?a. <br>  <br>  2. Meu filho só quer colo. Devo cortar esse hábito?<br>  Deve. Coloque-o no carrinho ou no ch?o, sempre sob a supervis?o de um adulto. Se ele já engatinha ou anda, deixe que se desloque por seus próprios meios. Pai e m?e n?o podem ser táxi do filho, levando-o de um lado para outro. Isso cria uma rela??o de dependência muito negativa. <br>  <br>  3. Minha filha de 1 ano se recusa a largar o peito. Que fazer?<br>  N?o tenha pressa em desmamá-la. Saiba apenas que alimentar crian?a no peito é fundamental até o sexto mês, útil até o primeiro ano e, a partir daí, há controvérsia no meio médico sobre sua validade. <br>  <br>  4. Devo tirar os objetos quebráveis da vista do meu filho pequeno?<br>  Se algum objeto pode de fato machucar a crian?a, substitua-o por um inofensivo. Agora, se você quer que um porta-retratos ou uma relíquia se mantenham onde sempre estiveram, explique a seu filho que n?o deve mexer ali. é fundamental que ele aprenda a lidar com limites. <br>  <br>  5. Como fazer meu filho guardar os brinquedos depois de brincar e n?o jogar roupa no ch?o?<br>  A crian?a precisa saber que a casa é da família, e n?o propriedade particular dela. Avise-a antes de come?ar a brincadeira: ela pode esparramar tudo. Depois, deve juntar tudo. Ajude-a a guardar. <br>  <br>  6. Como evitar que meu filho vá dormir na minha cama?<br>  N?o há como evitar, mas leve-o de volta sempre que isso acontecer. A atitude refor?a os limites e no??es do que é meu, seu e nosso. <br>  <br>  7. Meu filho se joga no ch?o do supermercado e fico sem a??o. Como lidar com isso?<br>  A crian?a n?o pode vencer as batalhas recorrendo ao escandalo. Em troca do silêncio, jamais ofere?a compensa??es como um doce, brinquedo ou passeio. Também n?o se desgaste passando serm?es. Uma saída é tirar a crian?a do lugar público e explicar de maneira firme que ela n?o pode se comportar desse jeito. Se fizer novamente, deverá ser informada de que n?o irá ao supermercado na próxima vez. <br>  8. Como agir quando meu filho n?o divide os brinquedos com os amigos?<br>  Insista na idéia de que, se ele n?o aprender a repartir o que é dele, acabará brincando sozinho. <br>  <br>  9. Soube pela escola que meu filho morde os coleguinhas. Como devo agir?<br>  Isso n?o pode acontecer. Ainda que ninguém morda sem motivo, o filho dos outros n?o tem nada a ver com isso. Chame-o para conversar e mostre que a agress?o provoca dor. Informe que ele n?o pode repetir a atitude. <br>  <br>  10. Meu filho tem sido vítima de um coleguinha que o morde na escola. Como proceder?<br>  Isso n?o pode acontecer. Seu filho n?o vai à escola para ser vítima de ninguém. Reclame com a dire??o da escola e cobre uma providência. Mas jamais entre em confronto com os pais do agressor. <br>  <br>  11. Como ensinar meu filho que n?o se pode ganhar todas?<br>  Ninguém quer perder. Para vencerem, muitas crian?as roubam no jogo, mudam as regras. N?o permita que isso aconte?a. O filho pode achar que os fins justificam qualquer meio. é fundamental que ele conquiste a vitória pelos próprios méritos. <br>  <br>  12. Quando posso dar umas palmadas?<br>  As palmadas s?o um testemunho da incompetência dos pais como educadores. A crian?a pode até obedecer, mas o faz por medo de apanhar, e n?o por respeito. Um olhar seguro e bem dado é, sem dúvida, muito mais eficiente. <br>  <br>  13. Castigo funciona?<br>  Funciona, sim. Ele alivia a culpa da crian?a, que paga o que estava devendo e tem direito a novos créditos. O castigo também age como disciplinador. Ele atirou um brinquedo contra a parede? Fica sem brincar com outro brinquedo por um ou dois dias. Uma falta grave pode ser castigada com a retirada de aten??o. Você pode dizer que gosta muito de seu filho, mas ficou chateada com o que fez e n?o vai falar com ele durante um certo tempo. <br>  <br>  14. Meu filho só faz o que pe?o quando grito. Como saio dessa situa??o?<br>  O grito é um mau hábito. Ele n?o imp?e disciplina. Um diálogo eficiente deve ser feito face a face, num tom de voz normal – ainda que você precise repetir a instru??o para a crian?a. <br>  <br>  15. Devo sempre explicar por que estou dizendo n?o?<br>  N?o. Até os 5 anos, a crian?a n?o deve receber muita explica??o. Ela apenas quer autoriza??o para fazer algo.|`|1lLsnpqRaa	- primeiro procure um pediatra p/ tirar dúvidas sobre a saúde de seu filho.<br>  -pode ser a denti??o,isto incomoda bastante  a crian?a! <br>  -tirado as dúvidas, se for manha n?o tem outro remédio ,p?em ele no chiqueirinho com brinquedos e deiche chorar !|`|4DO8ZOtpaa	Minha querida, se ele está com 11 meses e vc já n?o sabe o que fazer com ele, tem que procurar ajuda urgente...<br>  Vc é a m?e, e ele tem que aceitar o que vc faz...se vc dá a mamadeira, troca ele para n?o ficar de xixi nem coc?, n?o tá doentinho...tem que deixar ele chorar filha.<br>  Se n?o fizer isso ele vai usar a arma do choro em tudo na vida para conseguir as coisa com vc.

Em casa sempre procuramos respeitar a fisiologia do bebe, principalmente no tocante a alimenta??o sólida. <br>  Hoje em dias muitas recomenda??es est?o diferentes do que eram e o que se aconselha é que se siga a linha de conduta do pediatra. <br>  A observa??o abaixo n?o é regra imutável, mas é interessante: <br>  <br>  <br>  A partir do 6o mês torna-se necessário complementar a dieta da crian?a com outros alimentos. Lembrando que n?o é para SUBSTITUIR o leite materno e sim COMPLEMENTAR, pois o aleitamento materno deve ser mantido, sempre que possível, até os 2 anos de idade. <br>   <br>  <br>  Os novos alimentos devem ser oferecidos ao bebê gradativamente, sendo um alimento novo por dia, a fim de observar a tolerancia pela crian?a.  As papinhas de fruta poder?o ser oferecidas 2 vezes ao dia enquanto que as papinhas de sal inicialmente poder?o ser oferecidas apenas no horário do almo?o e posteriormente, por volta do 8o mês de vida, oferecida também no jantar. Poderá ser elaborada pelos mesmos alimentos presentes nas refei??es da família, porém, inicialmente, a consistência deve ser adaptada às condi??es da crian?a. N?o deve ser muito mole, pois é necessário estimular a mastiga??o e os dentinhos que est?o come?ando a serem formados. Portanto sugere-se amassar ao invés de liquidificar e com o passar do tempo substituir por alimentos picadinhos.|`|m5NV5y1Qaa	pode um legume diferente ao dia. na semana seguinte dois legumes diferente...a partir da terceira semana vc pode  oferecer papinhas mas completas com carne e macarr?o

bVCPmLkvaa	Amiga fa?a o seguinte:<br>  Em primeiro lugar vá logo ao médico para este lhe solicitar um exame do Beta HCG (sangue), pois é o único teste confiável. Estes teste de farmácia n?o s?o muito confiáveis. Além do mais, vc pode nem estar grávida mais o seu psicológico também pode influenciar na vinda da menstrua??o... A nossa mente é muito poderosa...<br>  Em segundo lugar, n?o utilize o método do coito interrompido como anticoncepcional, pois já foi mais do que comprovado que ele n?o funciona...  Já que o homem já libera um líquido que contém um pouco de espermatozóides desde o come?o do ato sexual e n?o somente no fim, com a ejacula??o (gozo).<br>  Assim, procure logo seu ginecologista!!!|`|bb8fd004d586212774b7c8f0810de347aa	Amiga, o coito interrompido n?o é um bom método anticoncepcional.

CJ5gHAhLaa	aure why not/  i took my 21 days daughter from wv to new orleans to meet my daddy. and i drove.|`|AA10336702	yes, my sister was only 2 weeks old when we came to meet my grandmother that lived here in the USA, we came all the way from South America.|`|3duKCOJtaa	sure it is. i went on a trip with my 2 month old by myself and she did just fine. you'll probably do even better since your child is younger they'll sleep more. the best tip i can give you, if your child sucks on a pacifier, keep it handy. if he/ she doesn't, that's okay too. keep a bottle handy, full or not, or if you breast feed, keep your breast handy. most babies cry a lot on planes from the discomfort of their ears popping, but if they have something to suck on, their ears usually pop. kinda like chewing gum or yawning for us adults. your baby will do just fine. good luck.
jNtkhOTVaa	The tests say that you can find out up to five days prior but when you read the instructions the chances of them being accurate diminish the earlier you take them.  So the best thing you can do is wait until the day of your period or the day after.  I know, the waiting is the worst.  <br>  But for what it is worth you sound like you are pregnant.  I had the typical PMS symptoms too.  Sore breasts, terrible cramping.  I kept waiting for AF and she just never came.  I wish you the best of luck.|`|H74F8jxuaa	You may have tested too early.  Try another test if you miss your period.  I hate waiting to take the tests too, but they are the most accurate with the morning urine the day of or even the day after your expected period.  Good luck.|`|MOsStEbqaa	Wait till monday and take a test first thing in the morning. And if it feel like how you did with the first there is a good chance that you are. Good Luck.
HclKftzAaa	I think that you geographical location is NO excuse for an induction.<br>  <br>  In the end, he should have explained to you the risks of induction vs a 'home birth' (which is what it would be really if you didn't make it to the hospital) so that you could decide for yourself which one would be better.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could compromise with him, and stay in a motel near the hospital when you are getting closer.<br>  <br>  Besides which, there is no guarantee that you'll have a short labor this time just because you did last time.<br>  <br>  I don't believe that the doctor's reasons are strong enough to warrant interference.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Is there a hospital closer to you in case labor does happen as fast as last time? If so there would be nothing wrong with going to a closer hospital if need be. You wouldn't have your doctor but you would have a doctor.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I think that with such a rapid labor it will be no worse with an induction and you will respond well to it as well.  Besides, with induction you'll be able to have an epidural this time.<br>  <br>  And realize, I don't believe that induction should be done regularly at all, but that fast labor is better done in hospital.|`|DqUi0xPhaa	There is no way I would induce unless me or the baby was dying.  I have fast labors (was only at the birthing center 45 mins before my son was born) but if we have another I will be using a midwife an hour and a half away.  I am planning a homebirth in that case.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I would think you would notice mild cramps etc this go round that would let you know to head on.  I had mild cramps for hours prior to being in full blown labor as I bet you did but disregarded them.<br>  <br>  Good luck,  Yahoo.com had this when I logged on yesterday (they are my homepage).  I saved it cause it was of interest.<br>  <br>  I know it is on c-sections but they are along the same line as induction.  Do you know inducing increases risk of c-sec<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.yahoo.com/news/healthday/earlyelectivecsectionsproducecomplications.html">http://health.yahoo.com/news/healthday/e...</a><br>  <br>  ADD: I 4got to ask how far along are you?  I assume you are not 39-40 weeks as if so your doctor woudl be having a fit at the risk of you going into labor.|`|myEwHgI1aa	Well, you have every right to say no to induction. I did not know it with my first baby, and I ended up getting induced before my body was ready, and I ended up in the O.R. with a C-section. This time, I am going with a home birth with midwife and doula. <br>  If you don't want it, tell him No.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	I have had labor induced and not induced.. its realy NOT stronger... women just think its worse becaue they want to have the most terrible labor story for some reason.  It will take longer for things to progress, that is for sure.  My middle child came in only 45 min!!|`|U67DfN5naa	I was induced with both of my children, one due to going two weeks overdue and the other because I was losing amniotic fluid rapidly. I actually didn't have much pain till the last hour of both and no pain medications with both. My first (overdue) was 8 hours long, a few pushes and my second (losing amniotic fluid) was only 5 hours long and only a few pushes also. I think I would prefer to be induced any day. It really wasn't that bad, I played Yahtzee, read, and walked around for the time being.|`|npc57R53aa	Being induced can be so painful! I was induced with both labors, my first labor my contractions lasted 3 mins with 3 seconds break in between. They tried the gel 3 times, with everytime it resulting in my body quiting labor 6 hrs later. After all that, It wound up taking 12 hours on the drip!<br>  My second labor was alot easier, 1 min contractions with a 1 min break and only 4 hrs in total!<br>  I think the difference was they thought my water had fully broken with the first labor and it hadn't.  If they turn up the drip gradually it really isn't that bad. No drugs with the second labor.|`|cgk2yefUaa	HI i was induced with my girl 7 years ago and from my own personal experience i enjoyed the labour as of right now tho have nothing to compare it to and i didn't find it any more painfull than i thought labour itself would be !!! <br>  <br>  Im hoping to go myself with this baby but if i need induced again i wont be worring like a said im sure it be fine ( altho i might add i have herd the old wifes before saying if you ar induced then it more painfull) but im sure 1 or 2 of the ladies on her have experience both so they might be a better help honey <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations i hope everything goes well for you !!<br>  <br>  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|wRvYyXZLaa	i was induced at 36 weeks due to a tear to my placenta and i honestly don't think the contractions were anymore pain full then my other 2 after finally getting the labour going it only lasted 2 hours and i only had gas and air so i had a good experience if i was you i would take this Option as the doctor said if you was at home and something went wrong you are very far away good luck hun xx|`|pRiS7ET5aa	i think that if your labor is that short and you're an hour away you may want to listen to your dr to be safe im sure you'd rather be induced than have your baby in the car on the side of the highway.. good luck and this of whats best for you and baby.|`|ZlgFB7qBaa	I hated being induced. But my labors were much longer than yours. If you had the baby at home would you be ok with that? Is that something you feel prepared to do?
KTj8Hbbtaa	Parents should censor the television being watched by their children, not the community at large.  <br>  <br>  Parenting is a personal issue, what is ok for your child is not for mine.|`|ZRQvrbtGaa	It certainly is up to the parents, and no one else. I don't think TV should be censored just for kids, there are older people who might like to see "explicit" TV. I'm not going to lie: I watch all those shows you listed, and ones that come on Comedy Central at 2am which are probably worse. I like "trashy" shows, sorry, I don't think those should be taken away from me just because of kids. Their parents need to monitor what they are watching. The world does not revolve around people's children.|`|bmEOXy8Naa	if it is during the day time, tv should be censored.<br>  not just for the sake of the children, but for everyone!<br>  imagine sitting down watching tv with your grandmother and someone says something vulger and very sexual.<br>  do you know how awkward that would be??<br>  omgsh.<br>  and it is also the parents respnsibility to make sure that theyr children arent watching South Park, Family Guy, American Dad etc.<br>  i watch it, but i'm 15 and my mom allows me.<br>  she thinks its funny too, but she would never let my 9 year old brother watch it until hes at least 13.|`|Fvuq2Nwiaa	I think it is the parents responsibility. <br>  Why should everything have to be censored just because of children. <br>  TV is for entertainment and parents need to take charge and control what their children do for entertainment. That is IF they care what they do.|`|488edafbffd854a7df677efa90768cabaa	I think that it would help if there was a little of both. Yes, parents need to be responsible but it's getting so there is nothing that isn't offensive. Would it hurt to return to the "family hour"? Parents need all the help they can get.|`|AA10409800	Note:  How about being a parent and doing your friggin' job, and not leaving it up to television.<br>  <br>  I have a son, and I control what he does or does not watch.  I do not expect HBO, FOX, etc. to do my job for me.|`|9hQolfDcaa	It's the parents responsibility to monitor what their kids watch, we should cut back on censorship.|`|MI53mUKzaa	whats wrong with ALF?<br>  <br>  and i think it is the parent's responsibly to know what their children are watching|`|NzCuYRXFaa	Censorship on public media is the responsibility of the parents not the programmers.  However, you can't censor the world and a child will hear foul language, see violence or disrespect everywhere in today's world from the grocery store to the doctors office.  One must teach children that foul language is inappropriate, to respect themselves and others and be considerate of other people.   |`|a0823d62eaff75aea92cc91e2466c3aaaa	Yes it is our responsibilty to make sure what they are watching is appropriate.  We never watch adult shows in the company of our 16 month old.  And even then we rarely watch tv. at all.   <br>  <br>  I think everyone should try cutting back on their tv watching... it really helps you become more connected as a family.  |`|5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	Oh my gosh yes....the television shows now days are horrible...the examples you gave are the best of the worst.  I think it is the parent's responsibility as well as the network's to ensure that children don't grow up with all this violence, sex, and cursing.  |`|9PoqzrJ8aa	yes i think it's the parents responsibility they have such things now as the Vchip installed in many tvs|`|gLffUQWfaa	9.o clock watershed is ok kids should be in bed , i don't want to live in nanny state its bad enough|`|H41u0B8Jaa	It is the parents responsibility to decide what the kids can and can't watch.  We are their censors not the people who produce the TV shows.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	We should sensor what our kids watch....I loved The Simpsons when I was 9....and now that I am 27 I cannot believe my parents let me watch it!|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	I think it really depends, I think network television should be censored from foul language between certain hours. You don't need the tv accidentally being turned and the F word making an appearance during cartoons.<br>  <br>  However, cable tv should not be censored, if I'm paying for it then I know what I'm paying for.  I think it is absolutely the parents responsibility to monitor their children's tv habits.  I don't let mine watch American Dad, but I think it's hilarious!|`|hjc2y3TMaa	No I don't think they should sensor it. I am not particularly offended by any type of language...I can tell my children not to use certain words because they are not nice or age appropriate if I so choose. <br>  Content I make sure to watch out for but there are rules about not watching TV after 8 pm in our house anyway so it's not a problem.|`|qpln6o9Yaa	Absolutely. Obscene language is so out of control in television anymore. The best thing for a parent to do is strictly control what their children watch. Most of TV is garbage and not fit for family viewing. |`|8IfePMa3aa	It's the parents' responsibility to be a parent and keep track of what their kids are being exposed to.

I literally got through this book in a couple hours.  It is a quick read but hilarious nonetheless.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	Belly laughs by Jenny McCarthy. I loved that one!

As far as this specific outfit, it sounds like the quintessential christmas attire for a little one. I wouldn't worry at all. Look at almost any child in a magazine or ad at the mall and that's what they're wearing. Even if it's not for Christmas, it still looks super cute.  As far as tights, with/without I don't think it's anything to worry about. |`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	nope..  at 15 months she could wear running shoes with the dress and she'd still be cute!   look for black tights.. i found some last year and they were a lifesaver... stay clean unlike white ones!!  I got then at The Children's Place.  |`|9NpXU7D2aa	no. <br>  i assume you are talking xmas dresses. <br>  that is the look every mom trys to achieve for xmas. <br>  red and white dress with black shoes makes a baby look like santa and i think that is sooo cute. i just bought my 6 month old niece a red velvet dress that has white fur collar, cuffs, and bottum trim and it sparkles. and she is gonna wear it for xmas with shiny black dress shoes and white tights.
vKavuSMtaa	My daughters wore maroon during the holidays last year.  I think it is great for kids because it is a bit classier than bright red and green.  If you are worried about the color being to grown up for her then pair it with cream colored tights instead of black and some nice shiny patent leather mary janes.  I had one of my daughters in maroon and my other one was in emerald green.  I also paired the emerald with cream tights instead of black and it was very age appropriate.  You and your husband can wear black and cream with some accents of maroon and emerald green ex: a scarf for you or a pin or hair accessory, a tie for him or comfy sweater.  Gold will also look better then silver because of the warmth of the colors.  Good luck!|`|o6ruEMVUaa	Maroon is a beautiful Christmas color! :)<br>  I just bought my daughter a darling dress. It's maroon on top with ivory and flowers on the bottom. It's for Christmas pictures. <br>  I think Ivory (is better than white) or Cream, gold (goldish/copperish), any warm natural color (browns/tans) and even black would like nice with maroon. Without seeing the dress, that's the best advice I can give on what you guys should wear! :) <br>  Oh, if she's wearing maroon, you guys shouldn't wear red. |`|AA10779768	so since you found the maroon dress let her wear it...you dont have to stick to the traditional colors...you and your husband could wear white shirts with black bottoms i think it would be cute with your husband in black dress pants and you in black dress pants or a long black skirt...this will make your baby pop and it will make her be the center of attention so this will show everyone how pretty and cute your daugter is..|`|XTuhGaL1aa	Maroon is beautiful and it looks really nice in photos. Good choice for Christmas photos!|`|mQhWH1mzaa	is she wearing any leggings?? if so.. the color of them is what color you guys should wear|`|xK6wehG7aa	maroon is great! You and your husband could wear black or white. Both would look nice|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Maroon's lovely, it'll probably look even nicer than red to be honest.<br>  <br>  I can't think of what colour you and your husband could wear though, sorry!|`|2N6KEoVqaa	Maroon is great. To keep it looking really Christmas-y I would say you and your husband should wear a forest green. It's just like taking the vibrant red and green that is traditional and classing it up a bit.|`|fEF2WoaYaa	maroon is great for christmas my lil girls dress this year is that color and i belive last year it was too the pics turned out great! They will for you too! |`|fJiUa5ykaa	Maroon would be very pretty color for Christmas pictures.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Maroon is fine for Christmas.
SRsFkNBBaa	those leggings that are in style now. you can get them at walmart. i bought some and as i got bigger, i cut the sides at the top. alittle, about 1/4 inch. that would give enough room for my belly (i carry babies all out front, and huge!! lol) <br>  they are tight enough that they won't slide either-at least in my expirience. and on top of that, they are only $5 a pop at walmart in about 10 different colors.|`|4duo5AcOaa	Well I don't know if you can get away with regular ones during the last months, but I will warn you that pregnancy pantyhose are the most evil invention known to women lol.|`|J6IOqzL0aa	yes you could buy larger ones and just wear them under your bump. but you might get uncomfy and need to invest in a few but i would think you will be ok|`|NeXOvFl0aa	well what u should wear under ur skrits is leggings u can find them at ur local mall!!! try dat and write me bac and tell me how dat go.|`|z3jehVv8aa	i have never worn maternity/pregnancy underwear in any of my 5 pregnancies just wore normal ones lol. best wishes|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I had a really tough time with non pregnancy panty hose last year when I was 6 months pregnant....they were tight and hurt a lot. I never needed pregnancy underwear either but I do suggest to invest in a pair of pregnancy panty hose if you plan to wear them a lot. I only wore panty hose one night when we went out for Valentines Day but man do I wish I at least bought a queen sized pair.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	my mom was slender during her pregnancy and she said she always bought queen sized pantyhose/tights.  Also you can usually get plus sized pantyhose/tights in places like walmart.  If that doesn't work I'd get to a maternity store and buy tights there.. at least with tights they don't ruin easily so you'd get your money's worth out of them before you no longer need them.  Also consider leggings to go under skirts!
HXadRqVfaa	It's up to the family, but the climate in the office may also contribute to whether or not it's apropos. Do others have pictures there? Does he have a space that is entirely his own?|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	Some offices allow this, others frown upon it. If it is generally acceptable, I think he should. Both my husband and I keep a family picture on our desks. |`|shBj5RElaa	my hubby works from home but when he had to go into an office, he did have one. I say its up to that family|`|wBpennsMaa	Yes :-)|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	My hubby keeps pics of me on his computer since he doesn't have a desk. So when people look at his laptop they see the background which is a big collage of my pictures. I'm sure they'll be taken down and replaced with pics of our daughter once she's here though. : ) Which I am perfectly fine with of course.|`|rN0JubIRaa	yeah well of course he should he married you has a family with you so he should be proud of the fact he has a family to put on his desk as some people don't|`|CuiWaH3Yaa	there no rule saying he has to, but If I worked in and office at a desk I would be proud to show of my lovely wife and kids to my fello work mates|`|XgSRmF0gaa	I think so but sometimes it isn't appropriate. Small amount of space and lots of husbands means not possible sometimes..|`|jLQekcZDaa	if my wife looked like you, i'd have a picture just to show everyone else what i get to bang every night.|`|c8AHa6PMaa	Its their choice.|`|feSM2POmaa	If they want too.|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	My husband doesn't have a desk but he does keep a picture of the kids in his "locker" - he's a firefighter, it's where his coat, boots etc. are kept.  <br>  <br>  My dad has a desk but he doesn't keep any pictures of his children or his grandchildren because he is a police officer and it could be dangerous for some of the people he deals with to see current pictures of his family members.  |`|PDHCOrOSaa	If they want.  It would be nice for them to look at their family all day.
4ulGfh2haa	The good thing about maternity pants is that they are super stretchy, but the best bet would be to try them on before buying.|`|sbfm5rCAaa	Materity wear is the best clothes ever! All you need to do is buy the normal size you would normally wear and the panels, zips etc will adjust to fit your expanding tummy.<br>  <br>  you will have no porblem at all buying a small pair of pants which will fit your tummy. Go to a proper maternity shop and they will guide and assist you with what is best. I personally prefer the zip pants and the pouches as opposed to the drawstring pants and elastic bands. This si just my personal preference though!|`|mVD3TQkFaa	I was a 4-6 pre pregnancy myself and started out with small maternity pants. At around 6 months I had to go up to medium. Best thing is to try them on if you can or order big. Sounds to me ike you would be a medium. 
8pup9oWhaa	I know it might seem like a difficult situation for you, but its really not your business how much and when your daughter in law works.<br>  Also, you say your son works long hours, why is it ok for him to work, but not his wife?<br>  Your grandchildren love you, they do. If your DIL is saying things about you, they will make their own minds up as to whether to believe it or not. Remember that a 10 year old can get mouthy and rude, and perhaps its not all your DIL.<br>  You can not expect your DIL to work around you in terms of parties and fun activities for the children. If i was you, when changes are made like you say about their birthdays, i would make the effort to be there, without complaining. No kid likes it when adults argue, so dont do it in front of the children. The best that you can hope for is that one day your grandchildren will see that you love them and care for them. They wont see that if you bicker and are bitter with their mother. Just be there for them when they need you.|`|shBj5RElaa	i think you are whacko and you are imagining things.<br>  <br>   noting wrong with homework.<br>  <br>  MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS, if you were my MIL, you would NEVER see my kids period|`|JsqMSU9Haa	you need to talk to your son.  i don't see how you can object to doing homework.. but the disrespect is unacceptable.|`|aKhZNd7daa	One day Joan you are going to Self Com-bust or at the very least give yourself a coronary with all the hatred in you towards your DIL.  I'm sure she is not Grooming (as you so delightfully put it) your Grandson to be Rude & Disrespectful to you - He is 10 now and probably picks up on the fact that as far as your DIL -  HIS MOTHER - is concerned she cannot do any right in your eyes and he obviously doesn't like this and so lets you know it in his own by being cheeky to you.  Your own Son has even told you to ' leave it ' can you not respect his decision in all this.  Sooner or later Joan you are going to find that you lose all contact with your Son & Grandsons if you carry on like this.  And going to 'Her' Mums at Christmas - Well why shouldn't they - they don't see as much of her living 'down south' as they do you and my guess is the real reason you don't want them to go is not because The Other Nan Smokes but because you are Jealous.  Why can't you just enjoy your Grandsons Joan and be a normal fun loving Gran instead of this Old Harridan you always come across as ???|`|I7ktUFQfaa	You're the mother-IN-LAW, not the mother. You have no say in how your grandchildren are raised and you should just leave them alone.|`|uwAZrBykaa	Stop these pathetic questions you |`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	Are you even a real person?<br>  <br>  I get so worked up over your questions, that I am really starting to question the legitimacy.<br>  <br>  If I read another " My daughter in law is Satan" extensive post, I'm going to cry.<br>  <br>  Your lucky you even get to see your Grandchildren. I'd cut off all contact from you if you were my mother in law.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to stay out of their business.<br>  By the way, doesn't your precious son have a part of your 'unholy' Grandchildren's upbringing as well?<br>  <br>  For someone who claims to be Anti-bullying, you sure seem to bully your poor daughter in law quite a lot!|`|LMc23g9Maa	When I was ten, I also was not too happy in my grandma's company because I knew some of the comments she was making about my mother, I did not need anyone to tell me what to think and where to side. <br>  From the age of 12, neither my mother nor myself ever wanted to see her as she had caused too much grief and unhappiness.  Only my dad went to visit.  I saw her again, last year, for the last time, at her request.  Yes I travelled the whole 17000 kms.<br>  Children have extreme loyalty for their parents.  You may not have started this war but if you keep on fighting, you will be like my grandma, someone that no one wants to see.|`|cgk2yefUaa	First of i felt totally compelled to answers this question even altho many have before me!!.Please can i say you are going to be the one that loses out you will be stoped from seeing your grandchildren because of the resentment you have for there mum I  for 1 would NEVER allow someone to tell me how to bring up my kids not even my own mother !! Im thinking you also have a problem with the lady working !! what right do you have to criticise ANYONE that wishes to work her and your son clearly enjoy a nice life style holidays clothes etc they both like these things that's prob why they married they have alot in commen !!!<br>  I MUST GET TO THE SPIKEY HAIR COMMENT  please tell me you are not also saying the boys are not allowed to choose what way they dress i think your living in the 50s if the child wants spikey hair that's not up to you weather you like it or not the boys do so that's all that matters !! <br>  As for you brought you son up i think you resent him to because he not sticking up for you as it were because he and his wife get on with it they both work have 3 children so there life cant be all plain sailing and your just adding to it !! As for her giving boys extra homework EDUCATION is of the up most importance and i also give my daughter (who is 7 ) extra homework !!!!<br>  If your not carefull you will be totally excluded from there lifes even your sons as he rightly so should stick up for his wife !!<br>  <br>  |`|g4Rl7T8Kaa	now, i may be wrong, but i do believe that if she wants to balance children and a career, that is her business, being that it's HER career and HER children.<br>  <br>  not yours.<br>  <br>  get over it.|`|osDQVLqNaa	Do you have nothing better to do than make up imaginary stories about your imaginary family? A few days ago you were talking about your grandsons being in their late teens, and now suddenly we've travelled back in time and they're all 10 or under? You have serious issues if the only enjoyment you get out of life is riling up strangers on Y!A with your obnoxious tales.<br>  <br>  Add: Here's the other question posted by you, Joan/moan <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgyIApL4Sm_yHFUyCAVF82dJBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20081117024342AA6oVSs">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|p0LrO27caa	I didn't even read all of this because I got disgusted at the beginning. Are you sure you're not my MIL?? My MIL is horrible and lies like this to our friends and relatives. She maliciously tries to make people hate me.<br>  <br>  These are NOT your kids. They will be raised how the parents want them to. Leave it alone. I wouldn't want my kids around you either, just as I told my MIL I was done with her s*it and didn't want her around my son for a while because she is teaching him things other than what I am trying to get him to learn.|`|010e45dc0e6346ff817fa3cf9c7d3649aa	You really are the end Joan, it makes me so cross that even after your beloved, perfect son, who loves your DIL, tells you to leave it you still go on.  If you brought up your son so perfectly then he would do or say something if he was not happy with the way his children are being bought up by his wife and him.  But he doesn't, he tells you to leave it alone....so take his advice and leave it alone or you will lose your family completely, and i wouldn't blame them.|`|DgqHqNeGaa	is this a joke?<br>  <br>  firstly, you talk in a confusing way, you keep referring to 'my eldest' etc, when i think you are talking about your grandson, therefore they are not 'yours'.<br>  secondly, you have been told by your own son, the father of these children to stay out of it, therefore, respect his wishes as a father, he and his wife have parental responsiblity for these children not you<br>  thirdly, yes homework has to be done at the weekend if it is due for monday morning, when else do you think it will be completed<br>  fourth - you dont like the boys coming round with spikey hair????? what are you the hair police?????<br>  <br>  i tell you what you should do. make an applicaiton to your nearest family proceedings court for defined contact. after the application is received by the court, the judge will order a social worker (either from social services or cafcass) to investigate the application. they will assess the situation with the boys welfare and your appropriateness to have contact with them according to your request in the application. then someone will be able to put in black and white once and for all, why you should back off from this family and act appropriately|`|SPATdDozaa	Firstly and most importantly your grandkids aren't being "groomed" as you put it!<br>  <br>  Your grandkids are growing up and are forming their own opinions and ideas, your grandson probably believes your "past your sell by date" because of the dated opinions and beliefs you have, as for him telling you to "shut up" she should have reprimanded him for that!<br>  <br>  As for saying your DIL resented finding alternative childcare, i'd be amazed if this was the case, she's probably just relieved that her kids are going somewhere where they are happy and aren't restricted in every thought and opinion they have!<br>  <br>  The birthdays, all kids nowadays have parties at the weekends, this gives them a lot more time to spend having a party and extends their options for the type of party they can have, not to mention pretty much gaurantees that all their friends are able to come. If you think about it who wants to have a party after they've been at school all day, plus most kids have some after school activities they attend!<br>  <br>  Her mother, of course she's going to take her kids to see her mother, it's completely ridiculous of you to suggest she shouldn't, would you have stopped your mother seeing your sons if she smoked???<br>  <br>  As for her work ethic, thats highly commendable Joan, would you be happier if she sat at home while your son payed for everything? or even better if she claimed benefits? Is that the sort of example you think would be good for her to teach her sons? <br>  As for the foreign holidays and designer clothes, has it occured to you that this maybe the lifestyle your son wants to live as well? <br>  I wonder Joan do you work, or have you ever? You seem to spend such an awful lot of time interfering in your sons family's life that I don't see how you could possibly find the time to have employment, plus you where always there for "your boys" as they were growing up, how did you manage to pay for clothes, food etc for them??? benefits?<br>  <br>  Accept your grandchildren are growing up and forming their own opinions, if you don't you'll be asking questions such as "Why have I been banned from seeing my grandsons" or" My grandsons don't want to spend any time with me" to which everyone would reply, no bloody wonder!|`|dCfLjE3Daa	I would suggest that you speak to your son about this. If this is a serious question then your son is the father to these children and if he is your son then he should be able to answer and deal with your concerns much better than a bunch of random strangers.<br>  <br>  edit: <br>  <br>  If you are serious, then I'm not sure that 'having it out with her' is the answer. In fact 'having it out with her' might just cause problems. Can you not take it more carefully? If you are for real, then the risk to you is losing contact with your grandchildren and so you need be careful. Don't antagonise their mother unnecessarily. Stay in contact with them but don't lose sight of the bigger picture. You want to be able to stay in contact with them? Then tread carefully and don't cause any argument unless you can't avoid it. Be patient here.|`|mHitm7eXaa	1- its 2008<br>  2- Butt out!<br>  <br>  My Mil is great, leaves me to look after my boy how i want- NEVER criticises and is supportive of everything i do- try taking a step back.<br>  <br>  EDIT have you ever thought she needs to work for the money?

She's just parenting them differently than you would.<br>  <br>  As for you allowing any child in your care to behave rudely - whether to you or to someone else - that's really *your* responsibility when they are under your care.

jNtkhOTVaa	     It sounds like you're on the right track. Kick anything you consider a bad habit now.  It's just easier to do it now.  Smoking, drinking, if you're addicted to caffeine nows the time to cut back. That was my weakness.  It's okay to have some but studies have shown that too much has been linked to miscarriages.<br>  <br>       Eat right and get in shape/stay in shape.  Now is the best time to do it because later you may be battling morning sickness and not even want to eat.  Then further down the road if for some small reason you have a high risk pregnancy (which isn't actually as scary as it sounds) and you get put on bed rest you've already done all the right stuff and stayed in healthy shape so you're not just sitting around packing on the pounds... like I did.  Good times!<br>  <br>       Best of luck to you. 
cAtWxJG1aa	What people think is so bad about it is that if kids learn that gay people can get married, they will think that being gay is fine and not something to treat with disgust or hatred.<br>  <br>  What they miss is that being gay *is* fine and not something to treat with disgust or hatred.<br>  <br>  The gay people are there whether you let them get married or not.  The only question is whether to marginalize people because of their sexual orientation, which isn't something they choose.  Seriously, you have to wonder if any of the people worried that kids will "choose" to be gay if gay marriage is allowed would "choose" to be gay themselves.  That's just ridiculous.  You don't "choose" with whom you fall in love.  <br>  <br>  And as for marriage being religious ... it's religious and civil.  The religious element won't change, and gays won't be able to get married in a church that doesn't sanction gay marriage.  But your tax status and ability to visit your life partner in the hospital should not depend on your religion (or your sexual orientation).|`|hVrfm4eIaa	There's nothing wrong with kids learning about gay marriage.  Those against it worry that their children would learn tolerance.  It reminds me of the song from the musical South Pacific about how one has to be carefully taught to hate and fear.  A child's natural inclination is acceptance.|`|G4qP2gATaa	Nothing really.<br>  <br>  Just religious freaks think that its a bad thing because you know, its saying that is okay, AND THAT HAS TO BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS!<br>  <br>  ....<br>  <br>  Yep.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Also, if it were true that learning about being gay would turn you gay, I would be gay, because I had a gay cousin since I was born, and knew he was gay since I can remember. . . . . and I'm not gay. OMG!|`|PtfaM7jEaa	i do not know what <br>  <br>  i am a christian and all of my other christian friends say gay marriage is a sin<br>  <br>  but i believe that they have the right to be together and get married if they want.|`|5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	Tolerance should be taught from a young age and the best place to learn that is at home.|`|0a14Mg2kaa	Nothing.  Unless you are an opinionated bigot who is under the delusion that it is your job to tell other people how to live their lives.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	Chances are when parents send their children to school there is a child in their class that has too moms, or dads so they will learn about it anyways!!<br>  <br>   Some people tend to want to believe that if they do not ever mention gay people...or any other "controversial" subject that their kids will never hear of it and be some how surrounded by a bubble and never find out!<br>  <br>  And some actually believe if they hear about gays that the kids will want to be gay too!! lol<br>  <br>  |`|AA11254601	Its not bad for kids to learn about gay marriage.  As much as religious freaks hate to admit it, its part of our culture. <br>  <br>  They don't want kids to learn about it due to the fact that they don't want to send the message that gay marriage is fine with society.  Too many closed minded people exist in the world today.|`|1TtpS6HRaa	it is not. and i can not stress enough how pathetic ans sick the people that vote yes on 8 are. they do not have to "approve" of it (although no one needs peoples approval) but who the hell do they think they are to say that people that love each other can not get married. it is sick and just shows where the world is going. they do not need to like it but they have no right at all to "oppose". just ignore it and do not do it. their kids will have to live in this world meaning sooner or later they will be around a gay person. if you like it or not. i think it would be good to slip gay people in there with not hating someone for race. there is no difference between a racist and a person against gay marriage. if losers have the right tot ake that away from people what is next no interracial couples? why not bring hitler back?as i said it is the same thing as teaching them about the days people had 'slaves'.|`|t64JQ3ataa	well in this day and age this subject is still taboo , my children i have 2 boys and a girl  i will be open in all subject's of life with them and hopefully they will take this and be able to be a true person , if any of my children realise they are gay , lesbian i will Truly Support them and be happy for them , so i think children should be taught about all relationships and also the emotional parts that come with life i think its up to us as parents to teach our children about life!!!! i will be honest with my children so they can come to me with anything .
jNtkhOTVaa	I'm so sorry that you lost your mom.  I can't even begin to imagine how difficult that must be.<br>  Perhaps you can talk to your partner about it and ask them to pass it on to her in a very nice way.  I know that is what I would have to do in that situation.<br>  I love my mother in law too...  But so far I haven't had anyone babysit my son and he is four months old.  The moment someone offers I absolutely panic.  I feel for you.|`|YcoNi8t4aa	If you feel you cant discuss it to her can you discuss it with your partner? he may be the only one to help if you feel so strongly about it.<br>  Get him to talk to her about it and im sure she would understand. she may become a little offended, but just remember she was a mother to at one stage, she may not of gone through the same situation you have but she certainly would have felt partially the same and would understand your wishes, especially if its a first child.<br>  <br>  Good luck and all the best :)<br>  <br>  <br>  oh and tell her that yo are very sorry but it just inst time |`|z1EYe479aa	my mom died of cancer when i was 5months pregnant and it would have been her first grandchild so i can totally relate to you on this one. here is my opinion, this is your baby and i know with loosing my mom it made me more attatched to my baby because she is what got me thru my moms death because i had this little girl to look forward to meeting so i think it creates a closer bond, not to mention your little one is only 3weeks old and im sure you cant get enough of her, here you are carrying her for nine months and after just 3 weeks someone wants to borrow her for a while, no no no. you take her any time you want her. she is your baby and she wants you.i would tell your partners mum that she is still really younge and you arent comfortable leaving her with anyone yet. also that you appreciate her help but with the flu season coming its best that she isnt held so much by everyone besides you. if this is too hard to tell her write her a letter explaining how you need a little more time before you are comfortable with your baby being around everyone and that you will let her know when you are more ready :)|`|Vi0jHbOgaa	I am sorry but you HAVE TO TALK TO HER!

It may be hard on you, and understandably so, but she'll just keep persisting until something is said. And it's important that you don't try to get your partner to do the talking. You don't want to put him in an uncomfortable position between you and his mom. |`|RBtAn3b7aa	Haven't you ever heard that when you get married you also marry his side of the family?<br>  Sorry for your loss of your mum, I know how that goes I lost my mom in October of 2007.<br>  You must sit down and talk to your mother in law, and maybe she's just trying to help..<br>  So don't get to shook for its time.. best of luck|`|U7R151uHaa	When you have your first child it is bloody hard with your partners mom around. With my first she kept saying things like "really he should only be having breast milk" or "I think your holding him wrong". Tell your partner and maybe he should have a word
sYsfI856aa	Oh hun, that doesn't sound like fun.  I'm sure your partner will understand your feelings. For one thing you are pregnant and moods can be difficult. Just ask him to find maybe a couple of hours here or there just to curl up with you, or sit down and have dinner with you if possible. Don't feel like you're being selfish, it sounds as though you don't see him at all. That's not selfish, it's just a normal woman's need to have her love with her once in a while.  I get that way a lot already, my hubby works overnights and sleeps days. We have one boy, and it's hard when I don't get my time with him. <br>  <br>  Maybe take the family to see his dad, go all together so you are at least with him?<br>  <br>  Or maybe try to plan a time where you two can just do something you enjoy together, be it a show you like to watch or even a game you like to play. Sit him down when you get the chance and just tell him that you miss him, and you feel as though you don't see him enough. He should understand. Good luck and I hope you get your time with him, no one should feel lonely.|`|hj1RNiVYaa	well as crazy as it sounds you need to be blunt about telling him you both need some time with eachother. you need to throw it in his face that this is reality if you want a family theres things we need to do and talk about as a family. make him realize that yall have a baby coming soon and he needs to be there.|`|jNtkhOTVaa	You're pregnant, you're stressed out, you already have two other kids to care for.  Your feelings are more than valid.  <br>  <br>  I spent almost my entire pregnancy hiding my moodswings and emotions from my husband just out of sympathy for the poor guy.  But if I were to ask him how he felt about that he would tell me he just wanted the truth rather that make me a crazy pregnant wife, a crying pregnant wife, or whatever wife I was in the mood to be that day.  <br>  <br>  Start with, I love you and I know you're under a lot of stress but...  <br>  <br>  You're being emotionally supportive for him.  Give him the opportunity to offer you the same in return.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Write him, a heartfelt message, showing that you understand everything he is going through.<br>  <br>  Then, Point out, how you feel alone in the pregnancy because he is so busy.  But, Don't be overly critical.|`|Vdq9jfzfaa	Well, personally I feel you're being quite selfish. You partner's father had a life-threatening operation and your concerned about him spending his free time with him after working 12 hour days? That's ridiculous.  His father could potentially die, and it sounds like you're just bored and being snotty.     Your situation is only temporary, give the guy a break. 
mB3pcT57aa	It is done at your GP's by the nurse.<br>  <br>  you have to get the implant yourself from the chemist (your gp will give you perscription).<br>  <br>  The nurse givrs you a local anesthetic in your arm and makes a small cut, the implant is inserted into your arm (dont be alarmed by the sixe of the pack, that is just the device used to insert it).<br>  The small cut is dressed and your done.<br>  <br>  It takes about 10 mins in all.<br>  <br>  To remove it they do the same, a small cut is made and just pulled out (this is a little tender as the implant usually binds to fat cells etc over the 3 year period.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps |`|jD8TxlLfaa	I just got the implant put in in June. First, they had me come in for a consultation, so I could ask any questions I had and they made sure that I really wanted it. They scheduled an appointment for me to have it put in (about a week later). When I came in, they brought me into the room and numbed my arm. Took a bit more numbing stuff to numb my arm, but he gave me enough so I couldn't feel it. The needle is rather large, but you honestly can't feel it at all. All you feel is a tiny bit of pressure. Afterwards they bandage up your arm and tell you to leave it on for a little while. If you're like me, you'll wind up with a huge bruise (I bruise easily). Most people also end up with a tiny scar, but since they put it in on the inside of your arm, you'll hardly even notice it. They'll have you back in for another check-up to make sure it took properly and all that. So far I haven't had any problems with it except for a bit of irregular bleeding.<br>  Hope that helps. :)|`|qygYwdRpaa	Hi the Implant is about the size of a thin matchstick. It contains a hormone called etonorgestrel. Most users have it inserted under the skin of their left upper arm, not far above the elbow.<br>  <br>  The ‘match’ can easily be felt, but it’s not very visible – except to someone who is looking for it. There will be a tiny scar at the point where the device was inserted, but unless something has gone wrong, this shouldn't’t be very visible either.<br>  <br>  Implanon lasts for three years.<br>  <br>  The specially-trained doctor (or nurse) injects a little local anaesthetic into your skin, and then pushes the tiny rod in, using a special needle.<br>  <br>  Because of the local anaesthetic, there should be very little pain. <br>  <br>  Traditionally, the site of insertion has been in your left upper arm (if you’re right-handed), in a groove between two of your muscles. In October 2008, the manufacturer's recommendation was changed. The Implanon should now be put in slightly lower – about 8 to 10 cm above your elbow. <br>  <br>  Generally, the procedure takes no more than three minutes. If you feel OK, you can go home immediately afterwards.<br>  <br>  After the insertion about 3.6 per cent of women, get bruising, swelling, redness or soreness after insertion.<br>  <br>  Ive actually seen one put in, it isnt as bad as it sounds it was fine she was fine and was talking to me the whole time it was very quick |`|pNhS0JsBaa	They numb the skin with an anaesthetic then use a special inserter so that the implant can be put in without touching it - to reduce the risk of infection. When mine was done it felt a little uncomfortable but it didn't really hurt. A drop of blood came out but not much. The anaesthetic stings a bit when it goes in but then that bit of your arm goes numb, a bit like at the dentist (its the same kind of drug). |`|fJaZlJQXaa	With a rather large needle im afraid,the implant is inside the needle,its inserted into your arm and then pulled out with the implant left in your arm.<br>  They do numb your arm 1st though.<br>  And no it doesnt hurt at all,I got mine and didnt feel a thing.|`|6m8ol1H9aa	Why bother with an implant.<br>  Use an aspirin they are cheaper. All you do is hold it between your knees. the best contraceptive going|`|cgk2yefUaa	HI even altho im pregnant just now ( i fell pregnant on the implanon ) this was my 3rd one and i never had any probs with it going in or getting it out a nurse numbs your arm first and its in in about 30 secs honestly doesnt hurt abit i WOULD RECOMMEND it to anyone !! getting it outs a little more awkward just depends the way its been put in but again nothing to worry about and you be fine !!<br>  <br>  Im just unlucky to have have fallen pregnant on implannon but in saying that im getting a lovely baby boy in 9 weeks !!! and i believe everything happens for a reason !!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK <br>  <br>  xxx|`|byvMhyWNaa	visit the following url

However as they were really close together I would definitely advise getting a paternity test when the baby is born.|`|1rFYElOnaa	you know whats so weird? Theres these things called CONDOMS and BIRTH CONTROL PILLS that actually REDUCE the chances of getting pregnant! Yeah, with birth control you can actually take these very small pills and have sex without having to worry about who is your baby's daddy.<br>  <br>  It's really great for girls like you who like to sleep around with different guys.

Sperm live up to `10 days.  <br>  <br>  Do the math.... forever fertile.<br>  <br>  Sweetpea, all of Africa used an ovulation calendar, and the "pull out and pray " method, and the average Kenyan woman has 13 pregnancies, 9 live births.    This is all they have.   BC pills are not available to them, but they are to you thru Planned Parenthood, and free if you are under 18, and they won't tell your parents.<br>  <br>  Are you pregnant?<br>  <br>  Yes.<br>  <br>  Google them + your city for their numbers.

In years to come you can sit back and smile to yourself that you managed just fine...... Blokes love it when women are seeming to be desperate. My ex has left me and im pregnant i wont even take him for child support.... I wont give him the satisfaction of knowing that he has helped me in anyway i think thats the worst insult than anything..... Its not good to be stressed out whilst your pregnant either so just have a good time being pregnant and enjoy it while you can.
