Although he has been "watered down" in the last 20 years or so with mediocre versions with Frank Langella and Gary Oldman, actors like Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, Jack Palance, in IMO the greatest Dracula of all Louis Jourdan show how dangerous, demonic, and powerful the Lord of the Undead could be; with superhuman strength, psychic powers, near invulnerability at night added to control of the elements and shape shifting ability make Dracula a powerful foe indeed:      Question: Would Dracula make a good 3rd supernatural addition to the Freddy and Jason saga;      Question: What modern actor would make the most terrifying and frightening Dracula?  I like Johnny Depp a lot as an actor, but all he would be is Frank Langella redone 20 years later.

20090226160015AAQda2f	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	How do I get better at guitar?	I have all the basics down pretty well. I have been playing a few years and developed good technique. I just really don't know where to go from here. I have good guitars and good amp, but I feel like my equipment is better than I am. I can play most of the songs I see tabs for, but I have problems when trying to play stuff like At the Drive-In, Minus the Bear, and Radiohead by ear. I really want to be a great guitarist, but I'm just not sure what to practice anymore. Is there a certain DVD out there that might help intermediate guitarists? I will be grateful for any advice I receive.

20090226162001AAqzR5o	Entertainment & Music;Television;Other - Television	What show was this? (90s or maybe early 2000s) Kids Show?	When I was little I would always watch this show, and now I can't think of it for the LIFE of me. I've literally been trying to remember for years, because I used to watch it daily.  It would always be on when I ate lunch, and I was addicted to it.  I can barely remember it now though.  It involved this white dog character, though he walked and talked like a human, and wore sweaters and pants, shoes, etc.  I think it was a Scottish dog?  And he would always go places with this professor of his, who may or may not have also been a dog, though I'm pretty sure he always wore glasses. I think the professor also had a British accent (not 100% sure) though if he did I'm not sure that the other characters did. I know there was a best friend to the dog character, though I'm not sure if he was a dog also or not. I remember in one particular episode (vaguely) that they all went to some sort of castle, like a fantasy type thing. I kind of remember there being a dragon in that one, though I'm not sure.  It was an animated show, of course, though it was a more "realistic" type of animation, if you know what I mean.  If you know the title, PLEASE tell me; this has been bothering me for ages, I can't even convey! Haha. Thanks so much for any help you can give(:

Why do you think that is??      I feel it was b/c he had such little promotion. I didn't even know that departure was coming out till I saw it on itunes! Also he came out with only one single before the Cd.       Also there seems to be alot of people who dislike/hate/don't care about jesse.       What factors caused this album to sell so little??

The whole deal––streamers, cakes, presents, party dresses, games. At each party around 20 people have come. I'm not spoiled. Really. My parents plan these parties for me. I just want simplicity. I have always found these big parties to be boring.   I asked my parents to stop, and they agreed for the past 2 years. On my special day, they sang Happy Birthday and gave me a small gift. We had a special dinner, and had cake. This year my mother asked me what I thought about a cruise for my birthday. I turned her down. I don't think my family can do that, considering the economy and such. She recently asked me what I wanted to do. I answered with 'Have a sleepover with friends.' I don't want a big bash with a huge outfit, entrance, etc. I'm not a spoiled brat. I simply want a sleepover.   Here were my ideas, I want to hear yours, too:      1. Spend the night at a hotel w/ 3 friends.      2. See a movie and then come back to my place.      3. Go out to eat, see a movie, my place.      4. Go to a salon for mani's and pedi's.       5. Go to the mall and shop.      I have a few good friends. I don't want them to bring gifts or anything, but just have a good time. Any ideas?

20090226163900AAdUnZV	Entertainment & Music;Television;Other - Television	Help finding a Walkers Crisp TV advert?	This Walkers Crisp TV ad was from about 1997.  Here's a description:      It was a scene involving a family trying to lock their farm down and run to the storm shelter as tornados rush towards.    At one point, the father and son lock up a shed and the son asks 'but dad, what about the prawns?' Dad says: 'never mind the prawns. They can take care of themselves!'.    Then they run to the storm shelter and lock themselves in. But suddenly the roof is pulled off the shelter. The camera - looking down at the family staring up in terror - rushes away into the sky. The house dwindles away until we see it is on a crisp. Held by a woman.    The woman puts the crisp in her mouth. There's a crunch and we hear 'Prawns'. She raises an eyebrow.      Thank you so much!

Verse 1:      I slay any rapper, could be the meanest with vocals   Was always kind of smart, now I'm genius like pro tools   Sleep during the day, so at night I can stalk   Deep out of sight, but don't even need light when I walk   Seemingly I'm nice, but still in your head when yo mind dreams   Then I play Freddy, and murder yo rhyme schemes   When I write, I got the pad locked like domination   So tight, I got em searching for the numbers to the combination   Stop looking it is only reveled when the rhymes spit   Showing up in small portions at a time when the lines hit   Hearing sound in the background, It's drowning me lightly   I feel mad energy like a cipher that's surrounding me tightly   Is there fire in their eyes? I keep catching hot glares   Can't call it, I'm like Dana Dane having nightmares   But I'm awake; I can't shake or break it   Guess my only option left, is to take it         Verse 2:      I'm tired of them trying boast and brag; they can get toast and lag   Dipped in hot coffee and just mostly sag   Took the bag, and up the sleeve I got mad tricks   Houdini style disappear quick like magic   Shakespearean plays I'm tragic   And my thoughts are way too deep to imagine   It's not all the same, I hit the streets no hesitation like David Blaine   Take a look at my feet that's levitation   Magnetic style, out the station with the new school, any old tracks erasing   I'm pacing, hitting more threes than Reggie in Indiana   Never forgetting me, I'm not a one hit wonder like the hammer   But I will hand ya, more L's than Big, not a friend of me   I'm platinum plus, you're the enemy   I pack the tonic so bionic it's kind of ironic   How my skills just slag like Ebonics         Verse 3:      You can catch a freeze from you hero   With ease, on moral combat I'm sub zero   I begin with a fatal style I'm going to win   At the end they yell flawless victory, finish him   But I don't think it's over just yet, I'm to set   To wet, I leak more songs than the internet   Then I return to sender, no surrender   Get it southern fried, copped and skewed like a blender   In a stick now this is how they use him dumb   It gets written, bite, chewed, and spit like chewing gum   Picked up then ABC style's how the selling me   You're telling me, they reciting my words like a spelling bee   But, they need to get off my dick, they don't own me   I'm alone see I've been playing on stations before Sony   For real

I'm a bit of Arthur Holmwood 'cause I thought I'd have a happy ending with my "Lucy." In my case though, Lucy's "death" is symbolic of our breakup.      And I'm a bit of a Dr. Seward. A melodramatic fool, neurotic to the bone, no doubt. And a workaholic.      And a bit of Van Helsing 'cause I'm quite eccentric and like the good Doctor, no one understands.      Or could that be Renfield's attributes?   Mostly, I'm more like Arthur Holmwood and Dr. Seward, though....

20090226180424AAVxZnT	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	How can you tell when Aquarius is still interested?	I haven't seen him since the very end of January and he was acting distant.  Then he would act distant on phone our only three phone conversations this month.  He still replies to my texts if necessary, and the last time I phoned him he didn't reply.  And I am not sure whether or not he is still interested because the attention I am getting from shrinks as time goes by.  We used to contact each other every 3 days or so but this last phone call I sent was done a full week after I last messaged him.  He didn't even invite me to his birthday party.  I have met him in November and since then we have seen each other about 7 times.  He was very affectionate the first 6.  I mean, this month it has been assignment and midterm month for many college students, but if he has time for his friends on the weekends, then what's wrong with me?  So Aquarius men, what do you say about this?

20090226171458AAJFGbc	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Have you seen Coraline?	What did you think about it and how was it in 3D? I live in a small town and our theater couldn't do it in 3D, so what parts were 3D? I read somewhere that it was 3D, but you didn't have to wear the paper glasses. How did it work, because maybe I just missed something.      My thoughts on the movie: I thought it was beautiful and errie and amazing, daring in the fact that it had it's own pace and wasn't going to pander to the "must have action every five seconds" audience. It followed very well with the book (which I read long before the movie came out) and fleshed out that almost bare bones story, while keeping with the feel of the story, which is simply paced and very innocent to begin with but starts decomposing into a darker wonderland full of horror and buttons. Amazing, and scary, too. This is one of those rare occasions where the movie is better than the book. The nearly naked old ladies was highly unnesscery, though.

He was slumped over his desk and a gun was in his hand. There was a cassette recorder on his desk. When the police entered the room and pressed the play button on the tape recorder, they heard, "I can't go on. I have no plans for the Fourth of July, and therefore nothing to live for."

I'm turning 14 this July, and I know it's a little early to be asking this because it's only February, but I tend to change my mind a lot towards my party, so I would like some ideas now to kinda get me started.       Okayy.. Info: Birthday: July. So summer time. We do have a pool. It's one of those blue above ground ones... you know the blow up rim ones? Yeah... we have one of those. Also, we have a pond. It's a little mucky, but it's not too bad to swim in. I'm think of a co-ed party, so boys and girls, and then having the girls sleep over for the night. Mom would kill me if I had the boys sleep over :p      There's a lot of different possibilities. I'm not really into the whole... one theme thing. I like to kinda... wing it. Like... all my friends have a theme, like hawian and Las Vegas.... I'm not into that. Keep that in mind.       I don't want any... 'have a dance' ideas.

What I'm mainly worried about is how long I get to keep the movie...in the FAQ it says: "Once you begin viewing, you have twenty-four (24) hours to view the movie." Does that really mean that if I, say, watch a bit of it then the rest the next day, I won't be able to watch it ever again because the 24 hours are up? That would mean you can't watch it again if you watch it just that one little time...If this really is the case, I don't think that's fair at all.

20090226190745AAWEeaH	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Is anyone else mad with the Black to the future 90s section?	Okay, for those of you who don't know,  VH1 is doing a show called black to the future, doing each decade from 1970s to 2000s, talking about significant black things from each decade. They did a decade each day, and i liked the 70s and 80s episodes, but when they got to the 90s section (which was today) i was pissed off. There are so many great things involving blacks from the 90s, and they showed the stupidest sh*t. They talked about billy blanks, hootie and the blowfish, arsenio hall show, rodney king, million man march, and other sh*t. The only hip hop they mentioned was kid n play, snoop dogg and dr. dre. The only black movie they talked about was Boyz n the hood. I can't believe how much good sh*t they left out! They didn't even talk about 2pac and biggie, and briefly showed TLC. I'm tired of these VH1 shows being biased. Here is some good things they missed:      Juice   Poetic justice   Above the rim   Friday   Set it off   Player's club   Dead presidents   New jack city   SWV   TLC   Biggie    2pac   Comic view   Eddie murphy   The nutty professor   There are no children here   Menace 2 society   The inkwell   Larenz tate   Jada pinkett   BAPS   Woo   Jason's lyric   Bill belamy's how to be a player         The list could go on and on. Just so much stuff they didn't talk about.

20090226183853AALFVCL	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	An 86 year old guy...?	An 86-year-old man went to his doctor for his quarterly check-up.   The doctor asked him how he was feeling, and the   86-year-old said ,"Things are great and I've never felt better.   I now have a 20 year-old bride who is pregnant with my child.   So what do you think about that Doc ?"      The doctor considered his question for a minute and  then began to tell a   story. "I have an older friend , much like you, who is an avid hunter and never   misses a season. One day he was setting off to go hunting. In a bit of a hurry , he   accidentally picked up his walking cane instead of his gun."      "As he neared a lake , he came across a very large male beaver sitting at   the water's edge.  He realized he'd left his gun at home and so he couldn't shoot the   magnificent creature."      "Out of habit he raised his cane , aimed it at the animal as if  it were his   favorite hunting rifle and went 'bang, bang. Miraculously , two shots   rang out and the beaver fell over dead."      Now, what do you think of that ?" asked the doctor.      The 86-year-old said,  "Logic would strongly suggest that somebody else   pumped a couple of rounds into that beaver."      The doctor replied , "My point exactly."

20090226183246AAKwPro	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Are they still filming new episodes of "COPS"?	I see it's on here now in SF with reruns from the late 1980's?? 20 years ago? Was there a cheaper show to produce ever? Hire a camera guy at scale to follow cops around all week and film it? What's that, a couple hundred bucks? Then you edit and produce it.     Are they still making this show? I don't see why not, cheap to produce and filled with action. Personally, i don't like it but are they still making new episodes? I'm sure some cable TV channel would pay for them right?

Would an eternity of looking for a good deal on car insurance be purgatory, with no access to a car or be able to leave the store.      Like in this progressive ad  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGkmJRKA4...       That commercial depicts purgatory for people who never used there resources wisely. No one is told the rules, but the idea is you are stuck until you find the best deal, and the overly chipper girl is the gate keeper. And anyone you try to talk to only talks about insurance.

20090226190957AAZlFvx	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Why do young Scorpio men act like this? How to deal?	I'm a Pisces woman, and I'm attracted to a younger Scorpio man at my university (younger meaning around 20 years of age). The funny part is, I noticed him liking me before I started liking him. It started off with him staring at me lustily from a distance. He would get super jealous when other guys talked to me, and it's obvious because he didn't disguise it well.       It's worth noting that I'm older than this Scorpio, and am an attractive woman who has a career already (I'm still an undergraduate though). I also have a lot of male admirers who genuinely respect me, and who aren't interested in simply getting into my pants. I am not a flirt either, and I make a concentrated effort not to talk to other guys when around this Scorpio.      When I finally did go up this Scorpio and started talking with him, he seemed really enthusiastic and friendly. He wanted to do favors for me and help me out. He acted kind of nervous and jittery around me too, and there were times when he couldn't look me in the eyes.      Then, all of a sudden ... BOOM. This man went completely cold on me. He'll talk to and flirt with any other females on campus but me. He'll only speak to me if I speak to him first, and at best it's a hi-bye conversation. It literally feels like he's trying to run away from me now!       Talk about mixed signals, though ... I constantly catch him staring at me out of the corner of my eye in class, and he always seems on high alert when other guys are around me. WHAT THE HELL DOES THIS GUY WANT FROM ME!? I showed him that I was interested in getting to know him better and he's avoiding me like the plague and trying to make me jealous.       This is hurting me a lot emotionally. Should I bother putting up with these games? I sense that this Scorpio man has powerful feelings for me, especially since he's acting so weird around me.

20090226183427AALlVro	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Help with the name of a movie?	I was really young and saw only a small scene of this strange sci-fi movie so it's difficult for me to remember. There was some sort of makeshift army camp and the main male character was under orders to stay in his tent. The camp was centered around what looked like a large dome or half of a sphere that was sticking out of the ground. It was some type of dimensional barrier. The army men could see the people inside, although to those inside, the barrier didn't exist. The army men saw inside the barrier a family living in a farm-like house in the summer. The kids would play outside and the family would eat dinner, although no one showed much emotion and the family seemed so ideal to the point it was creepy. The army men built an arm to throw ice cubes at the barrier, so if the ice went through they could see that they could also go through. When the ice cube went through, the main character ran out of his tent and into the "other world" and saw that he could not look back and see the camp. He approached a women (mother I think) and introduced himself as seargent (name) of the US Army while pointing to his name tag. She then twisted out her neck and bit him in the chest. More army men enter the place and gunshots can be herd.

20090226191155AAxgb3i	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Pisces and Aquarius as friends?	My music professor, is an Aquarius, she is highly eccentric and really very funny! When some other people, don't get her eccentricity, I understand it quite a bit, as I can be a bit eccentric myself sometimes. Also, we share a common interest...music as it appears. She is really awesome, and I enjoy having conversations with her. She is very logical and she is very intellectual . I understand a lot of her quirks, she is it seems a typical Aquarius. Sometimes it seems as if we may be friends  a lot of the time, then when she draws back a bit, part of being an Aquarius I realize, it seems that we aren't as close. I'm not bothered by this, as when I realize its happening, I then do the same and draw back, and then the next couple of days will be the reverse. Also, only a few people in class actually understand her eccentricity besides me. Its quite funny when some people think the eccentricity becomes too much or is to the point of ridiculous! She also seems to enjoy conversations with me and she does wave at me whenever I don't have her class, if I see her on a day I don't have her class.

He goes to live with his mom, i think in the country. She is very overweight. I can't remember much else about it, but there is a scene where the mom sneaks into the girl's house and starts tearing up her clothing. She's a bit.. crazy. for those of you who haven't figured it out, it's a comedy. thanks so much, i am dying to see this movie but i can't think of the name.
