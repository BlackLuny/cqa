a004e1940e06d7ec5c6e78e2a0536fc6aa	Had my eyes done 27th March 2007. Had the "wave front intralase Lasik" at optical express. Treatment was quick, but a little uncomfortable to begin with, but bearable. You are awake whilst it happens. So don't worry it doesn't hurt. My vision is now 20/20, I am still using eye drops which are supplied. You will have to wear goggles, which are supplied, at bedtime for one week. They stop you rubbing your eyes in your sleep. There is light sensitivity for about a week, but I can now sit out in bright sunlight without sun glasses, which I couldn't do before the surgery. My next follow up appointment is this Saturday.<br>  <br>  I'd send off for their information pack which will tell you all you need to know.  You could even do research over the net. It took me 3 years to make my mind up to have it done, now I wish I'd had it done sooner.|`|QW4V0UhRaa	Actually no, it does not last a  life-time.Your eyes will continue to change as you grow older, and you may need prescription glasses or contacts again at some point. Especially since you say you work with a computer most of the time, that is very damaging to the eyes. There is also a chance that you may need a second surgery if you do not get the right amount of correction the first time. <br>  <br>  The worst part it, for me, is the fact that they put an eye clamp on, and you are not allowed to blink. If you have ever had a staring/no blinking contest, then you should know how hard it is.|`|dAKhemmraa	Laser eye surgery re-shape your lens in your eye this can stop the need for glasses and yes it does last for years but the lens in your eye can alter with the passing of time. It does not hurt at the time but as a rule it is done one eye at a time and 2-3 weeks will pass between surgery for the second eye.|`|sVSyNv8caa	It lasts for life, might not be perfect though :S go see sum specialist guy about it|`|iFXnYdbBaa	my friend had it done a few weeks ago and is absolutely amazed at the results- before she couldnt see the signs on the motorway- now her eyesight is better than mine and i dont have to wear glasses!! she said it does not hurt at all but is a bit uncomfortable because of the eye clamps. She had both eyes done at the same time and they were tender for the rest of that day and the day after- she recommends you take sunglasses with you as afterwards your eyes will be sensitive to the light. <br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  Also, she is paying hers on the drip so if you dont mind doing that then there's no need to wait!!
Sangebynaa	It might be because your mind is going on about something that is either going to happen or that has happened. I am like that  I only get four hours of sleep and that on a good day. I would try doing some writing when your wide awake it might bring out why your still awake. Like someone else said it can be a million different things. But when I REALLY just can't seem to sleep I try eating oatmeal or drinking some hot tea and just think about relaxing and I just let go of all the thing running through my head and heart. I try to say okay I'm done with one thought and then start on another and eventually I'm done with the important things and I get a few hours of sleep. I think that if you can let that one thing go that your thinking of when your awake you'll get good sleep and wake up at a good time and be refreshed.I hope this helps.|`|026407cde2bc8691b34593dbabae7e6eaa	You don't say how old you are.  It could be 100 things wrong and I'm not a doctor to say.  So I recommend seeing a doctor.  You might have a physical problem (thyroids could do this).  You might be depressed.

I've heard testimonies of people that haven't slept more than a couple of hours in any night sleeping a full night's sleep each and every night...

Wernicke on the other hand affects the ability to receive information.  Therefore when something is said to them, they are unable to understand and process that information.  for example if you ask a person with wernicke damage to pass you a spoon, they might pass you the fork.

It is wonderful, there is no pain on this trip to the dentist, they will sit you in a chair and put a mold into your mouth for about 30 seconds, this will make a model of your teeth which they can identify the problem and resolve what braces you need. No pain at all! <br>  <br>  When they actually do put the braces on, do not worry. Your teeth will hurt a bit for the next week, and you won't be able to eat solids. (Your teeth may also feel loose but don't worry this is normal.) After this week your teeth will feel good as new and you will be able to eat once more!

Now let the orthodontist do his job. verbalize any anxieties you have with the staff there so they can help you through it. many have numbing medicine for you gums before they do any evasive procedures. most likely they will fit you for braces or a retainer for a beautiful smile. relax, there is nothing to worry about. Good luck.|`|aceb2ceb4036c8b77ef3a4962513c9d0aa	i hve no idea|`|zNho66nJaa	when i first went there they took pictures of your teeth, and a full head shot of u smiling lol, x-rays..and they determined where ur braces should be and which kind u want such as metal or the clear ones..then they schedule u for your next appointment which is when u get ur braces..or whatever your there for..@ least thats wut happened when i went..dont be nervous! you will have a beautiful smile!|`|AA11805744	they listen to patient concerns, provide an orthodontic examination, indicate whether or not treatment is needed & when the best time to start treatment is, gather orthodontic records, discuss fees, also they take pictures of ur teeth using a cheek expander that goes on ur lips to make ur cheeks go out as far as they'll go w/o breaking..... it hurts
aef56ce1b13b87b86b5069bcf282f166aa	Allora io secondo le prove generali non sono allergica a nulla.<br>  Ho però scoperto da piccola di essere allergica alla componente di un antibiotico, che ora per fortuna non usano più. Non ricordo il nome, ma ce l'ho scritto.<br>  <br>  Le dermatologiche non le ho mai fatte, ho avuto problemi di reazioni allergiche col gesso della lavagna alle medie, poi più nulla...era un'allergia adolescenziale.<br>  <br>  Poi.... io dipingo, e ho una ipersensibilità fastidiosa per chi fa questo lavoro.... sono ipersensibile alla trementina (che sarebbe l'acquaragia rettificata, ed è uno dei principali solventi usati per la pittura ad olio) mi causa difficoltà respiratorie... mi tocca usarla con  la mascherina....<br>  Tutto sommato però, essendo elementi "particolari" (tranne la trementina che per me è molto utile, ma si puo cmq sostituire) mi ritengo abbastanza fortunata.....<br>  <br>  Un mio caro amico invece è allergico al latte e ai suoi derivati (formaggi, ecc) anche in minuscole quantità, e non puo mangiare niente in cui è contenuto (neanke la nutella, il cioccolato al latte, il gelato, o un semplice dolce fatto col latte).<br>  Purtroppo è stata un'allergia tardiva, quindi lui queste cose le ha sentite.

Crescere troppo puliti fa sì che il sistema immunitario sia potenzialmente più propenso a sviluppare anomalie come le allergie.

UpdCjQy1aa	Purtroppo devo comunicarti che l'efficacia del vaccino è legata al fatto di non aver avuto contatti col virus, e quindi è diretto maggiormente alle bambine o le adolescenti che non hanno avuto rapporti...

Q4Ze0Bojaa	Non lo senti affatto, e neanche il tuo lui lo sentira'. E' molto molto comodo, e poi il fatto che rilascia il piu' basso numero di dosi d'ormoni di tutti i contraccettivi che ci sono ora fa si che non senti sbalzi fisici, non ingrassi, ne ti vengono brufoli o cose varie.

0c5Xupi5aa	dont worry about it, picking a scab only removes the blood and platlette clot that forms to trap and prevent bacteria from getting into the new wound.  And dont put anymore of that ointment on it, if it scabbed, its in no risk of getting infected xP<br>  <br>  Creams only slow down the healing process as it kills all your helpful cells that are fixing your body up.  Yay for a super awesome body of self-fixing-up-ness :D<br>  <br>  The new pinkish skin your seeing it the healing skin, the fatty layer as you may think of it, its nothing to worry about.  Plenty of people peel their scabs off.  But if you pull it off to soon it may start bleeding again, so you should at least wait till its very dry and pinches a little when you press on the area around it.<br>  <br>  The link below is a very, down to earth, non-scientifical way of explaining it.

62d39e62fb5d002657b2c8a11e5d5cf5aa	It depends on how severe the fracture is.  It can be a hairline fracture (the bone doesn't completely separate), a severe fracture (the bone actually breaks in two), a compound fracture (the bone breaks and breaks through the skin), or the bone can be completely shattered (all broken up).<br>  <br>  For fractures that aren't severe, you'll be put in a cast.  For fractures that are severe, you may have to have surgery and the bone may have to be screwed or pinned back together, then you will be put in a cast.

It can be just a broken bone, where you'll get a cast after the bone is put into the right posssition to heal. The bone regenerates in the broken area and after some time it's back to normal. If the injury is harder, i.e. an open wound..... it could have some veins or arteries perforated and a hard bleeding if those are some big ones.

VOSGaIANaa	I started the 3-Hour Diet three years ago, lost all of the weight, and have kept it off since.  It is certainly worth trying.  It was the only thing that worked for me.  Grab a copy of the book at your local bookstore or library.  The only thing in the book that I do not agree with is how it downplays the need to exercise.  I exercise 2-3 hours a week (aerobic and weights).  I am able to eat whatever I want to as long as I make sure that I eat every 3 hours during the day.  I usually have to force myself to eat after lunch.  I love not feeling hungry all of the time like I did when I tried weight watchers, Atkins, etc.  Good luck!|`|05268a0a30de7a6ed957ab0117a60b6caa	dont eat anything 3 hours before bedtime.. not even a peanut.. drink loads of water... you will see an immediate weight loss...

If this might be a bad thing, the following applies.<br>  <br>  Get to yoru doctor or a sexual healp clinic IMMEDIATELY.  Ask for the morning after pill and take it as directed.  You must take this within 72 hours of unprotected sex.  You will also have to have blood taken to test for STI's.  No, not all of them will show up this early, but it's a baseline.

You can ovulate during any time in your cycle, so even though it's incredibly rare to ovulate during your period, it can sometimes happen. If you are over 18 (or know someone who is) get to a pharmacy and pick up a dose of the morning after pill. You don't need a prescription, you just need to be 18. It has very few side effects and will not cause an abortion if you are already pregnant. <br>  <br>  It can take 3-5 days after sex for pregnancy to occur (sperm can live in there for a while... they're troopers) so taking the morning after pill within 3, or even 5 days after sex will seriously decrease the chances of getting preggers. Good luck!|`|AA10552909	As it always is, there's a chance you got pregnant.  The fact that you're this worried the day after you screwed around tells me you know darn well you should'a kept your pants on or used protection.

J9oQ8dCYaa	Switch entirely to frozen prepared dinners like Lean Cuisine and salads for lunch and dinner.   Have a smoothie for breakfast that includes orange juice, yogurt and other fruit.  Once you've lost your 10 pounds, go back to eating more dairy and fruit and measure your portions to avoid getting the weight back.<br>  <br>  I like Atkins as well, but after I lost 9 pounds, I just wasn't losing any more!|`|DSeJT4pmaa	normally 10lbs would take about a month to lose. with cardio 4-5times a week and some light weight training. if you lose 10 pounds in 1-2weeks, you'll definately gain unwanted weight back in a blink of an eye. thats why its healthier to lose weight healthly. losing weight fast would only bring bad effects to your body in the near future.|`|AA11932450	Atkins diet.

I rode a stationary bike everyday for about 20-30 after my son was born, and started walking about an hour a day with the stroller when the weather got warmer. <br>  Just try to get in 30 minutes at the least of cardio every day. Doesn't even have to be all at once - 10 minutes here - 10 there. <br>  And please, if you're breastfeeding please make sure you continue to eat well. Don't starve yourself.<br>  Just try to stay motivated. It takes time.|`|F21Pb6jxaa	I will give you three!<br>  1. If you are still breastfeeding, that will help, but you need to start moving as much as possible. Find yourself a nice long hill....not too steep, and walk up it (fairly quickly) with baby in the stroller for 20 minutes a day, then down again. When you feel like you can, go an hour up, and then down. Do this 3 or 4 times a week, you will feel great, and your butt won't jiggle.<br>  2. Cut your (healthy)portion size to the palm of your hand, and eat 6 times a day. <br>  3. And lastly, take whatever your body weight is in pounds, divide it in half, and that is how many ounces of water you must drink per day.|`|cGUI0diBaa	nine months on nine months off. i found when i finished breast feeding i lost 5 kilos! also when your child starts to crawl and walk you are doing incedental exercise ( running after him or her ). that also brings the weight off.|`|ed14c62c0a8bb07cf3d32e06c3da094daa	Ha Ha, you just said your fat, fatty.

ItMKPp0Laa	Just keep working out... you've lost quite a bit of weight and it will take some time for your skin to tighten up. With good exercise it will. The elasticity of the skin allows it to stretch and it takes it a little while for all the skin to recoil.<br>  <br>  Good luck, best wishes and keep up the good work!|`|73508f9c894ee1b94f8e60ea890c9cc1aa	They say that skin will shrink, somewhat, after you lose weight.  Unfortunately, it can take up to a year for excess skin to recede.  If, after a year, the skin has not shrunk completely, you may have to consider a tummy tuck to remove the remaining skin.  In the meantime, using skin creams, particularly ones that contain cocoa butter, will help the skin along in its efforts to heal.  Make sure you keep the area soft and well-lotioned to speed up the process.|`|1J0bmip0aa	well excess skin is stretched skin...so when u lose weight it wont change ur skin since its already stretched out and lost elictisity so id say surgery is the only way to get rid of it....|`|rQwVhfsgaa	what the heck does a stone weigh???

enDggi6Haa	I know how you feel, and make sure you have a goal weight, it's not a g ood idea to say, " how can i lose as much weight as possible" because your a good weight alredy, you don't want to lose much more weight, No more than ten pounds at the max...i'm 5'2'' and 110 pounds, don't go below this weight, or else it will not be healthy for you.....i suggest, eating alot of vegetables, and getting a balanced diet, eat about 6 small meals, instead of 3 big meals, it boosts your metabolism. Don't skip meals, it's dangerous and it slows down your metabolism, slowing down the process of losing weight. if you run every morning or night, it will help you to lose weight all over, exspecially your hips. Do crunches, sit ups and leg raises to help your tummy. and be sure taht you don't eat too many sweets or bad food for you, hope this helped. remember, you don;t have to be skinny to be gorgeous, your at a great weight and don't need to diet, but if you feel unsatisfied with yoru body, then follow those instructions and you shoud be on your way to getting thinner. And 110 should be your MAX goal weight, definatyl don't lose anymroe than that,....and i think asian women can pull off pretty much any hair style, there one of the most gorgeous race of people, goodluck!|`|z69BlgjZaa	weight lifting would be your best bet.  new muscle burns calories 24/7 and will also tone and trim your body.|`|DxkAEqqSaa	I recommend you take “weight loss-30”-a diet supplement made of natural herbs, that will curb your appetite and let you drink a lot of water.

Her skin and hair looked healthy when I would have expected to see some dryness and sagging from that much weight loss. <br>  <br>  She had bought a rebounder (mini-trampoline), kept it in her office as she has work from home business and would get on it at 30 minute or so intervals for anywhere from 3 minutes to 15 minutes, depending on her schedule. On days that she couldn't or didn't get on it that often, she would make time for a single 20 minute session using rebound exercise videos for different moves. I was concerned that it would only exercise the lower part of the body, but it is actually very much a whole body process.<br>  <br>  She looks and feels fabulous and the rebounder is still in her office and very much a part of her daily routine. She bought the one that folds in half so she can store it in the closet if necessary, or under a bed.<br>  <br>  After seeing how much her health had improved, I bought one as well. While not as diligent as she is (yet) I have definitely lost weight and my legs, buttocks and back have really begun to show some definition. I also have a good bit more energy. I have noticed that if I miss a day or so, my energy levels flag. My intention is to rebound daily. I bought mine at Rebound to Health. <br>  <br>  It cost about $200 but is commercial quality and I fully expect it to last me for many years to come.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Denise G

7237ecd730a81f02899b246f10d786b4aa	Hello Socks n Heels,<br>  <br>  I understand how you feel. When I was in college, while I didn't gain the "freshman 15" I did gain the "Junior and Senior 20" thanks to all the rigorous coursework and less time to exercise! :) What really helped me after college was actually understanding how many calories I was burning (on average) and keeping a food diary. It helped me understand the relationships between the foods I was eating and how much I was eating as a result, as well as understanding how much is too much.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, the best thing to do regarding weight loss is to keep yourself "occupied." If you're bored or just sitting around the house, you constantly have access to food and it makes it very difficult to stay away from those temptations. Sometimes it really helps to just go out for a walk and get your mind off things.<br>  <br>  Also, drink plenty of water (probably one of the more under-rated solutions).<br>  <br>  Higher fiber diets, particularly in water soluable fibers which are found mainly in fruits and some vegetables will help keep you "fuller" longer.<br>  <br>  Finally, as I mentioned before, it really helps to know what your metabolic needs are.<br>  <br>  While I'm not advertising this service in anyway, because it's a link to a local California company, this website does provide a free online health calculator which is excellent in calculating your metabolism (in fact, there is even a link to this website from the California Dietetic Association, so it is a very reputable site).<br>  <br>  If you goto: <a href="http://www.nutradvice.com/healthylifestyle/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nutradvice.com/healthylifesty...</a><br>  They have a calculating tool which can help you get a good idea of how many calories you burn and what your nutrition needs are.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and good luck to you!|`|AA11872054	take a walk or go running outside twice a day (day+night), about 1hr for each time.|`|KNm1aboRaa	hey u can try detox diets to loose weight.detox diets is the natural way to loose weight and it really works....<br>  (detoxmedifastdiets.blogspot.com )is a great website that has many links for detox diets recipes and tips to loose weight...try the links  and loose weight fast at home without exercising
AA10484402	NO PILLS OVER THE COUNTER WEIGHT LOSS ARE SAFE  ----------<br>   don't do it you'll gain the weight back|`|bd48356d45ad5fcaa19fb26a6b14a2c1aa	Once you metabolism goes back to normal then the weight will definitely creep back, I have tried loads of these kind of diets and they never help you keep the weight off. Apidex will help you lose weight but it is no where near safe for your blood pressure and heart rate. I have found one where you lose weight steadily/healthily and they teach you how to keep it off, if losing some pounds of any description and inches is what you want then I would suggest you use a diet that is all natural and is rich in protein and vitamins, which is what the FDA recommends.  I used a protein based diet after a friend who had lost a lot of weight with this recommended it to me. All the way through you feel great and energized, you also get great coaching and support along the way. The people are very friendly and gave me lots of great advice. I needed to lose 40 pounds and I did so with no problems. The products really work and you feel great whilst losing weight. I lost all my weight in less than four months and they have helped me to keep it off. I would definitely recommend using them. My sister did this also and lost 76 pounds in five months (She works out, I don’t). There is no pressure and they will even send you a load of free samples so you can try before you buy. The samples were the thing that initially convinced me that this was the right diet for me. You also a get a free complete health consultation with the samples, I just paid the postage and handling, but for what I got it was well worth it. You just go to www.myhealthabc.com to register your details to get the free samples and the free advice etc and then they just call you up and ask you a few questions. It was so easy. Their main site is www.myhealthabcmall.com and you can see all the products and packages and order from their. Its nice to have contact with real people who care about you losing weight and improving your health. I am in better health now than I have ever been thanks to these products and I know that I will continue to keep the weight off with the help I have received. I hope this helps.|`|AA11713235	I took it and lost 50lbs over 3 months. I would take it again.  I found that I gained muscle mass so I am able to keep the weight off.

I am a diet pill expert.  I've been selling different diet pills for years now.  Be careful with Adipex. It is designed to make you lose the weight rapidly, but you must stay on it for at least 3 months.  If you stop before the 3 month period, you will gain it all back.  Try Proactol instead.  It won't make you lose 25lbs in the first month, maybe 10-15lbs.  However the main difference is that it isn't designed to become dependent.  If you only use it for a month, you won't gain the weight back. Here is the site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://track.lativio.com/hit.php?w=109410&p=2&s=38&competition=7&campaign=yahoo" rel="nofollow">http://track.lativio.com/hit.php?w=10941...</a><br>  <br>  As I was saying, there is a difference between Adipex and Proactol because of the weight gain issues.  Now because Proactol doesn't have the weight gaining side effect, it is about $20 more expensive.  However, if you are serious about staying healthy and keeping the weight off, it is worth the extra $20.  Also, Proactol is designed to be most effective in its 3rd month. 72% of average people weighing over 250 lbs lost about 75lbs their 3rd month. Good luck to you!
HnX0kkTZaa	exercise hard and control what u eat!!! Good luck!!!|`|Q37UQuNKaa	Try a cleansing diet!  I did and lost 11 pounds and 21 inches in only 9 days.  I was very happy with the results and continued on the program and lost 29 pounds in 5 weeks.  This is the fastest I have ever lost with other diets like Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Medifast, Slimfast etc…. Cleansing works by removing impurities from your body.  You get impurities from your food (pesticides, preservatives, food additives, colorings) water, chemicals, pollution, medications, alcohol, hormones that the animals you eat were fed etc….YUCK!  The impurites get coated with fat and remain in your body.  To remove the fat, you have to remove the impurites.  This system worked for me, maybe it can work for you too.  You can check out the website or call this toll free number 1-877-587-4647 for more info.  The program is not cheap, but it is worth every penny since it works and keeps you motivated.  Good luck!

It won't harm you, it won't do you any good.and you shouldn't feel guilty at all. but do not do it all the time.and it doesn't oncrease your penis size.<br>  4.6 and 9 inch?! do not worry... it is big enough...!<br>  5.why you want to "make it exfair"?the colour on your penis is according to the colour of your skin. do not try to change it and for gods sake do not put anything on it. not even coconut oil(why you do that???) , just wash it and rinse it well when you take a shower<br>  6.if you are unable to take your foreskin back,well, that is kind of a promblem... you should do a procedure. it is kind of circumcision, it depends on how much you can take the skin down. it is a bit painfull after the procedure (local anesthesia), it takes about 2 weeks up to 2 months to heal. it is not dangerous if it is made by the right doctor.|`|f562EVMoaa	It is controversial over whether or not it has medical benefits but I have heard that it cuts down on UTI's, STD's(including HIV) and Penile Carcinoma(Cancer). I have seen circumcision done on babies several times but I am not sure if the process is the same for older males. I think that for a 15 year old you have a lot of questions that you need answered. If you can't talk to your parents, talk to your doctor- that is what they are for. Size and hair-no hair is a personal preference. I would definitely contact a doctor before you continue your home-made concoctions.|`|g8jCwZA3aa	We like it shaved.

b9ab1d8fe13f7ef56ecd7ffbf9f83cecaa	Bonjour!<br>  Sans être forcément grave une douleur constante est l'indication d'un problème, et parce que les problèmes de dos peuvent être très pénibles et incapacitants (?), il vaut mieux aller chez un médecin, faire une radio (peut-être une vertebre s'est-elle déplacée, ou encore c'est un début d'hernie discale -visible seulement par IRM) et voir un/e physiothérapeute pour de la reéducation (perso, j'adore la methode Méziere, qui prend ton corps comme un tout, et pas que la zone douloureuse), et/ou un/e osthéopathe pour remettre les choses en place (mais pas avant de savoir ce que tu as).<br>  J'ai souffert pendant des années de mal de dos (puis de nuque suite à une chute) et j'ai constaté que c'est directement lié au stress (trop de travail ou de responsabilités par exemple) et le fait d'apprendre à demander de l'aide m'a beaucoup aidé. En effet, j'imagine que comme la plupart des gens qui ont des problèmes de dos, tu refuses de recevoir de l'aide, ou la demande très difficilement. Peut-être aussi t'inquiètes-tu trop pour quelqu'un ou quelque chose (finances, travail...): le dos étant notre "soutien", lorsque l'on y a mal, c'est qu'on ne se sent pas soutenus, ou que l'on veut trop faire. Quoiqu'il en soit, les douleurs physiques sont toujours liées à un état mental, et découvrir cet état "déclancheur" est souvent le départ pour une vraie guérison.<br>  Par rapport à la difference de couleur, tu ne précises pas depuis combien de temps elle est là, c'est peut-être juste les restes d'un "bleu".<br>  Quoiqu'il en soit, sans t'inquieter outre mesure je te conseillerai de consulter, afin de savoir mieux ce qui se passe (si c'est une hernie discale, il vaut mieux arrêter le sport jusqu'à ce qu'elle se résorbe ou durcisse car si elle sort...je te dis pas la douleur, et dans ce cas, pas de sport du tout pendant un looong moment, et là c'est ton moral qui en prend un coup!!!)<br>  Bon courage en tout cas!!!|`|eF4QafmGaa	Mon experience:<br>  <br>  Lorsque la douleur sera un peu apaisEe, decouvrir les tractions verticales.

yhly3ecLaa	Salut,<br>  La biche réagirait possiblement comme réagit une personne phobique des araignées (ou n'importe quelle autre phobie), mise dans une pièce remplies d'araignées :<br>  Panique totale, sécrétion d'adrénaline en particulier  jusqu'à épuisement des réserves d'adrénaline en peut-être 1-2-3 heures. Puis, ces réserves étant épuisées, la personne se surprend "bizarre, je ne panique plus". <br>  Pour que cela fonctionne, il faut que la peur, crainte, angoisse, panique soit suffisamment forte. <br>  Je ne sais pas comment réagit une biche, mais j'imagine de même. Si plein de fauves lui tournent autour, elle va réagir comme tant d'animaux de zoo, qui se rendent compte que l'être humain ma foi n'est pas dangereux et se laissent facilement approcher.<br>  S'il n'y a que de temps en temps un fauve qui passe, la biche va progressiver s'habituer à la présence du prédateur, puisquil ne se passe rien d'inquiétant. Le font de même les animaux sauvages dans des réserves de chasse, dans des parcs naturels. C'est comme l'histoire du chien de Pavlov (conditionnement), mais dans le sens inverse (déconditionnement).<br>  <br>  En cas de stress majeur aigu ou durable, d'autres hormones sont secrétées. Le cortisol augmente le taux de sucre dans le sang, utile donc pour une réaction de fuite, pour avoir des réserves d'énergie suffisantes, que ce soit chez l'humain ou chez l'animal j'imagine (ex : hormone très utilisée comme doping dans les années 70-80). Chez l'être humain le stress est un des facteurs favorisants à long terme (dizaines d'années) les infarctus du myocarde. J'imagine par le même phénomène que l'excès de sucre d? au diabète qui a aussi cet effet.<br>  <br>  Des maladies spécifiquement liées au cortisol, ou aux glandes surrénales qui produisent les corticoides ne me sont pas connues.  (Excepté bien s?r les maladies classiques liées à un excès ou insuffisance de production de cortico?des)<br>  <br>  Pour les maladies auto-immunes : personne ne sait d'où cela provient. Par un raisonnement simple et probablement simpliste (l'être humain est tellement complexe ; le lien est tellement "logique" que mille chercheurs ont tu d? y penser).<br>  La cortisone à bonne dose (dose thérapeutique, par exemple dans la sclérose en plaque, des doses bien ou énormément supérieures à ce que le corps peut produire) a un effet immunosupresseur, et est le traitement classique des maladies auto-immunes. <br>  Un raisonnement simple serait donc : plus de stress --> production augmentée de cortisol --> augmentation de l'effet immunosupresseur --> diminution des maladies autoimmunes.<br>  En pratique cela reste je pense sans aucun effet, notamment en raison de doses bien trop faibles de cortisol que le corps est capable de produire. <br>  Par ailleurs, la nature met en place systématiquement des choses utiles. Les maladies autoimmunes (le corps qui s'attaque lui-même) comme les maladies allergiques semblement en forte augementation, n'étaient peut-être pas ou très peu présentes chez nos lointains ancêtres, c'est-à-dire n'était probablement pas une menace pour la survie de l'espèce. <br>  Empêcher un phénomène peu gênant par un phénomène gênant (stress), n'aurait pas de sens. Le stress diminue par exemple la libido, ce qui va à l'encontre de la survie de l'espèce. Ce phénomène a tout son sens : faire l'amour / se reproduire alors que l'ours / le prédateur r?de : nos ancêtre ou les animaux ont bien plus de risques de se faire bouffer.<br>  <br>  Voilà. Je n'ai pas fait une recherche de littérature, ma réponse n'est donc pas validée scientifiquement. Je me suis basé sur les connaissances que j'ai + quand un pénomène est méconnu, je me demande "à quoi cela aurait-il pu servir à nos ancêtres" : tellement souvent on trouve une explication simple et logique.|`|2806Z8zmaa	Elle fermerait les yeux et le problème est réglé !

jR5kvXgeaa	the only fat burning exercise is cardio - burns fat all over your body - we cant choose which body parts to lose fat off - do it 4-6 times a week for 30-50min (ideally 45min because the first 20-30min body burns carbs and only then starts burning fat) - those are running, jogging, spinning, swimming, elliptical, rope jumping etc. and combine it with light weight training to tone up instead of losing muscle (cardio burns both - fat and muscle).<br>  sit ups and crunches wont help - they only build muscle, they do not burn fat and will make your belly look even bigger.|`|AA10672538	There is no way to target weight loss to a specific area of the body because your body decides where it wants to put on weight and where it wants to take it off. The midsection is a common "problem" area for many people.<br>  <br>  The best way to lose fat is through cardiovascular exercise. It is important to do a variety of abdominal exercises (including crunches) to keep your core strong, but until that excess fat is gone, you will not see the muscle definition. So if you’re not doing cardio, crunches are not going to help get the six-pack you’ve been hoping for. Regular cardio exercise at a level that’s challenging for you is your best bet.|`|4carwzZMaa	I answered a similar question a few days ago, asked by a girl.

uSwUEBgqaa	Saltare con la corda è un ottimo esercizio, in particolare per coordinazione e respirazione. Non a caso viene molto praticato dai pugili, che devono avere una bella resistenza sul ring...<br>  Pare possa far bruciare fino a 200 calorie in un solo quarto d'ora... ma sfido chiunque a reggere un quarto d'ora ininterrottamente saltando la corda!<br>  Comunque, qui potrai trovare qualche notizia in più: <a href="http://www.bellezza.it/donne/fit/obietti/dfitsalt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellezza.it/donne/fit/obietti...</a><br>  Ricorda che, come qualsiasi altra attività fisica, soltanto praticando con costanza si otterranno risultati. Se pensi di far tre salti e dimagrire come per magia, ti sbagli di grosso...<br>  Stai attenta all'alimentazione e salta, salta, salta!<br>  Un ultimo consiglio: quando salti, fai attenzione sia alla posizione della tua schiena - che deve essere ben dritta, con addominali tesi - sia a come poggi i piedi a terra.<br>  Ciao!|`|35gokzN9aa	serve... ciao|`|3u6hBB03aa	è sempre un esercizio fisico quindi si,però non si puo fare solo una cosa e sperare di dimagrire e rassodare in 3 giorni,serve cmq altro esercizio fisico combinato con una dieta salutare...|`|Szl8IGmmaa	Si è vero, saltare la corda aiuta, ma secondo me non è il miglior esercizio per consumare i grassi. Il problema è protrarre l'esecuzione per un tempo sufficientemente lungo.<br>  Infatti l'esecuzione è piuttosto faticosa ed è difficile mantenere il battito all'interno della fascia lipolitica saltando la corda. Dopo pochi minuti il battito va già alle stelle e se per consumare grassi è opportuno rimanere entro una certa soglia per un tempo di almeno 35-40 minuti, ne risulta che saltare la corda non è precisamente l'allenamento più corretto.<br>  Si ottengono più risultati con 30 minuti corsa blanda un giorno si e uno no, piuttosto che saltando 15 minuti la corda tutti i giorni.<br>  Sicuramente aiuta a tonificare i muscoli delle gambe, specie dei polpacci, e fa fare "fiato".

38b0f98e8dae75fc1a4b8cac73107172aa	Well running is great for overall cardiovascular activity but you should do exercises that target the inner thighs. I know of a couple if you go to the gym you can work on the inner thigh machine (seated hip adduction) or you can do pirouette with weights. It is important to the outside of your inner thighs also! I also found out that lateral step up works also. If you start lifting weights for your legs you will see a difference.  I have provided links below of thigh exercises that you can do at home. I hope this helps ya and good luck the inner thighs are tough ones.

AA11834237	I just finished using crest white strips for 7 days.<br>  <br>  The box does not prohibit you from using it more than twice a day, but the stain used to whiten your teeth may temporarily make your teeth feel sore, stingy, or hurt. <br>  <br>  In either case, make sure you wear the strips for at least 30 minutes.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	i think that it clearly says no.  this is very harsh to your teeth.|`|577c65badc4c3c922a9ed289ba83e4a6aa	All of I know of the product is from what I see on the tv commercials and from using whitening gels and toothpastes myself.  For anything to whiten it would need some form of bleach in it.  Probably what little is in there won't hurt you internally, but I'd be carefull if I were you since they say not to eat the toothpaste, so why would you swallow the mixture from the whitestrips I don't know, so it doesn't sound right to me and I'd stay away from those.  But it's up to you which whitener you choose.  I do know that using too much whitener or too often will loosen your fillings which may break the teeth and then you'd need a root canal and tooth replacement.  This happened to me because of the whitener I was using.<br>  An occasional use of teeth whitener is fine, just don't overdo it or leave it on long.|`|F7x1cNVIaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  You can get very useful info related your query from <a href="http://www.dentalcareonline.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.dentalcareonline.info</a> .

You are taking a huge change on creating sensitivity issues by over using Crest White Strips, it is better to either extend the length of time you wear them, or wear them prior to going to bed (taking them off obviously at bedtime) or  using a second treatment after you have seen the initial results from the first kit.  <br>  Either way, to over-use any whitening products can increase your sensitivity to hot and cold, not a good thing, and not a lot of fun. Also new reports show that whitening product cause teeth to fracture easier as well.|`|znklOTRvaa	Only use them twice  a day.  They will not get your teeth any whiter any faster by using them more often.  And yes, it will make your gums sore and possibly take some enamel off of your teeth (not good).

W4whHKmxaa	You already know, there are many different causes<br>  of liver disease.  <br>  However, it depends alot on how old the person is,<br>  how much of the liver is cirrhosed, how fast the cirrhosis<br>  can or will advanced, how the liver responds to <br>  treatment,  how long they have had this disease, if they<br>  have other illness or disease along with this one, if<br>  their liver is able to still function and do all the things<br>  it once did to keep the body healthy, if they have good<br>  support with family and friends, etc.<br>  The doctor can give you an estimated guess depending<br>  on your past and present medical history, your other<br>  conditions, your blood work and films that are taken,<br>  if you had the top test known as the liver biopsy, and<br>  if he sees you are following his orders and accepting<br>  the treatment that is available.    <br>  I added the support of family and friends, cause people<br>  who have no one tend to give up alot faster than those<br>  who have people who love them and help them through<br>  the touch times.  <br>  There is so much to take into consideration, that no<br>  one here could really tell you this estimate but a doctor<br>  who knows more about this disease and that is<br>  a Hepatologist, or maybe a gastroenterologist.  <br>  Wish I could be of more help to you.  <br>  <br>  I can give you some of the signs that show you may<br>  be in the last stage of this disease, though.  <br>  Having Jaundice, which is yellowing of the white of<br>  the eyes and skin.  Having trouble remembering things<br>  or thinking clearly, this is known as encephaolopathy and<br>  it may take someone else to point this out to you...patients<br>  don't normally know this is occurring.  Having an<br>  enlarged abdomen brought on because the liver isn't<br>  able to produce enough protein, known as Albumin and<br>  this causes fluid to leak from the vessels and collect<br>  in the abdomen.  Having another kind of fluid known<br>  as edema, where the legs and feet may swell because<br>  the body is now holding onto sodium.  <br>  Here is a link to an article on cirrhosis which may <br>  answer more question for you, there are more than one<br>  page.  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cirrhosis/DS00373" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cirrhos...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/cirrhosis/article_em.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/cirrhosis...</a>|`|cKqskv06aa	It depends on the extent of damage and the liver can regenerate itself to a degree.  Cirrhosis is like scarring or permanent damage that won't regenerate.  If this doesn't get worse, a person could live a normal life span.  Anything that further damages the liver - and most drugs (medications) and many other things are metabolized in the liver - is not good, but essentially, the doctors will be watching liver function and over time, they may see improvement or not.  I know a guy who is likely to beat liver cancer, so don't lose hope.

PDGTyLbkaa	It may seem too obvious, but have you been to see a doctor yet? I thought I had a sty once and it was something else that was clogged, so my doctor drained it for me. Even if yours is a sty, a qualified medical professional might have some advice outside of compresses.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|7J8jYIe4aa	Well you were doing the right thing by putting on the warm compresses. But since it has been a month you may want to go to the doctor, it may not even be a sty so I would go just in case they might prescribe antibiotics. If you don't want to do that than I suggest you go to your local drug store and ask the pharmacist if there is any over the counter creams or medication you can use. Good luck|`|M2h3JF7Zaa	no that doesn't sound normal for a sty, i'd make an appointment to have your doctor look at it.

ciz0qYwnaa	I don't think it's enough if you're trying to gain weight (don't worry, I understand, I'm recovering from anorexia). Maybe you should opt for an English muffin with peanut butter and jam (260 calories if you put in the right amounts). It's healthy and yummy, and you'll learn to love food again easily with it : )|`|mTwn8p79aa	I agree with the other answer that said that's not enough calories for someone who's 5'8" and 110 lbs.  You're still dangerously underweight.  Think about adding a bagel to that breakfast.  You'll need more than 240 calories for breakfast to actually get into a stage of recovery.|`|1tjJPHpMaa	Sounds good, but if you were going for super healthy than you could have traded splenda for honey or even real sugar. You could also add a little yogurt for a bit larger of a breakfast. But, since you are recovering from an eating disorder I can understand.|`|AA11476749	It looks like a very satisfactory breakfast.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you stay away from the Spenda, and use real sugar.  Artificial sweeteners aren't all that good for you.|`|77afc9c6ef5c9139b7b20cfeb0ffb2bbaa	u oughta be eating around 1800 or plus cals a day, so split em into 5-6 meals which means 300 cal per meal.  that breakfast s extremely healthy but a bit low in calories|`|xvvlYuNtaa	yup|`|HOdvH2c1aa	Sounds healthy if you're trying to lose weight; although I don't like skim milk, 2% is okay.

GfR2qdyiaa	for the intro I would say how far we have come from a disease that gave a death sentence in the early 80's to a managable disease now thanks to science and research.|`|V1rItCajaa	HIV-Aids is a world-wide spreading, life taking virus as we all know it. Although the treatments have been helping to pro-long lives, still there is no known cure for the HIV-Aids virus.<br>  <br>  <br>  u can use that- lol just keep doing with about 2-4 more sentences, but try to make it positive, but showing the negative side as well.. like how i said treatments are becoming better, but there is no cure.. blah blah blah<br>  <br>  then maybe try to find out on google how many ppl have died from it, an how many ppl have it- and include that in the intro as well..
af5c3a383754171b0788539f8e9a52d4aa	well you have admitted the fact that you don't like your life, so now you have to break it down day by day, look at what you don't like about it, and change it, see your life as a picture, the canvas represents your family or loved ones, then the rest is up to you...you can put in the picture what you want, then try to make it a reality, firstly, I would ask my friends or teachers etc, what they would put in their picture. give it a go<br>  <br>  sometimes we have to go through life, experiencing nice things, & then the difficult things, and it can feel as though we are wading through treacle at times (struggling, and getting nowhere fast), this is apart of life... if life was easy.. it would be called easy... <br>  <br>  change what it is you don't like, and by that i don't mean scrap everything that annoys you... what i mean is.. look at how YOU can do things differently.. trying to change things to my own desire..  can lead to frustration, adjust yourself to what is, change your picture of you, realise that you can.|`|12dc3bb1a76b53ab3dd45fea87f4b78baa	Yeah you need to tell us why?|`|rphHEkr1aa	Change the things you don't like.  (may be easier said than done say if you are a minor and mostly under the contro of your parents)  in that case change the things you can and have heart knowing that one day you will have complete control over everything in your life.  Then set goals to accomplish that more quickly.|`|W4k5WrDUaa	Begin by thinking positively.  Instead of focusing on all the things that seem to be going wrong, focus on all the good.  For example your good friends and family.  What I do when i'm upset is go SHOPPING haha it always makes me feel better, but if your on a budget and have a dog, lay down, relax and watch a movie with it...dogs always make people feel better for some reason lol.  What could also help is have a girls night out with your chick-friends.  If your having trouble with friends try going out with someone in your family that your close with.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help, and hope you feel better!<br>  <br>  =)|`|Hhwzp6Iwaa	Sweetheart you ended your notes with I've tried.  You listed everything on their but forgot the most important thing.  The Main Ingredient.  Jesus Christ.  Have you tried him?  Have you opened up to him and asked him to forgive you of your sins and repent?  Have you talked to him and walked in faith, but not by sight?  Have you committed yourself to the Lord who loves you more than any other human being will?  You are of God and not of the World, so that means that what you are of Loves you and will be there for you and what you are not of which is the world wants to see you fail and give up.  The Enemy(Satan) wants you to feel unloved, unappreciated, not wanted and can't do anything so that you will destroy yourself.  I don't want to see that happen.  Think about your daughter.  She is counting on you.  You are a strong mother who has alot going for her but you just need some motivation.  If you need a friend I am here for you and will be more than happy to mentor you and show you the great things that God will do in your life if you put your trust and faith into him.  This is what he wants.  Sometimes he takes us through the trenches so that we can see for ourselves that we can not do it without him.  This is a blessing from the Lord who loves unconditionally.  Don't give up.  Fight off the Enemy and tell him he almost had you but it won't happen and commit your self to Jesus Christ and live a happy and joyful life.  Trust me it will happen.  The road will not always be smooth but if you know God has got your back and you are united with one you will be unstoppable.  God Bless.  Let me know if you need anything.  There is a great man that I know and would like for you to meet.  His name is Jesus Christ.  Our Lord and Savior for Eternity.|`|JLKVewk3aa	To make yourself happy, you need to first find out your true identity.

You'll realize your life isn't that bad. Or how bad it could be. Life is hard. Struggles produce perseverance, perseverance produces character, character produces faith, and faith produces hope.

Either join a club, take a class, volunteer, get a job or find SOMETHING that you are forced to do, at a certain time, preferably every day.  Then get a hobby.  Either something physical ... or creative ... something FUN!  Tell yourself, every Monday (the day that you're not doing above) I'm going to ... paint a picture, roller blade around the block, whatever!   Also, listening to happy music really helps to boost your mood.  Keep your favorite radio station on, as much as possible.  I hope these ideas help.  I hate to hear you say you hate your life.  Things WILL get better, you just need to help things along.  Take Care!  <3   P.S.

xt677EEwaa	You can't really wait until Tuesday, either contact NHS Direct or contact your GPs out of hour service (on call care). Antibiotics are a must for UTIs, no home remedies will cure it.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  No, cranberry juice will have not curative measures on a UTI which is already established. <br>  <br>  This cranberry juice crap annoys me. It's won't cure an existing UTI and there is very little evidence to suggest that it prevents one from occurring either. If you call your surgery today, it will be shut but there should be a recorded message giving you the number of on- call care. Give them a ring please. <br>  <br>  If you chose to leave a UTI, it can ascend the ureters, lead to a kidney infection and if that's left untreated it can cause scaring to the kidneys and even enter the blood stream- causing septicaemia which can of course be fatal.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	This is considered urgent/emergent. you'll need an anti-biotic. if you don't go to the emergency room at the hospital you risk having that infection go to the kidneys. It is more difficult to treat a kidney infection. you can go to a pharmacy and ask for pyridium.  You can buy that without a doctors order. the pyridium does not treat your infection. it reduces the the bladder spasms and urinary burning. you may find it by it's trade name AZO. ( that is in the US)|`|zC8xLn8caa	I agree -- you need to call around, and see if there is a pharmacy or hospital that can get you some antibiotics. That will help ease the burn, but also keep it from spreading to your kidneys, which is a possibility if you wait too long.<br>  <br>  Until then, drink lots of cranberry juice -- not that cranberry juice 'cocktail' stuff, which usually only has a small amount of cranberry for flavoring (and is mostly grape juice), or fake cranberry juice. I mean the real, tart, make-your-lips-shrivel 100% cranberry juice that you'll probably need to add a little sugar to, to make it drinkable. (Consider: If it does that to your mouth, you can bet the bacteria in your bladder don't like it much, either!)  <br>  <br>  I've discovered that while it's not cheap, it will help while you wait for the antibiotics to work.

The medicines should not be stopped till the infection is cleared completely.<br>  <br>  <br>  The most important method of preventing such infections is to practice good personal hygiene. Always wipe from front to back after a bowel movement or urination and keep the skin around the anal region clean.<br>  <br>  Drinking plenty of fluids each day also helps in flushing the bacteria out of the urinary system.<br>  <br>  Empty the bladder as soon as the urge to urinate occurs.<br>  <br>  Taking of foods rich in Vitamin C such citrus fruits and juices helps to reduce the number of bacteria that might be harmful to the urinary tract.|`|HP1pToMOaa	All the UK supermarkets sell sachets of cystitis powders. these work really well as they take away the burning.

ghLqQVMaaa	Ce n'est pas douloureux du tout, il faut juste quelques jours d'adaptation. Ceci dit, tu peux en porter à condition que tes yeux les supportent, mais ne t'inquiète pas pour cela, la première fois que tu essaira, l'opticien t'aidera à mettre les lentilles, tu ira te ballader quelques heures avant de retourner le voir pour savoir si tes yeux les tolèrent.<br>  Ensuite, tu devra prendre RDV chez l'ophtalmo tous les ans pour le renouvellement de l'ordonnance, ce qui est obligatoire. Mais bon d'un c?té, ce n'est pas plus mal, au moins ta vision est suivie de près.<br>  <br>  Tu as différent type de lentilles, les rigides, non jetables, et les souples, jetables que tu dois changer soit tous les jours, soit tout les 15 jours, soit tous les mois. <br>  Je te conseille les souples qui sont beaucoup plus agréables à porter. Au départ, j'avais de mensuelles, il m'arrivait parfois de les sentir un peu et elles finissaient par picoter les yeux avant que je ne les change, puis je suis passée à 15 jours et là, plus aucun soucis.<br>  <br>  La première fois que j'en ai mis, j'ai eu l'impression de voir la vie autrement, ?a faisait tout dr?le de ne plus avoir d'écran de verre devant mes yeux!!! Je devais avoir 18 - 19 ans et ma vue n'a plus rebaissé depuis (c'est sans doute le fait de les garder toute la journée, contrairement aux lunettes que je ne mettais pas toujours!).<br>  <br>  Par contre je te conseille tout de même de te faire faire une paire de lunette de secours, indispensable si tu conduis et surtout, si comme moi, tu oublie de racheter une paire de lentille donc te retrouve sans rien pendant une semaine, le temps que l'opticien soit livré!!<br>  <br>  Niveau mutuelle, tout dépend de ce qu'elle couvre niveau optique, pour ma part, j'ai un forfait mutuelle optique de 190€ /  an, donc la totalité est remboursée, je précise que je porte des lentilles souple jetables.<br>  <br>  Le petit inconvénient, qui n'en est plus un avec l'habitude, c'est qu'il faut avoir une hygyène irréprochable, c'est à dire nettoyer correctement tes lentilles, ne pas les garder plus longtemps qu'il ne le faut, car cela reste un corps étranger. Il est également conseillé de les mettre de temps en temps de c?té et de reprendre ses bonnes vieilles lunettes pour faire respirer un peu les yeux. En général, je les enlève une fois rentrée chez moi après le boulot et il est rare que je les porte le week end.|`|533d08b5ea98aba8dc66a450222db749aa	Tout dépend de ton type de défaut, tu devrais en parler avec ton ophtalmo, il te conseillera sur le type de lentilles qui te conviendra le mieux.<br>  Il existe 2 types de lentilles : les souples et les rigides. Les rigides sont celles qui respectent le mieux la physiologie de l'oeil, mais elles sont plus difficiles à supporter au début.<br>  Il faut respecter les règles d'hygiène et d'entretien sinon bonjour les problèmes type ulcères, abcès, ....|`|7BEVkc6faa	les yeux c'est precieux alors a toi de voir|`|8d982c01b251c2426263a58774566707aa	Bien maintenant.|`|DJv5lgYXaa	Personnellement je porte des lentilles depuis 20 ans et je trouve que c'est une des plus belles inventions du monde.<br>  <br>  Ce n'est pas douloureux du tout, il faut juste trouver le bon modèle si je peux dire ainsi, il y a plusieurs marque de lentilles certaines ne font pas à tout le monde il faut en essayer pour trouver le confort idéal.<br>  <br>  C'est plus cher que des lunettes mais tout dépend du type de lentilles que tu auras besoin certains sont moins dispendieux que d'autres.<br>  <br>  Il y a des jetables au jour, aux deux semaines, au moins, etc...<br>  Tu dois prendre des jetables au mois max parce que ?a évite des dépots sur les lentilles et les risques d'infection.<br>  <br>  Je ne reviendrai pas aux lunette pour rien au monde, essaye-le et tu ne pourras plus t'en passer.|`|KIvxSCYUaa	je suis une ancienne porteuse de lentilles. j'ai arrêté d' en porté pour plusieurs raisons : les produits d'entretien ne sont pas fiables, les lentilles restent un corps étranger et l'oeil ne peut pas respirer normalement, et le prix (tu as intérêt à avoir une bonne mutuelle). maintenant c'est vrai qu'avec des lentilles tu as un certain confort et surtout tu n'a plus les contraintes des lunettes ! mais personnellement je préfère garder mes yeux en bonne santé.|`|UYprqICVaa	Au debut ca va te faire bizarre mais on s'habitue vite au confort des lentilles.<br>  Pour ma part je suis tres contente du changement.<br>  Il m'arrive parfois d'avoir de legers picotements (surtout a la fin du mois, vu que je porte des lentilles mensuelles).

QzGFksSoaa	Le médicament pour les hyperactifs est une amphétamine. L'hypothèse serait que les hyperactifs manquent de cette amphète présente naturellement dans le corps et que ce serait la raison pour laquelle on obtiendrait l'effet inverse des amphétamines et donc une meilleure concentration.<br>  <br>  Car les amphétamines ont comme effet de "booster" les gens, mais la concentration sur des cours me semble difficile tant l'esprit va d'idée en idée et tant la tranquillité physique est pénible sous amphétamine. Enfin, si ce médicament était si efficace pour tout le monde, on en donnerait aux traumatisés craniens  et victimes d'AVC qui ont tous des problèmes de concentrations, pourtant on est bien impuissant encore vis-à-vis de ces patients.<br>  <br>  Bref, tout cela pour dire que si les étudiants américains prennent de la ritaline pour les examens, c'est pas s?r que ?a les aide.<br>  <br>  Pour répondre à ta question, la vente des médicaments est extrêmement contr?lée ici, et la ritaline plus que les autres : les ordonnances ne peuvent se faire qu'à l'h?pital et le médicament n'est délivré que sur ordonnance à la pharmacie de l'h?pital. C'est donc très difficile de s'en procurer, et d'autant plus pour des gens qui n'en ont pas besoin.<br>  Le phénomène doit donc rester très marginal en France et je n'ai jamais eu vent de telles pratiques dans mes connaissances.|`|ZhH1bQ22aa	NOn moi je ne sais pas loooooooooh|`|f42b4e9b5baf108ec9b9ce16d1372444aa	L'utilisation des amphéts pour la concentration ne me semble pas très appropriée.

The secret with sleep is quality rather than quantity - 5 hours good sleep is better than 8 hours light or disturbed sleep - are you waking up during the night? Don't watch TV for two hours before bed, read a little but nothing too exciting (no scary books!) Your last meal before bed should be more carbohydrate than protein (pasta is great) Get up at the same time every day (yes even weekends!) whether you're tired or not.

Whenever people feel threatened and anxious, their minds try to cope with the situation. Having nightmares is actually a good sign that you are struggling to make sense of the horrific situation. It's the brain's way of attempting to accept the unacceptable. You might have dream replays of the traumatic event or other nightmares in which you or loved ones are hurt or in danger.<br>  <br>  1-You cannot change what has happened, but you can change your dreams about it.<br>  <br>  2-Start by changing any nightmare in some small way for the better.<br>  <br>  3-Use your imagination to prepare for better dreams.<br>  <br>  In the drowsy period before you fall asleep, picture your usual dream scenario. Now picture it changing for the better. Visualize what you could do to improve the dream. Find the lost dog. Break free from the kidnapper. Make telephone contact with rescuers. Make the dream better.<br>  <br>  You have many more options in your dreams than you know.<br>  <br>  What you do in your dreams makes a difference, just as it does in waking life. By changing your dream behavior you are improving your life skills.<br>  <br>  Each nightmare you can change for the better is a step toward recovery from trauma.<br>  <br>  Your dreams are an inner resource that can lead you through difficult times. <br>  Use them|`|HvnFTNmCaa	I can relate, I was in a house fire, not everybody made it out alive. From time to time I have bad dream of waking up in that house. I sometimes fall asleep to the tv as the sounds sometimes carry over to my dreams. <br>  <br>  At best all I can really suggest seeing somebody about this. Even if you are not a fan of counselors, sometimes its good talk to somebody...<br>  <br>  I wish you luck my friend....|`|aSWOtchuaa	Unfortunately there is no quick fix for your nightmares.  I suggest seeing a therapist or counsellor to help you deal with the issues you have had previously in your life.  When you can unload your feelings to someone who doesn't judge you and can guide you to feel better it makes a world of difference.<br>  <br>  You can also not eat anything close to your bedtime.  Go to bed a bit earlier and spend some time reading and relaxing.  Getting a good sleep routine will help get rid of the nightmares as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11621397	I used to have bad nightmares. I couldn't stand them they were so vivid and terrifying.I learned a method that before I go to sleep I tell myself "No nightmares" it's like a mental note that I will not dream about nightmares. Dream catchers are a native American belief that bad dreams will be caught in the dream catcher weave of strings while good dreams come through. Visualize and say to yourself "No more nightmares' it may sound unrealistic but don't underestimate the power of the mind.|`|x7p1hwXpaa	i have delt with much nightmares. i found two things help. when you are having a nightmare , usually you know that that is what it is. try to scream as loud as you can. if that causes you to make a noise for real it may wake you up. ( myself , im a light sleeper so it wakes me up) then before you go back to sleep, think about what was hapening and figure out what you need to fix it. such as , someone is chasing you. go back into your dream with a weapon.( not a real one) you have to keep in mind that it is only a dream and in that sence .. you have the power to change it. works for me.|`|66e13f4cab398aa4b945e6be872e4aa4aa	Usually the reason someone has nightmares is that your mind is screaming at you to deal with something!!! Think it through and see if maybe you have some unresolved issues either with yourself, someone else or something! Once you figure out how to deal with it and get past it you should start having better dreams. Keep a dream journal and write everything you can remember even if it seems like its the same dream, even little details can be significant. Then read it over to see if something clicks or helps you to realize the issue. Hope this helps a bit !!!|`|5fhlVgoMaa	you could look into lucid dreaming?<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  im not sure if your familiar with it, but it allows you to control your dreams. so whenever your back in prison, you can open the door and just walk out, or whenever your being chased, you can just turn around and jack the guy in the face.<br>  <br>  and over time, the things that scare you in your dreams will fade away.<br>  <br>  you can get books and stuff on techniques and such|`|aF1tKzJlaa	Eventually, you will have to deal with what happened to you.  You will need to see a therapist or counselor.<br>  <br>  However, if you have a doctor to see, he or she may be able to give you some Neurontin, it's a medication used for seizures, nerve pain, and mood disorders, but it's also known to help reduce nightmares.  Of course, you will have to talk to your doctor about it because you need a prescription for it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps some.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://anxiety.today.com" rel="nofollow">http://anxiety.today.com</a>|`|gqLkbLqMaa	I think what you need to do is to talk to a professional councelor. You need to work through your trust issues before you can work on getting rid of your nightmares because that could be the root of your nightmares.|`|1ZyyNCeTaa	You attend religious discourses and read books of great men of the world.  Don't see such movies or scenes which are of such types go to sleep early and before going to sleep take feet bath and get up early in the morning.

It puts you at peace.|`|6vZ0nRplaa	You have to deal with those thoughts sometime. After you have processed them in your mind, they will go away.|`|lSRl6cbYaa	you could try a dream catcher it works for me|`|rR2GYsAMaa	watch cartoons before you go to sleep. But usually your mind will think about what trobles you most.|`|SJmtCc1kaa	Unfortunately, nightmares usually occur BECAUSE of rough happenings in our life. Violent or stressful dreams are usually the result of unhappiness, stress, or other negative feelings you may have when you're awake.<br>  <br>  A change in diet will not block out your nightmares, I'm sorry to say. To stop having nightmares you need to be calm and happy, or at least peaceful when you're awake. Dreams are a merged collection of our thoughts; have you been thinking a lot about things?<br>  <br>  My advice to you is to sort out everything in your life ASAP. And yeah, I know that sounds stupid and like I have no idea. I'm really sorry that you've been through hell, but you've got a chance to rebuild, so take it. I've been through a lot as well, and I used to have nightmares every single night-and that was when I could actually get to sleep.<br>  <br>  If there are particular things that are bothering you-something that happened to you in prison, a particular moment when you were being chased, etc, break it down into small pieces. Figure out what EXACTLY is scaring or disturbing you-is it a particular emotion you felt? A thought you had that wasn't so pleasant? Often smaller things like this can cause big issues like sleep problems and stress.<br>  <br>  You may want to write everything down, like a recount of what happened or a description of how you feel. You may want to talk to someone, though it may be hard, it will help. Or you may choose to just contemplate everything and sort it out in your mind. In any case, you need to get rid of the things that are bugging you in order to sleep peacefully. In the meantime, try reading a book before bed or listening to music while you sleep-this may distract you.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, a dreamcatcher is an object that is meant to spirit away our bad dreams, and get rid of evil spirits. It looks after us while we sleep. If you think you'd feel safer with one, maybe it could help.<br>  <br>  Good luck-and sweet dreams.|`|ympAojxvaa	It's possible to control your dreams with a bit of  practice.  Before you go to bed, think of that bad dream you get.  Then think of a way for that situation to change.  For example, if you dream you are being chased, think about confronting the guy instead.  The dream will change over time and eventually have a different outcome.  It sounds weird but psychologists that specialize in dreams have told patients this, and it has worked.  The more you think about your dreams, the more lucid they become (lucid, as in you can tell it's a dream and manipulate it).  <br>  <br>  working out problems during the day is great too, and will make you happier overall, but if the problem is only your past haunting you in your dreams, then remember it's still a dream and you will wake up ok again : )
VU6YfRaSaa	Basically, don't worry. The doctor will be able to tell you better than anyone else. He'll feel around your abdomen, and then you should get a pap done to make sure that nothing else is the matter. If it's near your appendix, but you're not sure where the appendix is, then it could be the ovaries, because they are set pretty high in the abdominal cavity. Either way it's good that you're going. I put off scheduling an exam for a Colposcopy for two years! (which is basically a camera that looks for uterine cancer)<br>  I was very anxious at this point, because I knew that if I really DID have cancer, that it could have been easily removed early on, but that it could have gotten very bad in a matter of two years. <br>  <br>  Thank God it was nothing, but if it had been cancer, I would have been sorry that I didn't get it checked out. <br>  <br>  All the best to you, and don't worry, it could just be constipation! ;-)|`|AGaNsjEXaa	I wouldn't worry about it being ovarian cancer.  I used to have the same pains when I was ovulating.  You didn't say how long you have been experiencing these pains...a week, a few days?  Is the pain felt only on the right?  Have you ever had your appendix taken out?  If not, and this pain just started and becomes severe...go to the emergency room, especially if you become nauseated or start vomiting.|`|ivzhA4Bdaa	You might be feeling ovulation pains.  Sometimes, when a woman ovulates, she will feel it.  However, since you're on the Pill, you shouldn't be ovulating at all.  Perhaps you need a pill with a higher dose.<br>  <br>  I'm not a doctor.  I don't even play one on TV.|`|G6jTu4Ibaa	i was about to give you an answer more specific but instead thought of sending you my wishes<br>  <br>  BEST OF LUCK<br>  <br>  DO NOT WORRY IT IS NOTHING LIKE O CANCER OR SORT OF THING, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY FINE.|`|OIVH4hhEaa	if pain is near appendix,it may be of appencities so no meed to get worry about and consult to a doctor......<br>  <br>  ALL THE BEST|`|1dI1QiVJaa	it could be a number of things BUT IM NOT A DR SO IM NOT SURE WHAT IT MAY BE.   It can be maybe if ur under alot of stress of have nerves about ur current b/f etc then it maybe just stress pains.   not being a female but being an older male im not sure if it has to do with the BC ur on or not.   I wouldn't worry about it till you see the dr and talk to them about it.  I also worry about alot of things stress etc and sometimes i get a pain but in my chest and the Dr's said im fine so i know its stress but  i do worry and sometimes i almost always  worry about something when there is nothing to worry about , so my point is that i wouldn't worry till u see and talk to the dr.  then if it is something serious or not to serious then ur dr can tell u what to do  so  don't worry. JUST BE HONEST WITH THE DR AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING U SAID HERE ABOUT THE PAINS ETC. GOOD LUCK AND LET US KNOW HOW U MADE OUT.
LxUX3TdLaa	Throw that dumb measuring tape away! <br>  <br>  Are your clothes fitting more loosely? Do you FEEL better? Do you feel like you LOOK better?<br>  <br>  If the answer is yes, the who cares about numbers!?!<br>  <br>  There could be a number of things factoring into your no inches lost, depending on when you measured you could have actually "gained" weight that day (it happens to everyone do NOT get discouraged), if it was after a workout your muscles were probably swollen, if it's close to "that time" you could be bloated, etc. <br>  <br>  and please tell me you aren't weighing yourself everyday! That is torture!! <br>  <br>  I say to heck with all that, if you feel good and feel like you are starting to look good then what's the point of it! All it does is get you bummed out!|`|CYCIlR7Eaa	People tend to think they can lost fat from 1 particular area, but you can't.<br>  Everyone thinks sit ups or crunches will get rid of belly fat. It won't. You may even find your waist measurement going up because you are increasing the muscle size below the fat. Stick to a low fat diet and low intensity exercises like walking for longer periods. High intensity excessive burns your body's natural fuel Glycogen but lower intensity excessive done for longer periods burns body fat. Restrict your calorie intake and you'll be fine.

ixPVr23Waa	An ectopic beat is simply a general term used to describe any unusual electrical impulse of the heart that does not originate from the usual source of electrical activity (the sino-atrial node). <br>  <br>  This is really common and no real problem, the only real problem would be if it does not allow your heart to fill properly or squeeze blood properly resulting in low blood pressure, dizziness, faintness etc...<br>  <br>  On the monitor they usually like wider and odd shaped compared to normal beats as it comes from a different part of the heart. They are quite common when stress is placed on a patient with any cardiovascular history.<br>  <br>  Chris- registered nurse|`|9669Wxzvaa	The term ectopic beats means heart beats 'out of place'.

NaM7nShJaa	As one poster has already said dehydration, potassium and or calcium deficiencies will cause cramp. Mustard is an emetic - it makes you vomit. You should avoid that as vomiting will dehydrate you.<br>  <br>  A good natural source of potassium is bananas. Have one or two before swimming (they also have slow release energy producing carbohydrates). Calcium supplements are available from any good pharmacy. Don't forget to increase your fluid intake too.<br>  <br>  Good luck - Hope the above solves your problem.|`|4SrdYUuSaa	Not only do you need more potassium, as another person advised, but it is important that you are receiving enough calcium.<br>  <br>  Please make certain you are always properly hydrated -- another cause for muscle cramping.<br>  <br>  Good luck -- taking even a supplement tonight will make the cramps history by tomorrow.<br>  |`|mMGQCGMsaa	I used to get cramps in my feet so bad at night that I would scream and cry.

aEKI1Knqaa	This happens to everyone who smokes from time to time. It's all in your head. When you are not high and around the same people, what is it like? It's pretty chill, right? So what's different when you smoke? Nothing except that you are high. Nobody around you can tell if you are high unless you ACT like you are high. Just chill out and enjoy yourself. Don't be so worried about what people think. Who really gives a  sh it if you are high? Also, if you smoke some weed that you have never smoked before and you don't know exactly how it will make you feel...that can sometimes mess with your head too.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	smoke less|`|DGFc8TbLaa	have a can of lager with it.|`|S5ZYHiFaaa	self awareness really helps fix things like this.<br>  <br>  the next time you catch yourself thinking "oh god, what are they thinking about me" and other such things, just silently say to yourself "okay, it's happening again, im being overly self conscious, now stop it".<br>  <br>  its just a matter of realizing that even if they are judging you, just say f*ck it, im having fun.|`|x81bKkFqaa	Because you probably always had a little social anxiety in you and the pot brought that out even more. I was this way when I was younger and I could only do it with people I really, really, knew well and could trust. Usually I just ended up doing it with my best friend and I was fine because we knew each other forever.|`|W08qzLu6aa	I used to get that because when i was with friends we would smoke so much and i would get so baked. simple, just smoke less when you are with them, or wait until your tolerance builds|`|3JUKOGOvaa	the same happens to me..i dont really know why but would like to know why too|`|IHxcqYt5aa	1. Anxious and paranoid: This is an effect of what the drug does.<br>  2. Calmed and chilled: also an effect of the drug.<br>  3. It's probably different each time because there are different ratio's of the main biochemicals involved in the drug. You can't really prevent the effects of any drug you take. Probably lessen your intake and you may not be as anxious or paranoid.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_cannabis#Psychoactive_effects" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_...</a><br>  <br>  This gives you the effects of drugs and reasoning.<br>  <br>  You may want to look up Schizophrenia, and the main page for cannabis as well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia#Drugs" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophren...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijana" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijana</a><br>  <br>  Although I tried to answer your question,  I am against you smoking, as it is bad for your health and can cause quite a few problems in the long run, but hey,  it's your choice what you do with your body. Also be wary on the effects smoking may have with your relationships, and if your friends, or family try to stop you, don't turn them away as they are only concerned with your health. I would stay away from the stuff, personally. Hope this helps.|`|m2R73DwPaa	I personally think from experience that we cannot control this effect, LOL I have been that way many times, And I notice that it only happens When it is GOOD GREEN BUD! Don't get me wrong, It doesn't happen every time you have good green, Or I would never leave the house! LOL No Really, I have discussed this with a few friends of mine and we've come to the conclusion that there's some plants with this paranorma state in the THC in the plant, And when it comes to thinking."what other people are thinking about you"  I've been there too, It's worse for me though if for 1-Their are strangers, 2- I run into someone I don't want to know about me even getting high! lol And Worst of all if I like someone and we just smoked and the person I like shows up afterwards!  Well now the whole world knows that I'm a Pot Head!! lol   I honestly think It has to do with the THC in the plant.|`|lle4SvwIaa	honestly, i dont think that you will be like that if you smoke it with someone you trust, you will be more relaxed that way..and also i think the experience is a lot more mind expanding (ie sorta trippier) when you do it by yourself, you will be more alone to your thoughts and all that stuff. but hey whatever ways is good, but yeah smoke it with people you trust...always, and if its unavoidable, bring pepper spray to spray them, that would also be pretty funny when your stoned.
4jiEViPFaa	i'd say about 1700 to 1800 a day. protein, carbs,and then fats, in that order are best. snack a bit throughout the day if you can, while driving or watching tv, as i found that makes it easier for me to make myself eat.<br>  <br>  good luck with your recovery! you're very brave :)|`|LxUX3TdLaa	I would hover in the range of 1600-1800 a day. THAT'S NORMAL! <br>  <br>  & that's for good QUALITY food! 5-7 meals a day!
It8fhHLuaa	Has long as you don't have AIDS or Herpies then that bag of worms won't appear so bad.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	If it's varicocele then it MIGHT make it harder to get someone pregnant. Doesn't mean it will. The reason is because the enlarged veins put pressure on that area, making it harder for more sperm to be produced (not all the time though).<br>  Yeah it can make it harder, wouldn't try it though.<br>  Also, I had varicocele and didn't have any pain or heaviness whatsoever.. you don't need to have those symptoms to have it.
ITCknAHVaa	Understandable, how you feel, you feel helpless and angry.  What is the school doing to help your brother?  They should be helping him and do your parents know?<br>  <br>  Tell them how you feel.  I can certainly understand your anger and frustration and while very normal, please do not act on it as it will not help the situation at all.  Please inform the school, parents, even the police to stop the bullying.<br>  <br>  Also talk to the student welfare officer.  You need help to get the ubllying stopped and also it is good to talk your feelings out.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you and your brother take up martial arts, it help you to learn self defense, not fighting, but assertivness, and standing up for yourself.  You need to take back control.<br>  '<br>  I do not think there is anything wrong with you, what you are feeling is normal, but pease talk to soeone and don't act on it|`|kA5CUf62aa	what happened to your brother is awful BUT . . .<br>  <br>  To get back at the bullies you're going to stoop down to thier level and bully them back?! That makes you just as bad as them.<br>  <br>  You probably do need to speak to a counsellor or psychologist about the issues you have because being a thug won't fix your problems. You'll probably end up feeling worse afterwards if you choose a violent solution.|`|AA10953999	Forget about them. Talk to your brother and let him know that you are there for him when ever he needs you. Tell him that no one told you about what happened or you would have taken care of it.

Pjm9pg7iaa	While i played tennis my dog would dig in the dirt to chase the rats and ground squirrels in the desert.  When we got home he would have 100 ticks on him.  He had so much fun digging and chasing that i didn't care.  Altho i did worry about the bloodstream problem that you mention.<br>  The vets say to use a tweezers.  I got several different sizes. The ones that have plastic on the grip worked best because they didn't twist in my fingers when squeezing.  The dog seemed to know that i was helping him .... he stayed still until i was done.<br>  Keep a dish of soapy water nearby. The soap film causes the ticks to drop to the bottom.  Otherwise they float and live.  Don't squish them after removing them.  The same thing that hurts the dog can hurt you.<br>  Where do you go that collects the most ticks?  Do you live in the desert or in the woods.  Both places are full of ticks.|`|pXPdO2I8aa	I answered the same thing before and people thought that I was taking the micky!<br>  <br>  Ticks burrow into the skin clockwise ,so to ensure getting the head right out you should unscrew them anti-clockwise. Fact!|`|YHpePjb9aa	all of these answer work! but the things you can get from the vets or pharmacists etc (like creams or lotions to remove the ticks) can cause serious irritation to the dogs and burn the skin (like an acid burn on a human). The best way is to remove them with a special tick tweezer, which is a green, shaped piece of plastic with a V in the base, that you hook around the tick and just pull it off. Another way is to stub it with a cigarette end (so iv been told). I just pull ticks off with normal tweezers, and then rub some antiseptic gel into the dogs skin. They live in long grasses, ferns etc and can cause limes disease, which is like a really bad fever! hope this helps|`|Vo7iicvEaa	Buy a tick remover from the vets is best really.You can try and remove the tick with tweezers but unfortunattely they are prone to leaving their mouth pieces in situ normally causing a tick reaction wound.|`|cb5484427266c6c943560304f1a18037aa	Cotton wool and Vodka or whiskey.<br>  Keep wiping soaked cotton wool over tick.<br>  The tick will fall away and not leave its jaws in your dog to get infected.|`|krPMGnMAaa	tweezers, then put it in a glass and burn it with a match stick as they can climb out and attach teir self somehwhere else|`|xOTVsHa7aa	There are soaps and antiseptics specially designed to do the job perfectly with no side effect. Do visit your VET for recommendations, Cheers|`|AA11171486	you can buy tick tweezers from Millets-they are for travellers but expect they'd be ok on the dog. you must get the head out as well as the body so magnifying glass would be useful

fBMNbUcsaa	Like they said, it could be hemorrhoids but it might be an ulcer. If there's not that much, it could just be a fissure (which isn't life threatening), but if there's a lot, there's a good chance it's an ulcer whether it's a stomach ulcer or a small intestine ulcer.<br>  If it turns out to not be an ulcer, you may just need to move around more and/or get more fiber.<br>  Generally, though, if it's an ulcer, your feces is dark rather than it being bloody... but you should get it checked out tomorrow (or today if it's not 1 in the morning for you).|`|3y0jPzgSaa	it might not be hemorroids...go to a doc..it could be many other things such as a bleeding ulcer...or intestinal problems..etc|`|m0WUEtqXaa	there are numerous other reasons, you shouldnt be guessing when it could be a matter of life/death. See a GP or go to a clinic|`|i4TjgBFnaa	I'm not sure, it could be a possibility. But as the others said pooping out blood that much with it still hurting is not normal.

0hUYFYUvaa	si el diente esta muy da?ado es mejor colocar una corona si la caries es poco profunda y extencion pues es mas viable colocar una resina ya que esta es muy buen material para restauraciones peque?as<br>  <br>  en cuanto a la sensivilidad debera ver el medico que no nesecites endodoncia|`|8197f0b803e3859f9fdc4b8f91b4c845aa	Hola, esta mal el dignostico, por sensibilidad, se puede hacer una endodoncia que sería algo radical y algo suave usar pasta especial como sensodine para evitar la sensibilidad en los cuellos, si hay caries ,se debe reparar y recomiendo resina al 100%, ni las coronas ni las resisnas sellan abajo de la encia, ningun material es biocompatible, te sugiero cambiar de especialista, y pedir 2 o mas opiniones de especialistas.|`|0dfc07671ec64f8146d820648b79c543aa	Hola!<br>  <br>  Primero que todo, tanto las resinas como las coronas tienen sus indicaciones (o usos) muy claros, no es que una sea mejor que la otra per sé, sino que hay que evaluar cada diente y ver qué le corresponde.<br>  <br>  En el caso de las resinas, no se deben indicar si no es posible manter un campo de trabajo seco, como es el margen o abajo de las encías.  Si la el remanente dentario, después de eliminar caries, (o realizar tratamientos de conductos) es poco, o muy débil, tampoco podemos indicar resinas, ya que requieren una superficie de adhesión, de otro modo, podrían despegarse.<br>  <br>  Si ambas situaciones se dan en en los 4 dientes de tu mamá, estaría de acuerdo en realizar coronas, de lo contrario no.<br>  <br>  Espero haberte ayudado.|`|1kzgw3CLaa	La verdad no te podria  decir nada sin un examen clinico, lo que pasa es que algunas veces se evalua que tanta estructura dentaria esta afectada  y segun eso  se  indica las coronas o las resinas, sin embargo lo mejor que te puiedo sugerir es que acudad con una segunda opinion y que  le expliquen a tu mama  si  es  indispensable la corona    o no. suerte|`|FZeBzJrpaa	Es muy arbitrario decidir que hace falta sin ver el caso en boca y sin radiografias<br>  Punto 1: Pueden existir caries que lleguen al nervio y no provoquen dolor por mucho tiempo, eso se debe a que los microorganismos no han alcanzado la suficiente virulencia como para desencadenar la agudeza del cuadro lo que no quiere decir que no exista una infeccion cronica que aun no se manifiesta<br>  Punto 2: A veces las caries se forman entre piezas a traves de sus puntos de contacto por lo tanto no son visibles salvo con radiografias, aunque en los dientes anteriores suelen transparentarse a traves del esmalte como zonas mas oscuras<br>  Punto 3: El fin de la odontologia es y deberia ser conservador, en el sentido de salvar primero la pieza, con una buena recontruccion si eso no resultara ahi recien habria que pensar en un tratamiento de conducto, ya que recordemos que un diente con conducto es como un arbol seco que se parte de nada si no se lo refuerza con un perno y una corona<br>  En definitiva todo lo que sea protesis fija es el fracaso de la odontologia preventiva<br>  Cuidado|`|NLlM8PMIaa	Es siempre mejor ir de lo mas conservador a lo radical...mejor las resinas..si no funciona las coronas ok?|`|TodafUTuaa	Hola <br>  Creo que siempre ante  la duda debes consultar a otro dentista , pero no le comentes el anterior diagnóstico, deja que el solo saque sus conclusiones . Por su puesto debes llevarle todas las Radiografías, pues sin ellas difícilmente podrá diagnosticar si una caries esta cerca del nervio o no.<br>  <br>  Ahora si de todas maneras te dice que es necesaria una endodoncia, te diré que que los dientes quedan mas  frágiles  y corren el riesgo de fracturas, por un tiempo puede hacerse primero una rehabilitación con resinas y si se fractura el diente después hacerte unas coronas cuando ya no quede mas solución. Yo se lo que cuesta el dentista por eso te aconsejo eso. Ahora si quieres haz coronas apenas terminen las endodoncias..|`|rEPrKR05aa	Es muy dificil diagnosticar por correo, y con pocos datos, pero creo o pienso saber lo que tu mamá tiene, tal vez sea caries cervical, que es a nivel de encia y puede estar muy profunda ya, la corona del diente puede verse bien aparentemente, pero la lesion existe.<br>  Lo mas recomendable es que vayas con otro dentista y escuches una segunda opinion y que te expliquen bien la enfermedad y el diagnostico.<br>  Y si es necesario colocar coronas, siempre va ser mejor colocar coronas que resinas, la resina son para obturar peque?as cavidades, las coronas para recubrir un diente.<br>  Yo he visto casos en que el paciente acude por sencibilidad y al hacer la exploracion clinica se observa caries cervical severa, que tal pareciera que ese diente se va ha trozar, hasta ahorita todas las he obturado con resina previa valoracion del compromiso pulpar, y me han dado resultado.
6f6174e436e06d1fa492c73df0d90658aa	As a registered nurse working in the ER, i give these injections often.  I always give it to people in their non dominant arm ,because they do hurt and continue to make the muscle sore for up to a week.  The injection is given as a deep intramuscular injection and it is a painful shot.  It is common to have pain and sometimes slight redness, if the pain becomes too much to handle or you are unable to move your arm and do activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, and eating then you should definitely see your doctor.  Here are a list of common side effects as noted on medicine net  <br>  <br>  <br>  SIDE EFFECTS: Pain, swelling, or redness at the injection site may occur. Headache, fatigue, body aches, nausea, diarrhea, fever, chills, vomiting, or sore/swollen joints may also occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, notify your doctor or pharmacist promptly. An allergic reaction to this drug is unlikely, but seek immediate medical attention if it occurs. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include: rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, trouble breathing. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.<br>  <br>   <br>  I hope this helps to answer your question, and please let your parents know if the symptoms get worse so you can see your doctor.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Tetanus HURTS and it's going to hurt for about two weeks.

If the shot was given in your 'dominant' arm/hand and you continue to use the arm as if it 's not been temporarily injured, it can be painful. Take a couple of anti-inflammatory meds (Ibuprofen or Motrin) and see if that helps. If the area gets red and puffy after 2 days see a doc fast. could be a reaction to the shot.|`|RYjJ5PRNaa	That's a pretty common problem unfortunately.  It should go away on its own within the next few days.  A warm washcloth on the injection site might help a little.  Oh yeah... and make sure you tell your parents and see a doctor if it gets really bad (I'm no medical expert LOL)

Go to the doctor and get yourself checked out; it is probably the flu or maybe something else.  You can get prescribed something for the mucus, but I would lay off the Nyquil.  When you're throwing up, you don't want to put in more stuff that could just come up again really quickly.

Ci sono poi altre donne che soffrono di mestruazioni dolorose (hanno in pratica delle contrazioni uterine quasi equivalenti a quelle del parto, quindi immagina un pò te come ci si senta). Infine ci sono la stragrande maggioranza di donne che hanno il ciclo e i classici dolori mestruali, tuttavia sopportabili. Personalmente ho mal di testa e mal di schiena durante il ciclo: non ne soffro sempre, diciamo di rado. Però è capitato a volte di avere mal di schiena talmente forte da non chiudere occhio: nonostante ciò sono rimasta nel mio letto, senza svegliare nessuno o mettermi a piangere. A volte bisogna stringere i denti e a meno che non si abbiano dolori assurdi si continuano a fare le cose di sempre. Cmq mi è capitato di vedere una mia amica che diventava sempre più pallida finchè ha iniziato a vomitare e sudare in un modo pauroso, e aveva delle contrazioni fortissime al punto che abbiamo chiamato il medico. Non so però se la tua ragazza stia così male, o si culli solo un pò su questa cosa fisiologica.|`|VkWzQ5Siaa	che ridere...quanti insullti...|`|WjalrbVAaa	da uomo ti dico che i dolori mestruali cambiano da donna a donna ci sono donne che soffrono e donne che sopportano,come vedi non e' il caso di chiamarla demente solo perche' non va a lavoro nel periodo mestruale,almenoche tu non sia il suo principale ,ma in ogni caso visto che non sai certe cose penso proprio che il demente sei tu'|`|cLGCgjutaa	Sei proprio uno STROONZO, spero anch'io che rinasci donna così almeno provi anche tu quello che stiamo provando noi.<br>  Spero di non trovare mai un ragazzo come te.<br>  Comunque, non tutte le ragazze sono uguali, certe non sentono niente, altre invece provano dei dolori che tu non puoi neanche immaginare.|`|n5vV2iW3aa	è probabile...ci sno certe xsone ke nn hanno mai avuto dolori premestruali e mestruali...mentre altre si..io 3 giorni prima ke mi vengano le mestruazioni sto un po male e nausea...e quando mi vengono sto sempre malissimo....ma voi uomini ste kose + di tanto nn le kapiteeeeeeeee..mannaggia a voi!!!<br>  ps:dikono ke un uomo resisterebbe molto meno ai dolori mestruali e quelli del parto !!!!!i piagnoni mi sa ke siete vooooi..no dai skerzo..xò....ste kose sono kosi...tu ke sei un uomo + di tanto nn le puoi kapire...nn xkè sei stupido ma xkè fisikamente nn le potrai mai provare...ciao|`|nfchbEneaa	1)non sei donna,non puoi capire propio nulla,2)con l'età e le gravidanze i dolori diminuiscono(almeno così so io),3)ogni donna è diversa,ho amiche che vomitano x tutti i giorni del ciclo,altre che svengono e altre che non hanno sintomi..SIAMO TUTTE DIVERSE!|`|oMcsfuwUaa	fossi la tua ragazza ti avrei già mollato (ke c***o ke nn lo sn!!!!!!)|`|owaRu8ARaa	ma che ca**o ne sai tu se è o meno il motivo più stupido e banale?? l'hai mai provato?

Losing 20 pounds in 14 days doesn't sound very safe or healthy.<br>  Eating more of the healthy foods and yes reducing or eliminating the sugary drinks(replace them with fresh fruit and vegetable juices and lots of water is better) will definitely help with the weight reduction.

Firstly life isn't easy, it doesn't always bring happiness it can be cruel but we carry on, that's all we can do as humans is carry on and have hope that little bit of us to keep going. I think you believe you have no hope or anything left. I suggest seeing a psychologist you have alot of problems and talking with someone and working through it professionally is one step to put your life back in order. You can continue to pursue your art and keep trying or perhaps thinking another path. Just get up and keep going don't fall back--move forward. Get friends/family back in your life you need love. Don't end your life try to make it better and make change. We have the gift of life and there is so much more for you in the future.

Family Troubles, I know what you mean cause its really tough knowing that you're family might not be there for you 100% of the time, because they've spent the time arguing, try get like friends who are mature enough to give advice as good as a father or mother would.  Or characteristics with a nurturing personality, extra friendly, or happy all the time that you won't even think of one single problem of you're own.  Just people look a bit for a couple of days, you'll see some who shine a little, you'll need people like those in you're life.<br>  <br>  Job thing, Get it solved fast, just guessing, knowing the personality similar to most, emotions based off success, and wanting a new start I'd try researching jobs in an area that carries a lot of retail stores urban or surburban, where job cycles very fast, stack jobs if you need more money, and it might be safer, people friendly, like that you know.  When the atmosphere's better, you're mood will change to it.  Good luck with making some more decisions, ask an advisor for more of the important ones.  I don't know, but I've gotten over my family troubles all by forgetting every single one of them. and changing the appearance does work, how you treat yourself is how others will treat you.<br>  <br>  I hope I've given enough advice.  Good luck with life out there, I'll be in it too in a couple years. lols.

PKtWiLvUaa	Hi Angelia,<br>  <br>  There are different aspects to coping with stress.  You can act to relieve it.  And you've already got some good answers to that.  But over the longer term you want to work to reduce or eliminate it.<br>  <br>  Stress happens when the events of life show you that what you thought was true, really isn't.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes this might be that you thought someone was more honest that they actually turned out to be or something was going to happen and it didn't.<br>  <br>  To overcome the stress you have to update your view of the world so that the world can be as it is without causing you the pain that it currently is.<br>  <br>  Usually people fight against this and justify why things should be better or fairer.  But the fact is, you can either be right or happy.  You get to choose.<br>  <br>  There's a series on how you can deal with stress here;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://livewithoutconflict.com/blog/2008/06/24/what-is-stress-a-new-definition-of-stress-for-a-new-millenium/" rel="nofollow">http://livewithoutconflict.com/blog/2008...</a>|`|FkvW7jBeaa	Our lives sound somewhat similar.  Interesting.  I take it one day at a time.  There are days I don't feel like getting out of bed and sometimes I don't know why I do.  I think I get my energy from God or my Mother (who is deceased).  I don't know why I keep going and yes, there are the days where I don't know what stops me, but I'm still here.  If you need to talk, e-mail me.  I'll be around.|`|AA11621397	You need to breathe. Relax, try mediating by taking some deep cleansing breathes (yoga perhaps) Try penning all your emotional turmoil in a journal or talk to someone, by letting out the emotional stress you'll be relieved.|`|B6qNBC4Daa	i started cutting. dont do that, its a bad way to deal with stress. :(|`|hWQcsZCLaa	A selection of treatments follows, because circumstances, and individual preferences vary. See stress treatments, at ezy build, below in section 42. A certain level of stress is unavoidable, in modern society, so it is a good idea to develop effective coping methods. For others, or yourself: A massage (at least neck and shoulders) with jasmine, lavender, juniper, and/or bergamot, or German chamomile essential oils added to the massage oil, and to a warm bath, preferably beforehand, to help make any tension knots and muscles more pliant (they may only want, say, a juniper and/or bergamot and/or sandalwood mix: check first). I am aware of advice that strong heat, applied to essential oils can damage them, and so I would not use a diffuser. See if they will do long, stretching yoga exercises, or t'ai chi with you (see section 2, at ezy build, below).       <br>  <br>   Practise daily, one of the relaxation techniques on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i; whichever works best for you, but the mindfulness breathing for 15 - 20 mns is ideal, although the progressive muscle relaxation can be learned quickly, and takes only several minutes, if pressed for time. Employ the EFT version for use in public, for which you can reasonably claim that you have a headache, as you massage/tap your temples, but it may be advisable to restrict yourself to subvocalising (saying it to yourself, in your mind, not aloud). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o refer. "Even though I sometimes suffer from stress, I deeply and completely accept myself".   <br>  <br>  (The following is a variant of EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing  therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, insomnia, and anxiety: it is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective. It is easy to be dismissive of such a seemingly unusual technique, but give it a good tryout, for at least a few weeks, to see if it is effective in your case.).              <br>  <br>                      Prior to using either of the methods in the above paragraph, first sit comfortably, and take a deep breath. Then, without moving your head, move your eyes from the left, to the right, and back again, taking around a second to do so (say: "a thousand and one": this takes approximately a second). Repeat this procedure (without the words, although you can count, subvocally, if you like) 20 times. Then close your eyes and relax. Become aware of any tension or discomfort you feel.                        <br>                   Then open your eyes, and take another deep breath, and repeat step one, closing your eyes, and relaxing afterwards, in the same manner. Then, repeat the procedure one last time. Some people may find that this is all they need do.   With experience, you may find that you can practise this in public, with your eyes closed, which greatly widens the window of opportunity for its use, and avoids attracting unwanted attention.              <br>  <br>                      I have found that the 2 - 3 minutes spent using the EMDR markedly reduces distractions to the relaxation process, and is repaid many times over. With experience, you may find that you can practise this in public, with your eyes closed, which greatly widens the window of opportunity for its use, and avoids attracting unwanted attention. <br>  <br>  <br>       You can also multitask, using the gazing technique, as you walk/jog or exercise, by focusing on a distant object, or just focus awareness on how each step feels, noting any thoughts which flash across your mind, without pursuing any particular train of thought, just gently redirect your focus to the task at hand.              <br>  <br>                      For some people, it helps to visualise of a quiet, relaxing scene, (Imagine, as vividly as you can, that you are on a tropical beach, reclining comfortably; you luxuriate, as the the sun warms you, and a gentle breeze caresses your skin lightly, inhaling the tangy, sea scented, salt laden spray from the sparkling, translucent, aqua waves, crashing on the white, coral beach sand, and feeling the hot sand slip through your fingers in one hand, sipping your favorite drink with the other; all the while, the seagulls call, swoop and cavort playfully overhead in a cloudless, azure sky: you feel just like one of them, free to soar and cartwheel, or just glide in the moist, heavy air, and that this moment will last forever ... ).      <br>  <br>    Some people may find it helps when they listen to: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sounds-Of-The-Ocean/dp/B000XSX6E6/ref=pd_sim_tdbs_dmusic_title_2/002-9404631-0817638)" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Sounds-Of-The-Ocea...</a>  Other suggestions: <a href="http://www.secretsofmeditation.com/demo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.secretsofmeditation.com/demo....</a>   <br>       and the audio, as well as the printed version, at:   <a href="http://www.lessons4living.com/relaxation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lessons4living.com/relaxation...</a>   and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ambient-Rain-Sound-Sleep-Relaxation/dp/B000QPXNA8" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Ambient-Rain-Sound...</a>  or the mountain river sounds. Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily, replacing 2 of them with cod liver oil supplements, or a teaspoonful of the oil (I spread mine on toast, and mask its strong taste with fishpaste, and pepper), in the winter months only. Those people who receive adequate exposure to sunlight, daily, won't need the vitamin D from cod liver oil, but many people, particularly those in latitudes far from the equator, find this difficult, to achieve. Eat healthily, in accordance with your "nutritional type" as determined at <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR.  <br>  <br>      Ginseng (Panax Ginseng (Chinese/Korean/Japanese), panax quinquefolius (American) Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian)). It is also known as man root, life root and heal all. Lady's Slipper (Cypripedium pubescens) Lady's slipper is one of the most widely applicable nerviness available. It can be used in all stress reactions, emotional tension and anxiety states.    Try having a cup of "Tension Tamer", herbal tea, by Celestial Seasonings, (from supermarket tea, or health food aisles) or make some at home, and cool, then bottle, and drink as needed (I find it so strong tasting, that I need to drink it quickly, followed by something like fruit juice, to take away the taste, but others may find it more tolerable). C(h)amomile tea is a more palatable option. As with all herbal/green teas, use lemon/lime, and/or a little sweetener (NOT ARTIFICIAL!!!) but no cream, or milk.  <br>  <br>       Xylitol, or Stevia is preferable, (health food stores) or fruit sugar (fructose, such as "Fruisana", from supermarket sugar aisles) or even a little honey, because these will reduce "sugar spikes", which later deplete you of energy. Minimise/eliminate consumption of highly processed foods, particularly grain products, such as white bread, donuts, cake, cookies/biscuits, or anything with sugar. Opt for more wholefoods, non-starchy vegetables, and fruit.              <br>  Light to moderate daily exercise helps fight stress. <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a>|`|UwrVK72aaa	I would suggest going to the doctor and getting a prescription for something that can take the edge off until you are better able to deal with everything going on.<br>  Then get yourself into some therapy quick. It sounds like you are at your wits end.|`|mBUfy9zMaa	I know how you feel, Im the same way, but I made the choice to stay sad because its easier than trying to build yourself back up after every single disapointment or all the **** that happens in our lives....I just couldnt take it.  But when I made that choice, I didnt realize the dangers and I became severly depressed.  Im still somewhat depressed but Im getting better.  Trust me, and dont do what I did.  Instead find healthier ways to vent by writing, talking to friends, going for a walk, listening to music, ect.  Just do what you love and try to block all that crap from ruining whats stopping you from enjoying life.  And good luck!
AA11500263	you will need both cardio and weights to lose weight and build muscles. <br>  <br>  Cardio will help to boost your metabolism rate and will help you to burn calories. However to make sure you are doing it the right way, make sure your heart rate is above 140 but lower than 160. If it shoots up to 160 you'll have to slow down.<br>  <br>  The best way to lose weight and tone your muscles is to do interval training. 15 minutes of cardio + 10 minutes of toning  then back to cardio and so on. You can do as many intervals as you want but make sure to listen to your body and not overdo. I would recommend to start off slow and increase intensity gradually.<br>  <br>  Remember not to lift weights for full body at one time. Focus only on certain areas esp when you're just starting until your agility is much higher, you can do as many as you want.<br>  <br>  Remember, exercise is not enough, you'll need to combine with balanced diet and of course soda-free.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps|`|E6BWYo2oaa	Building muscle while losing fat is like an oxymoron because to gain muscle, you must consume more calories than your body burns, while to lose weight, you must do the opposite.  <br>  <br>  This is why bodybuilders do what is called bulking and cutting, where they eat, eat, eat to gain weight, and then cut, cut, cut to lose it while still lifting to keep the muscle gains they made.<br>  <br>  Also, you're right: no one needs to workout to lose weight.  But doing so will allow you to eat more because of the calories you'll be burning.<br>  <br>  By the way, since you're a female and therefore aren't genetically capable of gaining much muscle, I'd hit the stair master!|`|CXu91n7naa	weights will only help strain yourself if you do too much. you'll get injuried. first of all you need to do a cardio warm up beforeyou do weights to get the blood flowing and your body warmed up so you don't pull any muscles. second of all you are only building endurance, which doesnt burn fat. you need to reach your 65% max heart rate and stay there. thats the optimal range you need to be working in to burn fat.|`|AtO3x9E3aa	omg cardio deffinetly works,|`|ASyovZk7aa	cardio diffidently works...|`|mRk8huV2aa	works|`|PEzx6I7Gaa	lift weights. don't listen to the stupid people who say that cardio is the only way to go. lifting weights raises your basal (resting) metabolism and cardio doesn't. you'll burn more calories while you rest and are inactive. so you will lose more fat and get toned.|`|O37tnEeKaa	cardio does indeed work. to build muscle you need to do lots of leg lifts and go jump rope

Poi le sopracciglia nel giro di 3 giorni son tornate normali|`|fbHsdDM7aa	Assolutamente no. Se controlli le istruzioni per l'uso è specificato chiaramente.

A7gaKCRUaa	I have been on haemodialysis for three years now - my kidneys failed due to Vasculitis.  I go to the unit three times a week and dialyse in a chair for up to 4 hours at a time, I am more used to it now and apart from feeling tired its not too bad.  You will need a Fistula made for access, this can be quite traumatic to start with, I hate needles but they will use anaesthetic if you want it and then it is painless.  It can be difficult to needle at first if the graft or fistula is new, as they can move and be hard to locate, this can be troublesome but in time it gets easier.  I have made some wonderful friends on dialysis, we are all members of a club we didn't want to join!  But life goes on!  Good luck to you.
ts0g33Apaa	My friends sister was 5 months along and didn't know. She still had periods. It was a big surprise!|`|KHsWu1zbaa	In the early stages, yes. <br>  <br>  You can go one month being pregnant and not know it. <br>  <br>  Around one month is when you start feeling a soreness in your breasts. Around month two you'll start getting the morning sickness.<br>  <br>  However to have NO symptoms whatsoever, is rare. There are many changes going on in your body and if you were pregnant, guaranteed you would know it. |`|F9w1likxaa	Ya maybe have u tried a pregnancy test?<br>  <br>  THIS IS COMPLETELY SOMETHING ELSE BUT STILL CLICK IT.<br>  <a href="http://swagbucks.prodege.com/?cmd=sb-register&rb=220554" rel="nofollow">http://swagbucks.prodege.com/?cmd=sb-reg...</a>|`|Xtqq71KGaa	sure, happens all the time, esp. with overweight women who have irregular periods anyway.  they aren't alarmed when they don't get their period b/c it's nothing new to them, and the bulging belly is less noticeable.|`|fe53dcc8e9ff4b8d4153869a09c84c91aa	My friend was 3 months pregnant before she found out - she'd been told that she couldn't have kids, had irregular periods etc.  She thought she was gaining weight because of all the french pastries she was eating on her OE.|`|s5JysOsIaa	Yes. There have been some women who have given birth and claimed at the time they couldn't be having a baby because they weren't pregnant. <br>  <br>  Takes all kinds.|`|SE4ZXm4Oaa	Well if you have gone about three months with no period, then i would hope you are pregnant.  But it depends on your age, if you just started your period it is natural to have them spaced out randomly. If you really think you are pregnant and it has been a month to two months (and that is even pushing it) you should try to take a pregnancy test. <br>  <br>  I would say yes, but only in the first few months, and no if it is any later than that.|`|eBBu527Kaa	Happens to some women, but the ratio is very low.  Personally, when you get to be around 6-7 months, you have GOT to feel that baby kicking.

It it's not removed properly you may get a dry socket (where the nerves are exposed to the air) and it's going to hurt like hell for ages.|`|HYLDReP9aa	A wisdom tooth is so far back in your mouth i really doubt anything but a dentist could get it out. and i doubt cavemen had to worry about their teeth too much with all the hunting and trying to live thing.|`|9gsm05lnaa	I imagine that they would take a rock or something and knock it out.

PAvYZJK2aa	depends.. 5-15 for me on the first 2... virgin on 3 and 4|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	When I have sex there is no set time limit. I like to take as long as I want and if all my partner and I want is a quicky thats cool.<br>  <br>  But if I had to guess on average:<br>  <br>  1. 30-45 minutes. Not because I can't sooner, but I like to take my time.<br>  <br>  2. Same as #1<br>  <br>  3. Thats a bit harder to say. My past girl friend couldn't give head for **** so I didn't even orgasm at all until I was able to train her. But even then probably about 10-15 minutes with her. <br>  <br>  But the thing with that is I've had other girl friends who have gotten me to orgasm within just a few minutes. They just hit all the right keys and for me its kind of like a game I like to be *made* to orgasm. So I like to try and not do that but with a couple girls I was with they were just that good at giving head. Again though I like to prolong the pleasure even though they could have gotten me orgasm sooner it was really more 20-30 minutes. I would have them go longer but them I would just feel guilty.<br>  <br>  4. With sex I like to take my time and for me sex is not just straight penetration its foreplay, intimacy even role playing or acting out fantacies. So the whole bit together probably between 30 min to a hour. But sometimes longer. I've gone all night just having sex again and again.<br>  <br>  As far as the penetration itself for me to climax just depends on so many different factors - the position, how attracted I am to my girl, my mood (if I've really really aroused). It especially depends on my thrusting too. On average I would say that straight sex lasts about 15-30 minutes. But that's not really typical either. Sometimes I can orgasm in just a few minutes or if I really prolong it I can just go as long as I want. <br>  <br>  I will say that I was with this girl a few years back. She was hot and I mean HOT HOT HOT!!! Not only did she give good head, but I could barely help not having an orgasm within about 10 minutes. No matter how hard I tried. She was just that crazy hot and knew how to do everything right.|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	Porn (of your preferred type) rocks!!!<br>  <br>  1.  1 to 5 minutes, depending.<br>  2.  10 - 20 minutes<br>  3.

LyfODGbVaa	You took it out too soon after putting it in. When you take out a tampon that's dry it irritates the area and it's pretty painful. If you would've left it in for a few hours, you probably would've been fine.|`|9huxAcK9aa	Well if you haven't actually HAD your period, this may be why.  I've tried it before my period, and using a junior of slender size is the way to go.<br>  <br>  when you pull a tampon out, it may feel strange because your vagina isn't used to it!  putting 'in' and pulling 'out' a tampon is probably uncomfortable just because it isn't wet, and so you have a dry wad out cotton irritating your skin.<br>  <br>  Good luck hon!|`|9kfxPcoIaa	go with pads if it hurts that bad lol|`|SghwXlQ9aa	Oh, my gosh I know how you feel. When I was first trying them, and it didn't go in right, I took it out immediately and it hurt so bad. It's because it's dry and didn't soak up any blood. Next time wait a little while and then try to take it out. Just make sure you're not tensed up, and relaxed. <br>  Don't worry, I had the same problem but now I am a perfectionist at them lol. Good luck!|`|Up5LRkvGaa	the tampon was too big that's why it hurt....it is not good to use tampons anyway..do the research.....use pads and not shoving foreign objects up inside you..let the blood flow out, not get all smelly and clogged up in there festering infections with a tampon.....yech!!!|`|R37e00HEaa	only use supers on your heaviest days. your "jay" didnt have a enough... liquid in it so the tampon hardly soaked up anything. when you pulled it out the roughness of the tampon wasn't covered up by anything so it just scraped your "jay".|`|ccfb71afaac5d79b06639126ff012c31aa	yeah...if there was noting on the tampon when you pulled it out, it was still too dry and it hurts like a mofo when u have to pull it out when its dry...for the rest of this period, just use pads, and try with a regular tampon next time. <br>  <br>  feel better!|`|TdlalvGVaa	naww dnt worry it will always hurt a bit wen u pullit out but u will get used too it|`|hfqUp1IBaa	When you insert it don't worry it won't get lost make sure you get it deep enough or it will hurt bad.  Also never pull a tampon out before it is saturated because it does hurt.  You probably just chafed your vagina.  Keep trying and I guarantee you won't regret the switch!|`|ucT6YMIraa	It most likely went in crooked in the first place.  Happened to me many times.  WOW!  I got 3 thumbs down for my answer!<br>  BFD!  Must have been men who gave me the bum's rush.  I am 54 years old and spent 33 years messing with tampons and I know for a FACT that the pain when removing one WAS from it being inserted improperly.|`|kle6DM2Naa	It was too dry and the tampon because of that was too big. you might want to be careful with that because that is why tampons can be harmful over time, due to the fact that it gets rid of all the "moisture" when you use the wrong kind.|`|lNpEYsQDaa	its probably because it was too dry, and since it was a super it was bound to hurt. happened to me too!<br>  use pads for now, and only use tampons again if youre comfortable with them!|`|DiPQbyGyaa	Well i know that when the tampon is dry its hurts more coming out.<br>  Maybe your tender and that is why it still Hurst's but idk <br>  |`|Hs8mmYJTaa	maybe you arent ready to use tampons yet, maybe try using pads for a little while longer until your ready|`|L3BJtLR2aa	Wow i'm glad i'm not a female. Good luck dear.|`|GNi8d56eaa	It hurts to take out an unlubricated tampon.  when its been used its easy to take out, because you'd put it in and then taken it out your vaginal muscles had just started to take hold of it. <br>  Try using a bit of Vaseline on a tampon and remember to relax and breath next time putting in a tampon.<br>  <br>  It also might help if you "massage" that area first to relax the muscles.|`|G5PTNTFQaa	You didn't wait long enough for the tampon to absorb everything.<br>  So when you took it out, the cotton had nothing on it to lubricate it so its easy to take it out.<br>  <br>  next time when you try it, just use one that is perfect for your flow,<br>  that way when you go back to the bathroom to take it out, when you pull it just comes right out and doesn't hurt. |`|KlkOMZR2aa	Make sure you get the right size, they aren't supposed to hurt, if it does then it's in wrong. I've dealt with painful ones also, next time you try to take it out and it hurts, take it out as slowly as possible just yanking it out will make the pain worse, I took it out slowly and I wasn't sore from it. Hope that helps.|`|GBBRH9y0aa	u were  probably dry and the cotton from the tampon most likely scratched ur vagina...it will get better|`|T0V2jYplaa	If you just started using them start with the light ones (and use a pad also). Also don't use the cardboard ones, get the gentle glide ones...they go in better. And you have to leave it in for at least 5 hours, otherwise they don't do their job and if it is too dry (not enough blood) it will rip you up, not literally, but you already experienced it. Give it a few more tries, tampons are way more sanitary than pads (and less stinky)|`|AA10965725	Sorry for your trouble it is common, as for any experience it takes some time for you later in life when you will find proper to use tampon. For now please alternate Between normal female pads.  The reason more likely you experience pain it is because it dry you out same time the size is discomforting you.   May also try to insert it deeper.   Please do not take offense me being a man.  Take care|`|AA10100565	dont worry... during that time of the month you are bound to be a bit sore... so this being your first foray into the world of tampons just made it worse... a couple of things will make it painful to  remove.. <br>  1. you are using a higher than necessary absorbency level- this will soak up your period but also soak up your normal moisture leaving you dry...then you get a friction kind of thing going on...<br>  2. the tampon you are using absorbed alot and expanded...again its a friction thing this time due to size.<br>  3. when you went to remove the tampon you pulled at an odd angle.. this can make it hurt because you are putting pressure on very sensitive bits..  <br>  <br>  now while one of these can be an issue it sounds like you may have had a combination of 1 and 3 going on... dont worry, its normal to have these types of things happen when you start using them. <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you try using a bit of ky jelly or other lube to insert your tampon. now while this may sound odd, if you put a dab on the "top" of the tampon, then when you insert it it will glide in easier. this wont be bad for the tampon and it will help you get used to using them.  its an odd thing that while we have all the added "moisture" from our period.. we can have a "dryness" issue, but it happens to alot of us around that time of the month. i hope the info helps|`|DDVKuMAcaa	Sounds like you took out a dry tampon. A tampon needs to be wet in order for it to slide out of your vagina. When you put in a tampon its not advised to leave it in too long but also not to take it out too soon. I suggest not using a tampon this month seeing as how your too sore; so try again next month. Get a smaller tampon first, try the lights and just to cover your bases put on a pantyliner in case of leaks. This will let you gage what size you need and about how long to leave it in. Also a dry tampon can leave particles behind as its pulled out of your vaginal wall, which can cause infections. Don't let this scare you away from tampons, just be a little more careful when you use them next time.|`|NUnXcy0Zaa	I went through the same thing when I first started using Tampons.<br>  I'm going to guess it was just dry, or you put it in at a bad angle.<br>  Make sure your using the right size tampon, and you'll get more used to inserting your tampon the more you use them and hopefully you won't have to go through the pain!<br>  Good luck!|`|3OgmtH16aa	They are not meant to be put in and then taken out right away. When the tampon absorbs the blood it will shrink and thus be easier and pain free to take out. I'm guessing that you are a teenager. They have a special brand by playtex that is designed for teenagers. They are easier to insert and take out. I wouldn't use pads either. I used those when I was younger and hated them. Now I use tampons and would never go back. Good luck hope this helped. |`|685420c37147e40201b74dce36ac29a6aa	I think you're having a problem with dryness. If your "jay" is dry when you try to insert or pull out a tampon, it will prove difficult and painful. Next time you put one in, try putting petroleum jelly on the tip so it slides in much easier. And you should change your tampon after you urinate so that it's still wet down there. Hope this helps.|`|pEwhe8FAaa	Don't use a super again.  Try a light.  It might have just been too dry.  It will be sore the first time you use.  Same thing happened to me my first time love so dint worry and just use when you need it.  {Like P.E or sports practice.} Otherwise use pads.  |`|djZQXxmhaa	If the tampon is dry it will hurt coming out.  If you are using tampons for the first time try to look for the teen ones.  Those may be better for you.  If not use regular or light tampons and wait at least 2 hours before you change it.|`|e4LHvaPpaa	You put it in a little crooked and then stretched your "jay" and it hurt.<br>  <br>  Or it was dry and u burnt yourself while pulling it out<br>  <br>  Wait for a week till the soreness goes (use a pad for now dear)|`|JaGVI9Doaa	wow what a surprise these guys are right.<br>  you were either to dry and insert it at a wrong angle take it from me it happened to me as well but not that bad so dont worry about it.|`|UeKu11xiaa	i know exactly how that feels :/<br>  if its dry, then it hurts really bad pulling it out.<br>  <br>  give your "jay" a rest for a couple days,<br>  and then try again with smaller tampons.<br>  |`|Nbq1fkFGaa	It was too dry they come out easily when they are more saturated.  A super is probably too big and your flow doesn't warrant such a large size.|`|j23FQIhuaa	i had a problem like this when i first started ...its okay to be honest with you mine hurt alot less after i loss my virginnity.... (dnt do ne thing crazy) just use a pad and stay away from the jumbo's if u must use one |`|MVfOLb5Baa	that happened to me and my moms friend said it was cause it was not in proply or the "jay" was not moist enough ... but i don't know for sure|`|rLcwTNJyaa	Your tampon hurt? Your tampon has nerves?|`|IKaoqcHuaa	if you took  it out shortly after you put it in, it was likely too dry which can be quite awkard and sore taking out.|`|Z5Rv2fXqaa	It was probably just dry. Try tampons that aren't as absorbent if your cycle isn't heavy.

They begin licking the cup passionately, a lust for each other in their eyes. They began swapping the poop back and forth in their mouths to show how much they care.

Joint pain can be attributed to many syndromes and disorders. Also, doc may be able to give you something for relief|`|6c7cbef38fea0d9bee0911c09dd11c4aaa	Believe or not, thyroid problems can cause this along with many other things such as lypus or Fibromyagia. Many auto immune diseass can cause it. Let's not forget about depression, it can cause it. Teenagers can get arthritis but I doubt you have it. I would tell your parents and make sure you tell the doctor everything, old enough not to have your parents in the room. You can call ahead and tell them when you get there you would like to visit with the doctor alone and not to tell your parent. That way they don't get upset with you. This is only if you need to tell the doctor something you don't want your parents to know. It's the law even though your a minor. For the time being, take some advil and do some streching, it will help. Good luck.|`|vl3jH9oHaa	sounds like the classic case of migratory pains. you might also be frustrated, worried and angry. and also not sleeping properly. there are more symptoms which you have not listed.|`|UsmJLAuPaa	Try taking glucosamine supplements from your local health shop... or cod liver oil, they all promote healthy joints.
uKmNYqGgaa	Early when I was first taking anti-depressants, my psychiatrist switched me from 20 mg Lexapro to Wellbutrin, and said it was no problem switching.  I'll tell you - it was pure hell!!  I know about the brain zaps, and when I complained to the psychiatrist he acted like he had never heard of anything like that.  Of course, I now have a new psychiatrist!!<br>   <br>  The brain zaps will last for several weeks - but as time goes, the become less frequent.  I also experienced occasional dizziness, too.<br>   <br>  If you're still weaning yourself off the Lexapro, I did put a withdrawal guide together for the next time I need to get off it.  Here it is:<br>   <br>  The key to getting off Lexapro is to get off it very slowly. It took several weeks for the Lexapro to reach full potency in your system - and the same has to happen when you want to get off it. Of course, stopping cold turkey is very not pleasant and you certainly don't want to do that!<br>   <br>  To get off Lexapro, wean yourself to the lowest dose (5mg). If you're on 20mg, cut them in half (to get 10mg) and take those for a couple weeks, then go to the 5mg pills.<br>   <br>  After you've been on the 5mg pills for a couple weeks, cut them in half and take the half-pills for a couple weeks, then take the half-pills every other day for a couple weeks, then you can stop. This will slowly remove the Lexapro from your system, and help eliminate the possibility of withdrawal problems.<br>   <br>  If you wanted to add an extra step at the end, and take the half-pills every third day for a week, you can - but I don't think it's necessary.<br>   <br>  I wish you the best of luck :-)<br>  Paul.
6LxXR61Waa	Day 1 is the day she starts her period.  The day of ovulation is usually around Day 14 (when an egg is fertile).  However, sperm can live for 3-7 days, so to be extra safe, don't have unprotected sex on Days 8-20.  If that's too hard to figure out, then just remember that it's "safe" (nothing is 100% safe though) to have sex the week before her period and the week during her period.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Usually, yes.  Nothing is ever 100% when it comes to conception, but this is generally a pretty safe time.|`|uMlxKEbUaa	Your wife can potentially get pregnant at any point during her cycle. So, if you're trying to prevent pregnancy, there is ALWAYS a possibility that she can get pregnant. That being said, a woman usually ovulates 14 days after her period STARTS. If her period starts on the 5th, she should ovulate around the 19th. So from the 5th to the 19th, she should not have an egg released. However, women can release eggs early. I would say the one week after her period is when you should be ok. But remember, this is not 100%. She could release an egg the day after her period ends.|`|ZcfZx60aaa	Ovulation is usually day 14 in a 28 day cycle. Day one is the day your wife starts to bleed. Without using protection, your best bet is to avoid days 9-21. If you don't want to use birth control, your wife can take her temperature everyday at the same time, and avoid intercourse when her temp. rises (you'll have to do some research on this).<br>  Hopefully this helps.|`|sOO93u5Oaa	If you don't want to get pregnant, I would always use a condom or some form of birth control. You can get pregnant at any time, but I'd say she's least likely to get pregnant without any protection during her period.|`|pDtoi6FUaa	when its about to happen.|`|8d546b629532c767d810434c4f02ec0caa	well, typically a woman can only get preg when she ovulates. which is exactly in the middle of her cycle and last for four days or so. which sounds easy enough to say its ok to have unprotected sex around those days BUT there are two things to take into consideration. Are her periods exactly every 28 days every month? most women are not and some can be between 21-36 days of cycle. if she isnt regular then it will be hard to tell when she is ovulating. Second of all, sperm can live in a woman for anywhere between four-seven days. so if you have sex a week before she ovulates its possible for her to get pregnant as soon as the egg hits a sperm. It only takes one to get the job done! be safe and use condoms or have her get on birtch control. I dont recommend it but if you dont want to do either of those then make sure you pull out, of course you need to have a  lot of self control to do so. good luck!
QUCIdBp5aa	A couple of tips that I hope will help.<br>  <br>  When you're tempted, take the moment to ask yourself:  Which do I want more, the body/health or the junk food?  ;)<br>  <br>  And if and when you do mess up a little, get yourself right back on track.  Don't sabotage all you've done by punishing  yourself and making it worse.  So you had a burger.  Forgive yourself and move on immediately.<br>  <br>  One more thing:  I lost a lot of weight when I had kids and would sometimes find myself having to do the junk food scene.  But I made up my mind that I wanted to lose the fat, so I would spend two hours of the weekend cooking up chicken breasts and sweet potatoes and pack meals in a cooler every day.  This way I could eat a healthy meal in the car or in any situation where I could possibly be tempted.<br>  <br>  Once you continue this for a while and start seeing some results, that should keep your motivation.  Just remember, for many of us, food is comfort.  But it's really meant as fuel.  Think of the body you want as a high performance sports car and only fill it with the finest fuel.  <br>  <br>  Now go get 'em!  You can do this!|`|BJ1TjXhAaa	Your right life happens and if you are an emotional eater like me it is very hard to keep the weight off.  If it way easy the diet business wouldn't make billions a year.  The thing is if you do your best that's all you can ask for.|`|ro1yMxZ9aa	I think you answered it perfectly  "Life happens."  <br>  <br>  I always try to watch what I eat but the temptations find me and I make up for lost time and my weight rarely goes down unless I become sick or upset.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	I am the same way you are! We get so busy with life and taking care of a family, that we forget to take care of ourselves. Temptation IS out there. Lately, I have been making myself drink at least 64 oz of water. It's so hard to do and I'm peeing all the time! but I just keep telling myself that its healthier for me. Also when I feel that temptation to eat something that I know I shouldn't I can usually stop myself and tell myself it's my brain and only I can control what I do and I start doing something else. Usually a temptation will only last 10 minutes, so if you can get past that 10 minutes you should be safe. Also when I go to the store, I make sure I don't go when I'm hungry then it is so much easier to say I'm not going to buy those chips or cookies and I don't. Yes, kids like junk food, but why raise them with it, they don't need it and it's just teaching them bad habits. So now when they have a snack after dinner, it's been organic fruits and vegetables and I haven't heard any complaints yet. <br>  <br>  Let me know if you have any other suggestions for me! Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  I wanted to add too, the book "You on a Diet" is really informational. I would suggest it to anyone that has problems losing weight. I can usually get my reading in right before bedtime.|`|ysJA71Bpaa	I know just where you are... my daughter is turning 1 in a month, i have still yet to loose weight... luckilly i didn't gain too much while pregnant...<br>  <br>  you just need support and strong will power....

iAPHAAinaa	Methadone is a synthetic drug created to "Mimic" heroin, which is an opium derivative. It is used to slowly ease people off of opiates by giving them less of a dose of the drug each time.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL.

These exercises include squatting, dead lifting, overhead pressing, pull-ups, dynamic rows, and bench press. Six pack abs are the sculpted muscles of the abdominal region. Only a good diet will result in the look you desire. Six pack abs are compacted and the buttocks gathered under to correct the angle of the pelvis.<br>  <br>  Six pack abs are obtained in two parts.<br>  <br>  First part is diet and it?s best to eat low sugars and many small meals. Six pack abs are in big demand right now. However, in terms of attaining a six pack of abs in relation to building a bigger chest, sculpting your abs takes a little more work, education, and discipline. Six pack abs are heavily commercialized these days through movies and ads, and everyone would like to have one. Hence the search volume on Google is high on these search terms.<br>  <br>  The second one is desire and discipline.

qq5nceCXaa	In short no.  You may attend a consultation with your mother, though that is to a degree at the consultants discretion.<br>  <br>  It really depends on your mother's condition as to how the consultant will respond.  If your mother is mentally alert and able to put her view forward then he/she may decide that it's up to her to invite you along.  If she's having lots of elderly moments then he may be more sympathetic.<br>  <br>  To a degree the seriousness of your mother's condition comes into play.  Whilst you will be concerned, consultants are busy and will focus on those patients who have the greater need.  Fussing relatives can be a pain.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to contact the Consultant's office in the first instance and speak to the secretary.  If you have a specific question the consultant may be able to write you a letter to explain it, or he may be able to speak to you on the phone.  If he considers it appropriate he may invite you to a consultation.  The real clue is to be as specific as possible in your questions and be prepared in advance.|`|1F28QvFCaa	You're entitled to ask...the consultant is not obliged to see you but if he/she is anyway decent they probably will see you.
ivzhA4Bdaa	First off, I am not a doctor or other health professional.  Having said that...<br>  <br>  I think that you had (and probably still have) an ear infection, and your eardrum ruptured.  DO NOT put anything else in that ear canal, whether it is oil, a cotton swab, or even warm water.  You need to see a doctor NOW, and have the eardrum checked out.  The doctor will probably put you on antibiotics, which you can't get over the counter, anyway.  Don't put this off.  It's serious.<br>  <br>  A heating pad or hot water bottle will probably give you some pain relief.  So will OTC pain relievers (aspirin or Tylenol).  However, this will only give you mild, temporary relief.  It won't fix your ear.  And it won't kill the pain completely.|`|EMbaak9waa	You should go to the doctors and get this checked.|`|yzKrwvxSaa	tell it to stop|`|gjKqBJwKaa	go to an otorinolaringologist, most likely it's nothing but all the colds and stuff could have caused your eardrums to get pierced and that hurts a lot, so better get it checked.<br>  <br>  Edit: never put anything inside your ears without a doctor telling you to do so.
ivzhA4Bdaa	Teens frequently have erratic periods, as their hormones are not really regulated yet.  Stress can also lead to irregular periods, or missing periods.<br>  <br>  Are you taking proper pain medication?  Ibuprofen usually works better on period pain than aspirin or Tylenol does.<br>  <br>  Finally, if this stuff is really worrying you, you should really see a doctor.  It might be something that has a very easy fix.  Trust me, nothing you have or say will shock your doctor, and you really WON'T die of embarrassment.  I know this for a fact, because I gave birth in a teaching hospital, and I was an "interesting case", and so I had several dozen medical students examining me.  Pelvic exams.  With the other students watching.

AA12358000	Amber 18,<br>  The causes of a low blood sugar reaction may include - you did not eat all of your meals and snacks. You wait too long to eat your meals. You forget to eat your meals or snack. You exercise more than is usual. You took too much insulin. When you are having a low blood sugar reaction or hypoglycaemia you may feel – shaky. Sweaty. Sleepy or be falling asleep. Tired or confused. Hungry. Dizzy, irritable or easily angered. You may have headaches, disorientation or even become unconscious. You will need to use something sweet to help bring your blood sugar back to normal. This may include - ? cup of sweetened juice - 1 serving of fruit - 1 cup milk - 1-2 regular sweets - ? cup soda pop - 1 tbs. regular jam - 1 tbs. Honey. Sit for 10 – 15 minutes after you take the drink. When you are better, check your blood sugar and record it.  Also record the time and date of the hypoglycaemic reaction. Always carry some food and sweets with you in case of a reaction away from home.  If the reaction happens near a meal or snack time, take the snack or have the meal and carry on with your usual activities.<br>  <br>  With reference to the answer above by Nikki - may I respectfully point out that pregnant women who have never had diabetes before but who have a HIGH blood sugar (glucose) levels during pregnancy are said to have gestational diabetes, not, as you are asking about, a LOW blood sugar(glucose) level.<br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

It was so bad that I had to move back home with my parents for the remainder of my pregnancy. The doctor said it was because when a diabetic is pregnant, your body goes in overdrive and your blood sugar tends to drop more. I was advised to eat six small meals a day and snacks on time. I also had to get up during the night to check my blood sugar and eat a snack. It was very tiresome but well worth it.  I do agree with matador89 that you need to get facts instead of just taking what people say on here. I myself would advise you to log your blood sugars, the time, how much medicine you take along with your food intake and take it to your next dr appointment to discuss it with your dr. Good luck and congratulations and I hope I helped you some.

You ask why not vaccinate when the alzheimer's patient doesn't have symptoms yet. If they don't have symptoms yet, how do they know they will get alzheimer's? To determine this they would have to run additional tests (which costs more money) to figure out who is PRONE to getting the diease and even then, they may never develop it. Just because its possible you may develop something in the future doesn't mean that you will.

8WYWEDOpaa	Maybe.<br>  <br>  I've had two spine fusions.  I didn't have physical therapy after the first operation but did have it after the second.<br>  <br>  I've posted the following a few times for other people with questions. I hope I'll answer the things that have you concerned.<br>  <br>  Let me talk about the hospital stay.<br>  <br>  You'll have meds to help with the pain. You'll start out with stronger meds and then wean yourself from them over time. So, yes, it does hurt, but you shouldn't be left hurting.<br>  <br>  The size of your scar depends on how many vertebrae need fusing and the technique used to do the fusion. A four-level fusion will have a smaller scar than a 12-level fusion. Some surgeries (probably not yours) need both anterior and posterior (A/P, or front and back). Lastly, some people may be candidates for "minimally invasive" techniques. So, this is a hard question to answer without knowing more about your situation.<br>  <br>  Your hospital stay will probably be between four and seven days. Teens typically heal quicker than adults and so their hospital stay is less.<br>  <br>  As for what they do, each case is different. Here's one possible scenerio. Its incomplete as I'm describing things pretty quickly. The amount of time spent doing things will probably differ. Maybe even the order that things are done will differ. But it will give you kind of an idea of what happens. Just take it with a grain of salt.<br>  <br>  You'll arrive at the hospital early to check in. You'll change into your gown and get an IV hooked up. You will talk to your nurse(s) and perhaps a couple of other staff members. You'll then get put to sleep (injected through the IV that you had put in earlier). The operation then happens. You'll wake up, probably in the ICU, but possibly in your hospital room. Probably on the first or second day after surgery, you'll be shown how to sit and then stand. You'll be able to take walks up and down the hallway but you'll tire quickly. Your IV will be removed in a couple of days as will the catheter you've had in you since the surgery. You'll be allowed to go home once your stomach starts rumbling, you're eating, and going to the bathroom. When you are in the hospital, your scar will be checked by a doctor each day.<br>  <br>  You will feel like a truck ran you over for the first couple of days. Once your body starts to recover, you'll feel better.<br>  <br>  When you wake up from surgery, your bed will have a machine that gives measured doses of pain meds (morphine or something as effective). You're self-medicating, so if you're hurting, just hit a button. The machine won't let you overdose yourself, though.<br>  <br>  You'll be weaned off of the meds from the machine and given oxycontin (or the like). This is what you'll be taking for the first few weeks you're at home.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is that you'll be hurting, but you'll be given pain meds to take care of the pain. They'll do the job for you.<br>  <br>  It still takes two months to be doing basic things. You'll be cleared to do more things at six months. At one year, you'll be able to do about anything you could do before the surgery. Take it easy. This is major surgery. It takes a while for the spine to fuse.<br>  <br>  There's a couple of things, off-topic, that will make life easier for you. <br>  <br>  o Make sure you has a robe in case you gets up in the middle of the night when the house is colder. The surgery may mess up your body's temperature control.<br>  <br>  o Get a toilet seat extender so that you don't have to squat as far. These also have handles and certainly made my life a lot easier. Since your chest muscles are fine, you'll be able to use them to raise and lower yourself.<br>  <br>  o It might be nice to get a "grabber" which will help you pick things up from the floor.<br>  <br>  o You may or may not have a walker when you get home from the hospital (probably not, but...). I did and discovered that I had to meneuver through the bathroom door sideways because the walker was too wide. This works, but it may be a bit more difficult.<br>  <br>  o You will be sleeping an awful lot. This is a combination of your body needing rest and the pain meds knocking you out. Expect it.<br>  <br>  o When I was in my bed, my wife made kind of a "nest" with pillows so I wouldn't roll out. I don't normally roll but I think it made both of us feel better. You might want to do the same.<br>  <br>  o It will be helpful to sit in a chair with arms when you're having his meals and is sitting at the dining room table. Since your chest muscles are fine, you'll be able to use them to raise and lower yourself.<br>  <br>  Please email me if you have questions.|`|211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	In the USA, we mostly call it Physical Therapy, but after reading the definition, Physio Therapy sounds much better!!<br>  <br>  Yes, you will most definitely have therapy.<br>  <br>  I had my fusion in 2005 and am fused from T-10 to L-1.

FaqoZWM4aa	Okay, people aren't actually READING your question thoroughly. Fat rolls are when people don't exercise and then pot bellies are from eating too much take-out and not enough exercise. My dad has a pot belly and he walks most everywhere, but he doesn't go out and exercise like I do. I go for walks with my dog, and go to the park and get my heart really going.

M3pRAe7Vaa	YES!!  Smoking can definitely delay recovering from a cold or illness.  The nicotine and other chemicals in the cigarette constrict the air passageways, and cause the cilia (tiny fibers in the lungs that normally move mucus up and out) to be paralyzed.  Therefore, the more he smokes, the more mucus and phlegm is going to be stuck sitting in his lungs and airways.  This is a breeding ground for even further infection.<br>  <br>  Please guide him to stop, at least until he is fully healed from the cold.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|vrPDbUkVaa	he should stop smoking also, use vapour rub! nose drops!<br>  <br>  xx

AA11626529	It depends on the presenting history of the patient. For example, if it is a stabbing sharp pain, it's probably muscular or bone in nature. If its a dull aching pain that radiates to the left arm and over the left scapula or deltoid region, its a heart attack. If it is a central crushing chest pain that is relieved by GTN or came after some exertion, it can also be a heart attack. In the case of a heartburn, it is usually a dull epigastric central pain that can be relieved by antacids or omeprazole. <br>  <br>  What matters is what the patient tells us. If the patient tells us that the pain is relieved by resting, it's probably cardiac in origin. If the pain is relieved by antacids or gets worse when a person eats and there is a bitter sour after taste, its GERD (heart burn).|`|TueNEitraa	best way to diagnose is to see a DR.

There is no proven way to increase height other than painful drawn out expensive surgery ( I once saw a little person on TV who had surgery and it took years and she did increase her height but not drastically) You might try stretching exercises and posture improvement as this does make you appear taller. There is nothing wrong with your height. It is best to accept it and do the best you can with what you have been given. (I hope you do have a growth spurt just because you want it, but if it doesn't happen, I wish you the best and that you have confidence in yourself.)|`|A71U6gNtaa	5.4 for an 18 years old (American) is small but if your an (Asian) your height is normal,im 14 and 5'7 1/2(Asian),they told me to grow fast you need to drink milk a day and eat healthy foods especially fruits,you can still grow until 21,don't worry.|`|8bd023d619447668b8e9b545aa8635dbaa	it all depends on how you feel. if you want to grow more then start taking steps like skipping soon because the bodies physical growth especially height stops at around 20.|`|2awj8ptIaa	it would be better if u increase ur height|`|BmPK6Fwxaa	hello,<br>                dont worry every human being have their growth till their 22. daily do exercise in gem for continuously 2 hours daily. take milk in 2 secessions. have protein powder drink it may in any nutrition medical for developing their personality and superub health.|`|iC190dpfaa	I would recommend lifting weights and getting pumped.

Ich rauche nicht in U- und S-Bahn, nicht in Krankenh?usern, Rath?usern und ?hnlichen Institutionen. Wenn ich in meinem Auto unterwegs in der ?ffentlichkeit bin, rauche ich, es sind aber meine 4 W?nde, auch wenn diese sich in der ?ffentlichkeit befinden. Wenn ich in meiner Lieblingskneipe rauche, mache ich dies ?ffentlich und alle freuen sich. Der Wirt freut sich, wenn ich Geld in seinen Automaten werfe, um Zigaretten zu ziehen. Der Staat ist oberglücklich, weil er meine Steuern dringend ben?tigt. Ich habe sie nicht zum erstenmal gezahlt, denn bevor ich mein Geld vom Arbeitgeber erhalte, hat er ja schon einmal richtig abgegriffen. W?hrend jemand anders seinen Alk in der ?ffentllichkeit konsumiert (ist ja auch Privatsache), rauche ich eine. Das ist dann an der frischen (grins, wenn die Luft mal frisch w?re!)  Luft, die Autos und andere b?se b?se Verursacher verpesten. Die Diskussion ist schon superalt, g?hn. Jeder kann sich doch aufhalten, wo er will. Ich z. B. halte mich von Orten fern, wo Zigarrenraucher ihre Privatsph?re pflegen, weil es mir dort einfach stinkt! Es gibt mittlerweile schon einige Nichtrauchergastst?tten. Warum bist Du nicht etwas tolleranter? Man kann sich doch aussuchen, wohin man geht. Wenn es Dein Privatvergnügen ist, Dich unter Nichtrauchern zu vergnügen, nur zu. Ich wünsche Dir viel Spa?. Du mu?t Dich nicht unter Rauchern aufhalten, ich mu? mich nicht unter Nichtrauchern amüsieren. Das ist doch alles organiesierbar. Ich will nicht behaupten, dass Rauchen gut ist, ich behaupte aber auch nicht, das Nichtrauchen das Non-Plus-Ultra ist. Soll doch jeder dem nachgehen, was ihm pers?nlich gef?llt. Man mu? nicht immer diskutieren und versuchen, den anderen die A****karte zuzuschieben. Geh Du Deinen Privatangelegenheiten nach, wir pflegen die unseren.

3b0e16e24319d527ed803016e51959f8aa	Wei? nicht ob es Dir eventuell weiterhilft, ich habe einen guten Freund, welcher genau das gleiche Problem wie Du hatte. Verschiedene Medikamente, Spritzen, Therapien und noch einiges mehr, sogar mit Akkupunktur hat er es versucht. Mit den blühenden Weidenk?tzchen fing es an und endete mit dem letzten blühenden Grashalm und dann reagierte er sogar auf Hausstaub und bekam Asthma, war superschlimm. Seine Freundin hat ihn vor 5 Jahren zu einen Urlaub auf Gran Canaria überreden k?nnen, obwohl er sich kaum noch aus dem Haus getraute. Es war zur Zeit der Mandelblüte... es ist verrückt aber wahr, die Allergie war dort wie weggeblasen!!! Vor 4 Jahren hat er Deutschland endgültig den Rücken gekehrt und lebt ohne Medikamente hoch zufrieden auf der Trauminsel. Er kann jetzt an einer Blume schnuppern ohne nach Luft ringen zu müssen, keine tr?nenden roten Augen mehr, keine laufende Nase, keine Niesanf?lle und auch das Asthma hat sich nach und nach wieder verabschiedet. Woran es liegt wei? ich nicht, eventuell die Seeluft? Keine Ahnung, denn Pollen gibt es ja auch dort und der Hausstaub ist bestimmt nicht anders als in Deutschland.

AA12349988	I used David Lloyd and paid nearly ￡70 a month but stopped when their toilets where blocked and their was pooh that wouldn't flush down them twice in a week - they told me they didn't have the budget to repair them.

AA12123428	1. I think it's because most 16yo's are not mature enough emotionally to have a sexual relationship, even though many think they are, so the law protects them from adults with dishonourable intentions.<br>  <br>  2.

The interferons also prevents the viral replication in the cells by inhibiting the viral polymerase present.

b78619186925ee8fa039c639d2b1fc1caa	Definitely.  Your frontal lobe contains all of your personality traits, so if that area is damaged from a stroke (which is when the blood supply is cut-off to an area of the brain), personality qualities can change dramatically.  But, strokes can also affect communication.  He may not be able to understand language, but be able to speak just fine, so he might not be responding to you like he use to because he doesn't understand what you are saying.  Or, his speech may be unintelligible or jumbled, but he may be able to understand you just fine.  In that case, hearing how much you care about him can never hurt, he just won't be able to explain how grateful he truly is.  <br>  <br>  Don't feel bad about asking for some details.  Maybe ask your parents or grandmother about the area of the brain your grandpa's doctors said was affected.  Reading up about what your grandpa is going through may help you come to terms with and understand how he has changed.|`|88a552abe47806cedecc4112daad45d9aa	As the brain controls everything we say, do and think, a stroke can have a wide variety of effects. A stroke can affect personality, emotions, behavior, and the ability - <br>  <br>  To move and coordinate movement; <br>  To feel touch, temperature, pain and movement; <br>  To see or to interpret what you see; and <br>  To think, to remember, understand, plan, reason or problem-solve. <br>  He's still you Grandpa, he just has difficulty with communication.|`|b42a9423a389968c2ea070135bc3f501aa	ya they usually are never the same once it happens they act differently than what your used to|`|lGm3g5F0aa	definitely and most commonly it causes one to lose control of their emotions, cry alot, get angry. sometimes that gets better sometimes it doesnt|`|ae3f7ba39c8a304e85d01a7df6fe1a7faa	It may seem for awhile that his personality isn't there, but deep within his brain, he still is the same person, but right now, his stroke has hurt a very important organ, his brain.  In time, more and more of his personality should return, although, it may take months, or years, depending on how bad the stroke was and where it was in the brain. if he talks, he may speak with slurred words, in time, with therapy, he may be able to speak more normally, as with any injury, there has to be a healing time, and the brain and body are remarkable when it comes to healing. and you must remember that the person you love is still there, even though it might be hard for him/her to express themselves, letting them know that you love them, and you help them, will speed up the process of recovery|`|AA11280073	Yes it can. A stroke damages the brain. It is very sad but it can permanently change the person.|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	Yes this often happens after a stroke.  It is just something you have to learn to adapt to.

17b088d67647626fb8f52e0b628f36f1aa	You can avoid or control most acne with good basic skin care and the following self-care techniques: <br>  <br>  Wash problem areas with a gentle cleanser. Products such as facial scrubs, astringents and masks generally aren't recommended because they tend to irritate skin, which can worsen acne. Excessive washing and scrubbing also can irritate skin. If you tend to develop acne around your hairline, shampoo your hair frequently. <br>  Try over-the-counter acne lotion to dry excess oil and promote peeling. Look for products containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid as the active ingredient. <br>  Avoid irritants. You may want to avoid oily or greasy cosmetics, sunscreens, hair-styling products or acne concealers. Use products labeled "water-based" or "noncomedogenic." For some people, the sun worsens acne. Additionally, some acne medications can make you more susceptible to the sun's rays. Check with your doctor to see if your medication is one of these, and if so, stay out of the sun as much as possible and anytime you have to be in the sun, use sunscreen that doesn't clog your pores. <br>  Watch what touches your face. Keep your hair clean and off your face. Also avoid resting your hands or objects such as telephone receivers on your face. Tight clothing or hats also can pose a problem, especially if you'll be sweating. Sweat, dirt and oils can contribute to acne. <br>  Don't pick or squeeze blemishes. Picking or squeezing can cause infection or scarring. Most acne will clear up without this kind of intervention. If you need aggressive treatment, see your doctor or dermatologist. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You may have various options for natural acne treatment. Lotions or creams that contain alpha hydroxy acids, salicylic acid or bovine cartilage seem to reduce acne for some people. Or you might try a gel that contains tea tree oil. Some studies suggest that gels containing 5 percent tea tree oil are as effective as are lotions containing 5 percent benzoyl peroxide, although tea tree oil might work more slowly. (Note: For some people, tea tree oil may cause a skin reaction known as contact dermatitis. There's also some concern that topical products containing tea tree oil might cause breast development in young boys.) Other studies suggest that taking zinc or guggul supplements may help treat acne. Check with your doctor before taking any dietary supplements, especially if you have any underlying health conditions. If natural acne treatment isn't effective, ask your doctor or dermatologist for other suggestions.|`|ff2412c97b67f0b149eff3f689063d6baa	If you just want to go for cream use CLINGARD as it helps a lot...<br>  <br>  Or if you wanna try a home remedy take Multani Mitti powder and mix it with Tulsi juice..i.e by crushing Tulsi leaves you get some juice, mix with it and apply it to your face where you have acne and pimples...<br>  <br>  You can mix the powder with any fruit juice for that sake...if you dont get tulsi leaves.<br>  <br>  Wash your face daily atleast twice with fresh water...<br>  <br>  Avoid taking junk foods and foods with high oil and cholestrol content...<br>  <br>  Have your body cool by drinking Tender coconut juices,lime juices and so...<br>  <br>  Take fresh fruits and vegetables a lot...
tQMqdjvXaa	When I had a UTI I became so sick that I ended up in the hospital because I would pee blood. Your boobs hurt because o your period. You feel nausiated because your body is fighting an infection and of course your body isn't going to behave well during this time. You need to start takeing cranberry pills and drink TONS of water to flush out that virus in you...|`|c741f2ea044bb7b631f12f8f89cc3e68aa	The nausea and throwing up could be a symptom of the UTI. Are you sure there is no possible way you could have been pregnant because all the symptoms could have been of a miscarriage. If not, and you are on birth control pills then it is breakthrough bleeding from the interference of the antibiotics you were on from the UTI. They lesson the effectiveness of birth control and can cause you to have bleeding and the other symptoms you described. The throwing up however makes me think that you have a kidney infection if it wasnt a pregnancy.

Trim with scissors.<br>  <br>  Hair growth you describe is normal.|`|6TSwoU3yaa	Someone has already asked the question about your nationality, and this is important.

Without knowing that, I cant really tell you if it is normal or not.<br>  If you have a good relationship with your father, ask him if he has the same problem, then you will know if it is hereditary.<br>  I would not recommend that you start shaving - it usually makes things much worse, becomes very itchy and is high maintenance (you have to shave every day).  The idea of a scissor trim may be a good one, but do not cut too close to the skin because your pubic area is very thin-skinned and easily nicked.  Also, ther are lots of blood vessels around that area and you can bleed a lot more than cuts elsewhere on your body.|`|LZoUTjE7aa	i have hair in all of those places, and so do all my developed friends.<br>  <br>  its normal, and manly too so dont worry.<br>  <br>  just trim your pubes with scissors if they are getting tangled up.<br>  <br>  dont worry mate youre fine. honest <br>  <br>  hope this helps (:|`|EMDxDnlCaa	pubic hair around your butt is normal, however pubic hair on the shaft/ foreskin isn't right, you could always use scissors to trim them but be CAREFUL|`|1j30jnMIaa	It is normal|`|fJ9hHTjuaa	most guys have hair on the area between the balls and butt. its also known as the gooch.  and if your unerected penis is getting hairs in it then your pubic hair is way too long to begin with. go to wal mart and buy an electronic hair or beard trimmer. then put on the sizer to the the that says 1/4 of an inch and shave that thing. you will not get cut as the sizer is on there.
M3pRAe7Vaa	When you initially went to the doctor, you probably just had a virus, which your doctor can't do anything about.  Do you now have other symptoms, such as a fever, aches, chills, etc?  If so, It is possible that the you have now caught a bacterial infection such as tonsilitis or strep, but you may still be feeling the symptoms of a virus (can produce VERY painful sore throats).  If you are getting worse, go back and see your doctor, there is no harm is doing so.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	get a strep screen.  its going around.

You might have to poke around a bit to get a grip on them to remove them both, that's all. Don't worry! If it's the heavy flow that you're worried about, that's quite common too.

73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Be satisfied with what you have and not grieve over what you want and cant have. Have fun as often as you can. Don't judge people and don't let people judge you. As long as you aren't hurting anyone do as you wish...life is too short to waste it. Love those you love fully and with all of your heart and let them love you. Don't care what anyone thinks of you...their opinions don't matter. As long as you and the ones you love are happy then too bad if others don't like it. Give to others now and then. Either money or your time is fine. It makes you feel better about yourself to give something back and you never know how much of a lifesaver you can be to someone else. You can change someones life by babysitting for them for a few hours or inviting them for a meal or even just sitting and listening to them for an hour. Old people especially need others. Some of them are never touched from year to year. Try holding their hand while they talk to you. Recognize the world doesn't owe you anything and be happy with what you have and you will be rich in both finances and soul. Live well and laugh often.|`|vaeLtEiNaa	well, it's easy... just gather more friends and spend some quality times with them, don't get to serious everyday and always wear a smile, if possible, you should always be friendly and be religious. but most of the time, friends and family are the ones who can always make you smile.<br>  if you want to be positive, just bear in mind that, giving up are for losers and you should never lose sight of your dreams and responsibilities. <br>  always think that a happy person never fails to have a good friend.<br>  trust me, coz in our school, others call me "MS.

Its early days i could have bipolar I just dont know it yet.<br>  I know some doctors diagnose bipolar NOS or bipolar rapid cycling, or ultra rapid cycling.

You can be diagnosed there. Ordinary doctors sometimes don't have a clue what it's like to feel these symptoms. You should be able to get in pretty fast. (Mention suicidal and you'll get in REAL fast! ha ha) I wish you the best of luck. If you can't get in somewhere, try another place.|`|xUcjzYPdaa	You might have Borderline Personality Disorder.<br>  <br>  Also, if your hallucinations are caused by panic attacks, that's not mania.|`|T17pbHVJaa	There are different types of Bipolar, type 1 being very manic and the worse.

The mood swings are accurate, but normally they don't swing so rapidly. I think you could have a combination of major depression and anxiety. I personally have major depression and I know that you can have rapid mood swings (generally tending towards the depressed side) but the up-swing is rarely so high as to be called a hypomanic episode.<br>  I think it is obvious that you do need help, and that your counselor will be unable to give it to you. I highly suggest you seek professional help. I cannot stress how important it is for you to be able to think clearly.<br>  Also, please fight those suicidal thoughts. Suicide is Never a good solution.|`|m65xAqdmaa	Anyone who reads the information on bipolar would think they have it.  It's so vague & open that it applies to almost everyone.

This sound urgent as you are having bad feelings.  Modern treatments are very good.   <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|TtpOuQA1aa	I am bipolar and its far from being a made up illness (it nearly destroyed me, my children and my relationship!!) .<br>  <br>  I had counselling before  and during my initial diagnosis and my counsellor was very "down" on my psychiatrist almost laughingly asking what the doctor had told me I had. Now I was seeing this woman each week and telling her all sorts  of strange and unimaginable events that were happening in my life, like the fact that my partner was having an affair and doing it in my house at night whilst I was in bed asleep and how this woman was hiding in the house during the day but I couldn't find her! I could go on and on.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it turns out I was experiencing psychosis and this woman was going through it with me yet took the mickey out of my diagnosis!<br>  My counsellor seemed to believe that listening to me talk was going to help me more than a "label" and medication, fortunately for me and my family the medication seems to have calmed it down.<br>  <br>  You should go back to your doctor and keep going back till they find out what is wrong with you, I can't say you have bipolar and I can't say you don't as I am not qualified to diagnose you (neither is a counsellor!) but something is definitely not right and you should seek professional help. |`|fVCVknFfaa	Well maybe u could be bipolar maybe u just need a friend 2 talk 2 how old are u im a great friend 2 talk 2 at anytime u want to i.m me gone write ahead|`|kK2oqsiXaa	Chis, <br>  <br>  To twist and kill an old sayng, "If you diagnose yourself then you have a quack for a doctor." You can't be afraid you have a problem and be objective about looking for symptoms. If you feel you are bi-polar then go to a clinic and get a professional to discuss it with you. I realize finding someone good to talk to is a challenge, I'll get to that. <br>  <br>  Feeling suicidal is much more important than why but it sounds like you are reaching out for help and that's great. I appreciate your not wanting to stay in a hospital, Alec Guiness in "The Horses Mouth" said, " why go and live in an asylum before you're sent for?" <br>  <br>  I don't think it is a question of what you prefer to do, no one wants any treatment for anything, the question is what will resolve the pain you are feeling and how much time will it consume vs. the time you are losing to suffering. If you are going to kill yourself, you are far better off being treated in a hospital because you have more to lose either not being treated or not getting the treatment you need. Lesser situations are harder to figure but you sound like someone who can make the right choices.<br>  <br>  One thing I would not worry about is being embarrassed by going to a hospital, if you decide you need to go the awkwardness of having had to go will pass with time.<br>  <br>  One thing that is like Bi-Polar disorder is depression. It sounds like the depression can come and go well enough but you don't get mania of bi-polar disorder.<br>  <br>  I do think you should continue looking for a therapist. If you are having trouble finding someone you think is any good then I suggest calling a university with a clinic, and emailing the chair for a recomendation. I've done this for relatives with medical disorders when they were getting bad advice from their own doctors and it let to much better treatment. This will require some research on your part but it is a strategy that has worked for me. My experiene is that these department really like making recommendations.<br>  <br>

74530f1c293522b59e9e263928bd2299aa	Well.. I am 47 years old, spent a lot of time in the sun. I do not have a lot of sun damage.  My daughter wants to tan in a tanning booth.. but I am against those.. I suggest we ruin our skin naturally.. hahahha.. I get really good tans but I think the key is not to lay still and let the sun bake you, or tanning booth.  I have never once in my life basked in the sun.  I have been active in the sun.  Get tan just from being outside all summer.  I think if you are a person who is going to lay and bask, your are at a much higher risk for skin damage.  I think it is like baking a cake, if you bake at too high of a temp too fast, the cake will burn on the outside and still be raw in the middle.. but if you bake at an even temp, the cake comes out perfect... :)

Las preguntas, las típicas (cuando fue tu primera menstruación, de cuánto son tus ciclos, si eres regular, si tienes problemas médicos, si tomas alguna medicina, si eres sexualmente activa, etc)<br>  <br>  3-  Que precio tiene?<br>  <br>  Los precios varían dependiendo de la marca, pero alrededor de unos 12 euros el envase de 21 pastillas.<br>  <br>  4- Que tienes que hacer si un día se te olvida tomártela?<br>  <br>  Si te das cuenta del olvido antes de 12 horas simplemente toma la píldora olvidada nada más recordarlo y la siguiente a la hora habitual -así que puede ser que ese día tomes dos píldoras-. La protección anticonceptiva no se ha perdido ni siquiera aunque hayas mantenido relaciones sexuales en esas 12 horas. <br>  Si han pasado más de 12 horas desde el momento en que debieras haberla tomado, ya no se puede garantizar la eficacia anticonceptiva. Debes omitir la píldora olvidada (que se quede en el envase o se tire para evitar confusiones) y tomar la siguiente a la hora habitual. No obstante, deberás emplear durante los próximos 7 dias o, para mayor seguirdad, el resto de ese ciclo, otro método anticonceptivo (por ejemplo el condón). Esto mismo es aplicable si vomitaras o tuvieras diarrea dentro de las 3-4 horas siguientes a haber ingerido la píldora. <br>  <br>  Un saludo.|`|e3990e178840f97a51729ecd90965a73aa	debes ir al ginecólogo, el te informará sobre todo|`|bAEM5e7jaa	Hola! Desde el momento en que tienes relaciones, debes saber que siempre existen posibilidades de embarazo (en cualquier momento de tu ciclo). Ningún anticonceptivo es 100% efectivo.

(trastornos hormonales, esterilidad, cáncer de mama u ovarios...); a?ade a todo esto el síndrome post-aborto, del que nadie suele hablar, pero que tiene consecuencias terribles, que duran toda la vida.

Además toda mujer después de una cierta edad, debe tener un ginecólogo de cabecera.

KXtHjGKKaa	This sounds like a very difficult predicament, and I feel very sorry for you. Here is my advice:<br>  <br>  Although it is currently in fashion to "deinstitutionalise" people with mental health problems - and to "get them out into the community" - in reality, what people like your mum need is a safe place where they will be looked after 24 hours a day - and also a place where they will not harm others. Now, whether or not your mother actually warrants being placed in a home for the mentally ill, I don't know, however there are many brilliant ranches/centres/homes out there that can provide you with respite, and give her the attention and help that she requires.<br>  <br>  You honestly need to distance yourself from her. <br>  The fact that she is your mother does not justify her behaviour. She is torturing you - and that is enough reason for you to move away from her. Emotional abuse can be as painful as physical - if not more. Think about it this way - if she was punching you, burning you with cigarette butts, cutting you, smacking you or strangling you - you probably wouldn't think twice about distancing yourself from her. What she is doing is analogous to physical abuse - she is punching your ego, she is burning your hope, she is cutting up your life, she is smacking your partner in the face and she is strangling your life.<br>  <br>  You must understand that guilt is a natural reaction. Of course you feel that you should protect your mother. That is a natural instinct. However, you really have to look at the situation objectively. She is another human being causing you undue emotional stress - she is even driving you to contemplate suicide. That is absolutely intolerable.<br>  <br>  She is a toxic influence. And you need to get out as quickly as you can.<br>  <br>  Find out about domiciliary carers (carers who come to her home), find out about mental care homes and find out about respite centres that can provide some relief for your father. Your mother should either stay at home and be visited daily by a carer who can entertain and look after her. Or she should move into a home for people who are mentally unstable. Or she should continue living with your father, but travel to a respite home every few weeks for two or three nights at a time to give him a rest.<br>  <br>  As for you, you need to move away from your mum (emotionally, but also physically if necessary).<br>  <br>  Yes all of these changes may be expensive - but you need to work out what you value more: your money or your quality of life.<br>  <br>  You need to firmly explain to your mother that you require some time to yourself. Consider getting a new cell phone - keep the old one just for calls from her and don't give her your new number. That way you will always know when it is her calling, and you can switch off that phone for a few days if you don't want to hear from her.<br>  <br>  It sounds cruel, but no matter how close a person is to you, if they are destroying your life and driving you to want to end it - the relationship has become dangerous and you need to escape.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope it all works out. I think you should also consider seeing a counsellor. You said you were struggling financially - well you should check out what benefit schemes you can apply for. In lots of countries, low-income earners can receive free psychological advice for a period of 12 weeks or so, as long as they are referred by a general practitioner.|`|sOZoonICaa	i have a gran that is 70 years old and my uncle brian her son is 38,my uncle has no life at all and even though we all try to help him she don't allow it.If my mum asks my nan to stay with her she tells brian that if he doesn't go as well she may not be hear in the morning she really is a selfish women,she makes him cry like a baby he's not allowed to have a relationship or life at all and it's so hard when you just can't do anything to help him he is the most beautiful person in the world and she is abusive to him she calls him unthinkable names, has him up all night like a baby taking her to the loo,making him sleep in her room on a put me up bed he is like her little slave and that even though she is capable sorry to go on but it makes me so sad and angry.|`|k6CSa9caaa	Try getting to the point sooner id like to help but ive gone cross eyed from that question %D|`|Swzw9gesaa	ok 1thing 1st Breathe in and out 4 a bit. 1st go on Holiday some where to get away and think and relax. she seen well and ill but not that bad. don't cut her off maybe ring her once a month 2 c how she is. u did a ot 4 her but now start living your life.|`|XUQaRpgxaa	How about talk to a local therapist <br>  try to just to calm down and just let your feelings out<br>  i know that you just want to help your dad with cleaning his house but you have to listen to him because if you don't this is just going to cause more arguments than you already have.<br>  <br>  For your mum's case you should trust the people who are taking care of her in the psychriatic care.

CnGR2xeoaa	I don't think genital warts would be appearing around your anus, unless you've been going through the back door. It's probably not an STD, it could be hemorrhoids. Make an appointment to see the doctor first thing in the morning, you'll feel a lot better once you've been to the doctor for an examination.<br>  Often genital warts go without any symptoms whatsoever, especially in men. There is a test available for HPV, see the link below for more information. Also it is not uncommon to have false positives as well as false negatives when doing a test. If you're unsure about your last test results see your doctor and they can put you at ease.<br>  FYI - If these are warts treating them with wart remover will NOT solve the problem and I doubt it will feel pleasant in that sensitive area. You would need to see a doctor.<br>  Good Luck|`|KNnwUcpqaa	Having a STD check doesnt check for HPV. If you have your yearly PAP exam, it might detect abnormal cells from HPV, but your PAP can come back normal and you can still have HPV. There are over a 100 strains of HPV.

While you still have time though, you need to get some help.

They are called attacks because they come on suddenly, and often strong, and then decrease in severity after 10-30 minutes. I am just now getting help for Panic Disorder, which is the panic attacks and anxiety and everything. What has worked for me is to learn all I can about panic attacks, and most importantly knowing that these cannot hurt you. I am on a very low dose of medication to take the anxiety down some, but I still get anxious, but it helps clear your thinking because you can realize right away that there is nothing wrong. <br>  <br>  I would definately say go to cognitive therapy to help you learn how to cope with the attacks. Also, it's been reassuring to me to know that you cannot pass out when you have anxiety because fainting happens from low blood pressure, and when you have anxiety, your blood pressure will go up a lot, so biologically it's not possible. <br>  <br>  It's also helpful to breathe in through your nose as deep as you can, and doing it so your stomach goes out, and have your hand on it. Then hold it for 5-10 seconds, and then breathe out through your nose, and have your stomach go in. This helps slow down your breathing because a lot of panic attacks, especially the ones where you think you're going to faint, are because of fast breathing (hyperventilating). <br>  <br>  Just remember, relax! You think you're disliked because you don't have any self esteem, just like every female on earth. Self esteem work books and work with a therapist on this specific issue helps tremendously!<br>  <br>  Most importantly, remember to never take anything personal and that you can change your thinking.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|E4PsZKwkaa	Your anxiety is shared by very many people.  You have a head start as you have recorgnised your problem early in life.  You will gain a lot of help if you share these anxieties.  Drug therapy along with cognitive behavioural therapy are known to work well.  If you do not wish to bring this to the attention of anyone at the moment look for a telephone support group has talking with someone who understands your anxiety will help start you on the road to coping.  They will also be able to give you local support numbers and groups and this can be confidential.  Do not sit in silence and try to deal with your social anxiety it will not go away without you learning ways to cope.  Understand that we are all social phobics to some degree..  A new term is unfamiliar, this is probably what has triggered your latest anxiety, the trip to the mall just reinforces 'IT'S GONNA HAPPEN'.  There will be 1 in 5 people at your school going through exactly the same.  Find the courage to get some help sooner rather then later....|`|gVUfwyzTaa	Hi, I'm starting college this month. I will have to do classes that involve speaking in public as well as answering questions in public. I have suffered from social anxiety since high school, during the time that there wasn't any type of help or this condition wasn't understand as much as it is now. I would skip classes or even school if I knew that I would have to make a speech that day. I was afraid of people ridiculing me or judging me. My self esteem was very low, as a result of this I failed some classes and wasn't able to graduate with the others. My social anxiety started I think with family gatherings. My parents were divorced, but this particular day I remember my dad, who was a homosexual, he came to one of these family functions, my moms side of the family, and he was humilated and embarrassed in front of everyone. I could see his face to this very day. The shame, or maybe it was himself suffering from social anxiety that made it appear that he was having a panic attrack. I didn't understand what was happening at the time, however today I suffer from the same disorder. Whenever I get in social settings I began to panic. I can't speak out in public. I don't like confrontations for fear of being humiliated or embarrassed. I would like to be free of this constricting condition. I know that you would as well. I won't even function in certain situations with my children. It's a terrible feeling to not be able to support your children. HELP, that's how I feel whenever I'm faced with adversity. I don't want to take any medication, but I will seek help from a professional. I have to be able to trust the individual and know that they will be able to help me get better. So I say this to you get the help you need, don't delay like I have for numerous years life has passed me by. I could have been a successful individual, however fear has successfully taken over my life.|`|vzoTwVaraa	I also suffer from severe anxiety.

TC21ao0Paa	It could be a stomach bug, among other things. Any fever, chills or, sweats ?? When was your last bowel movement ( poop) ?? Is the color normal or, is it black with a tarry consistency ???? The pain may be related to an upset stomach from stress or heartburn that you may have had.Usually, people who have problems with their normal bowel routine and, vomit after eating, may suggest that you are constipated or, it could be a stomach bug. Any history of tummy ulcers ??Try to eat small meals that are easy on your tummy.Toast, scrambled eggs, soups ( mainly broth), yogurt, applesauce. It is important that you prevent becoming dehydrated from vomiting. Drink small sips of clear liquids, mainly water or gatorade.<br>  Eat fruits that are high in water content, grapes, watermelon, cantaloupe, honey dew melons ( fruit bowls are available at supermarkets). Fruits will also help with constipation.<br>  The best advice is to see your Doc to be sure that there is not an underlying physical cause related to your symptoms.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helps and that you feel better soon.|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	Dehydration is a possibility ~ some of the symptoms of dehydration are puffy bags under your eyes, dark circles under your eyes,dizzy spells and loss of balance, constant yawning, headaches and migraines, nausea, cramping, constipation and bloating and foggy thinking, irritability and moodiness..... :0)<br>  <br>  Are you sure you aren't just dehydrated buddy?? Expecting your digestive system to digest food and transport essential vitamins and nutrients with no water in your system is an extremely huge ask ............ Water is imperative to life. Without water your body will have a terrible time breathing, digesting food, transporting nutrients, lubricating your joint sockets, thinking clearly, doing anything at all really......... nothing substitutes for water. your body needs at least 2 - 3 litres of water daily to function efficiently Geez, we need at least 2 litres daily just to maintain aspiration (to breathe)!! so drink up buddy.<br>  <br>  Increase your intake of fresh filtered water 20 minutes before or after meals so as to enhance digestion rather than interfere with it ............... if you drink fluids during your meals it will only serve to dilute your digestive juices and hinder digestion ?<br>  <br>  also, try to cut back on drinks such as coffee, tea, alcohol, sodas and soft drinks (if you drink any of them) which will all do great job of dehydrating you. ......... as well as robbing you of your essential B complex of vitamins which are so very essential for healthy neural, immune and digestive functioning.......

9bba0305d55e8600abdff2bd2ae8870faa	Yes, with treatment it can.  I would highly recommend finding a therapist who specializes in the treatment of trauma.  When someone has experienced a lot of trauma, their central nervous system is constantly activated.  It can be difficult to regulate emotions, and they may feel anxious and unsafe much of the time.  There are various techniques that a trauma specialist can use to help discharge some of that stored traumatic energy (that lives in the body).  Such techniques include EMDR <a href="http://www.emdr.com/q&a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emdr.com/q&a.htm</a> and Somatic Experiencing <a href="http://www.traumahealing.com/registry.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.traumahealing.com/registry.ht...</a><br>  <br>  If YOU feel that something is wrong, TRUST that, and get help.

Well, yes one could do a lot of hard work and really get educated about their disorder and actually get better in time after delving again and again into the problem and all the surrounding issues and why you've reacted to your experiences specificly in the way that you do, etc., but only if the rest of one's life were conducive to healing.

In fact several different studies by the American Psychological Association have found that people with PTSD do better if they work through the stressor ( the incident ) with trusted friends or relatives. You need to discuss your feelings and have someone willing to be empathetic. No one can know "how" you feel about whatever caused the PTSD but having someone validate your feelings will go a long way

To tip the scales in your favor, focus on nutritious high-calorie foods that are low in saturated fats, such as nuts or 100 percent fruit juices. Here are other calorie-rich foods to choose from: bagels, low-fat granola, canned fruit in syrup, dried fruit, avocados, olives, peas, corn, nut butters, oily fish (like salmon), beans, cheese, oils, and salad dressings. <br>  <br>  Try sneaking some of these foods into your meals.

I am dealing with depression as well, and my SSRIs are definitely affecting not only my interest in sex but the level of enjoyment associated with sexual activity.|`|Eku8XD2Gaa	along with antidepressants try some breathing exercises and dark chocolates they will help u a lot.<br>  <a href="http://www.healthmad.com/Mental-Health/Simple-Breathing-Techniques-to-Combat-Day-to-Day-Stress.442517" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthmad.com/Mental-Health/S...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.healthmad.com/Health/Blissful-Delighted-Contended-and-Easy-Going-Chocoholics.467167" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthmad.com/Health/Blissful...</a> <br>  <br>  and loss of sexual pleasure can be a possibilty, when depressed usually nothing diverts ur mind. try some new method to masturbate that will be helpful|`|6TSwoU3yaa	Any drugs will have some effect on your sexuality, that is why you should avaoid drugs whenever you can.<br>  Depression is probably a greater retardant of sexual desire.<br>  Are you seeing a doctor about these problems?  It would be a good idea to do so if you are not already.
GfG6wupTaa	The meds will do that. Normal. Talk to your doctor about Viagra or something like that. Hope you have insurance though, they are expensive.|`|cr2KKT6Naa	you might of wore the little guy out. give it a rest.

oRIWyTZxaa	You need to reduce your drinking habit slowly but steadily.  You can do work outs and restrict your diet.  You contact your physio therapist for further action|`|CYCIlR7Eaa	I had a friend who had a drinking habit(every day 10 pints) for years and his complexion was terrible. Big red boils, red puffy face and he was like this for years.<br>  <br>  He broke his hip and had to stay in hospital for a month. This meant no alcohol. I went to see him after 3 weeks and his complexion was totally clear. I couldn't believe it. He looked years younger and healthy.<br>  <br>  When he got out of hospital, he went back to drinking 10 pints a day and he is now back to square 1.<br>  <br>  True story.<br>  Hope this helps.
v3Motq8Iaa	Try turning down the heat, sleeping with fewer blankets, open a window, etc.  Happened to me before (was just too warm).|`|Dfppbeo8aa	Sounds like menopausal night sweats!

GfG6wupTaa	A GP can tell you if it needs further looking into. But a biopsy will show if it is benign. You could go to the er and apply for charity care and some doctors accept that.
CYCIlR7Eaa	Forget about taking any supplements to make you lose weight. Just be active in your life and eat sensible amounts of good lean food. Don't starve yourself thinking this will help you shift fat quickly, it won't. In fact it could do the opposite by making your body hang on to your stored fat because it will go into preservation mode thinking it won't know when it will get any more food. <br>  <br>  You're only young and just have natural puppy fat that will melt away if you stay active and eat right.<br>  <br>  Your time will come.|`|027f718c10034b9410bd7f94684f6da6aa	This is the fastest but not the easiest. DO NOT take diet pills. They can do some serious harm to your heart. Plus they're a waste of money.<br>  Here's what you do:<br>  <br>  Cut out all breads, pasta, cookies, cereals, crackers, chocolate, sweets, icecream, cakes, pizza, all fast food etc...basically anything made from flour & away from sugar. They are all called simple carbs. This is what makes us fat. Those foods leave us hungry for more...<br>  We need to have complex carbs. (fruits, veggies, salads, protein.)<br>  If you want a snack like crackers or something...go buy gluten free rice cakes from health food store. Snack on 1 or 2 a day. Make sure you have cut up carrot sticks to munch on also. By doing this...you will lose lots of weight.<br>  Avoid cold cut meats. If you can, stay away from dairy products...<br>  I'll give you an example of what to eat okay.?<br>  <br>  breakfast: 1 banana & 1 kiwi or orange<br>  cup of coffee or tea (no milk or sugar)<br>  drink 2-3 glasses of water<br>  <br>  lunch: grilled chicken or turkey breast(portion should be the size of your palm) w/ some lemon squeezed on it...mmm I like lemon<br>  romaine lettuce salad, tomato, grn onions, grated carrot, radish & whatever other green you like in there. Dressing should be balsamic vinegar or wine vinegar w/ olive oil.<br>  stay away from ketchup, mayo & bbq. sauce<br>  <br>  snack:14 walnut halves or 20 almonds<br>  a fruit<br>  lots of water<br>  some tea<br>  <br>  dinner: hamburger or fish w/ brocolli or spinach<br>  you can have 1 or 2 rice crackers<br>  lots of water<br>  cup of chamomile<br>  <br>  before bed: pray to the Lord to help you lose weight. To give you self control. Keep asking until you receive. The Lord hears you & loves you.<br>  <br>  The secret to success is to be "organized & committed".<br>  You should have your salad or greens washed & cut up the night before so it's ready to eat for lunch the next day.<br>  Make sure you have bought all your ingredients/food the day before.<br>  <br>  Take a multi-vitamin & calcium every day.<br>  <br>  It's not impossible to do...just believe you can do it.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to exercise, drink lots & lots of water & you will see results. Here's a site for exercises: Ignore the diet pill ads...<br>  <a href="http://www.fatx101.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fatx101.com/</a>|`|oRIWyTZxaa	Regular cardio and targeted strength moves will do the trick. Genetics plays a role in where you store fat, but the upper back is also a tough area to home in on.  Many of the moves you do every day are in front of you (swinging a tennis racket, carrying bags), which works the chest, not the back. Plus, most women don't work their back muscles. To refocus your routine, do cardio for 30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week. Rowing and boxing with a bag will help tone back muscles and burn fat all over. In the weight room, do 2 or 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps of bent-over flyes (hold a dumbbell in each hand, bend over at your hips, and draw your arms out to each side to shoulder height). Those bra bulges should start to vanish in about a month
UL3XOKJxaa	Well written question...you should not have any trouble with speech or annuciation. Even if you experience the parathesia,  the tongue will adapt and the speech should not be affected.

But I am sure that your reaction to a nipple cripple, would be just to give one straight back!

You shouldn't touch a girl's breast, no matter what.  She can say you sexually harassed her or something.  I still think that she should not dish something out and not expect retaliation.  She should be able to take what she hands out.  But, it is a touchy situation, because it was her breast.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't want to hang around somebody hurting me.  I can't blame you for being upset.  I don't think it was right of her to do that to you and expect you not to react.  <br>  <br>  You need to talk to her.  Tell her that you are sorry for touching her there, but that you reacted in pain without thinking.  Mostly so you won't get into trouble. Tell her you are sorry, but you expect her to respect you, too.  In the future resist the urge to touch a girl in a private place.  I know she didn't do you right, though.|`|SXqYdNpsaa	She shouldn't do things that make her mad when someone does it to her.

3751a4b1d4b23b35720ed11a646c06ddaa	Progeria narrowly refers to Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome, but the term is also used more generally to describe any of the so-called "accelerated aging diseases". The word progeria is derived from the Greek for "prematurely old". Because the "accelerated aging" diseases display different aspects of aging, but never every aspect, they are often called segmental progerias by biogerontologists.<br>  <br>  Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome is an extremely rare genetic condition which causes physical changes that resemble greatly accelerated aging in sufferers. The disease affects between 1 in 4 million (estimated actual) and 1 in 8 million (reported) newborns. Currently, there are approximately 40-45 known cases in the world. There is no known cure. Most people with progeria die around 13 years of age. [1] Progeria is of interest to scientists because the disease may reveal clues about factors involved in the process of aging. Unlike most other "accelerated aging diseases" (such as Werner's syndrome, Cockayne's syndrome or xeroderma pigmentosum), progeria is not caused by defective DNA repair.<br>  <br>  The condition was first identified in 1886 by Jonathan Hutchinson and Hastings Gilford. The condition was later named Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS). Around 100 cases have been identified since then.|`|a02e14729f156bf36a6e175f9f72f677aa	Hello  =)<br>  <br>  You're close....it's progeria.....<br>  <br>  Namaste, and Happy New Year,<br>  <br>  --Tom|`|AA11789739	Progeria or progheria.|`|ed220dbd957dcec9e0aeee6c68e9467aaa	progeria

If your daughters health is at risk then you are doing the right thing...if it is a matter of health and has to be done then that is fine......ignore society and keep on being a good father, and your children will learn what is right is not always what society says!! Good luck!!|`|2acfbf557aa74f0dda19432a2313ce4faa	Most people know that not all men are pervs but the sad truth is that there are a lot of them and family members are the most likely abusers.

Sorry, but I am backing Shamrock 100% here.  12 years old.. no need for gyn exam, no need for pill or anything like that.  And ya know what else? Even though I am a single mom, my son, when he was younger, if it were going to be an exam concerning his genitals, I simply told him I would leave the room, and let him be with the doctor.  Even kids deserve that kind of privacy.  Now if he was afraid, and wanted me to stay, that would be a whole different story.  You should NOT be in the exam room during a pelvic.  There is nurse there to keep eye.  Woohoo Shamrock, for your answer.  And, even when my daughter goes for her first pelvic, I will be right outside that door if she needs me.. not in there with her.|`|10fcc5ab0d67a6110220e0bc1ba8a3f8aa	Wow!

AA11026141	If you  are sexually attracted to males and desire sexual relations with them (whether you act on those desires or not) you are likely heterosexual or bisexual.  Similarly, if you are sexually attracted to females and feel sexual desire for them, you are likely homosexual or bisexual.  Being turned on by images of sexual behavior or finding women interesting to look at is not a reliable indicator of sexual orientation.  Some heterosexual women find images of 2 women together to be arousing to look at but have no real desire to have sex with another female.  Think about what person or people turn you on and arouse your desire in the real world.

In between each spine is a disc (known as an intervertebral disc). This disc is made of an elastic tissue and collagen fibres. It acts as a cusion and support the back during physical movements. However, when there is a sudden compression of the disc, such as during a bad high jump, it may cause a rupture of the disc or the central part known as a nucleus pulposes moves out of the disc.<br>  <br>  When this occurs, the nerve fibres than exit just beside the disc are compressed on. This may then cause pain along the regions the the nerve root supplies such as back and thigh pain.<br>  <br>  Usually it may heal in about 6 weeks. Pain medication are often provided to relieve the pain. Non surgical (conservative) treatment involved physiotherapy, NSAIDs, steroids, chiro and surgery involves artificial disc implantation and microdisectomy (basically removing a small portion of the disc and setting it back.)|`|168013d888cf5417290d2de5b190d141aa	Go to a Orthopedic Dr he may want a upright mri scan to see the complete pathology Here is some info <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/upright_mri/messages">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/upr...</a>

It was one of those situations where the guy said whatever he had to in order to get in my pants. It really makes it hard to accept that I trusted him enough to get that close. It doesn't happen to everyone that way and some people don't have the same feelings about the experience that I do. I really believed that it was just a physical act and wasn't that big a deal. I've changed my mind. I wish now that I had waited until I was either engaged or married. It's just hard to tell sometimes who is genuine and who is not. It's all about judgement.

The chicken is tender and not dry.   I believe there is less calories without the skin and you don't then use the stock.  There is nothing to be gained by a diet which is not varied.  A diet should be a lifestyle change where you learn to mix up a good set of foods.

lkoezvepaa	It accually is. I have seen it in "Mythbusters" a show that test miths and they tested many ways and it came true. Well, I didn't know since I watched that show. So they tested in many ways and it came true...<br>  <br>  Not necessarily. It depends on the human, and it depends on the dog. Some dogs have such heavy tartar accumulation on their teeth that they actually have PUS leaking out from underneath it at their gumline, and rotting teeth/bone as a result. The same thing happens to some people with poor oral hygiene. Dogs that eat "table scraps" far and away have the worst teeth like that.<br>  <br>  Dogs sometimes eat their own feces and feces of other animals, lick their anal areas (in which case they often lick/swallow the nasty contents of their anal sacs), and don't brush/floss daily. Not all people brush/floss daily, either....but I'm betting they don't engage in the first 2 behaviors as a general rule. ;-)|`|MlXn6X3Haa	that is kind of true we actually have certain bacteria in our mouth that dogs do not so we could actually get them sick.

Sensory integration/processing disorders can take many different forms and can manifest themselves in many different ways.<br>  <br>  Much more information is needed in order for any advice to be given.<br>  <br>  In response to your additional post....<br>  <br>  Sounds like a sensory problem.  Not autism.  I would go to the link below and reassure yourself that he is not autistic.  They have video of normal responses and autistic responses to stimulus.  The fact that he prefers you and speaks at 2 are great signs that he is probably NOT autistic.<br>  <br>  The Out of Sync child (which you can buy at any bookstore).  Has questionaires and such that will allow you to figure out what exactly your grandson is struggling with.  Just from what you said about food, he's definitely over-sensitive in the oral department.  A child who was undersensitive (which can also be an issue) would eat everything in sight.  <br>  <br>  The good news is that an occupational therapist can REALLY help in this area.  Your grandson may be having trouble using his tongue and lips properly to chew food or he could be overly sensitive to taste or overly sensitive to texture.  All of which can be modified with therapy.<br>  <br>  Having an overly sensitive child myself, I know the struggles that go along with it.  I've seen it described as if all the senses were set on super high volume.  The goal of therapy is to desensitize your grandson so that he can function normally.  <br>  <br>  His seperation anxiety with regards to you could truly be a response to the environment you are providing for him.  Do you have a quiet, uncluttered, peaceful home?  That may be what he needs and so resists being pulled away from it.<br>  <br>  Just some ideas.  Read the Out of Sync child.  It's my best advice.  It also has great ideas as to what you can do at home to help your grandson cope with this sensory world.  If you decide this is his issue, buy the Out of Sync child has fun.  It's full of games that each have a sensory purpose that allows the sensory child to begin working on his particular area of difficulty while having fun.

It is actually something that you do as a daily part of the Master Cleanse fast, however you can do this by itself.<br>  <br>  All you need to do is in the evening before you go to bed drink a cup of herbal laxative tea which is primarily senna leaf tea. then first thing when you wake up you drink down 32 oz of water with 2 tsp of Celtic gray sea salt. with in an hour everything will flush out of your system. For whatever reason the salt water stays intact and is not absorbed by the body so it passes through the stomach, intestines and colon flushing them out.<br>  <br>  I have done the master cleanse several times and this is an everyday part of that, so I know it works....its hard getting down the salt water, but it works.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	Check out www.colemaboards.com.

It's a form of masturbation. Don't feel guilty about it.|`|Qa3FHeeXaa	I would not do that anymore. The problem is that there are Lactobacilli inside the vagina, which is a good thing, because the avoid colonization with other - more pathogen - bacteria. They also keep the pH value normal. If you do vaginal douche too often, this bacteria will be washed out and you're at increased risk of vaginal infection, which can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease.|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	The clitoris is covered by the clitoral hood.

IeDV4VkVaa	It will probably take a couple months for your cycle to get back on track but it eventually will. Stopping the pill now will cause irregular bleeding and spotting until then so be careful.|`|KHsWu1zbaa	This is what happens when you take the pill. It doesn't happen to everyone, but some pills affect people differently. <br>  <br>  The pills instructions tell you to take the pill for THREE MONTHS, to give your body a chance to adjust to the hormones. Taking it for 15 days and giving up is not giving it a good chance to see if the pills right for you.<br>  <br>  Your periods will straighten out if you continue taking the pill, but what you're having is just breakthrough bleeding/spotting and this is common when women go on b.c. pills. <br>  <br>  If you "just stop" your body will be "triggered" to start your period, so yes, most likely you will get it once you stop.|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Speak to your Doc about this, I just stopped all my contraception wiuthout consulting the doctor and I've never had a regular period lol.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck x|`|8moacKr5aa	the same has happen to me last month i went to the Doctor she told me i might miss a pill i told her i never miss a pill , she said its a regular thing keep talking the pill until you finish all the tabs<br>  |`|8a11d5b2667823780b3a66cbb0541adfaa	just keep taking it. if you dont like it you can ask your doctor for a different type of birth control. i have the iud and love it. i couldnt keep up with taking a pill everyday.|`|nGYy9lxuaa	either finish out the pill<br>  <br>  or if you do stop you will get your period a few days after you stop and your body might feel weird since you have to get you body back to normal|`|GqfW2Fs1aa	Since you've only been on the pill for 15 days, your body is getting use to it, which is a reason why your periods are irregular right now. In about a couple months your periods should get back on track and be a lot shorter. If you stop the pill right now your body will be messed up! I was on the pill for about a year before I stop. I bleed for 3 months straight and not to mention I got pregnant pretty easy. No need to be scared about the pill, it will work as long as you take it everyday.|`|d8a3NhDnaa	it will depend on your body everyone is different

xjvbE9jEaa	Lol. ok calm down. seriously nw, its not TSS. Im assuming that u just had a mild anxiety attack. U were probably stressing to much when U were putting it in. that kinda happened to me the 1st time I did it because u dont really know what to expect. Try it again but before u do u need to relax ur body and mild, have a glass of water and take deep breaths, when u feel u r calm enough then go ahead and do it. in my personal opinion, i feel tampons r way beta than pads because I dnt get the horrible cramps that I used to have when using a pad. its also much more comfortable than a pad, coz u dont even know its there, u just need to change it every 6 - 8 hours and ul be fine|`|tLXD3yOWaa	you didnt even wear it for 10 minutes it cant be TSS. it just sounds like you had an anxiety attack. if its only your third period i wouldnt recommend tampons until you are entirely used to what's happening to you. just wait a while but you will be fine. there's also nothing to worry about using tampons i use them and nothing bad has ever happened to me.|`|Js09FbDnaa	sounds like you had a panic attack.<br>  <br>  TSS comes from having the tampon in for too long and your body starts to fight it like a foreign object.

6PhSENcXaa	Some times with elderly people the pump is so much easier then trying to give themselves shots.  My son who is 27 has the insulin pump and he loves it.  It's and easier way to control your diabetes without sticking yourself with the needle every day. <br>  Your grandpa will do fine with his insulin pump!  If you ask him about it he just might explain how simple it is once you  get use to it.  Plus it will give you a better understanding about this pump.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	It's frustrating when people like Gary B insinuate that if you are on insulin or an insulin pump, that you must "not be a very good patient".  All Type 1's and many Type 2's need insulin right from the start, it's simply what the body needs.  Pumps are great!  They give you so much more freedom and you can set different levels of insulin for different times of day.  I'm thankful your Grandpa has such a great tool to help him manage his diabetes.|`|pRF5LLloaa	With his other health problems, it seems probably that the doctor needs take STRONG action against the diabetes to prevent complications.<br>  <br>  Diabetes is VERY serious.  Not only does it affect his heart by causing high blood pressure, it also reduces his ability to heal, and it make the  cancer fighting medicines much less efficient.<br>  <br>  Apparently, you Grandpa is not a very good patient, but the doctor needs STRICT control of the blood sugars in order to help your grandpa with his other problems.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	All of us who have to take multiple daily injections (MDI) would be a lot happier to have to "inject" once every 3 to 4 days rather than 4+ times a day! It is just a much easier way to try to deal with the insulin problem.<br>  <br>  The cancer will make the other problems like diabetes less easy to control. Sometimes the cancer cells put out a "insulin like" substance which makes taking injections very hard to deal with.

CyjuTf0raa	Though it may be the case, you don't necessarily have the "to-close" vein. It might be the air around you is too dry, and is irritating your nose enough to cause bleeding. Also, it may be that you are moving your nose before the blood has effectively scabbed, and you are perpetuating the cycle. First, get a bag of ice and place it over the back of your neck; this will constrict the blood vessels and slow the bleeding. Then form a clog with a paper towel in your nostril and leaving it there for a while, even if you think you've stopped bleeding. It might help the cut/crack/etc. scab over better. Then be sure to not pick, scratch or blow your nose for several hours, at risk of re-opening the wound. If it does persist, however, go to a doctor and let them check you out. :)|`|AA11280073	You have to go to  a Dr. and have a vein in your nose cauterized. It doesn't hurt.

The doc said dry air.I live in Colorado with very low humidity.  She told me to pinch my nose - direct pressure to stop it.  That  didn't work for me. I ended up putting ice over the top of the nose where you pinch it, and the ice actually stopped the bleeding.  <br>  <br>  check out Webmd who says ice packs don't work, but it did for me.  They give the same suggestion as my doctor did - from WebMD - "Most nosebleeds occur during the winter in cold, dry climates. If you are prone to nosebleeds, use a humidifier in your home. Use petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or a saline nasal spray to keep your nasal passages moist. "<br>  .

Does it smell? Yeast infections or candidiasis cause a thick, whitish-gray "cottage cheese" type of vaginal discharge and may be itchy. You may have intense itching in your genitals. Painful urination and intercourse are common. Though you may not always have a vaginal discharge. Another one might be Trichomoniasis which causes a frothy vaginal discharge that may be yellow-green or gray, itching and irritation of the genitals, burning with urination (sometimes confused with a urinary tract infection), discomfort during intercourse, and a foul smell. Because trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease, symptoms may appear within 4-20 days after exposure. Men rarely have symptoms, but if they do, they may have a thin, whitish discharge from the penis and painful or difficult urination.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	I'm sure if it was one of these people that had it, they wouldn't be coming up with worst case scenerio for a freakin' bump.<br>  <br>  It could be razor burn, and it really sounds like it could be an ingrown hair.<br>  <br>  It doesn't sound like a yeast infection.. it will probably go away in a couple of days.

13k2WKx8aa	You're prone to worry about just about anything depending on what triggers the anxiety.<br>  <br>  If you want to, you can tack one more thing on the board. You're also a hypochondriac. That's why when you read about something you start thinking you have the symptoms. Have you ever gone to the doctors because of this (not for, but because you thought you had symptoms). ^_^<br>  <br>  Just remember that symptoms for things like cancers can be very broad. If you read this page on Y!A enough, you'll find people mistaking something like their common cold for something like HIV or Japanese Encephalitis.<br>  <br>  People tend to over-react when they start matching their symptoms to exotic and uncommon conditions and diseases.|`|UVOpjpkyaa	I've got both OCD and anxiety problems. I don't have hypochondria however. OCD makes you obsessive about your worries that most discard after seconds of rational thought. You've got to face the facts. These diseases don't run in your family and they never will. The odds of you actually having one of these random diseases is virtually impossible. The odds me being your next door neighbor are more likely...and I'm not your neighbor. See my point?|`|HDw5HhPbaa	OK not all people with anxiety think they have a disease if we ready about it. But I have anxiety and understand why you would. <br>  <br>  I have read up a lot about my condition and it states in one of my books that, we all have the same thoughts, bad and good, however someone without anxiety does not give importance to all of their thoughts and filters out the negative or ridiculous. However someone with anxiety gives importance to pretty much all their thoughts and dwells on them for hours at a time. Specifically the bad ones. <br>  <br>  Hence why you may ready about something and then instantly think you have it cause you dwell on the thought of it. <br>  <br>  You might want to look at Hypochondriac too. this is a <br>  conidtion also. <br>  <br>  somebody who is unduly preoccupied with personal health and believes that illness is nearly always present or imminent<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	I wish I knew the answers to these questions... or that my doctor knew the answers.<br>  <br>  I'm 40 and have suffered severe depression and anxiety due to my OCD and Health Anxiety since my 20's.  Most recently it's been lung cancer... which would make you wonder why someone with health anxiety would smoke.  :(   I can't answer that.   But after THREE spirometry tests from a doctor that understands I'm a hypochondriac, my lung function is still 99%.<br>  <br>  Last year it was Lou Gherig's disease, which he saw me several times for.... I read about it and immediately started having muscle twitches all over my body (you could see them!!) and that lasted for 4 months.<br>  <br>  Before Lou Gherig's it was ovarian cancer, which my sweet doctor took care of with an abdominal CT Scan... "I just went ahead and checked everything", he said. lol....all was fine.<br>  <br>  I'm currently on Prozac and Zanax, but still have plenty of bad days.  I wish I had a few answers for you, but just wanted you to know that you aren't alone.|`|rpnFxnCQaa	Joanna,<br>  <br>  I can relate to how you feel. I had anxiety attacks too. I was thinking too much. For me, that was when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of the side effects. That's when I discovered a program that cured me. It is a 100% natural method. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a> <br>  <br>  The key of that technique is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You know what I mean? You are thinking too much. You have to get out of that loop. You can get rid of it - others have. I have.<br>  <br>  There is always a solution!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

bf5698d28d59a0e95f4146ab7c9efa53aa	Because the position of the rash, and the length of time you have been affected, it sounds like you have Eczema. It's a chronic eruption of red patches accompanied by intense itching that usually begins in infancy but may continue into adult life; the disease has a genetic predisposition, but its expression is modified by environmental factors. It doens't always appear at birth, and is not necessarily a genetic thing, so I'm guessing that this is what you have.<br>  <br>  As for the nasal spray,<br>  I have no idea as to why that seems to work.<br>  Be careful with it, it might hurt you in the long run.<br>  <br>  But be sure to get to a doctor, they can prescribe an ointment that will help with the swelling of the bumps and the itchiness. <br>  <br>  Good luck. :]<br>  <br>  Edit: Here's a better definition of the condition. This might help you match your case better.<br>  A noncontagious inflammation of the skin, characterized chiefly by redness, itching, and the outbreak of lesions that may discharge serous matter and become encrusted and scaly.

Do the following exercises:<br>  <br>  Use a 2 or 5 lb weight and bend over, with your arms at your side, bend your arms below the elbow and then straighten them holding the weights. these are called tricep kickbacks.

KUcsN2wUaa	Depression can screw up your thinking and it tends to put everything in your life in a bad light.  It could be that he is worried that he will wreck your life as the depression has him thinking that anything that he goes near gets messed up.

yHHdAMnQaa	I am on 400mg once a day before bed.. It does make you have big Weight gain and makes you sleepy that's why unless you have schizophrenia your psychiatrist normally make you take it before you sleep. Yes it does make you want to eat more too. 100mg is not a strong dose. Depends on your illness, some people take 400mg to 500mg or more three times a day and that is for really serious mental problems. Even if you tired very hard to loose weight and this medication makes your weight gain. SO what? You rather have it cure your mental disorder and makes you better then you can go on a diet or rather not have weight gain and not have this medication to heal you and one day you go sudicial and youre dead. Dead and fit or you rather be alive and a bit fat..|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Usually seroquel is started at 50mg, is that all you are taking?  Seroquel and Inderal?  100mg isn't much, most people take alot more than that.  <br>  <br>  My mother who is bipolar takes Seroquel, her normal dose is 400mg but when manic it goes up to 600mg.  She is also on Mellaril (its a really old med), ativan, and ambien.  She is more a mixed episode depressed person<br>  <br>  My sister in law takes Seroquel too for her bipolar.  She takes 200mg but also takes Risperdal.  She is taking Lamictal, depokote, klonipin (anxiety-as needed), and ambien (sleep as needed).  The depokote and lamictal have a synergistic effect.  Seroquel is taken at night because it helps with sleep, my SIL takes the Risperdal in the AM.  Depokote she takes in the morning and at night.  She is more a manic person and sometimes has mixed episodes<br>  <br>  Both maintain there wait but struggle somewhat to do so, both are mildly overweight to overweight.  Zyprexa put weight on my SIL and it was changed.  Both are functioning, they both drive, SIL is employed, mom is retired, both married<br>  <br>  The lowest therapeutic dose of seroquel according to my davis drug guide is 50mg/day|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Your dosage is way to high, it is a wonder that you can even function in the morning.  I would cut the dosage in half and try that, my wife even cut her dosage into quarters, which is 25 mg a night.  That seems to work best for her, it allows her to sleep but still wake up and function in the morning.  Also, Seroquel does cause weight gain.  You poor thing, how can you even type this morning?|`|AA10236694	i was given 100 mg at bedtime but after two years and 110lbs of weight gain they realized it was causing a rare disorder called <br>      Sleep Eating.
xzwZ3lt3aa	Why do so many obese people still eat burgers. Take a look at the fast food restaurants. Mostly fat people. Do they not know they are at a huge risk of dying of heart disease, from high blood pressure, high cholesterol. diabetes? Of course they know. They are addicted to food . Smoking is the same. They are addicts. Smokers would love to quit,, however nicotine is a very powerful drug, and the withdrawl symptoms are not very pleasant. It takes tremendous willpower to quit smoking, and the drug addiction prevents them from thinking about lung cancer. They will automatically think they are in the percentage that will never develop health problems associated with smoking. After all not everyone who smokes will get cancer. Just like some people who have never smoked will die from lung cancer.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	it's an addiction, and not everyone does get lung cancer from smoking.<br>  for the most part, they do it because they like doing it.  Think about it, people jump out of airplanes for the thrill, there is always the risk that the chute will not function properly and they can and do die very quickly, but they still do it.  More people die on our roads in car accidents than from heart disease and cancer combined, but people still drive...  all you can do is what you know to be best for you.  Trying to understand the motives and desires of others will only leave you confused at things you have no chance of understanding.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	I started smoking when I was 15 due to peer pressure.  It was the cool thing to do with the group I hung out with.  From there I got addicted and tried many times unsuccessfully to quit.<br>  <br>  March 31, 2008 I was able to finally quit after 13 years of smoking regularly.|`|AA11142539	Here's an answer that's bound to piss people off:<br>  <br>  Smoking does not give you lung cancer.<br>  <br>  Cigarette smoke contains many carcinogens, which will increase the risk of you developing cancer, and often by a scary degree, but the generally accepted "fact" that smoking gives people lung cancer is both inaccurate and misleading.  There are lots of people who smoked their entire lives without suffering from cancer.  There's also a lot of people that have multitudes of health problems that are at least seriously antagonized by smoking.<br>  <br>  So in answer to your question, as it does not include a DEFINITE result like lung cancer, many people think the risk is insignificant when they start, and then they can't stop.|`|jrVlzffeaa	Because some people are incredibly nieve and are selfish, they obviously don't stop and think that what they're doing doesn't just affect them it affects people around them and their loved ones, and then they moan when they get lung cancer from smoking!!

67ea71af780ce95553f2ddb1eddee690aa	It sounds unfair for you to be denied an educational course due to behavior issues. That might be something you could address with the student services coordinator (or counselor).<br>  <br>  As far as changing yourself try to take a different angle of approach. Learn to love and respect yourself and seperate YOU as an individual from your PERSONALITY. Self discipline is key here. You're just going to have to realize that you are one of those folks prone to acting out when you get bored. I believe it's called ADHD  :))<br>  <br>  You'll be fine though...you're probably just going through that phase in your life where everyone meets that brick wall because you're still developing your personality and seem to dislike yourself and who you  are. You're projecting negativity inwards towards yourself and at the same time, isolating yourself from others, using avoidant behavior as a reason to get really frustrated. You could always try and force yourself to: A) In the presence of others - Keep your opinions and thoughts to yourself (that's hard to do sometimes...I'm a talker too and understand where you're coming from about that) --B) Understand that other people are individuals too and are entitled to their own thoughts and opinions no matter how dumb they might be -- C) Get a hobby that will let you blow off some steam (take up martial arts or dancing, archery or bowling,anything physically active to assist you in burning any excess pent up energy -- D) Keep a journal. Go to the store or get a notebook and special pen and find a good hiding spot...because people will try to get your journal and read it sometimes...anyway, keeping a journal of how you feel, what you're thinking and any obvious triggers you can detect that are setting you off. E) Don't yield to the pressure of others. YOU are YOU and if they don't like you for who you are, develop that attitude of "screw them"....you don't need THEM to define who you are. Only you can do that.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RVicFEyFaa	No offense but you could simply be suffering from being a drama queen at 16  or have an adolescent case of A.D.D (attention deficit disorder).

2QOcTTTuaa	Yes, megadosing on Vitamin C is good for fighting off a virus.  Take the same dose 3 - 4 times throughout the day.  You may reach a point of "bowel tolerance" where your bowels become looser.  At that point, back off the dosage by one dose.  Vitamin C is water-soluble and non-toxic, so when your body is getting more that you actually need to heal, the rest is flushed out through the bowels.  Continue megadosing until you feel better.  Get well soon!|`|F4DhYjlnaa	I take 2000 mg of vitamin C every day. What your body doesn't use gets flushed out when you P.

Also, fruits with Vitamin C also contain BioFlavanoids which work in synergy with the Vitamin C so it is more effective. Natural Vitamin C also contains 100 chemicals closely related to Vitamin C, whereas supplements are made from corn syrup in a lab and contain only one chemical. Try to get at least some Vitamin C from natural sources, a few oranges and a Kiwi will help your cold better than Vitamin C supplements alone.|`|FONamjzIaa	I've heard that you should for a day take about 1000mg of V.C every hour till you get loose stool.

It's especially hard to comprehend when you can't find a reason. Unfortunately, people can just pass away suddenly even when seemingly healthy. She may have had a weak heart that gave out on her - I had a friend in high school who passed away similarly. It turned out that she had an undetected heart problem. <br>  <br>  Take all the time you need to grieve.

2GHnbyC2aa	Novia, please accept my condolences for your loss. To help you understand, tumors can either be cancerous or non-cancerous.  What this means is that cancers spread to distant organs and non-cancerous tumors do not spread that way.  However, even though a tumor is not cancer, it can still grow much larger in the space where you find it.  It sounds that your mom had two different kinds of non-cancerous tumors.  It is not at all uncommon to have such growths.  The problem with a noncancerous tumor is if it damages the organs around it, or if it grows in a space where it crushes tissues around it (like the brain).  So, even though your mom's tumor was noncancerous (benign) and wouldn't spread to another place in her body, it was still harmful because the doctors couldn't remove it or keep it from growing. While we can't be sure about the chance that your family will get tumors (or not), I think the best way to look at it is that there is no need to worry because these kinds of things are not often inherited.  If you know the exact kind of tumor your mom had in her brain, you could look it up and be even more sure. More than likely you will live a long and healthy life!

K1UicE7kaa	It wouldn't cause changes in your blood sugar... BUT, there is research/evidence that the sweet taste in your mouth triggers appetite.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	It looks like someone needs a lesson in basic physiology/chemistry.<br>  <br>  #1 Soda (diet or otherwise) is acidic.  It has been proven to contribute to osteoperosis in women and should be avoided. C02+H20 = Carbonic acid....mix with bones you get calcium carbonate (which disintigrates)<br>  <br>  #2 The liquid and gas in the soda expands in your stomach and can serve as an appetite suppressant temporarily.  It sends a nerve signal that overrides the sugar level trigger that tells when you are hungry.<br>  <br>  #3 There is no sugar in diet soda so it has no effect on blood sugar levels.  However, Aspartame, the sweetener used in many diet sodas and some gum, has been linked to birth defects.<br>  <br>  Solution Eat an Apple.  Cheaper than soda and won't cause your children to have flippers or your teeth to fall out.|`|485b0a537e73379bb64ed3928743579eaa	Yes, it might make you feel hungrier because diet soda has a lot of sodium in it.  If you're drinking in all that sodium, your body is going to then want more water.  However, instead of drinking water, you may feel like you're hungry again. Also, the caffeine in soda, diet or not, can make you speed and then crash, just like a sugar high.  And upon the let-down, you'll feel hungry|`|0BX8Lozkaa	I drink two diet sodas per day (coke zero) I have one in the morning and at lunch. I also drink 64 or more oz of water per day.  I do get a little hungry between breakfast and lunch, so I try to prepare a fresh snack the day before. Fresh strawberries cut in half are wonderful. They add just the right amount to not be hungry and they are delicious.  The diet soda in my diet hasn't halted anything. I dropped 5 lbs in the last week and half :)|`|6omhZwdQaa	well i remember reading about this study they did about diet soda and regular soda drinkers and the diet soda drinkers gained way more weight than the regular soda drinkers but i dont remember if it was because it made them eat more...but it could have been,.|`|QTgm2ZTvaa	you trying to kill yourself? soda in the morning? without any food?|`|XZOgfxYJaa	I have heard that the aspartame/ artificial sugar that they put in diet soda can send signals to your brain telling it that it is hungry. Its kinda confusing. <br>  Basically, when you are hungry your adrenal gland submits hormones that tell your brain that you need to eat. Same thing when your thirsty. Your body can tell when the fluid levels in your cells are low and thus signals your brain to drink something. Basically, new findings are saying that artificial sweetner sends signals to your brain that you are hungry, when you are actually not. So then whenever you are actually just thirsty you brain thinks it is hungry and needs sugar. <br>  <br>  However, I have been drinking diet pop for years and not experienced this.|`|2QOcTTTuaa	The sweet taste on your tongue stimulates an insulin response.  In other words, because diet soda tastes so sweet, your body begins preparing to handle a rush of sugar by making plenty of insulin.  Then, when no sugar is delivered to your bloodstream, the extra insulin flowing through your body has no outlet except to stimulate appetite.  You literally NEED to consume more sugar to bring the insulin levels back down.  It is a delicate balance, but individuals respond differently to the stimulus.  Consequently, some experience a strong response and end up, over time, getting fatter by using diet foods, while other experience a lesser response, and are capable of using diet foods for weight loss.  Chemical sweeteners have several other health problems related to them.  You can check by Googling "aspartame" and "saccharin".  Be well!|`|3Gd7OBezaa	i'd say it probably does make u hungrier but it's better than normal sodas because if u drink coca cola ur blood sugars will rise leaving u feeling hyper & happy 4 about 20 minutes but then they will crash down leaving u feeling depressed making u reach 4 the biscuit tin stick 2 diet soda but don't use it 2 replace food as it will give a signal 2 ur brain leaving u havin the major munchies! i'd stick 2 tea as it cleanses u & leaves u feeling fuller<br>  xxxxxxxxxxxooooooooooooooo<br>  (i hoped that helped)|`|i57jmYXxaa	dont drink soda in the morning, its bad for you that early.<br>  drink water, sometimes you think your hungry but your just thirsty<br>  and water cleanses your body.

You ejaculate sperm in your semen-- that sperm is used up or gone, Takes about 60 days for the life cycle of sperm cells to reach maturity and be ready for ejaculation. Doesn't matter if you masturbate or not, you will produce about 200,000 sperm every minute, and 200,000 will mature and move out via ejaculation or get reabsorbed.  Masturbation is just solo sex, doesn't do anything magical to your balls or your penis or your sperm cells.|`|H2IqzG12aa	No effect at all.  You make sperm and semen continuously.

As for developing high definition abs - it's usually more a question of genetics than gymnastics. I suspect you look fantastic as you are.

Moderate amounts of alcohol may reduce your risk of cardiovascular problems. However, drinking larger amounts does more harm than good.<br>      * Eat a low fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low in animal fat.<br>      * Eat fish twice a week. Baked or grilled fish is better than fried fish. Frying can destroy some of the benefits.<br>      * Exercise daily or several times a week. Walking is a good form of exercise.

Not of the heart condition either.

Amongst other drugs, he will have been given anti-platelet drugs to try and prevent a repeat performance and Heparin or a similar drug to help prevent further blood clots forming.<br>  <br>  Treatment will also be given to to restore blood flow in the blocked artery.The quicker the blood flow is restored, the better the outlook.

The angiogram will assess the state of his arteries and degree of any occlusion-  if indicated he will be given stenting, or if he has severe wide spread blockage within his arteries he will be given a bypass. He needs to stop smoking with immediate effect. Smoking will have contributed towards his MI.

He's in the right place.<br>  <br>  I can tell you that, whether they do anything or not, they'll be saying "Give up the smoking, get off your backside and go for a walk . . .", that I will guarantee.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your Dad.|`|lf5ZXo9Eaa	I'm sorry to hear that dear :(  Of course you're upset and worried-these are normal reactions.  Since this was a less severe heartattack as per the doctor I'm sure that he will recover just fine.  He will have to watch his health and diet and take care of himself after this as best as possible to prevent more problems after his recovery.  Since he's 39 years old he's still young and I'm sure he's strong enough to handle this.  I'm not a doctor, but I know you're just looking for some reassurance right now.  Have faith, be there for him and your family and if you have any questions about your father's condition and recovery feel free to ask the doctor and nurses since they will have the best answers available.

688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	Time for the next test.<br>  <br>  My son has food allergies.  So we have gone through all the testing.  And they can have false positives.  His first blood test said he was allergic to eggs, milk, wheat, soy, beef and oranges!  Eeeek!<br>  <br>  But that was a crazy list, so we followed up with the allergist who did that scratch test (skin prick).  That narrowed it down to eggs, milk, wheat and soy.<br>  <br>  But we really wanted to be sure cuz that list is kinda long, plus he had previously had wheat and soy with no problem.<br>  <br>  So we did the Food challenge for the wheat and soy.  No problems.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, his only allergies turned out to be eggs and milk.<br>  <br>  You may want to go for further testing so you can know for sure what you are actually allergic to.<br>  <br>  PS - There is also Almond Milk which is a good alternative to dairy milk.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  The food challenge is the real test.  Let's say you have previously eaten toast with no problem so you think that maybe you aren't really allergic to wheat (as an example).  Then you would schedule a food challenge with your allergist.  You bring some bread and then eat it in a controlled environment and wait an hour.  If you have no reaction, then you aren't allergic.  If you do have a reaction, then you are right there where you can get treatment.   <br>  <br>  If you click through the link below, you'll see that there is a whole series of articles.  And the information actually follows exactly what I have learned from our own doctor and our own experience.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Just because the test says you're allergic, doesn't mean it is going to give you trouble.  When you have to do is get all the offending foods off your diet for 3 weeks.   Then slowly add them back, one every three days.  You may find that only one or two of them actually produces symptoms.  Then you just cut those foods out and can resume the rest.

My husband did this, and wears it only at night... it has helped him a lot, and is much less expensive than the one the dentist will make.
u6ExZKkJaa	Try massage the really painful spots  on each side of your face, shoulders and the back of the neck with hard,slow, short strokes. Do this at lest 3 times a day until it feels better! Also drink allot of water, and try to get a good nights sleep! Hope that helps!
tITPAbeKaa	I only wear pads and i have pretty heavy periods so it's quite normal for me to have little leaks onto my undies, especially during the first few days.<br>  I try to minimise it by changing pads regularly and also sometimes wearing 2 at a time. The ones with wings help too. <br>  <br>  As for sitting, i think as long as you're sitting straight like you do in school or when you are out in public, leakage will be minimal. For me it only happens usually when i'm lying around the house or laying back somewhere.|`|e9YXcVtdaa	<a href="http://www.always.com/gateway.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.always.com/gateway.jsp</a><br>  <br>  They have a lot of different protection options here.  And they do send free samples.<br>  Good luck|`|IP2suWFTaa	That's why on my heaviest days I wear a tampon and a pad,to avoid that from happening.|`|1GxMGmkqaa	for starters, get the pads with wings. way less chance of leaks leaking past your undies.<br>  pads really are the best thing to use as this way your period flows freely. tampons can sometimes stop flow which is not desireable and for some can turn out painful or make them sick. also tampons hav a reputation for causing illness. and sometimes dangerous! <br>  there are no certai ways of sitting but if you are having problems you might like to think about buying some firmer fitter undies so the pad doesnt slip around. and yes i care very much if ihad a leak. not somuch undies rather if the leak seeps through to outer clothing! its more embarrassing than anything. <br>  yes you will feel the leak generally. if not, thats normal too. everyone is different. always know that when you're wearing a pad that you are dealing with what is natural in a natural way and are doing your body and yourself the biggest favour.
AA11085356	I had braces when I was your age. It was hard to get used to in the beginning, but after a couple weeks it was better. Be prepared to have a sore mouth for a couple days!<br>  <br>  The rubber bands weren't hard to put in after you do it a couple times. I actually learn how to fling them out of my mouth! haha, I could shoot them across the room! lol<br>  <br>  And as far as colour, you can change it up every time you see your orthodontist, so it doesn't really matter.<br>  <br>  Make sure you keep some floss handy, or that little cleaning tool they give you. It can be hard sometimes to keep food from sticking in them.<br>  <br>  And don't worrie, they wont stay on forever! Good luck!|`|0MunIx8raa	It doesn't really hurt to have them put on.  When you go back for tightening your mouth is a little sore for a couple of days.  Rubber bands aren't hard to put on, they are just aggravating.  Choose your favorite color.  You will be sore for a week or so after having them put on, but you will get used to it.  Good luck.  You will have a great smile when it's all over.|`|lCftCyujaa	not to worry! it won't hurt at all<br>  <br>  <br>  i was scared about it about 3 months ago but nah it didn't hurt one bit :)<br>  <br>  you'll be okay|`|doHNEvf8aa	They put the rubber bands on first of all lol.<br>  As for colors go with lighter ones. Like pink, light purple, light green, light blue. And get all one color, it looks better that way.<br>  It tends to hurt for like the first day or two so don't be surprised if you have trouble eating, don't worry the pain does go away.<br>  Also ask for some wax (you use this when one of your wires is poking you) so that if you have any pain, that can help cover it.<br>  <br>  hope this helps! good luck! =]|`|0OFDLHJaaa	ya i just got them and im going back today to get it fixed, but u dont need to freak out it doesnt hurt a lot, inless u bit something hard. and itll only hurt like that 4 a few days (4) and u dont get the rubber bands for inother month or longer. i would not get pink if i wer u believe me i did that ad it looks to childish.|`|jr4aNLLlaa	it doesn't really hurt but they are annoying. don't worry your gonna be fine theres no reason to be scared|`|xijwHZrWaa	Rubber bands aren't hard to put on but it sucks cuz you can barely open your mouth.<br>  Braces aren't that bad but they're so annoying to have. <br>  Sometimes they hurt sometimes they didn't. Everytime you get them tightened it'll hurt for like 3 days to a week but then after that you'll be fine. And they should show you colors to choose from. <br>  Hopefully you won't have to have them for a long time but if you do everything they say then you'll be fine. <br>  And all that stuff about flossing and not chewinggum and blahblahblah is all crap just brush your teeth good. <br>  You'll be fine, don't be scared (:|`|sBn7D0h4aa	I'm almost 21 years old and have braces and when i got them on and everytime i get them tightened or messed with it hurts pretty bad for me for atleast a few days. I'm not sure if it's because i'm older and my teeth are pretty much done moving and whatever else they do when your younger but personally for me the spacers, those blue little rubber bands they shove between your teeth to make space, were the worst for me so far. The herbst appliance i had comes in a close second lol. <br>  <br>  But i just make sure i eat before or right as soon as i get home so that i can eat before the pain sets in and as soon as i get home i take some advil, excedrin, tylenol etc. for the pain  thats soon to follow.<br>  <br>  as for the color bands you see on peoples braces, those are keep your archwires on and in place. and the orthodontic assistant will do all that, that's not something you'll ever have to do.<br>  <br>  Now with the rubber bands that attach and strech from the bottom teeth and up to the top....you have to put those in yourself and they will attach to these little tiny posts sticking up from your brackets (the little metal squares with the color bands on them). On your first visit you may or may not even have to wear rubber bands yet. I've only had to wear them twice in a whole years worth of visits.<br>  <br>  Well best of luck on the braces and hope they don't put you in too much pain :)|`|N0PQLsucaa	Okay, Okay, calm down.................................<br>  I'm 14 and I know EXACTLY how you feel.<br>  I got to warn you, braces do hurt in the start, but you can take pain killers. The rubber bands take some getting used too. They are hard but the dentist will show you how to put them on.<br>  What's your favourite color?<br>  Chances are they'll have that colour. They aren't permanent so you can change them later. My friend's was blue but then on halloween he got black and orange. :P<br>  <br>  So my advice is stop worrying.. It'll all work out in the end :-)<br>  And imagine how perfect your teeth will be after all the work :-)<br>  So you're going to be fine and know that it will all work out!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  xoxo<br>  -Sharon <3|`|scui8nM4aa	Don't go for getting different colors on your brackets.  Just choose one color for every tooth.  It looks so much better and when you alternate it looks little-kiddy.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it, you can still chew gum, eat candy, kiss and all those things with braces.  Just do everything the orthodontist tells you!  You'll get them off faster!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vzvhvCNiaa	I had braces, and trust me do NOT worry.<br>  They are simple, they hurt for the first few days.. but seriously,<br>  once you get use to them, they feel fine.<br>  <br>  Colors you should stay away from :<br>  Clear<br>  White<br>  <br>  Make sure you get a dark color...

This is not a simple maths problem, you would loose a few pounds quickly and then simply loose energy instead for a long time during which your thought processes would be affected because thinking takes calories believe it or not.<br>  You actually use around 1400 calories a day just living, so a diet of a thousand will certainly be low enough to be effective..and if you do more than walk about a little and breath you could even start your diet higher,say at 1400, and then lower it to 1200 in a couple of months and then to 1000 a couple of months after that...and no lower.

You already know the answer to your problems. The solution is there. You need to not come home and gorge on pizza rolls, ice cream and chips. It's HARD I know, but just cut out a little bit at a time. Eventually you won't be as ravenous as you were before. What do you eat for lunch at school? Do you buy your lunch? You should pack something healthy so you know you won't be eating badly while you're away from home. It takes a while to gain the self control, but you can do it.

ufgv7oTjaa	Yes. It's actually one of the more popular, commonly used, and most effective herbs to help with various "monthly issues". The worst part is that it may take a few days to get into your system enough to notice a difference because herbs and supplements give your body nutrition it's otherwise lacking. If you're already in full swing of your PMS, it can help calm it down a bit now, but it'll have a MUCH better impact on your next cycle if you kept taking it. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|4277201b67af194037740747ba2be513aa	No, not really. I tried it and it did nothing. <br>  <br>  Try 5htp - take 50-100mg at night, or you could take 50mg at night and 50mg in the morning for the duration of your period. <br>  <br>  Magnesium (acts as a natural sedative), Vitamin B complex, Passiflora and Valerian (take at night) also work. <br>  <br>  I have recently started to take l-theanine as well which seems to help too. <br>  <br>  Avoid ALL caffeine - even in tea (drink decaff). I noticed that when I cut out caffeine my pmt symptoms went right down. <br>  <br>  Keep your fluid intake up - avoid lots of sugary stuff as well. <br>  <br>  I suffered pmt for years, but it's pretty much under control now. Hope you feel better soon.|`|0uXo1jUlaa	you may be relive take than told that is a way
ebhzXomLaa	A cold is a virus, and you only catch viruses once. That's why you can only get chicken pox one time. The problem with a cold is that there are many different strains of cold, and we only build immunity to the strains we catch. I think that's why you can't play "cold ping-pong." That would be when you catch a cold, you pass it to your friend, your friend passes it back to you, you bass it back to him, he passes it back to you, and so on. As to the weather affecting a cold virus the answer is simple: it doesn't. That's a common misconception. The cold weather obviously isn't good for you, and I guess it can produce cold-like symptoms, but it doesn't affect the cold virus. In fact, there are some places that are actually too cold for the cold virus to live.|`|FkMuXcs5aa	its because of virus influenza >>>> so we cant immune ittttt...|`|QLopvWKDaa	I believe that it is because there are 100's or 1,000's of different cold viruses!  You do build an immunity to those you have had or were exposed to.<br>  <br>  I, thankfully, only get a cold once every 7-10 years.  About once a decade.<br>  <br>  I am not sure why, but am sure glad, because I am the biggest baby when I do get one-i whine, I cry- you'd think that I was going to die!

All people are different.<br>  <br>  If you are concerned - go consult a doctor.|`|AA12266052	For resting heart rate:<br>      * Newborn infants: 100 - 160 beats per minute<br>      * Children 1 to 10 years: 70 - 120 beats per minute<br>      * Children over 10 and adults (including seniors): 60 - 100 beats per minute<br>      * Well-trained athletes: 40 - 60 beats per minute<br>  Your resting heart rate is normal. But after exercise, it should be between 123 to 164 beats per minute. <br>  220 (K) - 15 (age) = 205.<br>  60% of 205 =123 (minimum)<br>  80% of 205 = 164 (maximum)<br>  But you have got 180 beats per minute after exercise which is higher.<br>  During sleep, the pulse can drop to as low as 40 BPM; during strenuous exercise, it can rise as high as 150–200 BPM (Wikipedia)<br>  Hence it does not appear as a serious problem.<br>  Consult the doctor.
JMJsCU1vaa	I suffered from that and I finally realized I was Lactose intolerant and I was basically ingesting a lot of dairy products and suffering the side effects of it.. ie, gas, bloating diarrhea etc...<br>  Try eliminating all dairy from your diet for a few days and see if that doesn't help... if it does, then you are lactose intolerant... also you can buy Lactaid milk so you can eat cereal and such, but wait till you determine if that's what it is first...you can also buy lactaid tablets for eating things like Ice Cream and Pizza etc...

pjYQhPPBaa	I am a firm believer in that one cannot be cured unless they really want to be. The way I see it is having an eating disorder is like being addicted to drugs or alcohol. It's almost physically addicting, definitely psychologically addicting, and you can't be forced to stop; you have to realize it yourself, and stop for the right reasons. However, eating disorders are different because it's more mental than physical, therefore harder to "cure," if there is such a thing. There is a saying that one who has a serious eating disorder will never be cured because the disease is always in the back of their mind.<br>  <br>  I think it's very admirable that you tried to fix this issue by yourself, but I fear you didn't do it for the right reasons. You should want to fix it because you want to live and have a full life with a husband (or wife) and children, not because you're embarrassed. Therefore I think it's possible you could relapse if you don't seek help.<br>  <br>  When I was younger I had anorexia (though didn't realize it at the time), and my mom put me in therapy for 5 years. I hated it at first, but in the end it helped a lot, not just with me but with my mom. I strongly suggest you should seek help. Note that not all therapists are created equal. You have to feel a "bond" with them, if you will; not just talking to someone and they don't show anything back. Your feelings aren't going to go away overnight, but it's worth it.|`|DM6YyuoJaa	an eating disoreder is very serious nothing to kid about its all in your head yo udont need to cut your self to relive the pain in your life its time yo ugrow up and stop being a D-bag who want people to feel sorry for you get some phyciatric help or take up tae-kwon-do or just get a punching bag in your room then when ever you get pissed off up set or mad instead of cutting or burning you get tired from punching it and youll forget all about cutting im not trying to be a ***** but its time to stop and people have been feeling sorry for you and obviously thats not working you need hoenst help go get it today for your sake and your familys|`|oARkQFEuaa	About eating disorders can be read in <a href="http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=eating%20disorders" rel="nofollow">http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=ea...</a>|`|5107c3cf09f31a605b6d95cbf016f1dbaa	It is possible, but you have to be strong.|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	Try to make the past history. If you've stopped all these things on your own, you are strong-willed. The worst thing we can do to ourselves is give no credit for what we've done right, and all the blame for what we do wrong.<br>  <br>  I bet if you took more control of your problems, you'd feel much better. Don't eat just anything, eat what will make you healthy. If you can appreciate yourself being healthy, then you won't feel the urge to put yourself in that position again. Eat balanced meals, and focus on being the best that YOU can be. <br>  <br>  Some people have it easy, and they don't need to try. But they take their effort for granted, and it doesn't mean as much to them. If you DO do something about it, then it'll mean so much more for you. <br>  <br>  Start jogging and exercising. That's a great way to vent your frustration and take care of yourself at the same time. Try some yoga poses and meditation. It's about patience with yourself and learning to accept your thoughts. Most importantly, give it time, and be willing to experiment. You're worth taking the time for, so make that your priority.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in therapy. I believe in inspiration.
211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	My best guess, based on the symptoms you are describing is that you have experienced an ovarian cyst. However, even appendicitis and diverticulitis can produce signs and symptoms that mimic a ruptured ovarian cyst.<br>  <br>  Still, it's important to be watchful of any symptoms or changes in your body and to know which symptoms are serious. If you have an ovarian cyst, you may experience the following signs and symptoms:<br>  <br>  Pelvic pain — a constant or intermittent dull ache that may radiate to your lower back and thighs - which is sounds like you have<br>  <br>  Pelvic pain shortly before your period begins or just before it ends or around ovulation<br>  and<br>  <br>  you may have Pelvic pain during intercourse.<br>  <br>  Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs or pockets within or on the surface of an ovary. <br>  <br>  Although this cyst usually disappears on its own in a few weeks, it can grow to almost 4 inches in diameter and has the potential to bleed into itself or twist the ovary, causing pelvic or abdominal pain. If it fills with blood, the cyst may rupture, causing internal bleeding and sudden, sharp pain.<br>  <br>  If you experience severe or spasmodic pain in your lower abdomen, accompanied by fever and vomiting, see your doctor. These signs and symptoms — or those of shock such as cold, clammy skin, rapid breathing, and lightheadedness or weakness — indicate an emergency and require immediate medical attention.<br>  <br>  I used to have the cysts ALL the time and the pain usually went away within a few days at the most.<br>  <br>  Good Luck & Feel Better!!|`|qnDk8xjPaa	Sounds like it could be an ovarian cyst.  Go to the OBGYN he will have to do a transvaginal ultrasound (Pelvic).  I have one and they can be very painful! Good luck.

a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	It is important to realize that the hearing system is one of the most delicate and sensitive mechanisms in the body. Since it is a part of the general nervous system, it is sensitive, to some degree, by anything that affects the overall health of the individual (both physical and psychological). Therefore, in order to lessen the intensity of tinnitus, it is advisable to make every effort to:<br>  <br>      * Avoid exposure to loud sounds and noises.<br>  <br>      * Control blood pressure.<br>  <br>      * Decrease salt intake.<br>  <br>      * Avoid nerve stimulants such as coffee and colas (caffeine) and tobacco (nicotine).<br>  <br>      * Reduce anxiety.<br>  <br>      * Try to stop worrying about the tinnitus. Often, the more you worry and concentrate on the noise, the louder it will become.<br>  <br>      * Get adequate rest and avoid fatigue.<br>  <br>      * Exercise.<br>  <br>      * Utilize masking noise. Tinnitus is usually more bothersome when the surroundings are quiet, especially when you are in bed. A competing sound such as a ticking clock, a radio, a fan or white noise machine may help mask tinnitus. Small hearing aid like devices which generate a competitive sound may help reduce the awareness of the tinnitus.<br>  <br>      * Biofeedback may help or diminish tinnitus in some patients.<br>  <br>      * Avoid aspirin or aspirin products in large quantities.|`|ezT7xruoaa	After 6 months there is nothing you can do, sorry.

Even though you think its at its worst, you can still make it even worse if you keep damaging your hearing in this way. <br>  <br>  PS: if its hereditary the drink might not exactly help... but its usually loud noises that cause it.

AA11251285	It would be helpful to you to try to pinpoint where at school you are the most anxious. Go to school one day and monitor yourself all day to find out. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most anxious, rate yourself throughout the day. Once you discover where you are most anxious, you can talk with a counselor or therapist to get techniques on good coping mechanisms or read the book, "Feeling Good" as described below.<br>  <br>  Here are some good ideas:<br>  1. Do something that gets your heart rate up a bit like, walking, running, biking, and swimming.<br>  2. Eat Whole, Organic foods like: Broccoli, Cabbage, Organic Brown Rice, Beans, Spinach, Sweet Potato, Apples, and other fruits and vegetables in their Natural State.<br>  3. Avoid eating corn, sugar, white bread, white rice, white potatoes, candy, sodas, chips, and anything else that you already know you shouldn’t be eating.<br>  4. Drink clean water as your beverage of choice. Avoid Fruit drinks and fruit juices (unless YOU juice them yourself)<br>  5. Stop smoking, drinking beer & wine, and drinking coffee.<br>  6. Get 8 hours of sleep each night.<br>  7. Hang out with people who want to be healthy.<br>  8. Avoid anything with High Fructose Corn Syrup.<br>  9. Look into taking a multi-vitamin.<br>  10. Check out this website for excellent health advice: naturalnews.com<br>  <br>  Tone up the muscles:<br>  <br>  1. Join a gym and get a trainer.<br>  2.

s2F6pK9Xaa	This is what I did; I scheduled a physical with my GP (I needed one anyway- it was overdue) and several days before the appt, I sat down and wrote a note to him on how I have felt and flat-out TOLD him that I'm suffering from A&D. The note was over a page long. I felt that this was the best way because then all I would have to do was hand him the note instead of having to say it out loud. I felt that if I left it up to that that I would chicken out.<br>  <br>  He read the note, told me that this was very common, and then we discussed some options. I refused a perscription for meds that day so that I could try some other things first...they didn't work. Two weeks later I called and told the nurse that I was ready to accept the perscription. She took that to the Dr. and he sent the perscription right to the pharmacy so I didn't even have to go in and see him again.<br>  <br>  I've just had my one-month follow-up on Monday...it's working so well for me! I can't believe I didn't do this sooner. You don't have to be miserable! There is help available!<br>  <br>  I had tried therapy several years ago and I don't feel that I got anything out of that, so it wasn't an option for me anymore.

I am not sure how old you are or if your in school but if your under 18 talk to your parents and if your in college there should be someone on campus that you can talk to. I did that in college.|`|78ouhV4caa	please go to the doctor. If you say to him/her u do not feel therapy would be of a benefit to you now so they know that. No one is made to go for therapy. A lot of people with depression have many complex reasons for becoming depressed. I couldnt pinpoint certain reasons with mine, just lots of stuff happens and then you fall into depression. Remember it is an ILLNESS. so it does need treatment. The way u described ur feelings does definatley suggest a certain amount of depression. It makes u lose optimism, hope and makes u feel generally empty and low. The doctor will probably start u on a low dosage of an anti depressant. Dont be worried about having to take medication because most depressed ppl do need it. It will not cure ur depression but it will reduce some of the syptoms and can put u on ur way to getting through it. Depression does need a certain amount of self help. Find a new hobby and exercise. :) i really hope it doesnt get worse for you. <br>  Make the most of the days when u are feeling at ur best. be strong and if u bring new things into ur life and push urself u will have more of a chance of lifting out of depression. I am on Citalopram 20mg and it has helped me a lot. I am still depressed but it is bearable and i am no where near as bad as i was. My meds were also started on 10 mg (which didnt do anything lol) bcos my doctor didnt realise that i was that bad. If its a good Gp they will not want to put u on a high dosage and u always start on a low one and build up if need be anyway.<br>  All the best<br>  If u need someone to chat with im available . can give u an adress to contact :)
nBGjPwViaa	This is just his way of dealing...this is his defense mechanism, apparently.<br>  He is making light of the situation, and repressing feelings.<br>  Everyone deals differently -- You deal w/it how you feel is best.|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	you dumped him how did you expect him to act, <br>  do you not understand his pride was hurt, no-one wants to be told hey you know what i don't want to be with you any more.<br>  its called rejection<br>  he was hurt so he did the only thing he could do, act like he was not bothered<br>  did you think he would fall at your feet and beg you to take him back.<br>  he took the pics coz he wanted to remember what you looked like that morning coz until you left you where still his in a way and he wanted to keep something of that time.<br>  why are you bothered its over now are you miffed coz you did not get the reaction you felt you would get ???|`|8216823560555d6dc93db177c0503e7caa	This is his way of dealing with rejection. He sounds immature.
vGk4PlSWaa	Yes Its Because You Broke Up With Him.|`|SvffjoIwaa	There are many reasons why guys get all jurky after a break up. In your particular situation though, I think it's because he's young and a virgin. He want's to have sex and since he didn't get it from you, he's gone to look else where. Then there's the "saving face" factor that most young men have. They suround themselves with girls that supposedly want to be with him so he feels better. It's childish really, but he is still young and learning. Don't feel bad about the break up or how he is acting. Instead concentrate on things that make you happy.|`|fOZTNTLnaa	yeah its probably b/c you broke up with him. <br>  :)|`|vGxipYJnaa	It probably has nothing to do with you. People change a lot in their teen years.|`|NUPJ9DiKaa	yes it is. he feels that since he couldn't hold on to u then he lost all respect for himself and women. now he just doesn't care what happens bc he does have u..
AA11020187	Oh my.<br>  You didn’t say anything about a benign disease or cervical cancer and there is no vaccine that will help with uterine cancer. However, having unusual bleeding twice is not reason to believe you may have uterine cancer unless you have been postmenopausal for over a year. It most likely has everything to do with your menstrual cycle. Few women have their periods like clockwork with no breakthrough bleeding or for a specific amount of time. What you are experiencing is not unusual from time to time, but if it continues you should see your doctor.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	You can get cervical cancer at any age.  There are also many other causes of bleeding.  See your gyne.|`|WwftBSk8aa	my dear at first u have go to specialized doctor  .<br>  yes , the  teenagers girls have uterus cancer and know there is special vaccines! know there are a lot of strange diseases .|`|AA10063059	no cancer is benign ,but i doubt you have cancer at 17,unusual bleeding at that age is usually hormonal due to age
MmRDzhaHaa	I have this too so i know what you mean when you mention the pain! i had it at 12 and now im 37, so ive been in pain for 25 years, and i too have noticed it go worse with each year that passes,the hospital advised me to take up swimming to strenghten the back muscles, to help ease the pain, so maybe you could try this(i haven't, don't like water)and try arranging your pillows at night, i lie on my side with a pillow between my knees this helps a lot,you could even put a pillow under your legs while lying on your back,i had surgery for mine, but it hasn't really made the pain any less, i would say its worse after, as it leaves you with a stiff back.|`|c68nVKIYaa	Your posture may continue to deteriorate and the pain increase if you don't correct the main postural issues that are causing the pain. The pain problem can be solved quite quickly if you can find a physical therapist who really understands the underlying causes. Halting curve progression or reversing curves takes much longer but is possible.<br>  <br>  Conventional physical therapy usually can't do this, but a therapist trained in the Schroth method can. This is a system of exercises which would be tailored to your specific scoliotic configuration, and that you'd practice daily. A Schroth therapist fixed my pain -- two different kinds (tight hamstrings and ergonomic problem at my desk) immediately and permanently. She just figured out what I was doing wrong and taught me stretch exercises and how to sit correctly, also fixing my chair position. <br>  <br>  Search the web on "Schroth method" and you will find a series of resources (a textbook and some Schroth clinics scattered around the US and abroad). The homepage of the National Scoliosis Foundation lists some US Schroth therapists (scroll down). Good luck|`|8WYWEDOpaa	I'd see a scoliosis specialist first to see what's been happening to your back over the past several years.  If your curve is over 30 degrees (another lady on this forum says 40+ degrees) then the curve will most likely continue to increase even when you're done growing.<br>  <br>  You didn't say how many degrees your curve is or what activities you're doing to cause your back pain.<br>  <br>  You have only a few choices, assuming that you have structural scoliosis.<br>  <br>  o You can exercise - that strengthens your core muscles which may reduce pain or help keep pain away, but it won't treat your curve.<br>  <br>  o pain management - There are many meds that are either taken by themselves or in combination with other meds. The key is to keep your pain doc informed when something isn't working (after giving it a reasonable chance to work). This should be done only if surgery isn't possible or you still have problems even after surgery.<br>  <br>  o Surgery - This is done usually if your curve is greater than 50 degrees or it is increasing fast enough that there's little doubt that the curve will soon be greater than 50 degrees. This is the treatment you get when all else fails.
BLmyeLdTaa	They don't hurt when they put them on it's when they adjust the wires. Your teeth will feel sore for awhile and you won't be able to bite into anything hard for awhile but the soreness goes away after your teeth get used to it. It really isn't that bad.|`|9rLi9pSRaa	They are a little ( just a little) uncomfortable in  the beginning because they have to tighten them to do any good.  So they tighten them a little, really it isn't that bad and in a day you don't even notice it. Your teeth need to move and they adjust them slowly.  It is very cool to wear braces and I loved wearing them.  Your teeth will look great after they are adjusted.  So hang in there and good luck.|`|48e80d4dffb6b005f6946b03af059d5eaa	The actual process of putting them on does not hurt at all. It takes about an hour and makes your lips chapped, but doesnt hurt.

The process of putting on the brackets doesn't hurt, its when they put the wire on. Its because they are moving your teeth and you teeth don't like it. They were initially hurt for about 1 1/2 weeks. <br>  About 45 mins before your apt take an OTC pain med to help with the pain, and then continue to take the pain meds as directed.

This usually takes a day or two to set in at first, and lasts about a week.  The reason is simple: your teeth just aren't used to the pressure being exerted upon them.  <br>  <br>  While you're being treated, you will have your braces tightened, which will bring back this sensation, but it is unlikely to last very long.  <br>  <br>  I recommend keeping a small stock of softer foods at home, like bananas, jello, pudding, bread, etc...to make tightenings easier on you.  I myself had 8 years of orthodontic treatment, and had braces in two stages. <br>  Good luck.  If you follow your orthodontist's instructions, and get through the discomfort, it is worth it.|`|pZ73HRh7aa	Well I got mine yesterday, it didnt hurt at all when they put them on.

Sah5tjD8aa	Sadly, in the real world, **** happens.  Doctors expect to be paid.  Drugstores expect to be paid.  And young ladies become pregnant in violent situations.  Your parents deserve to be a part of your life.  You need to talk with them about your fears.  You do not need to spend the next few years afraid of pregnancy under violent conditions, but you also do not deserve to spend the next few years living in fear that your parents will discover you have gone behind their backs.<br>  Law varies from state to state regarding parental consent and release of information.  I cannot answer those issues from your information.  <br>  Planned Parenthood is the main provider of subsidzed healthcare to women, but there are "free clinics" in many communities.  Some local health departments provide family planning services.  Again, you have not provided enough information for me to direct you to a local resource.  It is just as well, though, since the real issue here is that you should discuss the real problems with your parents.   It is sad that you feel that you have to face this situation alone.  Good Luck!|`|AA12316174	You need an exam before a scrip is written if you go as self pay (which would be the best way for your parents to not find out) You will have to pay for the exam depending on your state and city can be up to 145. they will give you a script and you will have to fill it at the pharmacy again as a self pay so expect to pay arond $60 a month for your pills. If your parents have insurance on you and you use your insurance they will find out when they receive the EOB (explanation of benefits) so being self pay is the best way to go. Services cannot be denied to you due to age and your parents cannot be notified even if they inquire about it its the law|`|g7uMKvEzaa	The pill will NOT protect you from being raped ...or STD's. that is even way more scarey than getting pregnant..If you are serious and didn't or don't have sex...Just don't worry bout that ...It's just as bad as worrying about getting shot or killed .  I would try to stay clear of bad sections of your neighborhood or if you are that scared don't even go out. There ARE ways to find help if you are raped or need medical advise..I think all phone books have that info in the front pages... and even though you can get pregnant from rapes it is more a personal choice or medical descision to go on the pill...The pill doesn't cure the problem here..GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|KzmrWzOJaa	Dont worry...

What this means is that unless you consent or give permission to your health care provider, s/he cannot disclose your medical records to anyone, including your parents (except in the case of abortion services, which depends on your particular state's law). Additionally, since no state or federal laws exist at the present time that would prevent minors from obtaining contraception, teens don't need parental consent or notification to get birth control pills, condoms, emergency contraception, and other contraceptive choices.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are on your parents health insurance talk with your doctor about keeping the bills confidential. Tell them you don't want to be contacted at home and talk about an alternative route to contacting you and also if possible try and pay with cash.<br>  <br>  hope this helped :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1703.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1703....</a>

mfmdFhsjaa	Sleepwalking (also called noctambulism or somnambulism), under the larger category of Parasomnias, is a sleep disorder where the sufferer engages in activities that are normally associated with wakefulness while asleep or in a sleeplike state. Sleepwalking can affect people of any age. It generally occurs when an individual awakes suddenly from Slow Wave Sleep (SWS or sometimes referred to as "deep sleep"), causing the sleepwalking episode. In children and young adults, up to 25% of the night is spent in SWS. However this decreases as the person ages until none can be measured in the geriatric individual. For this reason, children and young adults (or anyone else with high amount of SWS), are more likely to be woken up and, for the same reasons, they are witnessed to have many more episodes than the older individuals.|`|14aac107dcba91009af0868f33a4976faa	Dear, it is psychological disorder, and u r requested to consult good psychiatrist.|`|GBxEj1uPaa	dont sleep dude <br>  <br>  no sleep no sleepwalking, thats it|`|5wAAnZPYaa	Doing something unconsciously.

Watch your diet.|`|xp8pmKOuaa	It's not necessarily a disease, although it is a possibility.  When you are digesting your food, your stomach "gurgles"  because of the acid inside of it that is breaking down the food and nutrients in your stomach.  If you are not active during this time, the process can often take longer than if you were out walking, or doing an activity, and because of this you notice it making noise more than you normally would.  It does this throughout the entire day, but generally because people are constantly on the move during this time, the digestive process is quicker and you tend not to notice it as much.  Unless you feel sick when your stomach gurgles, or you feel that there is something more than just basic digestion, you are fine.|`|CvVgihRtaa	Whenever our stomachs "gurgle" or "growls" after eating a meal it is actually talking to us.  <br>  <br>  Our stomach gurgles to let us know that it does not agree with the foods or the combination of foods we have eaten.  <br>  <br>  Such as . . . <br>  - There are some foods that should not be eaten together.<br>  - There are some eaten foods that should be given time to be digested before we drink liquids or eat other foods.<br>  - There may be some food allergies that we may have.<br>  <br>  To solve this, try and identify which food(s) your stomach may not be happy with and eat them less frequently or avoid them completely.<br>  <br>  You can also check out these links:<br>  <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/stomach-growling.htm" rel="nofollow">http://health.howstuffworks.com/stomach-...</a><br>  and<br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stomach-noise/NU00189" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stomach...</a><br>  <br>  All the best to you.|`|bQCfOftxaa	its probably not your stomach, but rather your intestines digesting your food.  depending on what i've eaten this happens to me too.|`|NFHeDrrPaa	I normally don't eat my stomach...|`|1z9zl6kuaa	no its not with everyone...may be some diet problem...

It has the same effect.<br>  <br>  Instead of doing that, I have also tried eating an all fruit, veggie and water diet for 2 weeks.  I saw it on the news.  You can't eat anything but salt and pepper on the veggies, and the only other liquids you can have are black coffee or plain tea.  Or the other method is to "juice" the fruits and veggies, then drink a meal 5 times a day.  No solid food.  Do that for 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  The fruit and veggie diets do just as good of a job as cleansing as the colon cleanse pills in my opinion.|`|L6ZEQxvLaa	I've used the Nature's Secret kits, Garden of Eden products (10 day) and currently taking the Hydroxycut version (7-day).

Drnpe4T5aa	I once came across a book with different ways to talk to people about things that can be embarrassing, difficult, etc.  I can't remember the name of the book, but *do* remember the way to pose a fact in way that is kind and non-confrontational.<br>  <br>  You simply ask it as a question:  "If I knew you might need help, would you want me to ask you about it even if it could be embarrassing?"  <br>  <br>  Stated this way, you are letting him know that something is going on, but allowing him to talk about it, without blurting out the dreaded "elephant in the room".  It gives him a chance to tell you about it in his own words. <br>  <br>  Asking him straight out, particularly if you use the word diapers, you can put him into a position of deep shame, embarrassment, and a sense of invaded privacy.  Telling him what you found could also do the same.<br>  <br>  As a mother, I can completely understand your wanting to help him and know what's going on.  A mother's love is deep!  But I can remember my own mother trying to talk with me about periods and such and if I could have, I would have dug a hole to China and jumped in.<br>  <br>  Good luck to both you and your son!|`|AKKWDcqnaa	i used to be in the same position as your son and yes it can be humiliating... dont tell him what you found, just say it was your intuition or something. im sure he will grow out of it in time- you need to tell him not to drink anything an hour before he goes to bed and to always go to the loo first. get it sorted now it will save problems in future (:<br>  <br>  UPDATE<br>  to that "moonlit W person: Boys do NOT get off lightly with menunstration compared to girls! were the ones that get the periods!|`|5qFmukWwaa	I smell a troll here.<br>  You have asked similar question 11 times and the only thing that changes is your son's age.

I think it might be kind of humiliating for him.  He would have spoken to you if he wasn't embarrassed about the problem.  <br>  <br>  You might say "I was tidying up your room and found a package of diapers under your bed.  If you have a problem you can always talk to me.  I won't spread your business around. "<br>  <br>  There is medication and behavioral training that can help with bedwetting.  Google it.|`|pd5LkFWoaa	Go with the truth... Tell him what you found and how you found it. You were not snooping just cleaning.

And also give him an option if he wants you their at the appt. If he is old enough to go alone. Good Luck|`|9RuBwanoaa	i say yes confront him and just tell him that you found the adult diapers and that youre willing to take him to a doctor if he wants.|`|fShlKEfYaa	Bladder control problems are not normal in adults of any age. Most problems can be treated successfully at any age. How long has it been since your son's last medical checkup? Schedule a medical checkup for him. Plan to discuss this with your son as soon as possible. Print out information on urinary control, incontinence, bedwetting, treatment options, etc. to have a folder put together to prepare with your discussion with your son. Find out if there was bedwetting in other relatives because bedwetting can be hereditary. Consider that this could be a 24hr incontinence issue, not just bedwetting. Select a relaxed private timeframe to discuss this with your son, such as after breakfast or lunch on Saturday at home. Open the conversation with your hopes for a good relationship with your son, a relationship where he can feel ok to come to you with any 'issues' or 'concerns' that he might have. During your one-on-one private discussion with your son, let him know that you were doing some spring-cleaning around the house and you discovered that he is encountering an issue with his urinary/bladder. Explain the background on the reason you are asking is that because this can usually be medically treatable. Let him know that in doing spring-cleaning chores around the house, you discovered the packaged adult incontinence products. Let him know that this is common problem but usually very treatable. Ask him when does the incontinence occur, daily, just at nighttime, around school test times, when he is more tired, is there urge control during the daytime, etc. (I wouldn't tell him that you found soiled evidence, and do not refer to the products as 'diapers' but as 'incontinence products' or the tradename 'depends'). Tell him that you have scheduled a routine medical checkup doctors' appointment for each family member, and will go with him to the appointment.  (Let your son know that during the actual doctors exams, you could step out of the examing room to give your son privacy) Causes could be due to food allergies, overweight, bladder infection, constipation, stress, heredity, lack of muscle control, drinking too many liquids in the evening, hormones, caffeine, smoking, etc. Treatment often depends on the cause and how severe the problem is. Tell your son that you will be there for him and help him find treatment options, and perhaps he would be willing to try the alternative vitamin therapy to see if that helps. Tell your son that you understand some things might be difficult to discuss, and he can come to you anytime about anything on his mind. Ask him how he feels about this issue interferring with his daily enjoyment on a scale of 1-10? Ask him to tell you about it. Thank your son for being able to discuss this, tell him you appreciate his candor no matter what his reaction is to the discussion, and tell him that you will get thru this together and support him however you can. In any case schedule a doctor's visit as soon as possible to rule out any possible unlikely but serious medical issues.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	There is no doubt that it will be humiliating for him.  However, as  parents it's our job to help our kids when we can.<br>  <br>  I think the way you approach (not confront) him on the subject could make a huge difference.  I'd let him know you weren't snooping, just sweeping or whatever and that you found them.  I'd also let him know you are talking to him because it IS a medical condition and can be treated.  <br>  <br>  While he will be embarrassed in the beginning, hopefully he will be much happier in the long run by solving a very embarrassing medical condition.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2QOcTTTuaa	This is a rather delicate question.  Could it be possible that he is using the diapers to contain nocturnal emissions, because he is embarrassed about it?  Just a thought...I know it is especially difficult for teenage boys to deal with the sexual fluids their bodies generate, since they cannot control it.  Girls get an easier time dealing with menstruation, because it is not as taboo.  I think it might be a good idea to ask a doctor about this before questioning your son about it.|`|40920d469e8966c8b5b709122e72bc1faa	Cherry C,<br>  <br>  Your son has a bed wetting problem, and it would be best to confront him on it. <br>  <br>  Why are you snooping on your child in the first place.

Don't confront him when hes busy with something like internet, phone or homework. In the morning ask him "i need to talk to you, when can we do that?". <br>  <br>  Then when you are talking him, make sure he understands that you are not judging him, and you completely understand and want to help him.<br>  Chances are he will get embarrased and not want to talk about it, but the more and more you talk about it, the more he will accept he has a problem and you can help. It probably won't happen on the first talk, so dont push on him too hard.<br>  <br>  Good luck xo<br>  nila|`|jf8nrfHZaa	He might have a fetish called diaper lover. You should confront him about it. Let him know that you know about his problem and you would like to help. If he does not want to give up diapers, just let him wear them until he grows out of the fetish. I would not change him though. If he contiues to wear diapers into adulthood, you cannot change his decision. Let him have to go through the constant fear of being caught. That way, he might get sick of it. I hope this helps. And remember, always be supportive for a child with any sort of problem.
ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	Scientology is a cult, not a religion.  They do use some medications, but exclude others, for no apparent logical reason.  Also, you don't just join, they put you thru a test, if you fit their profile, they admit you, if you don't, well, they just aren't interested.  A lot has to do with how much money you make, the richer you are, the more likely they will find you admissable.  If you are looking for a real spiritual foundation, don't bother with scientology.|`|BLD9EEWNaa	You might get more answers if you post this in Religion and Spirituality, under the category of Society and Culture.|`|RlzkeY0gaa	Scientology is a 'religion' made up by a science fiction writer who readily admitted that creating a religion was a great way to make money.

AA11020187	You need to be more specific about what information you need. <br>  It is unusual to have a diagnosis of cancer of an unknown primary. At a minimum there should be a histological type such as adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, etc.<br>  If it is simply cancer or carcinoma it is most likely because the only biopsy was an FNA. In this case a tissue biopsy should be obtained. <br>  From a tissue sample special stains can be done to narrow down or determine the primary site. This is often done in addition to various scans of the body.<br>  Every effort should be made to determine the primary site so that the doctors know how to treat it otherwise they are working in the dark. This is one of the main reasons unknown primaries generally have a poor prognosis.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	Cancer can begin in any organ or tissue of the body. The primary, or original, tumor is usually named for the part of the body or the type of tissue in which the cancer begins. The disease can spread (metastasize) from the primary tumor and form metastatic tumors in other parts of the body. For example, breast cancer cells can metastasize to the lungs and cause the growth of a new tumor. When this happens, the tumor in the lung is called metastatic breast cancer because it is composed of breast cancer cells, not lung cancer cells.<br>  <br>  Each year in the United States, several thousand people are diagnosed with metastatic cancer whose primary cancer site is not known. When the primary site cannot be identified, this disease may be called carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP). Most often, the metastatic cancer is first found in the lymph nodes, liver, lung, or bone.<br>  <br>  In recent years, microscopic and other diagnostic techniques have improved dramatically. For this reason, doctors can now determine the primary site in about four out of five cases first diagnosed as CUP. In some cases, the part of the body where cancer cells are first found helps the doctor decide which diagnostic tests will be most helpful. Doctors also have other clues that help them find the primary site:|`|kyTDQEWaaa	I imagine that would be that whatever cancer is found, its not the primary site.  Many times cancer is detected in the bone or the brain.   If its not a certain type of bone or brain cancer, its thought that it started somewhere else and metastasized to the bone or brain, in which case an abdominal CT/and chest CT is done to look for the primary site.|`|Y2ybQEetaa	About cancer of the unknown primary can be read in <a href="http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=cancer%20of%20the%20unknown%20primary" rel="nofollow">http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=ca...</a>

I had a lump like that at the front of one of my eyebrows and you couldn't see it unless I raised my eyebrow up - and then it just looked like a lump.

I went to the doctor because it was there for over two years... and it just kept getting bigger... and first he said it was a pimple that would eventually show - and then it still wasn't going away so I went back a year later and he recommended me to a specialist. I ended up having surgery to have it removed. It wasn't a health issue though - so it was considered cosmetic surgery and its expensive. <br>  <br>  I don't know if that's what yours is.. but it sounds like it.

YrdUWtSCaa	During an outbreak of cold sores, salty foods, citrus foods (oranges etc.), and other foods that irritate the sores should be avoided. Wash the sores once or twice a day with warm, soapy water and pat gently to dry. Over-the-counter lip products that contain the chemical phenol (such as Blistex Medicated Lip Ointment) and numbing ointments (Anbesol) help to relieve cold sores. A bandage may be placed over the sores to protect them and prevent spreading the virus to other sites on the lips or face. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) may be taken if necessary to reduce pain and fever.<br>  <br>  Vitamin and mineral supplements and diet may have an effect on the recurrence and duration of cold sores.

yE2vM76naa	Carbohydrates....<br>  <br>  However, here is the thing...your brain can be swimming in seratonin (5HT) or even its precursor (5HIAAA) and that doesn't mean that it will be useful....ever notice that the drugs to increase 5HT in the brain are "reuptake inhibitors" thats a real fancy way of saying "keep it from being broken down" - and a lot of time, the problem is that its broken down faster than its used....so you need to stop that process from going on. <br>  <br>  One way to do that is to reduce the amount of inflammatory cytokines, which decrease the fluidity of the cellular membranes....and that can be done by increasing the amounts of omega three fats in the diet - flax sed meal, and oily fish.|`|mg3DzHwFaa	Whole-grain breads, crackers, pasta, rice, cereal, and fruit all have the potential to increase your serotonin level. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://ivy_league0.tripod.com/rhyme_of_the_ancient_wanderer/id39.html" rel="nofollow">http://ivy_league0.tripod.com/rhyme_of_t...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Easy-and-Natural-Ways-to-Raise-Your-Low-Serotonin-Levels&id=795255" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Easy-and-Natur...</a>|`|lfGPmrqdaa	We need to increase serotonin production by increasing the ratio of tryptophan to phenylalanine and leucine.<br>  Fruits with a good ratio include dates, papaya and banana. <br>  However, increasing foods rich in tryptophan (eg, meats, proteins) do not increase serotonin levels, due to competition with other amino acids.<br>  Bright light therapy is another popular method which prevents the conversion of serotonin to melatonin, so spend some time in natural sunlight.|`|yVmmDcwFaa	Omega3 is the best natural product for that.<br>  <br>  You can get a freebie here: <a href="http://thelowcostsite.com/promotions/link.php?id=free_omega3" rel="nofollow">http://thelowcostsite.com/promotions/lin...</a><br>  <br>  I hope it helps<br>  <br>  p.s. exercise and sunlight also helps a lot|`|T64zP6fgaa	5-htp and omega 3-6--9 oils
BOuPi3wDaa	I've found that Midol is the best solution, second would be Ibuprofen.  Also taking a warm bath or going for a walk seems to help with the milder ones.  Hope this helps!|`|ZbMLigR3aa	I can tell you what works for me:<br>  A moist heating pad placed on the abdomen for 15 mins/once or twice per hour, midol or advil, a nap, eating chocolate (well, even if it doesn't reduce cramps I still feel better), drinking hot tea (decaffinated mint tea is great), watching a good movie (helps to take my mind off things).  Perhaps you can take something from this that will help you.  Hope you find a way to ease your cramps quickly.  Take care.|`|mcmOslOFaa	I know this is going to sound like the last thing your going to want to do but it works better then anything...SEX!! I am serious, I am 28 years old and that is the the #1 thing that works not only for me but my sister, and all my friends.  also, if you do not want to do that, try to drink a beer or glass of wine, sometimes that works.  But sex also works for migraines and regular headaches to. Good luck and give it a try!|`|SvffjoIwaa	Midol is good. If you don't have a heating pad, you can boil water and heat a towel with the hot water. Becareful not to burn yourself. Place the warmed towel where you feel the most pain. Another thing that works is walking. Sounds crazy because it's the last thing you would want to do, but it helps to loosen things up so it flows out easier. When I was younger I also took hot showers, drank soothing tea, or just took a nap.|`|vGk4PlSWaa	Well I Take A Double Dose Of Teen Midol Cause It Helps On Mostly Cramps because thats what teens mostly get.|`|itAhPNcqaa	sleeping is very important ,take something to sleep<br>  hot shower always the best answer ,dont fill your stomach|`|wagYLZ1faa	If midol and all those other pills dont work(which they didnt for me, i was up to taking 12 midols a day) then i went and talked to my gyno and she put me on YAZ(the pill) it will balance out your levels and reduce the pain to where it will be bearable with just 1 or 2 midolds.

Q4ggnG0waa	It may or may not have anything to do with smoking. That happens to me in the winter because you've got the dry heat in your house, which dries out your sinuses. I've always had sinus problems and take a zyrtec-d, which help greatly.<br>  <br>  Dee, you should list the website you copied that info from. He may get more info there also.|`|OQdPzl15aa	the vessels in your nose are incredibly fragile, and too much blowing or too many sinus problems good cause them to rupture.<br>  <br>  I doubt you have smoking-related cancer at such a young age; usually cancer from smoking doesn't set in until you are much older and after many years of being exposed to smoke.<br>  <br>  Either way, you should quit before you DO get cancer, and go to your doctor to make sure it isn't something serious.  I would give it a week or so before going in, to see if it gets any better.<br>  <br>  But seriously, stop smoking while you are ahead. It's a waste of money and it's bad for you...makes you smell, makes your breath stink, makes you age more quickly and ruins your bright smile.  Girls do not find this attractive on guys.  My prof. in college said he calculated how much money had had spend on cigarettes in the course of 10 years, and he discovered he wasted $40,000 on smoking.  Yikes.  That could pay for a really nice car or down payment on a house or even a killer vacation.|`|OoXfl4psaa	Bloody noses are more common in the winter because the air is cold and dry. Indoor air is drier also, even if you don't use a heater. The drier air leads to irritation of the nasal mucosa. Given enough irritation, the nose will bleed. Allergies, colds, and exposure to other irritants (such as secondhand smoke) will make things worse.<br>  <br>  Your son may find some relief by using an over the counter saline nasal spray. Be sure to buy nasal spray that is just PLAIN saline (salt water), NOT one with medication. Using the saline mist once or twice a day will help to keep his nasal passages moist and less prone to irritation. <br>  <br>  If his nosebleeds persist, or if you notice they always involve the same nostril, you should have him see a doctor (preferably an ear/nose/throat doc). Occasionally, people will have an area in their nose where a blood vessel is more prominent, so it becomes easily irritated. If this is the case with your son, a simple and painless cautery of the area will help.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	You don't have cancer, but you will if you don't quit.   You probably are smoking too much and maybe have some allergy to the smoke-thats why you're short of breath.   Possibly a little asthma.  The blood is nothing, its winter and everyone's nose is dry.    Quit smoking ASAP and you will feel a thousand percent better.|`|ce150cba77d5a8e4bc72290ebf1eb4f6aa	Sounds like a chronic sinus infection.. happens all the time... probably just need an antibiotic... quit smoking... let this be a wake-up call.. probably not cancer now... but someday, if you keep it up.. it will be.. see how you're worried now?... you wanna worry like that your whole life??

There usually have a list of specific drugs that if you are taking, they won't accept the blood...to my surprise though, they take far more than I thought.  It also varies state by state as to what is acceptable.  Also, what is best for you...you need to be healthy too so skipping your meds is probably not in your best interest.  Some medications are out of the system within 24 hours...but some build up levels so skipping one day may not do it.|`|q14QPcDcaa	You should not take any drugs 2 days before you give blood and make sure you drink lots of fluids before giving blood but don't drink fizzy drinks only fruit juice and water and you must eat healthy food too.|`|Y2ybQEetaa	About Giving blood can be read in <a href="http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=Giving%20blood" rel="nofollow">http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=Gi...</a>|`|AA10827766	YES OMG, you shouldn't be taking any meds if giving blood

What you have to do is call the billing office and have them forward the bills to China.  You are not responsible for her bills technically, but maybe you could help out if she needs it.  When my cousin visited from Canada, she too went to the ER and because she was staying with me, I gave my address.  Like you, the bills came to me so I called the billing dept. and told them to send them to her. I never got another bill.  If they insist that you pay, don't believe it.  They will do or say anything to get their money.  You don't have to pay it.  Forward the bills and if they do keep sending them, don't open the envelope and write on the envelope. "Wrong address"  Put it back in the mailbox and it will go right back to the hospital.  Just don't open it.  Ok,  Hope that helps.  Just know, you are not responsible for your mother's bill.
cPTRlMJ8aa	eat your medicines accordingly, do not smoke, drink cold water only for 1 day right after the surgery, do not rinse, refrain from eating or drinking hot food, eat non solid food, if the swelling continues, soak towel in warm water then put it on your cheek. <br>  <br>  average healing time is about 1 week to 1 month.|`|HYPxtFHzaa	nothing really...just eat soft foods;<br>  like gelatine so you wont injure your gums|`|qxWoiRHwaa	My dentist recommened I use a saline rinse, and it really seemed to help.

FicyC2TXaa	One in 8 or 9 women will get breast cancer, and only 5-10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary - so yes, it's perfectly possible for two or more women in the same family, including sisters,  to have non-hereditary breast cancer.<br>  <br>  Only 10% of ovarian cancers are hereditary, and cancers diagnosed after the age of 50 are less likely to be hereditary.|`|AA10723498	I have 7 sisters.  In Oct of 08, my older sister had a bi-lateral mastectomy.  The following month, I also had a bi-lateral mastectomy.  Granted, breast cancer is hereditary most of the time, but think about it., a hereditary factor has to start somewhere.  You may think there is no hereditary factor because the cancers in your family date way back, but we are all born with the cancer gene.  My younger sister also had breast cancer and 4th stage ovarian cancer.  People have the misconceptions that if no one in the family had breast cancer, then you or your siblings won't get it.  Not true, anyone can get breast cancer whether there is a hereditary factor or not.<br>  EDIT  Bozema, I'm glad your DNA testing was neg.  However, We also had the testing at Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.  My older sister I mentioned and I came out neg also.  We both got the breast Cancer.  There's more involved than just a rare mutaion that won't show up.  My Oncologist explained it to me.  My sister and I both had complete hysterectomies.  Therefore, he said without any of these organs, our test would come out neg because it's based largely in part of having ovaries.  I can't explain it the way he does, but it made sense.  If you have not had the hyst, and you're neg, your good to go.  Congradulation.  My insurance paid for the test, but our family history is so strong we all have a 90% chance of getting breast cancer.  So far, out of the 8 girls, 3 of us had it./  One sister is dead, so that leaves 7 girls left.  I hope no one else in my family gets it.  I'm so happy your test came out neg.  I love hearing that.<br>  ADD to Lo mcg. I think you should do more research.  I'm 62, my sister si 65, the first sister to get it was 59. ALL are hereditary according to our Oncologist.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It's absolutely possible, given how common breast cancer is.  That said, it's worth undergoing genetic testing to rule out the possibility when two first degree relatives get it.  But you need to know that genetic testing only tests for the most common mutations on the most commonly affected genes and there may be a rare mutation in your family that the test won't cover. Another thing to know is that insurance will generally not cover this testing unless the patients have genetic risk factors that are greater than 10% so if that is the case, they need to be prepared to shell out around $3,200 for the first test and if it is positive, $700 for each person tested thereafter.  They should discuss it with their doctors.|`|xPxIIlGfaa	yes and or no ; it's a genetic thing...  Brest cancer is a carcinoma.<br>    it a adaptability question.

EQAwlKZ5aa	Well the reason why you end up going to a fast food restaurant is because your diet doesn't consist of the right foods. That's why your body doesn't feel satiated. I wouldn't recommend losing weight at such a fast rate, because if you do you will end up putting it all back on fairly quickly and then some more. You need a lifestyle change. Don't think of this as a diet. Try to eat 6 small meals rather than 3 big ones. This will keep you full and give you energy. Remember to pick meals that are high in protein and complex carbohydrates. Eat fruits, vegetables and nuts. Drink a lot of water. Do not under any circumstances cut your caloric intake under 1500; this is a recipe for disaster. Your body will go into starvation mode and will start holding on to fat and burning muscle! You need 2500 calories if not more to maintain your weight, so to lose weight I suggest eating 2000. All in all, you shouldn't’t be concerned about the number of calories you’re eating but the quality of your food. You need to eat all kinds of foods for your body to stay healthy.

IxLkAEA3aa	30 days exactly|`|imKCvvFKaa	i hear it takes a while...|`|G83yqe75aa	marijuana has a halflife in your system. How long it takes to leave your system depends on how much you smoke. But the time maxes out at around 45 days. One smoking session for someone with a clean system takes about 3-4 days to be clean. Smoke 2 days later and then have to wait about a week, and so on. The time it will take roughly doubles every time you smoke until it maxes at about 45 days to be clean. So if you are maxed out and you wait about 2 weeks and then smoke again, you're basically back to 45 days.<br>  <br>  This also depends on the test. Most job drug tests only test down to about 100 nanograms, which isn't dead accurate but will pick up if you are a smoker obviously. Court-appointed tests can test anywhere down to 10-20 nanograms, which is very accurate, and can also detect high levels of water, and any other drug test liquids. You can not fool those tests, and drinking water and tea does nothing for getting weed out of your system at all. The ONLY way to get it out is time, because it is in your blood.|`|9IqzLDhnaa	In depends on how strong and how much you smoke.<br>  Cannabis if you only smoke it now and then will be out of your system in 3/6 weeks.<br>  If you smoke it all the while it could take up 2 six months.|`|lqt3wTQvaa	weed can take up to a month if you smoke heavily every single day. mostly it takes a couple weeks<br>  <br>  just drink lots of water and try to excercise..sweating helps to detoxify|`|4c056b35b4e33a793a012798113bbc31aa	ussually about a month. if you have a drug test coming up take a bunch of niacin pills and drink a bunch of water
F4DhYjlnaa	If the cervix is already irritated or tender, the scraping tool they use to take the samples can cause the cervix to bleed a little bit. It happens to me, too, but not every time.|`|dgRTkccBaa	Yes, spotting is normal because they have to touch your cervix to get a cell sample.  The cervix can be sensitive and bleed easily.  I'm surprised they didn't tell you you might bleed a little.|`|hZWup7xXaa	it is normal, i had one about a week ago and i bled like crazy, im not sure why, this was my 4th one and the other times i only bled a tiny bit. but it is normal, especially if your expecting your period soon. hope this helps hun :)|`|t44168wJaa	yes, a little bleeding is normal your gyno should have told you that
qnD5RfbPaa	This is because the supplements is taking a little too long to digest.  This could be because it is not mixing enough with enzymes required for its efficient digestion.  Or possibly because you are not ingesting other nutrients necessary for it's absorption.  Therefore it is better taking your supplements with heavy meals or immediately following a heavy meal that are complete with all essential food groups (mostly of which should be either fresh raw fruits or fresh raw vegetables).  While eating your meals would trigger the secretion of saliva, which is very important for efficient digestion and the enzymes from the raw foods will also help. (yogurt also supplies you with enzymes)   <br>  <br>  The chewables, you should probably try to suck (not sure that would work), immediately after you finish eating.<br>  <br>  You probably could try your supplements crushed into a glass of juice made from fresh raw fruits or vegetables and drink.<br>  <br>  I once read that supplementing your diet with B vitamins (which are nerve vitamins) and vitamin C will help.  If you try this, you should especially ensure that vitamin B6 is included, since it is essential for proper absorption of calcium.<br>  <br>  Seek out natural supplements to take.  You get more from these and they are better on the stomach.<br>  <br>  If none of the above works, than you might need to rely on milk to supply your calcium.  Milk is the best known source of calcium.  And it also carries the other vitamins and minerals necessary for its absorption.|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	I have the same problem. The iron in the vitamins are normally the culprits. If you are post menopausal I would get a multi without iron at a health food store.|`|zyHfRp5Faa	Just the same with my mother.<br>  She can't have any vitamins last time.<br>  When she tried to consult the doctor, than she just found out that her body is not getting used with all the vitamins she took.<br>  Then the doctor suggested that she took a lower dose vitamins.<br>  She break into half, each of her vitamins. And she took one every 2 days interval.<br>  That means if today she took half of multivitamin pill, tomorrow she will take her calcium pill (in half of course), the next day she she will take her salmon oil (one soft gel). So, she doesn't get sick, nausea, diarrhea, etc, because she took it one in each day, not all of them in one day.<br>  You can try it yourself. It works for my mom.<br>  Good luck.|`|F4DhYjlnaa	Have you tried eating first, then taking them? I usually take mine in the afternoon, after I have had plenty of coffee and some lunch. Perhaps you could consider tinctures instead - liquid forms of vitamins that you could add to your juice or other beverage, but not taste.<br>  <br>  Also, my mom chews Vita-Balls, they are like gumballs with all the vits. in them.
nAp688tZaa	OK, first of all, they are both opiates and both equally addictive.  There is no way to get around that possibility and there is no way that he is not going to be physically dependent on them after long term use.  You just need to remember that there is a difference between addiction and dependence.  Addiction is mental and the person's life revolves around when and where he will be able to get his next high.  Dependence is when you have used the medication for an extended period of time and the body actually needs it to function "normally."  Switching him to morphine is not going to fix an addiction issue, which is what you seem to be concerned about. Oxycontin, when taken as directed (not crushed, snorted, injected), actually has a lower incidence of abuse.  It is when people crush up their pills and get the dosage all at once that is the problem since the medication is intended to be released in the system over a period of 8-12 hours.  I take Oxycontin for a neck injury I got in a head on collision last year.  Since I have also developed epileptic seizures from the head trauma, I have not been able to get my neck fused as needed because there are serious consequences if you fall within a couple of months of the fusion.  The Oxycontin has been very good for me and I have been on the same dose now for almost 8 months.  It still works and if I need something for break through pain, a couple ibuprofen will usually do the trick until it is time for the next dose.  People do start to develop a tolerance to opiates when they are used for an extended period of time and this is just one of the things that is expected when they are used.  But how is IV morphine going to make it better?  He will need to be fitted for a pain pump, which is very expensive, and he will more than likely still need to have the dosage adjusted every once in a while to account for the tolerance.  If he is seeing a Pain Management doctor and being monitored with his use of the Oxycontin (pill counts, drug tests) then this, IMHO, is better than switching to IV Morphine.|`|211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	A friend of mine who had cysts on her back and several surgeries had the morphine pump.  I don't think it did much good because I still saw bottles and bottles of at least 10 other pain killers, muscle relaxants and benzodiazapenes.<br>  <br>  I have had chronic pain (including back pain from a bad fall in 2003 & a corrective fusion in 2005) and have had no luck with the oral meds.  In January, my doctor put me on the Duragesic Patch at 25 mcg.  It is the 2nd to the lowest dose.  It is most definitely available in higher doses, so that is good news.  Also, if you husband's condition improves at all, it is a very easy step down medication to ween him off the drug if that indeed needs to happen. <br>  <br>  I do not feel addicted to the drug at all.  I put a patch on and it lasts for 72 hours.  Very rarely do I have to supplement it with Vicoden, Soma or even IBU 800.  When I do have to take other medications, it is mostly not related to my back pain, but rather the other chronic pain conditions that I deal with.<br>  <br>  So, while you are investigating the possibilities of using a morphine pump or injections, I would highly recommend the use of a Duragesic/Fentenyl patch.  I, again, cannot speak highly enough of the medication as it has allowed me to take back to much of my life.<br>  <br>  I have not tried Oxycontin and have no desire to simply based on what I have heard about the addiction issues.<br>  <br>  Good Luck & Give him my best.

hXQBbOlvaa	I think that this is a good general guideline of a healthy diet, but instead of looking at specifically what you are eating, try to follow these daily guidelines:<br>  <br>  *at least 5 fruits and vegetable servings<br>  *at least 6 (8oz) servings of water<br>  * 2 sources of calcium (milk, yogurt, cheeses)<br>  * 2 sources of lean proteins (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef)<br>  * 2 (tbsp.) servings of healthy oils (essentially anything but vegetable  oil)--[I love fat-free italian dressing on salads]<br>  * 1 serving of multi-grain breads (when possible)<br>  * 1 mineral/multivitamin supplement<br>  <br>  I have followed this general diet since October and have lost 40lbs so far.  I have also incorporated daily exercise.  <br>  <br>  I wish you all the best on your weight loss journey!|`|frvhqM6Haa	Okay from what i have learned, is that if you increase the amount of times you eat, you can help to increase the rate of your metabolism, granted i work out everyday, but adding in some cardio workouts and small weight work can help as well.

Did you know a lb of fat is 3500 calories? That means that over a week, if you ate an excess of this which was ADDED to the 1500 eat day, you would only gain a lb and probably look no different. I'm telling you this because I know what you feel like I believe. I am 90lbs and 5ft 3 and had the same problem. I've been eating over 2500 calories a day and I'm hardly gaining any weight. It's not worth being so skinny when you could focus on so many other great things in life. There are many people in the world happy with how they look and everyone else would not want them any thinner. Once you start gaining some weight again, you will feel more like yourself and you will realize that you are not fat. Having a layer of fat is normal. You don't see many people with your kind of body because it is unhealthy, because of a mental disorder. It's not a happy thing. I know it might seem like the most important thing to count your calories, but listen to your body for once. Your mind and body are different. If you feel hungry and achey all over, you know what this means. Take care of it. Vitamins help you when you're eating and they help you to not gain fat too. They won't make you healthy if you are not eating. Being healthy is the right thing to do. Looking skinny and having everyone suspect your obvious problem isn't the way to go.<br>  I hope you get better.|`|ptDkPkd8aa	gradually increase your intake of calories, and eat high fiber food. Start by eating low caloric food such as crisp green celery sticks (seriously have like <10 calories per stalk). Then salads, then salads with meat and high fat dressings, then chicken and practically any meat not red, then fast food. Within a few months when you worked up to fast food you'll be average in no time.|`|QY1i8lUfaa	What you need most is someone to talk to and take notice of you.

If you feel very anxious about this, do you have a friend or relative who you can confide in and they could go with you to the appointment?<br>  <br>  The doctor will be able to refer you for appropriate treatment and get you support for your eating disorder. I'm sorry your dad doesn't seem very supportive, but you can and will get through this because you already recognise you have a problem and that's half the battle.<br>  <br>  Take care.
FU4TyghIaa	okay, bipolar huh?<br>  One thing with mental illness of this nature is that the sufferer can lack insight into their own condition.  All the education in the world won't change it.  It's the nature of the illness/condition.  To grasp what's happening to your own mind and have objectivity can be very difficult.  When i have episodic behaviour (as a sufferer) I've got no idea pretty much what's happening.  I can tell afterwards, sometimes but others.  The condition effects your mind, so it makes it hard.  Like you get a broken leg, it's broken, you can see it and feel it, you know.  When your mind is sick, then your thinking is distorted, so you can't see it.  <br>  <br>  Another thing with bipolar, the mania is like a drug.  It feels good, it's addictive and in that state you can be wreckless.  Many mania sufferers are reported as having increased libido and not being too discriminating about how they satisfy it.  <br>  <br>  Then in a depressed state, such misery, doom and gloom, so overwhelming that nothing will work or fix it, there is no hope.<br>  <br>  That's a broad idea anyway, the details vary considerably from patient to patient.  Differing degrees of insight, differing manifestations of the mood swings, and mood swings can rapidly change (cycling) or can persist for long periods of time.<br>  <br>  Medication.  The way that works.  Getting the right dose.  I've seen doses that appear insufficient.  The mood disturbance persists.<br>  Then the dose might be too high.  Patients lack affect and just sit around not reacting much.  Frequently weight gain is a side effect and that can be pretty depressing, but so shut down they're just like vegetables.  Some clinicians consider that to be a managed state.  Strange they would think that, but they're just following their procedures or whatever?<br>  <br>  But it's a fine line, and even though controlled and stable with the medication, the patient can still lapse into episodes, require hospitalisation until stable again, and then go back to the same dose, controlled again.  Some patients might typically function well with the medication, but have episodes say every two or three.years.  I've never done lithium myself, but my girlfriend tried it for a while.  She's on an anti psychotic now.  Lithium has been around for a long time, but is still administered with some success.<br>  <br>  The thing with being with someone who has bipolar and it has some similarities to borderline personality, it's so demanding how somebody can just argue or accuse or deceive or do and say all kinds of things that seem really really bad.  And to not take it personally.  To understand that it's the illness, not them doing it deliberately, when they sit there and just talk to you like nothings going on and it's all your fault for upsetting them or who knows.<br>  <br>  You say you think still hallucinating?  Or just saying that for effect?  <br>  <br>  It's difficult, cause just cause someone effected says something, it's not necessarily like it's even them saying it, but they said it and mmm.  If she is bipolar, it's a hard road to be in a relationship.  But nothing is impossible.<br>  <br>  So, rather than say there are bipolar symptoms, you might see there is some pretty difficult stuff typically with bipolar.  I know when i'm elevated i have so much energy and feel so blithely optimistic, get grandiose ideas.  <br>  <br>  Might not be your cup of tea this relationship, i tell ya, it can always catch ya off guard.  Or you might end up doubting everything and being really negative or dismissive or her.<br>  <br>  I'm not even that sure what you're asking.  Or you just want a postmortem on the relationship.  If it is over, then it's over.  But saying that, she may come after you and appeal to you like with the phone calls.  I've read some partners of people with these types of mental conditions talking about having the strength to finally be decisive and just slam the door.  It's unfortunate i think that people can get so nasty and character assassinate when it's not character but illness that's the root of the problem.  To remain calm and still love the person enough and be strong enough to say, i love you, but it's not working out, i can't handle the illness, and not give into any approaches, pleas, temptations or promises if that's what you want?<br>  Or to rekindle a relationship that always can bite you like a viper when you put yourself in a position that is vulnerable again.<br>  <br>  Don't know like i say what you're really asking or if i have answered anything.  Good luck.|`|vbXRz82Xaa	omg i went through all this, she needs to go back on the meds, she probably came off too fast...... <br>  keep things simple do you want to be with her? if not break up and have no contact.<br>  it sound like she also needs CBT, look into it you could save her life!|`|SkDomhoXaa	you need to look after yourself as well, your trying to be the good guy by standing by her, but is this what you truly want?<br>  how many mg of lithium was she on? and any other medication?<br>  it sounds like she could benefit from CBT its great at helping restore balance and rational thinking! which she could benefit from.<br>  did she stop her drugs cold turkey? as they should be fazed out slowly......her psych would not have discharged her in the state she is in. if she has of told nhs24 they would have told her to go A&E straight away as you cant mess about with lithium.<br>  the manic state can include promiscuous, and irrational thinking, it is the most dangerous faze of bipolar due to risk taking (accidental suicide). if she is as bad as you think ring the crisis team and they can advise you and even get her in hospital for her own safety.<br>  if i can help more get in touch<br>  good luck|`|pDptioSNaa	If she educates herself on her situation and takes her meds on a regular basis......<br>  <br>  She can get away from the see-saw that is her life as of now.

If you don't have that kind, regular neosporin or another antibacterial cream is a good idea to help prevent infection. Also you can take a painkiller such as Advil or Tylenol (don't take aspirin if you're under 20). If you can, bandage the rug burn.

You may have respiratory problems which may be causing your shortness of breath. Maybe you have asthma. Asthma causes you to be light headed and have shortness of breath which maybe causing the trembling. <br>  3. The lack of certain nutrients in your body may cause you to feel light headed, tremble, and lose hair. Anemia causes symptoms similar to the ones you have. Try improving your diet. Take vitamins and omega acids. They might be helpful.<br>  4. You might be experiencing some side effects from the medicines you have taken. Ask your doctor about side effects with your medicine or look them up on line. <br>  5. Are you feeling depressed? Depression can cause a person to feel like that sometimes. <br>  <br>  The most important thing to do is smile, even if you do not feel like doing it. Smiling sends chemical signals to the brain that will make you feel better. If you feel better, try going outside for a little while and walk around. Eat foods that make you feel happy (ice cream, chocolate, etc.). Eat while you are doing your homework. It might help you think better. Eat nutrtious foods. Exercise. Listen to music.

Anyway...<br>  From my knowlegde and dealing with depression and anxiety issues, after talking to my cousellor she told me that those two things can go hand in hand.<br>  Depression can lead to anxiety, when the depression is dealt with, usually the anxiety will subside.<br>  On the flip side, anxiety can lead to depression because of the constant worrying and creating problems in your life from it. So then again, if your anxiety is treated you will be less likely to become depressed (or your depression will go away).<br>  From your description of your experiences, it seems that you suffer mainly from anxiety problems, but it is becoming very distressing lately. This in itself can be causing you to become depressed (which is what it seems to be doing), if you don't get help for these feelings you have it can and will only get worse.<br>  You may need to go on anti-depressants as well as anti-anxiety (on the advice of a doctor), in conjuction with going to couselling and/or cognitive behavioural theraphy... would be very helpful for you.<br>  I hope this was helpful, I've added a few links below that you may find useful.|`|T64zP6fgaa	Yeah, if you are pregnant the hormones could be causing the rest of your symptoms.....<br>  You should find out, and not take the drugs if pregnant|`|hdTztmKDaa	It sounds like you have a bad case of anxiety.

It depends how long  it can last and varies from person to person, it can last a few weeks ,months ,years or possibly for the rest of your life time.You basically have a chemical imbalance in your brain and it can take a while to even out. You also seem to have a lot going on that is very important to you so that is probably why this is coming about now.I would try therapy first ways to help deal with your anxiety first, also exercise will help you because it releases endorphins that make you feel better. If none of these work after a couple weeks of trying them , then try a medication. with the medication they will usually start you off at a certain dose and if it works they will keep you at that dose and if you  used them as prescribed you will not get addicted. Good luck hun I know its tough to deal with it, just try and have someone there that will lend an ear to listen when you need it this can help you. My friend takes zoloft and that seems to help with both her anxiety and depression.|`|6akCILTQaa	This answer you can get in your mind itself. My sincere advice would be just sit alone in room and think about it|`|xNSpnSX1aa	I think you have too much on your plate.  I have depression and it seems to me that you have anxiety, but possibly both.  Becoming sick in the morning may be because you are extremely overwhelmed and nervous about what the day might bring.  I do not think your anxiety will let up until you either start medication for it, go to counseling and/or therapy (not that you would have time for this now), or the anxiety may let up after you pass the BAR.  You have an incredibly large amount of stress right now and until some of your "controllable" circumstances are addressed, I do not think it will get better.  Xanax will help immediately, but may make you very sleepy.  Try starting a low dose of Xanax and see how it affects you.  If it helps and you can still study that's great.  Lexapro is a good antideppresant.  It probably would be a good idea to take it just in case but remember it takes a few weeks to get into your system before you notice any effect.  Your morning sickness could be ulcers from stress.  I really wish you the best of luck!

The normal range for a Thryoid level (TSH) is .3 or .4 . If your level was above that, than you have an underactive or Hypothyroidism. If your levels are below the normal range, than you an over active thyroid or Hyperthyroidism. <br>  <br>  I have hypothyroidism, my TSH level was at 6.8. I think this applies the same for the T4 and FTI levels. So I would bet you have a Hyperactive thyroid. The symptoms for a Hyperactive thyroid are fast heart rate and hard to keep weight on. Although symptoms for Hyper and Hypo active thyroids can not always be specific to one type of thyroid condition. It is easy helping pinpoint which you may have. <br>  I hope this helps and Good luck!!

WKQS4z96aa	I think your BEST bet would be to pay for one session with a personal trainer. They can watch what you know and your form to see what works best for your body. You're definitely on the right track by not working the same muscles two days in a row. I'm a huge fan of interval training on any level and mixing it up. So if you're using the same exercises every week, buy a book to give you some ideas. A good book for men is 101 Workouts for Men by Health and Fitness Magazine. You want to add muscle confusion so they work harder. I don't understand exactly what you mean  by writing down reps for each muscle group since you seem to already have a plan for how many reps for you in each set but I hope this helped.|`|6akCILTQaa	Do situps atleast 20 daily, that might help

It will only tell your body to store fat cells for energy.  If you want to lose weight eat 3 healthy meals a day and 2 snacks. Drink plenty of water and exercise.|`|xd7tSmQeaa	You are a complete moron for wanting to do this.  <br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a starvation diet.  You are purposely depriving your body of the nutrients it needs for what?  Nothing.  If your body doesn't get any food it actually stores fat to live.  <br>  <br>  The best diet in the world is eating right and getting regular exercise.  It works every time it is tried.<br>  <br>  So forget pills, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, etc.  Eat well and go regularly to your local gym.|`|0BX8Lozkaa	Right away, I dropped 35lbs in a month.....but my back molar was infected and got into my jaw muscles.

So I would choose to not be an idiot and diet the right way. Don't be lazy. Exercise.|`|8FlSSQIGaa	about a day, but thats mostly water weight. but dont do a starvation diet. its extremely unhealthy and severely damages your body. and when you do this your body shuts down its metabolism. and that means that when you do start eating again, which you will have to do. your body wont metabolize any of the food you eat and it will just hold onto it for dear life because youre not giving it anything. and you will gain all of the weight back in a hurry. how about you eat more healthy and go outside for a run for 30 min oh say 5 days a week.|`|AA12227599	When you starve yourself your body holds on real tight to what fat you do have and doesn't let go. Your body needs fat to live and when it is being starved it goes into sorta like a panic mode and holds on for dear life. Why would you do something so silly ? When are people going to get that there is no quick fix for being overweight ? If you let yourself go and gain weight than you have to suck it up and start exercising and fueling your body with nutritious food. Trust me, there is no way to sit on your *** and lose weight, otherwise why would there even be gyms. But if you're going to do it anyway, I would expect it to take longer than if you were simply eating healthy and being active.|`|3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	Pretty fast within a few days. But that is the worst way to diet. Reduce the calories to a little less than what your body needs, not stopping completly. This can kill you. Also I would recommend a mulitvitamin for some of the nutrients that you won't be getting from food.|`|KzmrWzOJaa	Why would anyone do that? When you start eating again, you will gain more weight that you weight now! If you want to loose weight, drink about 4 cups of hot green tea (at every meal) and you have to exercise about an hour a day doing cardio at an Intense pace to begin to loose weight!|`|Xg8Y3kTZaa	Starvation actually will not help you lose weight.  It hurts your metabolism and you can actually gain weight.  Instead, you should try to eat foods with less calories and fats.|`|F4DhYjlnaa	Why would you want to starve? Just try restricting your caloric intake to about 1600 calories a day. You will lose weight and still be healthy. Starving yourself can damage vital organs like your heart. Not a good idea.|`|1cDo3REBaa	to start with you will store fat, this is because your body goes into starvation mode and stores any fat it does have or get|`|3Gd7OBezaa	i agree with john focus on smaller portions because if u starve u'll feel run down then u'll binge 4 a couple of days thats why celebs r always dieting!<br>  ask urself what celeb is always on a diet.|`|01fAZtaeaa	Hi ... don't do that...<br>  <br>  Let me tell you starvation diet don’t work; you may have weight loss at first but in the end you will gain the weight you lost back and more.<br>  <br>  You slow down your metabolism when you don't eat on a regular basis during the day; and your body stores what he can't get from you. Then once you start eating again regularly your body will store even  more fat than it did before in case he might be in lack of what he needs in the future... this is why you gain weight even more. <br>  <br>  Take a natural supplement with no side effects and has been proven to help people reduce calorie intake by 1,000 calories a day. <br>  <br>  Reducing your calorie intake, eating healthy foods and regular exercise can be a triple threat to obesity; this is the approach you should take if you’re thinking of using a natural supplement.<br>  <br>  Create a weight loss program for yourself that will be realistic and manageable long term, think in terms of a way of life, not a quick fix.<br>  <br>  There is no need to take such supplement for ever, just for the time needed. Then once you have the result you wish you can learn to eat on a regular basis, in small proportions, and a good tasty food. <br>  <br>  No low calories, but reducing the fat and sugar and alcohol.

hFSqYxgRaa	*  Vasoline is a brand of white petrolatum.  Vasoline calls their product "petroleum jelly".<br>  Vasoline is not a hydrator.  It merely blocks the water from evaporating.  Try a 12% ammonium lactate cream.  It has worked well for me.|`|kMbgcOzJaa	vaseline = petroleum jelly. <br>  <br>  for dry skin, you can use cetaphil cream, sorbolene moisturiser|`|XZOgfxYJaa	vaseline is a brand of petroleum jelly. <br>  <br>  but vaseline also makes a type of lotion. i think it still has the petroleum jelly in it but it is more of a lotion consistency.

f8mLpPXlaa	Yeah smoking is not good for asthmatics. But that didn't cause the fever, diarrhea and nausea. You've got something like the flu going on. The smoking was just coincidental.|`|AuvMZYTSaa	Taking three drags off a ciggy in and of itself will not make you sick.|`|AA10551195	The last eight words of your question should tell you all you need to know. Most likely the cigarette smoke irritated already irritated membranes (you have asthma, you said) and now you are paying for it. From a smoker of 40+ years, if you don't smoke, don't start. If you do smoke, stop. Any way you can. Thanks to smoking, I now have emphysema and am on oxygen 24/7 the rest of my life. I'm grateful for the oxygen, but I wish I'd stopped 10 years ago. I'd still be healthy and able to breathe.|`|pEWEEUBraa	Yes, you can get asthma, lung & mouth cancers, bronchitis, and other diseases.|`|dJtTtQYhaa	Yeah smoking does give you that nasty smokers cough..

It depends on several factors including how well her stitches have healed.  For the best advice she should speak with her doctor who will be able to fully assess her condition.|`|f2EbrS4Zaa	its normal frm 3 days onwards.. but u shud avoid it till a month or so.. coz d vagina is loose for a month or so coz of d cesarean..
RgEtKVaKaa	It does my heart good to hear from people who do not abuse their sick time.  If you have a fever of 101 degrees or greater, you are likely to be contagious so stay home & get well.  I believe we have a responsibility to our fellow man to protect them from what ever we have.  Someone offered a link to a web site  - I assume it is a school policy as to when children should remain at home.  That would be a great guideline.  So, chicken soup & lots of fluids.  Get well soon.|`|3Gd7OBezaa	if u can walk in a straight line u'll be ok!|`|xVmbTsAbaa	Just take it because you don't want to put the public at risk.|`|pqzKlNudaa	Go to work before you get in trouble one day is enough.
tITPAbeKaa	hmmm, probably not. the no underarm hair kinda says you're still not there yet. <br>  A good indicator of whether you'll be getting it soon is if you've had the white discharge for around a year.<br>  <br>  YOu haven't even said how old you are...<br>  And as i always say...seriously, getting your period is a huge pain (literally and metaphorically) The later you get it, the better!|`|oRZlNZk9aa	I think you asked this before but you have to have discharge to.|`|3Gd7OBezaa	yeah could take a week or 2 though<br>  xxxooo
5Tzm6P97aa	Your period might becoming. The symptoms you've described are of PMS (Premenstrual syndrome). It could be two weeks to a couple of days. The hair comes at different times sometimes after your first period. If your lucky it'll never come :P As for the breast pain, it happens during your first period and afterwords may happen before your periods. I suggest you stock up on pads, don't try tampons till your second cause it can be very diffucult to put in and you don't wan't to hurt yourself.<br>  I ope your first period is better than mine I was in a white dress X(<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	Yes probably congrats|`|GHnPXNriaa	it willl come|`|1uxhfh6naa	Those really aren't symptoms that are common, you just might be a late bloomer.

I do|`|ORUAtr0kaa	You are starting to go through puberty, but you might not get your period yet for a while.|`|IWDFArMIaa	mine didn't come till i was 16. it's no fun so don't get excited|`|aHPDAqw0aa	These are symptoms of being a teenager. They have nothing to do with your period other than the fact that it shows you are in puberty. The good news (or bad, I miss not having a period) is that you will start soon because you show signs of puberty but there is no telling how soon. Mine started when I was twelve and my sister's started when she was 13. Some girls can start as young as 7 and some as old as 16. I know it's exciting to get that change and that a lot of your friends probably have started now (it's like a right of passage)...but by the time you become the only one without your period and all your friends are cramping you'll have a tiny happy feeling inside. Don't worry it will come soon enough, my guess is probably within the year. Good luck!|`|1Onob98Laa	well yes, it could be coming.. however you can't push it, it will come on its own.. I got mine when i was 11 and i had no symptoms at all... but believe me you dont want to rush.. be happy while you don't have it...|`|mbNWBem6aa	It's called puberty. And you're a girl. <br>  (fun, isn't it?) <br>  <br>  Probably soonish, maybe. <br>  But how could we possibly know?|`|t0sjtkjAaa	you usually dont get it until your in 6th grade but sometimes it doesnt even come until your 16<br>  <br>  be patient and enjoy not having it.<br>  <br>  it sucks!|`|NFHeDrrPaa	Sounds like it..

0Y2HH0FEaa	I'm assuming these readings are your resting rates.<br>  Your blood pressure (systolic / diastolic) are within normal ranges; the diastolic is a shade low, but only very, very slightly and is probably perfectly normal for you - everyone's normal is different!<br>  Your heart rate is very good.<br>  As long as you're feeling okay and you're not having any symptoms then you're just fine.  If you're concerned, keep measuring the BP once a day over a week and you can see if it's normal for you.

i6RlYFo7aa	a penis that was not circumcised has about half an inch of skin covering the penis head, a circumcised penis has no skin on the head and is scarred|`|3156c54d8f966e51776af0486120bb1daa	There are drawings of circumcised and uncircumcised penises at <a href="http://www.circinfo.net/what_is_circumcision.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circinfo.net/what_is_circumci...</a><br>  <br>  Basically, circumcision is the removal of the foreskin, a folded double layer of skin that normally covers the glans (head) of the penis.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is performed for religious and social custom but most often for its protective medical benefits which include elimination of phimosis, paraphimosis, frenulum breve and balanoposthitis.  Also a reduction of up to 60% in the risk of catching each of several STIs including HPV. chlamydia, thrush and heterosexually acquired HIV/AIDS.|`|2QOcTTTuaa	it is spelled "circumcised", not "circumsized".<br>  <br>  circum...cised<br>  As in, an incision ("cised) is made around the circumference ("circum") of the foreskin of the penis, in order to remove the foreskin.<br>  <br>  It is not a medically necessary procedure, but many parents are led to believe that it is.  Most of the world, including most of Europe, do not circumcise their sons.  Americans began routine circumcision in the mid-1900s in order to prevent masturbation and sexual behaviors prior to marriage.  Of course, it didn't work, masturbation and fornication still happened all the time.  But it got to be so commonplace, that to opt not to circumcise your son was seen as unclean.  That is the very thinking that perpetuates the practice of female genital mutilation (aka female circumcision) in African nations that practice it.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is a functioning part of the penis, meaning it is there for a very good reason.  It protects the glans (head of the penis) and lubricates the penis.  It is also highly sensitive, adding the possibility for greater pleasure during sex.|`|OPa6uHSeaa	The obvious answer is that a circumcised penis has the foreskin removed.  The less obvious answer is that a circumcised penis works differently than an intact penis.  <br>  <br>  The foreskin is a sheath that allows the penis to glide where the penis enters the vagina.  This serves to keep the woman's wetness inside, where it does the most good.  So, one major difference is that intact guys have less need to use a lubricant during intercourse.<br>  <br>  Also, the foreskin reduces the impact of the glans corona during intercourse.  Some guys, like me, have a very large glans and the corona sticks out from the shaft.  Without the foreskin, the corona scrapes the vaginal walls and many women get sore from sex with circumcised guys.<br>  <br>  Over time, the circumcised penis will become less sensitive.  The glans and inner foreskin remnant is mucous membrane.  With this tissue exposed to rubbing against clothing, it gets keratinized and less sensitive over time.|`|f2EbrS4Zaa	circumsized is d one wid no foreskin.. its chopped off!!|`|GfG6wupTaa	About an inch!|`|IsCUjtaWaa	if you get circumcised, then a doctor removes your foreskin around your penis. it makes me cringe. so then obviously if you are not circumcised, the penis remains the same. <br>  <br>  people who usually have it done are of a certain religion or faith like Muslim or Jew and it is their duty to have it done by a doctor of their faith. <br>  <br>  personally i would never want it done to myself.

ZkwtldYlaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .

VmyQPltnaa	Frequent cleansing with antibacterial soap and an over the counter anti acne prep (generally containing benzoyl peroxide).  You can also purchase at a surgical or medical supply house a comedo extractor.  This is a metal instrument with donut shaped metal ring at the end  that enables you to apply pressure in a circular fashion around the blackhead, causing it safely to pop out.  They are relatively cheap.|`|kMbgcOzJaa	Here are a few suggestions:<br>  <br>  1. Steam your face for 10 minutes. Get a blackhead extractor (a tiny metal stick with a loop at the end) and gently squeeze out the blackheads. This may take some time and effort but if you do this regularly, it may reduces the amount of blackheads on your nose. After than, cleanse your face with your cleanser. <br>  <br>  2. Use Biore pore strips. It does not remove all blackheads but with regular use (say once per week), you may notice a difference. <br>  <br>  3. Look for cleanser that contains salicylic acid preferably 2%. Salicylic acid is well known for eliminating blackheads. Neutrogena oil free face wash is a good example (the orange one in a pump bottle 177ml). You may then use a toner preferably alcohol free but witch hazel is good if you don't have sensitive skin. Then, get a topical treatment of benzoyl peroxide with the strengths of either 2.5% or 5%. <br>  I use this routine daily and so far the amount of blackheads on my nose are reducing...<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope these tips help XD|`|dDTjpU3Baa	DIP A WASH CLOTH IN WARM WATER WRING IT AND PUT IT ON THE NOSE FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES  REMOUVE THE CLOTH MASSAGE YOUR NOSE GENTLY TO STIMULATE BLOOD CIRCULATION    REPEAT THE WARM WET WASH CLOTH ON YOUR NOSE .

8SRjELNBaa	yeah eating 1-2 meals a day is bad, be sure your drinking lots of water because sometimes when your stomach "craves" food, your actually just thirsty!|`|DLgfVqWVaa	5 meals a day !! thats ideal ! healthy breakfast, then snack (trail mix, fruits or yogurt) lunch - rice beans, chicken veggies and then snck in the evening like a fruit bar and then easy on dinner - soup and salad.<br>  drink lots of water, eat slowly..it takes 20 minutes for the brain to know that your stomach is full.<br>  dont limit yourself to 1meal a day, cause then when u will eat u will gobble a whole lot and that will add to more calories.eat less, eat balanced and 5 times.|`|MfzJROnJaa	Well you shouldn't eat if you're not hungry. If you are hungry that means your body needs more food now. Dont eat just because its mealtime! :)
I0Hjx0ahaa	Make sure you are not eating just because you are bored, and try pack your snacks ahead of time. It's very easy to quickly grab a bag of chips out of a vending machine before class starts without thinking too much about it, but if you make yourself think about what you are eating, you can significantly cut down on the junk food. Also keep in mind that a lot of these snacks aren't very filling, which is probably why you're hungry all the time. You just have to find a healthy, filling snack that that you actually like. Drinking more water can also help to cut down on the hunger. Whenever you feel like grabbing a snack, drink a glass of water first. You may find that by the time you finish the water you don't feel like eating anymore.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Oh, i've got class from 10-12 (pre nursing req's ftw).

Drink some water or Crystal Light-I have heard it said sometimes when you think you are hungry you are really just thirsty and if not, water will make you feel full too. Hope this helps; good luck.|`|DLgfVqWVaa	trail mix is a better choice. nuts, seeds, fruits...they will make you feel full and you would not have the guilt of eating unhealthy stuff|`|485b0a537e73379bb64ed3928743579eaa	Unfortunately, the junk food you are eating all afternoon like potato chips and cookies are empty calories and won't even keep you satisfied for very long so of course you're going to always be hungry.  And those kinds of things are easy to grab in a hurry so it's easy to fall into that trap.  You could buy yourself a supply of healthy snacks to always have on hand so that when you want to reach for something it's all ready to eat.  I do this.  I buy baby carrots in the bag or celery and cut it up into sticks and put in a baggie and when I want a snack I just munch on those and never feel guilty.  You could also try things like almonds, dried fruits, fresh fruits, nuts, even a bowl of cereal (low sugar cereal).  You could literally eat all afternoon on things like that.  Just don't eat too many peanuts or you can get a stomach ache haha.|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions<br>  <br>  <br>  if eat like above u wont be hungry the extra protein will keep u full along witht he water!!! but when u wake up u will be straving|`|mgeuli7Naa	I am trying to loose some weight too.

Brush your teeth.

I had classes from 1-4 then 5-9. Ugh! My solution was to ALWAYS be prepared. I spent time the night before packing healthy snacks; granola bars, trail mix, dried fruit. If you're body says you're hungry, then eat. But a large amount of people find they THINK they're hungry when they're bored or even when they're thirsty. Bring water or fruit juice with you to class to see if it's just the constant boredom of class that's sending you into junk food mode. If you're used to eating around that time though, packing up on low-fat, healthy snacks is a good way to go. You don't want to have anything too heavy like complex carbs because you're in class and I imagine you're sitting down. Because you're not moving you're metabolism is obviously moving a little slower. And I'd say if you really want to get those ten pounds off, run after your class ends. Or even take a brisk walk. Walking after you eat reminds your body to keep working. And if you're eating healthy food then decide to go for a run your body will utilize all of that good fuel!

cMksTuRhaa	Yes, chicken pox is very contagious.  I bet your 6 yo sis will get it if she hasn't had a booster.  You might get it too, who knows?  Since it didn't work on your sister.  Be happy if you get it now.  I made the mistake of immunizing my youngest son.  He's supposed to get a booster when he's 10, and every ten years after that.  He's 10 now and I will not have him get the booster.  (I don't know what I was thinking as a young mother)  Chicken pox is a lot less painful if you have it as a child.  It can be even deadly if you get it as an adult.  You're better off getting it now.  Maybe I should send my son over to your house so he can get over with it too. ;-)|`|rg7dxjC3aa	the chance of you getting it since you got the vaccine is no likely, but your six year old sister will more than likely catch it. chicken pox is not anything to be scared of. it is just annoying and itchy, nothing too serious. i don't know why there is even a vaccine for it.|`|AA11631715	unlikely that there would be 3 vaccine failures in the same house. (You and the 6 year old, on top of the infected one.)|`|zXpN20Wxaa	Your in same house so you might but idk i had it at 9moths so... i guess im not any help but my dad nor my brother didnt get it.|`|Drnpe4T5aa	My daughter was also vaccinated - but when she was exposed to a friend that had it, she got it (we had it diagnosed by her pediatrician), as well as our older son - our younger son, who's vaccine was more recent, didn't get it.<br>  <br>  According to our ped, if you have had the booster, and are exposed to someone with CP, it can go one of three ways:<br>   <br>  1 - The person could get nothing (this is more likely if you have had both the CP vaccine as well as the booster, which is now recommended after so many cases of CP after being vaccinated)<br>  2 - The person could get CP but it will be a milder case, with fewer spots.<br>  3 - The person could get Shingles.  (Shingles is the same virus as the the CP - when someone who has already had CP is exposed again, they can develope this instead)<br>  <br>  Living in close quarters, you are going to be exposed to the virus a lot.  (Example - my daughter picked it up from her friend by just sitting on the other end of the couch, without any contact or water-droplet transfer, such as sneezing or coughing - My son got it and he didn't even stay in the house, he was outside playing within 5 minutes of our arrival)  For your sister who has not been vaccinated, infection is likely.  But don't worry - most cases are not serious for children.  The danger is more for adults who contract the infection.  <br>   <br>  Incubation is about 10 days.  Watch for blisters on you and your sisters.  They typically start on the trunk/stomach/back, then spread outward from there to arms, legs and face.  <br>  <br>  If you both received the vaccine from the same batch and lot, there is an increased likelihood that your vaccine could fail as well, but it also depends on how your immune system took to the vaccine.  Every body is different.  But the high rate of failure is why doctors now recommend a booster a year later.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|UYaWH7a0aa	For younger children, like your six year old sister, it isn't really harmful for them to have chicken pox. The greatest harm is for already sick people as well as older people who have not had the pox. Your doctor can run a blood test on you (I believe called a titer) that can check your blood to see the effectiveness of the vaccine as well as to see if you may be naturally immune to it in which your sick sister would not pose a threat to you. Either way there is very little you can do about 'catching' it unless you really stay away from her and her belongings that have come in contact with the pox until she is cleared, even then it may trigger in you later on. Contact your doctor for additional questions and concerns :)|`|Zre0wAiNaa	It'd be wise for you to avoid close contact with your sister from now, and your other sister should definitely move temporarily. <br>  <br>  Go to your doctor, and tell them that your sister and you both had the vaccine, but your sister got sick. Maybe you'll have to go have a bloodtest and if you have antibodies to chickenpox, you won't get it.If not, your doctor will advise you on what's best.|`|b4362f157453acb65779789e80f6bf97aa	It's good to get the chicken pox while your young, I heard it's tougher on older folks. I wouldn't worry about it just go with the flow you know? You're prob. okay since you've had your shot and haven't caught it yet, chances are you may never get it. Good luck.<br>  <br>  P.s When your 6 yr old does get it... make sure she doesn't scratch because it could scare her for life. I scratched my chicken pox as a kid on the corner of my eye brow, and to this day it's a bald spot there. But hey I look cute with it:)|`|1tiCB311aa	There is a very good chance all of you will get it but you may not. When I was little my brother and sister both got chicken pox and I never did. When my children got chickenpox, again I didn't get them. We didn't have a booster back then.|`|GfG6wupTaa	getting the shot only means that when you get them they won't be bad. You might get them. You are only contagous before you break out.|`|AA11878029	some people get it some don't ....I purposely tried exposing my child to the chicken pox at 6 years old.  She drank after the kid who had it and played all day together,  she never got it....she is now 12 and i think i better get the vaccine she is to old now to get it !!

W2z5dCrmaa	There is a huge degrading in sensation with a condom, which women don't experience. The best sensation in sexual contact for male is the slippery sliding sensation of his penis head in contact with the vagina that embraces it. For males who are natural, the sliding of the inside part of the foreskin and the ferunlum make additional pleasure experience.<br>  <br>  With a condom, the male experiences slight pressure variations and the temperature to a slightly lesser degree. The critical sliding contact is masked by the rubber which slides in and out with him.<br>  <br>  For the female, she feels the penis with the rubber sliding in and out, so it feels little different from the penis. If the rubber was staying still on her and the Dude sliding in and out of the rubber, then she would get the experience that he's getting, and would likely get nowhere at all.<br>  <br>  The first round usually works because most males go around desperately built up sexually with their inner chambers filled. For the first round, almost a little imagination and all of the contact total of making Love brings them off. For seconds, they aren't desperate any more, and would need some actual sensation and feel good to come through or keep it up.<br>  Most Ladies don't realize this and take it all for granted that it's all great. On the other hand, does it matter that much with some of them as what's going about with him?<br>  <br>  You still can't stop using protection unless ur monogamous and trusting the other person to not mess around on you.<br>  <br>  Here's where in it shows up that real Love making is meant for faithful, monogamous married couples. For singles having sex, the condom protects the male as well, as it isn't a case of women being clean and males running around with STD. If a male has an STD, he didn't pick it up from his hand or a toilet seat...so which came first? the chicken or the hand? Ha ha!<br>  <br>  Additional.... Totally agree ..scobill.. unprotected is out!<br>  <br>  Unprotected as an idea isn't the excitement. The Dude is trying to get some experience of feel good going, as some don't have enough imagination power to pull sex off with a condom especially if they have already more reduced sense of feel from circumcision as compared to other males. Not everybody came through it the same. They aren't trying to trick or con...just  frustratedly trying to get somewhere.   <br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|2OO9U8o9aa	If he is getting erect easily without the condom and obviously with a condom first time round it sounds to me like he is trying to con you into unprotected sex . Happy to see you refused and you should continue to do so till you are very sure it is a monogamous relationship , you are confident he has no STI and you are taking other protection against pregnancy|`|77NzfiVkaa	Well, I am so glad to hear you said no to unprotected sex! Good for you! And no this isn't common, but like he said, maybe you should be using bigger condoms.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	my penis doesnt like condoms!! thank god for birth control. Condoms take too much feeling away if ur used to unprotected.|`|zHmZkMStaa	It's actually very common.  There is indeed a slight decrease in sensation with condom use, and in his case, it might be enough to tip the balance?  Reduce the 'performance' pressure on him a bit and you might discover something else that is common.  He may get better with practice :)  Meanwhile; good for you and he - that you insist on a condom.  It's the only way to go these days, even if it means sacrificing a teeny bit of pleasure.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	It might be a real issue if the condoms are too tight.  Honestly a lot of men don't like condoms because it is not nearly good no matter how thin they are.<br>  <br>  Get him larger condoms and see if it helps.  The only way it would hinder going a second time is that the sensations aren't as strong wearing a condom, and coupling that with having recently gotten off, could cause it to not be as easy the second time.|`|AA11119636	that's BS...with a condom you usually stay hard longer <br>  <br>  it's normal he just can't last in 2nd round, maybe just wait longer than 1~2 hours...maybe wait 3 hours<br>  <br>  DO NOT! have unprotected sex...unless he's tested and you're on the pills/shots or whatever|`|ykeI3OqSaa	yea, my boyfriend can't stay hard with a condom on either.  I take birth control pills so we don't have to use condoms.  It has worked great for 2 years so far! Good luck.|`|fecUjSr1aa	Well, i've done it 4x in one night (that is .. we started about 7 pm and got done around 3 am the morning after).<br>  <br>  biologically, after each "round" the male body needs to "recuperate" from the just concluded activity .. 2 hours (maybe 3) would be an ideal time of rest before he can get going again.<br>  <br>  also, you have to realize that all a girl's gotta do is open up and you're ready for action. the guy, on the other hand, needs a little (maybe a lot) of help like stimulation from the partner (meaning you).<br>  <br>  so you want another round, be the trainer (of this "boxer) and do some stimulation. who knows, he might be good for 2 more rounds ...<br>  <br>  that helps?<br>  <br>  p.s. you have to understand how his body works ...|`|H2IqzG12aa	Everyone's refractory period (the time it takes to get it up again) is different.  Some are ready to go in minutes, others need at least an hour, some might not be able to go again until a day later.  Sometimes you can help speed things up, sometimes not.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	There is a loss of sensation with a condom, but it shouldn't have that much affect hours later.  However, wearing the wrong size condom is a bad idea, you guys always need to use condoms that fit properly.<br>  <br>  Also, I've heard that placing a small amount of lubricant on him before he puts the condom on can greatly enhance the way sex feels with a condom, but didn't get the chance to try it, as my wife and I stopped using them before we learned about this.<br>  <br>  Glad to hear that you are sticking with the condoms, smart girl.
oKg42gQMaa	Signs and symptoms of Long QT syndrome:<br>  About half those with long QT syndrome don't have any signs or symptoms. They may be aware of their condition only from results of an electrocardiogram (ECG) performed for an unrelated reason, because they have a family history of long QT syndrome or because of genetic testing results. <br>  For people who do experience signs and symptoms of long QT syndrome, the most common symptoms include: <br>  ?Fainting. This is the most common sign of long QT syndrome. In people with long QT syndrome, fainting spells (syncope) are caused by the heart temporarily beating in an erratic way. These fainting spells may happen when you're excited, angry, scared, or during exercise. Fainting in people with long QT syndrome can occur without warning, such as losing consciousness after being startled by a ringing telephone. <br>  Signs and symptoms that you're about to faint include lightheadedness, heart palpitations or irregular heartbeat, weakness and blurred vision. If you think you're about to faint, sit or lie down and tell someone near you about your symptoms. However, in long QT syndrome, such warning signs before fainting are unusual. <br>  ?Seizures. If the heart continues to beat erratically, the brain becomes increasingly deprived of oxygen. This can then cause generalized seizures. In fact, some people with long QT syndrome have been misdiagnosed as having a seizure disorder and have even been treated with anti-epileptic medications. <br>  ? Sudden death. Normally, the heart returns to its normal rhythm. If this doesn't happen spontaneously and paramedics don't arrive in time to convert the rhythm back to normal with an external defibrillator, sudden death will occur. <br>  Signs and symptoms of inherited long QT syndrome may start during the first months of life, or as late as middle age. Most people who experience signs or symptoms from long QT syndrome have their first episode by the time they're age 40. Most LQTS-related deaths occur in people ages 11 to 30. <br>  Rarely, signs and symptoms of long QT syndrome may occur during sleep or arousal from sleep. Some doctors believe that inherited LQTS-causing mutations likely explain about 10 percent to 15 percent of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). <br>  Signs and symptoms of generalized anxiety:<br>  Signs and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder can vary in combination or severity. Generalized anxiety disorder symptoms may include: <br>  <br>  Restlessness <br>  Feeling of being keyed up or on edge <br>  Feeling a lump in your throat <br>  Difficulty concentrating <br>  Fatigue <br>  Irritability <br>  Impatience <br>  Being easily distracted <br>  Muscle tension <br>  Trouble falling or staying asleep <br>  Excessive sweating <br>  Shortness of breath <br>  Stomachache <br>  Diarrhea <br>  Headache <br>  If you have generalized anxiety disorder, you may experience times when your worries don't completely consume you, but you still feel rather anxious. You may feel on edge about many or all aspects of your life. For example, you may feel intense worry about your safety or that of your loved ones, or you may have a general sense that something bad is about to happen, even when there's no apparent danger. <br>  <br>  Generalized anxiety disorder often begins at an early age, and the signs and symptoms may develop more slowly than in other anxiety disorders. Many people with generalized anxiety disorder can't recall when they last felt relaxed or at ease.
7RH1WmWOaa	I'd go to the doc and have a once over. You might need to do some blood work..Are you drinking enough water?|`|xMTkyaRuaa	Do you suffer from anxiety?

bxxwhP04aa	Relax, my friend..........there is nothing to it.|`|5owT5hjWaa	MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging scans) are a necessary part of diagnosing and monitoring your multiple sclerosis <br>  <br>  At Your Doctor’s Office: <br>  <br>  Ask your doctor what he will want to see on the MRI: the brain, all or part of the spinal cord or the entire central nervous system (from top of the head to tailbone). If your doctor is wants a scan of the whole thing (which is likely if this is your first MRI or if an exacerbation is suspected), you may be asked if you prefer one or two sessions. Here are some things to consider: <br>  <br>  Doing the whole thing at one time may take up to two hours. <br>  If you split it up, the sessions will be shorter each time, but you will have to go to two appointments and will have to receive gadolinium (contrast material) each time.<br>  <br>  Before You Leave Home: <br>  <br>  No jewelry: Leave all of your jewelry at home. <br>  No metal: Some MRI centers allow you to wear you own clothes (instead of a hospital gown) during the scan, as long as there are no metal buttons, snaps or zippers. Keep this in mind when dressing-- wear a t-shirt and elastic waist pants or shorts. <br>  Dress for heat: Dress lightly or in layers that allow you to undress to a minimum of thickness. It can get very hot in the MRI machine. <br>  Bring socks: Your feet will be sticking out of the machine. <br>  Wear an exercise bra: An exercise bra (with no metal) may help you feel more comfortable. <br>  <br>  Before the Scan: <br>  <br>  If you have a cough: Consider taking a cough suppressant. You may be reminded not to cough or move during the scan. This invariably (at least in me) brings on the urge to cough. <br>  Ask for a sedative: If you are claustrophobic, or very scared of the procedure itself, do not be afraid to ask for a sedative. <br>  Protect your port: If you have a temporary intravenous port for Solu-Medrol administration, request that it not be used for the gadolinium. MRI techs love the convenience of the ports, but the gadolinium is caustic and could collapse the vein, meaning your port will have to be reinserted.<br>  <br>  During the Scan: <br>  <br>  Avoid the mirror: There is usually a small mirror positioned above your head, which is tilted so that you can see outside of the machine. I find looking in this mirror extremely disorienting. Keep your eyes closed if you can. <br>  Practice creative visualization: Picture the most pleasant, relaxing place that you have ever been. Imagine that you are there. Try to remember tiny details about this place. Focus on colors and lighting. <br>  Breathe steadily and regularly: Count your breaths up to 10, then count backwards. Repeating this is so relaxing, that I have actually almost drifted off to sleep during the scan.<br>  <br>  After the Scan: <br>  <br>  Drink lots: Drinking plenty of water after your MRI will help flush out the gadolinium. <br>  Give yourself a treat: Get a massage, have lunch with a friend, buy a light novel and get lost in the story.<br>  Additional Tips: <br>  Tattoos and MRIs: If you have tattoos that you got more than 20 years ago, these might cause discomfort or distort the MRI image. This is caused by metal components in the ink that was used in the past. Discuss this with your doctor or the MRI technician to determine if this might be a problem.|`|6be1690c7fe8ce017a68606b85137484aa	I didn't find it to be scary. I had an MRI done on my lumbar spine, but it was a simple procedure that didn't involve contrast dye or anything of that nature. The only thing I had to worry about was being inside the machine in close quarters. That didn't bother me, but I am not claustrophobic (fear of close spaces).<br>  When you book your appointment, don't hesitate to ask questions. If you are claustrophobic, ask about receiving a sedative. If you choose this option, be sure to have an adult drive you home. My mother has had multiple MRI's done and she is VERY claustrophobic, and she was sedated each time she had the procedure done.<br>  In addition to the close quarters, you will hear some loud/unusual sounds. It can be quite noisy, and you will be given some ear plugs to protect your hearing. The noise can be intimidating to some, but don't be afraid. These are just the typical sounds that the machine makes.<br>  You will be given a handheld button to push if you need assistance. For example, if you become uncomfortable, push this button and the tech will assist you. It is also important to be completely still. If you move, they will ask if you need help and advise you to be still. This can be a little uncomfortable, but it is not too bad.<br>  You will be fine, just make sure to ask questions and let them know if you are nervous, if needed.
UYaWH7a0aa	Check with the place that you're having yours done at - mine offered me to bring a cd that I could listen to while I was in my MRI. I've had 3 done and to be honest after the initial noises I fell asleep all 3 times. It's not so bad at all - a little uncomfortable but I found it best to just close my eyes and do all I could not to think about where I was and relax until they told me it was over.|`|KFuyBR8qaa	I've had about 2 on my head and four on my body, its not that bad. It is loud though, they usually take about 30-45 min. on your head. You have to lay very still and I always ask for a blanket to cover myself, it can be cold in there sometimes. They offer ear plugs usually, take them. They do help but it is still pretty loud. I close my eyes and focus on my breathing for most of the whole MRI. Just try to stay calm. Time will go by fast. <br>  Good luck :)|`|ZiOTLNGGaa	no. I it not scary at all- nothing to worry about! Take it from the sound of experience- ME! Don't sweat it!
6hRbcDmmaa	This is pretty cool. I've never seen a protein product with such high protein, as well as amino acids. But, I don't know why protein shakes have low carbs, since it is equally needed as much as protein for muscle growth. I'd say this is a great start if you are around 180 lbs. Try it out
fDGesUPJaa	1.  I like wearing pads because they are very comfortable, absorb wetness well, you always know how much you're bleeding and its just more natural to let it flow than to plug it up.  Plus, I'm tiny and I think tampons would really hurt a lot.<br>  <br>  2.  I feel fine about using pads since I'm used to them and I like them and I'll always wear pads no matter what my friends say (and they definitely do make fun of me for still wearing pads!).<br>  <br>  3.  I've been wearing pads for at least six years; since I first got my period.  I've never worn anything but pads<br>  <br>  4.  I like Always maxi pads the best, but I like Kotex and Stayfree too.  As long as they're not ultra-thin, I'm fine with any brand.<br>  <br>  5.  Pads DO NOT feel like diapers!  It makes me so mad when people say that because its so obvious that they're being brainwashed by tampon advertisements that will do anything to make girls feel self-conscious about wearing pads so they'll switch to tampons.|`|zyHfRp5Faa	I love pads....<br>  People said tampons are better. But I said pads are better.<br>  There are good and bad points from both of them.<br>  Using tampon is better because it small enough to slip in your 'v', and it will not make any sign that you are on your period. But sometimes it will give you headaches/migraine to some women and to me, and any discomfort and worries specially when some cases they thought tampons are missing inside you or dissolved and had to see doctor to find it.<br>  But pads aren't that bad. Nowadays there are ultra thin pads, when you used them, you feel nothing. And some more, it doesn't need to be inserted inside you!<br>  There are two main types of pads wings or non wings, cottony or maxi.<br>  I have been using pads for 14 years now.<br>  My favorite are stay-free cottony soft without wings and whispers ultra thin without wing.<br>  You can try which one best for you, tampons or pads.<br>  I didn't think using a pad is just like a diaper.  <br>  Good luck for your health class.|`|QLBNljhOaa	i prefer pads although i will wear a tampon if i have to (depends what im wearing) <br>  i have been using them since i was 12 <br>  my fave brand is stayfree<br>  no i dont think it feels like a diaper because i buy the thin ones with wings :)|`|PWMqeKZmaa	I do not like using pads, i hate it when i can feel the gush...I use pads when i sleep, when i was younger i used pads all the time and i used always with wings.

I don't use pads.<br>  <br>  How do you feel about using pads? I hate them. <br>  <br>  How long have you been using pads?

f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	There is a lot of stretch mark treatment available on the market these days. Some treatments are more effective in fading or even eliminating stretch marks, but the success of the treatment depends on a few different things. First of all is the color and age of the stretch marks. If they have faded to a flesh color they are much harder to heal. Second of all, ethnicity and heredity play a role in which creams, oils and other products or equipment will succeed in healing stretch marks. <br>  <br>  The cheapest stretch mark treatment available is creams made especially for stretch marks. The most effective creams contain ingredients such as cocoa butter, lanolin and wheat germ oil. These creams actually heal and rebuild the damaged skin. While they may not be able to completely eliminate stretch marks, they may at least make the stretch marks fade to a barely visible scar. A good recommendation will be Palmer Cocoa Butter Cream.<br>  <br>  Another popular & effective cream that you might wish to consider is Strivectin. It has a bioactive topical formula that has a combination of skin firming agents to reduce visible wrinkles and make skin appear firmer<br>  <br>  If you are interested in more effective ways of getting rid of stretch marks, you can read abt them from this site: <a href="http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.co...</a>|`|pn9q0JkXaa	Massage the area with stretch marks three or four times a day with moisturizers that contain cocoa butter or shea butter as a prime ingredient. This hydrates the skin, making it more pliant|`|QLBNljhOaa	some of my friends swear by cocoa butter, they used it after they had their babies and voila stretch marks gone|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Stretch marks are normal, often there is nothing that you can do but forgive them and look at them as part of you, I've heard people call them their tiger stripes, personally I love mine as they are silver patterns over my hips. They are caused by damage deep in the fibers of your skin which makes them difficult to repair, but if they are still red then they are new so stand a better chance.<br>  <br>  Most commonly used for stretch marks are vitamin E oil and cocoa butter, a lot of products are available for pregnant women to avoid stretch marks, and most body moisturizers contain these ingredients too but watch out for products with more cocoa butter – I recommend The Body Shop's body butter, they smell nice and cost less than some products. In raw form vitamin E oil and cocoa butter can be found in health or specialist stores, however vitamin E oil tends to be sticky and cocoa butter can take a while to melt down to body temperature to rub in. Bio oil is a good choice too for stretch marks as well as for general skincare, it can be bought from most pharmacies but is expensive so I recommend trying in discount stores which sometimes sell a cheaper version that works just as well. Plain old olive oil rubbed into your skin daily is great and cheap, this is less to heal stretch marks and more of a way to prevent any more stretch marks appearing as it moisturizes your skin and leaves it in totally wonderful condition. <br>  <br>  If your stretch marks really bother you then you might want to get an appointment with a  dermatologist to have them assess the stretch marks to see if they can offer you any treatment, they will use either laser treatment of a cream called Retin-A, it may be worth mentioning this to your doctor to see if they could refer you or suggest any other treatments.|`|2tnFQYhEaa	Bio-Oil<br>  Walmart<br>  $13.00<br>  <br>  Its good stuff and smells nice too.

4ZE8RG7Waa	chlamydia is one of the most common STDs. Because there often aren't any symptoms, though, lots of people can have chlamydia and not know it.<br>  <br>  The bacteria can move from one person to another through sexual intercourse, and possibly through oral-genital contact. If someone touches bodily fluids that contain the bacteria and then touches his or her eye, a chlamydial eye infection is possible. Chlamydia also can be passed from a mother to her baby while the baby is being delivered. This can cause pneumonia and conjuntivitis, which can become very serious for the baby if it's not treated. You can't catch chlamydia from a towel, doorknob, or toilet seat.|`|AA11631715	unprotected intercourse with an infected person.|`|jE0Y9su5aa	Chlamydia is transmitted through vaginal, anal and oral sex and can be transmitted from mother to child during childbirth. It is known as the 'silent disease', because more than 50 percent of infected males and 70 percent of infected females have no symptoms and are unaware of their condition.<br>  <br>  The only reliable way to know if you have chlamydia is to be tested. A urine test is available and there is an effective single-dose antibiotic treatment available to treat the infection.|`|XkWd08Uvaa	most simple way in spreading chlamydia -- is the un protected sex
FkXt4XLvaa	I don't recommend beginning protein shakes or any of the muscle-building supplements until you speak with a doctor or fitness expert who has skills in working with teenagers.<br>  <br>  Teenagers grow and change constantly throughout their years and being thin is better than being bulky. If you build too much muscle before your body is ready or would have done it on its own, you may actually screw some things up.<br>  <br>  Go to the library (public and school) and see if there are any books specified for teen boys on muscle training or weight lifting.<br>  <br>  Talk to the football coach (even if you don't know him) about what the players do. Or a gym teacher.<br>  <br>  Be thankful for that fast metabolism. It will come in handy when you go to college and have to live off of Ramen Noodles and Mac-N-Cheese and have five classes a day and a job!|`|t81MEJ82aa	Just understand that protein supplements do not make you larger. They help your body build muscle more efficiently provided that you are resistance training. Just like if you were playing sports and had Gatorade. The drink doesn't make you run faster or perform better, but simply supplies you the energy (carbs) necessary to keep performing.<br>  <br>  If you want to gain weight, a protein shake is a good idea provided that you will also lift weights but you also need to up your calorie intake. For example, if you're eating 1800 calories per day then try working your way up to 3000 (and more if need be) and keep aware of your results. Maybe you don't need 3000 but the idea is that you want more calories than your body needs. Working out takes a lot of energy, and so does building and maintaining muscles.

1NK1hK1Taa	You have tried to contact the endocrinologist's secretary. If it goes to answer machine, leave a message. I know i hate talking to the dam machines, but sometimes you have to. When you have done that, telephone the surgery and ask to either speak to your doctor, ask for the doctor to call you back, or failing that ask to make a quick appointment. Explain what has happened and you need your mind putting at rest as you are very concerned about the test results. No doctor that is any good would want a patient worrying for no reason.

It is really annoying and sometimes even gives me headaches. <br>  When you notice the ringing (or some people have cracking and popping sounds) get louder than it typically means you are getting sick or having allergies. <br>  The Spring season is almost upon us and allergies are going to start flaring up. That means that people with Tinnitus are going to have it bad too. It is typically worse during allergy season or when you are getting sick. The pressure in your head will usually make the ringing worse.<br>  Avoid foods like chocolate and caffenne. Also alcohol can make tinnitus worse. If you think you might have tinnitus due to stress, try doing some relaxing techniques, breathing exercises and Yogi Kava tea can help you reduce stress and Tinnitus.<br>  If you think you might have Tinnitus due to allergies or a cold. Than buy some decongestant and it will help relieve the pressure from your head.<br>  Also, sometime Tinnitus can just flare up for no apparent reason.

Since you're putting in very little food, I have heard that instead of the desired effect, it sometimes makes u gain weight, because your body actually starves for nutrients and takes sugars or something like that and turns them into fat....again, i'm not too sure how it works, but it is something to think about.  <br>  The slim-fast plan says you can loose up to 2 lbs/week.  but since you're removing food and exercising a lot I'd say you might loose 2-4 lbs a week.  <br>  Another tip, since you're  exercising and not eating enough, I do suggest you stay supper hydrated so you don't pass out (i used to pass out b4 cuz of dehydration I think)....so drink plenty of water and the new gatorade G2(?) is low in calories so you should be o.k. if you have one every other day.<br>  Myself, i'm on week 2 of slimfast, i've been following it ok.

If you have a really good metabolism, maybe 20.<br>  <br>  You'll feel like crap and will have to fight the urge to binge on the high carb foods your body will demand.  Pastires, pasta, etc.  You won't starve to death, but staying motivated and healthy will be the issue.  <br>  <br>  But why punish yourself?  You could eat six meals a day, feel great, never be hungry and STILL get the same results.  It's not hard to eat right, it just takes a little discipline and self education.<br>  <br>  Your exercise routine looks good and will help you be stronger and more fit.  Make sure you do cardio for at least 30 minutes at a time in order to get good fat loss.  Maybe add some push ups in to tighten your arms up.<br>  <br>  I'd really look into nutrition.  Body For Life has a great chapter on basic nutrition and the pounds will melt off if you follow it.  You might even be able to find it for free on their website.  The key is six small meals a day and sticking to lean meats and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, some starch, no sugar.

3156c54d8f966e51776af0486120bb1daa	The advice to initially soak in a bath rather than just showering is good.  Smegma is a waste product composed of excess body oils, shed skin cells, miscellaneous dirt and dust, stale urine and stale semen.<br>  <br>  Because it is oily it needs to be cleaned away with soap as well as water.  If you've never done this before then you will have a build-up of old smegma which will be stuck to your glans and foreskin.  This will need some rubbing to remove it!<br>  <br>  Once you have got rid of all the old smegma, make sure that you fully retract your foreskin in the bath or shower every day and wash away all the new smegma.  If it builds up too quickly then wash morning and evening.  Also make sure that you wash properly under your foreskin each time you have been swimming and after any serious exercise such as gym or sports.<br>  <br>  Your glans will be rather sensitive at first as you've clearly not been retracting your foreskin daily from childhood as you should have been taught.  The more you retract and clean it the less it will feel over sensitive to this sort of touch.|`|BicCDOllaa	Get circumcised and you won't have a Smegma problem!<br>  <br>  I opted to get circumcised at 18, so I have been there and have the t-shirt!

Being circumcised is much cleaner, uncut guys need to wash at least 2-3x a day and before sex, as there is always a stink. It is healthier to be cut, uncut guys have a 60% higher chance to acquire STD's and HIV! Being cut also looks better, that's a no brainer. It also enhances the sexual experience, the foreskin just gets in the way!

If you were 3 inches taller then not so much. But are you athletic? If you have an athletic build and do regular sports and exercise then I would say not to worry about it. But if you’re not active in sports and exercise then I would suggest that you do before it’s too late. If you don’t tackle your weight now it will only get worse as you get older. If you like video games I suggest getting Wii Fit – its fun and you’re exercising at the same time. Watch what you eat and I am not suggesting you starve yourself – just eat healthy and cut out the garbage (chips, soda, candy, etc. to a minimum if not all together). If you just stop drinking soda you will see a tremendous difference within a month or two!

uTPeYO4kaa	i see what you mean but eating a breakfast in the morning if even it's small because you're not hungry will help get you going in the morning and will speed up your metabolism...people will lose more weight during a diet when they eat breakfast compared to when they don't even with the extra 200-400 calories a day...if you're not trying to lose weight and you're not hungry then it'll be fine to skip breakfast and just eat normal...but if you're trying to lose weight def. eat breakfast.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Andrew has a point, I was reading a health magazine on this yesterday in the school library and eating breakfast helps build healthy eating habits.... which is going to be much more beneficial for you in the long run.<br>  <br>  You can make your breakfast high in fiber. (ie: 1/4 cup of "FiberOne" cereal mixed with 1/4 cup of oatmeal & a peice of fruit or small salad).|`|jdah4ZA2aa	From everything I've read, eating breakfast helps keep your metabolism running at a steady pace.  You slept all night, and therefore it went into a dormant setting where you aren't burning as many calories.  Eating breakfast supposedly "wakes up" your internal motor and gets it churning at regular speed.
mjC5XldXaa	First it sounds like some infection may be present.  If so, then you will need to get some antibiotics from your dentist.  Next if you are in a lot of pain, the ibuprofen may not be strong enough and you may need a stronger pain pill.  Next try mixing a teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water.  Swish it around in the area and spit it out.  Do this every couple of hours if you can.  This should take care of the symptoms.  If it reoccurs you might have to consider extracting the tooth.  Good luck.<br>  PS  Don't chew on the rawhide.  You might start uncontrollable barking.LOL|`|a1KqdXLXaa	Everything you have described is not normal for eruption of teeth, especially the swelling and fevers.

Except, on Satuday, you should get a little break.<br>   1,200-1,300 calories is just a bit too little.

She said the first thing she did was put the weight she wanted to be into a calorie calculator(you can find them online) and started eating like the person she wanted to be. Maybe for lunch you should have a large grilled chicken salad with lots of green veggies, because they help you to metobilize more fat. Maybe have the lean cuisine for dinner. The nuts with the banana is excellent-nuts keep you fuller longer and have a lot of protein. Try eating foods with lots of protein..Also have one snack of raw veggies, with a lowfat dressing(salad spritzers is only 1 cal. per spray!) <br>  <br>  Good luck hun!

You will get very tired of it and it will start to taste bad. You can get lighter without dieting easily. Just excerise daily or every 2 or 3 days and walk when you go to places. Also don't snack a lot.... Snacking a lot can get you wait. Having healthy meals until you feel nearly full. A healthy meal can have chicken and meat in it, if you add salad to the side and cook it properly (example: Not Frying) it should be good. Dieting can also start to gain you weight because your body gets use to storing fat and you gain more weight from what you eat. if you do all these things you should see results.<br>  I know all this from hearing it. 1 more thing.... don't get too skiny, i prefer girls that have a bit of fat, a skinny girl is kinda gross to be honest.

If you intend to stay within the UK, then there is really no need to get it (unless there is an outbreak). You should consider immunisation against hepatitis A if you plan to travel to certain countries like Africa, the Indian sub-continent, Central and South America, the Far East, and the Middle East.

I got them when I was 16, just a few. I have 20/400 vision so it's not all that uncommon. I'm assuming you have a strong glasses prescription?<br>  <br>  If you see lots of them or the number keeps increasing, head to the eye doctor as soon as possible. It could be a few different things. The more serious (and more common of the "bad" and very fixable things) of which is retinal detachment. Are you seeing any flashes along with it? Like tiny tiny camera flashed off int he corners of your eyes.|`|1NK1hK1Taa	I am 43 and have the same thing. Do you find it is next to impossible to focus on them? Are they almost transparent? They sound like 'floaters'. <br>  You don't need to panic, it isn't serious.|`|Vvd2BMn1aa	If the spots are brown, it could mean your retinas are stretched. That's only if you are nearsighted though. Otherwise it's probably normal as we all have these clear spots that occasionally pass across our line of sight. The only real worry you should have, is if you see flashing lights or shadows. Good luck at the eye doctor's.
VnLaUS3Jaa	hi! i have a mini stepper and i love it! it's great for when i can't get outside or to the gym for whatever reason. i even hop on it sometimes while i am watching tv. <br>  <br>  it's a great lower body toning tool, and with the bands, it makes it a great upper body workout as well. <br>  <br>  anything that gets you moving will burn calories. it's ten times better than doing nothing, that's for absolute sure!!|`|gtQEFvqVaa	Hey! I hear stacking hardcover books is just as great. And I have some resistance arm bands that are amazing for resistance training! If you want to use some, email me and we can meet each other ;) lol
6226337919d9467c9501a8d04a1c5d3faa	Hey, don't worry, I am sure your mum will be really understanding.  Maybe you could text saying:<br>  <br>  Hi Mum, sorry to text you this but I feel a bit embarrassed about it.  I think that I have a problem that I would like to talk to a doctor about.  I have looked it up and believe I have phinosis.  Would really appreciate your support but just didn't know how to speak to you about it.<br>  <br>  I am sure then she will just come and start the conversation with you.<br>  alternatively, I am sure you are old enough to make a doctors appointment without your mum being there, as long as you know which doctors you are registered at, but I do think it will be a lot easier on you if you just tell her as you are planning to do.<br>  <br>  I think you're being really brave (dont mean that to sound patronising), just do it right now, you'll feel so much better once it's off your chest.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  x|`|SyuGWtq0aa	Hi, I think you should just say that you need to discuss something with her but it's really embarrassing.  Then you can text a bit at a time. Tell you have the same problem as your brother had and then she will get the ided. Try not to worry, you're actually really brave and mature for trying to get it sorted. And don't worry about the doctor because he will be used to seeing this sort of this thing. Good luck|`|3g2xGmTiaa	O.K<br>  <br>  It may not seem the same to you but i felt scared and embarrassed when i told my mum i had OCD<br>  <br>  Dont do it by text <br>  <br>  What i did was waited until my mum was on her own. Went in the room shut the door and said i think there is something wrong with me and it all came out<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|6aVJw2AKaa	You could:<br>  1. Talk to your dad.<br>  2. Talk to your brother, since he had the same problem, and if he is elder he can go to the doc with you. <br>  3. Just go and meet a doc (you can take a relative or someone else along if you want to), and let him talk to your mom.|`|tjygT8Uzaa	be like mom something is really bothering me and i think i need to see a dr. i have a problem called phinosis and i'm really upset about it and need to take care of it.<br>  <br>  help me with my question please:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjxCC8RTU_wHavxSq_S.vA_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090305074718AAUXf7Y">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XYBHM8aSaa	in the text say, weiner's broken, SOS.<br>  <br>  I think its better to tell her in person, whip it out and she'll know what's wrong.|`|6nq1IiqXaa	sorry to hear about this, maybe if you tell your brother about this maybe he will tell your mum instead of you getting all embarrassed! I wouldn't do it by text though, im sure your brother wouldnt mind asking!|`|0630afKvaa	Just say. Hey mom I need to speak to the doctor about a personal problem. Just be adult about it.|`|Jgy9bCTLaa	told your mum that you had some problem & wants to see doctor. <br>  when your mom ask the fact, tell her without hesitating.|`|K7kPSgs4aa	you are old enough to go get a doctors appointment anyway|`|ZaIzN1Alaa	tell her you want a check up from your doctor thats you be feeling not so good|`|Lb0sZmYgaa	its ur mom shes seen it i dnt think shel mind u tellin herr|`|9DzY3n7xaa	Very popular condition..Seems a lot of people are misinformed or not taught at all, as i wasn't at a younger age. so heres my usual answer:<br>  <br>  You have Phimosis. To help with it, try stretching exercises, when erect just pull it back as far as it will go and hold for 5 mins. Do this a few times daily.. in the shower helps, and you should see results within days/weeks. Could also try, if its possible to pull back a bit, pull it back, grab the glands with two fingers and roll the foreskin up over the two fingers as far as it will go (when the ring of skin turns white). hold it there for 5 mins. Lubricant helps with this!. Or get a prescription from your doc for Betamethasone cream 0.05%. It's fairly common, and this should help. Also try rubbing vitamin E around the top and inside the foreskin, which may help elasticate it. If it's more serious, you may need a preputialplasty (alternative to circumcision but with no loss of looks, sensetivity or anything, and is less painful with a fast recovery rate. With a preputialplasty:they make a small incision vertically then horizontally in your foreskin, and stitch it up to have more space for your glans to appear without a total circumcision. This is a quick procedure they may even just do in a doctors office.. so may be possible privately.<br>  Speak to your GP about it.)<br>  <br>  <br>  **edit- make sure you do not pull it over the head till it is ready.. if you do, it may be too tight to reverse, and you will have a condition called paraphimosis, where the skin stops the blood flow, and then your only option is a circumcision. And if you are in the Uk, the cream isn't available. No steroid creams here are available without prescription. You have to use betamethasone 0.05%-0.1% for around a month or so..**<br>  <br>  As for the asking your mom, it's always best face to face. It'll be just as embarrassing for her as you, so once you've worked it all out, you'll both never speak of it again probably..<br>  But the support she may give while you are sorting this is invaluable.|`|hX1Qfs3qaa	Telling her through text is probably not the best idea... you should just talk to her, she won't judge you or anything, she's your mom. All she wants is for you to be happy and healthy, so if you're concerned, she will do her best to help you out, no matter what it is.<br>  <br>  Did she know that your brother had it? What did they do about that? And if she knows your brother did then you really have nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  Just tell her you want to go to the doctor, because you think you have phimosis. Seriously, you'll be so relieved once you talk to her, and the conversation will only last a couple of minutes. Find her when she's along, tell her you have something embarrassing to talk about, and all you have to say is, "I want to see a doctor because I think I have phimosis" and if she asks what it is tell her it's a boy problem or something. She'll make you an appointment.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	It's your mom. You shouldnt be embarrassed!<br>  She isnt going to laugh at you or anything, if you have a problem Im sure she wants you to feel you can go to her.<br>  It needs to be taken care of so just tell her.<br>  But I dont think telling her through a text is the best way lol<br>  <br>  If your brother had it then it shouldnt be that big of a deal.<br>  I think you just need to tell her.<br>  Tell her you are worried about a little problem and think you need to see a dr to get it checked out.<br>  She is your mother, she should be very understanding and will be there to help you through it.<br>  <br>  You could always go to your brother and see what he did.<br>  OR have your brother take you to the dr.<br>  Maybe you will feel more comfortable with him there.<br>  You could decide to tell your mom and ask your brother if he will be there for support<br>  <br>  You could always just go by yourself too, you are old enough.|`|zRQmWC5saa	These ppl telling u to go to the Dr on ur own is wrong! They will not see u without a parent present.<br>  I think u should tell ur mom " mum , I need to see the Dr. I have a male problem needs looked into" and if she ask what ? say " It is too embarressing for me to tell u, I would prefer the Dr tell u "<br>  I think u may need surgery to fix it , if u dont u can get a very serious std and that would be much worse to tell anyone, even a Dr. so be brave and be a man , tell ur mom!|`|N9U8KFCMaa	the best thing i would do is talk 2 my brother about it and ask him what he did but if u dont want to talk to him for some reson if u no were there is a condom clinik go there and there will be someone there who u caan speak 2 about it and they will no what 2 do about it <br>  <br>  or just be brave and tell ur mum <br>  <br>  hope dat can help m8 sounds nasty what u got|`|iFSw87M0aa	Hey there, I am a mom, Tell your mom, you can make the appointment on your own, just let her know, she will appreciate it. <br>  <br>  <br>  Text;<br>  Mom, can you schecdule me an dr appt<br>  Somethin goin on with my manhood<br>  luv ya, thnx|`|46aa0cdabe4cd1dfccd13cf00672c992aa	just call the doctor and explain to him/her your problems.<br>  if youre not comfortable, tell the doctor to explain it to your mom.<br>  that way you can avoid telling her completly. <br>  thats what i would do ;)|`|Rmbwvm2uaa	You could go to see your doctor without your mum, and ask him to explain it to her.|`|hRH0tp7caa	if it was me id defo tell my dad first =)|`|NWTfFEuVaa	First off, if you were born with it I think your mother would already know about it. I would just tell her in person, I've had a lot of embarrassing things happening to my body and when I finally got the courage to tell my mom and dad these strange things, I soon discovered that worrying about their reaction was a lot worse then what their reactions really were. There is no reason to be embarrassed, just tell her anyway that you feel comfortable, whether if be text or write a letter or email or face to face. Face to face makes it a lot easier because then YOU are bringing it up to her and the conversation boat has set sail. If you tell her any other way, that's going to make it akward for both of you because sooner or later she's going to have to confront you about the text or email or letter and she isn't going to know how to bring it up. And if you guys just don't face to face chat about it but do it all thru email, text, or letters, it's going to be an akward ride to the doctors.|`|H2IqzG12aa	If your brother had the condition, then wouldn't your mum already know all about it?  In any case, there are times in life when you can't afford to be embarrassed and this is one of them.  Bite the bullet, blurt it out and get it over with.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	You shouldn't need surgery, you may be able to correct this yourself, just stretch the foreskin<br>  Do it in the bath or shower - the hot water helps to soften the skin.<br>  Insert a clean finger under the foreskin, and gently stretch it - don't do it so much that it hurts, as this can cause micro tears, that then heal with scars - not what you want.<br>  It will take several weeks before you see any results, but keep it up daily and you'll get there<br>  Pulling the foreskin back whenever you pee will help, as will masturbating.<br>  Hope this helps|`|Wb1ydezNaa	I would just ask your mom if she could take you to the doctor and when she asks why,just say that you would like to get a check up/physical.if your too embarrassed to talk to her about it then you can ask your doctor to talk to her about it that way she is aware of what is going on without thinking the worst.(you can tell your mom that after your done with the doctor he will talk to her)|`|yTYLayLtaa	mom i need to go to the doctor there is something wrong with my penis i think i have a problem called phinosis and it really needs to be looked at i dont want to go into farther detail|`|fVMzCP5raa	Just dont tell your mum and go to the doctors alone.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	If your brother had it then just tell her you have the same issue as he had and need to see a doctor . Of course you can't go a day without worrying as at your age your body is developing and things like this are really important . It might sound easy just to send a text , but at some stage she will be talking to you anyway face to face . So do it correctly from the start and just tell her tonight that you need her to make a doctors appointment and you would prefer she waited outside whilst you see the doctor . I am sure she would much prefer her much loved son to be open , even about embarrassing things that find out you have been worrying all this time . The hard step is just telling , after that things will happen and you will be treated with consideration by the medical people who deal with this sort of issue every day . 15 is a very good age to get this sort of thing sorted out , it is before you start to have serious sexual relationships and that means when you do there will be no worried about discomfort   Good Luck|`|5apGkgS9aa	ok you are old enough to go to the doc yourself any way..but what you can do is leave a note under her pillow explaining everything ask her on the note to leave a reply under yours..dont forgrt to ask her to make an appointment for you.I did this with both my children if they ever felt embaressed talking face to face|`|0X4zg8yaaa	Luckily for you, a doctor is not needed to fix phimosis.<br>  Research it!|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Tell her she seen it and i have seen it|`|vJxuWyueaa	Well if your brother had the same thing, then just tell your mom. She'll understand.|`|n7uoE9wmaa	Your mum will want was is best for you, just tell her face to face|`|a013b919061eedf23c901fffea5350d4aa	look be brave an say mum i need to see the doc like our kid did|`|1545062c5c87be5a56f1f287fcc4e2c2aa	Why dont you go to the doctirs first, see what he has to say. He will diagnose you and give you options and then tell your mum that you been to docs and hes diagnosed this  . . <br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  Text her sayin , Mum im quite worried as i think i have a problem with my penis , therefore I am going to see a doctor. Could you book me an appointment. Then she will talk to you :) Dont be embarrassed, shes your mum and will help , you. Or why not ask your dad or a male guardian?<br>  <br>  Hope ya sort it  :)|`|v1uNUcwCaa	if you have had it since you were born your mum will know about it. and the chances are she knew that your brother has it as well. i think since your brother had it you should speak to him coz he will be able to help you from his experiences.<br>  <br>  anyways your 15.<br>  i started going to the doc's by myself when i was 12. why cant you go by yourself?<br>  a GP will not tell your mum anything everything is private between you and them. so you are best just to go there if you are finding iit too hard to talk with your mum.
