CDe5bEA6aa	Rent centers all have them, Just a couple would be Chets rent all, And Nine mile rental. Simple look in the yellow pages they are very plentiful.|`|fR2Geezcaa	I would not bother with a garage, they normally don't rent out their equipment. Try an equipment rental place like United Rental's or like the other answer said, Chet's. The Home Depot has started renting out all types of equipment too. Look on Yahoo Yellow Pages for a local place.

HfsZisOdaa	Look for a mechanic that has been in business for a long time. If they have been, it's likely that they do good honest work. I would then suggest that you let them do all of your work, they will be able to spot things coming and keep your car running. <br>  <br>  ~
WDVa1R0xaa	You should try googling "NYC prom after parties." You have to buy the tickets ahead of time, however. I was going to go to Webster Hall last year for our prom after party, and when we got there, they shut it down because there was wayyy too many people. You have kids from schools all over New York going so its going to be a big mess.|`|d55f4cfb1448583c397d7f7418a705edaa	yes. there are many. you will have to check up.
