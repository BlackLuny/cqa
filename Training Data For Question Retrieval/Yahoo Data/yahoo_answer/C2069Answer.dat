dcWN4v6Jaa	A troll is a person who reports innocent people's questions and answers for no reason at all. They will get suspended some time. They keep on creating accounts to do that for a "hobby". They mostly target top contributors. That is why you should keep your profile stuff private so they cannot troll you.|`|C9rnqAcQaa	Someone who walkks around with a club and perves at everyone!|`|AA11607373	A troll, just like the one in storybooks, is a nuisance to all those looking for real information.<br>  <br>  An internet troll could be a spammer, someone who posts random things completely unrelated, or someone who advertises.<br>  <br>  Internet trolls could also be those troll dolls from 2 decades ago posted on to the internet, but that is much less common. The ones with funny hair colors and the hair was all long... LOL, I loved those things.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	Yahoo says:<br>  <br>  "A "troll" is someone who intentionally and persistently posts inflammatory messages about sensitive topics to bait users into responding or provoke a confrontation. We also consider people to be trolls when they persistently misuse product features such as the ratings system to negatively target others."<br>  <br>  You will hear the term misused in talking about a good user who correctly reports violations. A good user who correctly reports violations, no matter how many, is NOT a troll. You can use it for a person who incorrectly reports many or targets another user incorrectly, but there are very few of these type trolls, mostly they exist in in P&S and R&S.

84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	In your 1st paragraph you confirm your total lack of respect.  You are talking like a punk.   You are doing yourself no favours by fomenting continuing dissension in class.<br>  <br>  If you would actually listen to him, and show some respect, you might see a different side of him.  Nobody lives to 60 in teaching without doing something right.  <br>  <br>  Respect is hard to earn after you have done something to lose it, and it is now up to you to earn your teacher's respect now that you have so obviously insulted and disrespected him.<br>  <br>  You are trying to get into a childish fight that you cannot possibly win.  If you don't start growing up now, you are headed for more trouble than you want.  If you don't think I know what I am talking about, you have to realize every adult out there has been where you are.  We have all had a teacher we didn't like at some point in time.  We got over it.  Some of the ones that didn't ended up as juvenile delinquents, and a small percentage ended up in prison as adults wondering what went wrong.<br>  <br>  By the way, the one and only time we acted up in class when we were in school, the teacher pulled out an unannounced test that counted 25% of our final grade.

They say oh shes just a teen and brushes you off.  That's why you got to their boss and if their boss doesn't listen go to the district office!  But they aren't going to listen to you if you go in saying my teachers so old stupid. You need to go in there and act like an adult good luck!
pOIY68Ygaa	when you take something out of your closet and don't end up wearing it, HANG IT BACK UP.  Learn some responsibility when you're young - life will be kicking you in the butt soon enough and you need to have your act together.  Just pick up after yourself.

Look for 'Options' link at upper right of mail screen and click on it.<br>  Options /mail options / blocked addresses<br>  enter the E-mail address you wish blocked and click on 'add block'<br>  you will never get mail from that address again.<br>  If this does not appeal to you, I believe your only other option is to cancel the account and open a new one.

zTau6hDIaa	100 / Total answers = percentage for each question<br>  <br>  100 / 259 your total answers = 0.386% per question.<br>  You would need to get 3 more best answers to go up one more percentage point.<br>  If you answer more questions, the percentage for each will go down so you would need to get more best answers to go up one percentage point.|`|ruYcE8i0aa	You have to actually do the math in order to find out (divide your best answers by your total answers to get the percentage), because it depends on how many answers you have. For example, if you've only answered two questions and one of them was the best, you'd have 1/2 50%. If you got one more best answer, you'd have 2/3 or 67%. Pretty big jump, but you'd just need one more "non-best" answer to knock it back down to 50%.<br>  <br>  But if you've answered a lot of questions, it would take many best answers to move up a percentage point (I can't get mine to budge unless I get several dozen best answers). On the flip side, the percentage won't go down quickly, either.|`|pTERJdzQaa	I would say about every 2 to 3 best answers your percent moves up by 1 or 2 percent.|`|pR2hy0bjaa	Its a Ratio...The percentage Goes up depending on how many you answered.

To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile.

You can 'comment' on a resolved question (under the Best Answer), but since no notice goes out to anybody about that, it is pretty useless to do.|`|OxnFnyqPaa	You can't, but you can add a comment by going to the Edit button.  You can also email your answerers and tell them what the correct answer to your question was.    Good luck and hope this helps! ^__^|`|gIszhbQNaa	As Yazmin said, you can't actually answer the resolved question, but you can't comment if you want to put like an extra opinion to the question, but you can't earn 10 points by commenting, so that's the sad part.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	You can use the edit button but my time here suggest few are going back to check that.

geIzOiWNaa	hello friend,<br>  <br>    the tamil poet thiruvalluvar was born in the district of mylapore in chennai,in tamil nadu,india,he wrote the famous book thirukkural,here is more information about him,i hope this will help you.<br>  <br>     About two thousand years ago there flourished in Mylapore, Madras, a born Siddha and a born poet by name Valluvar or, as he is more commonly known, ‚ÄòThiruvalluvar‚Äô, which only means, ‚Äòthe devotee of the Valluva caste‚Äô. Valluvas are Pariahs (now called Harijans) and their vocation was proclaiming the orders of the king by beat of drum. There is a tradition that Thiruvalluvar was the son of one Bhagavan, a Brahmin, and Adi, a Pariah woman whom he had married.<br>  <br>  Thiruvalluvar was born at Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. He is regarded as an Avatara of Brahma. His wife Vasuki was a chaste and devoted lady, an ideal wife, who never disobeyed the orders of her husband, but always carried them out implicitly. Thiruvalluvar showed people that a person could lead the life of a Grihastha or householder, and at the same time, lead a divine life or a life of purity and sanctity. He showed people that there was no necessity to leave the family and become a Sannyasin to lead a divine life of purity and sanctity. All his wise sayings and teachings are now in book form and known as ‚ÄòThirukkural‚Äô. These sayings are all in couplets. Here are some of them:<br>  <br>  Just as the alphabet ‚ÄòA‚Äô is the beginning of all letters, so also, God is the beginning for this universe.<br>  <br>  Learn the Shastras completely and then act according to their injunctions.<br>  <br>  The Anicha flower will fade by smelling, but guests are more sensitive if the hosts turn their faces a bit.<br>  <br>  Death is like sleeping in the burial ground;<br>  birth is like waking in the morning.<br>  <br>  These couplets are 1,330 in number. They contain the essence of the Vedas, the Upanishads and the six Darshanas. Thirukkural is regarded as a universal Bible. It is another Gita, Koran or Zend Avesta.<br>  <br>  Some aspirants repaired to Thiruvalluvar and enquired: "O sage, which Ashrama of life is better‚ÄîGrihastha or Sannyasa?". Thiruvalluvar did not give any answer. He simply kept quiet. He wanted to teach them the glory of Grihastha Ashrama by example.<br>  <br>  Thiruvalluvar was taking cold rice in the morning. He said to his wife: "Vasuki, the rice is very hot. Bring a fan to cool it". Thiruvalluvar‚Äôs wife was drawing water from the well when Thiruvalluvar called her. She at once left the rope and ran to him with a fan to cool the rice. She did not say to her husband: "How can the cold rice be hot? Why do you want a fan now?". She simply obeyed his commands. The vessel that contained water was hanging half-way in the well unsupported, on account of her Pativrata Dharma Shakti. The aspirants noticed this phenomenon and the noble conduct of Vasuki and were simply struck with amazement.<br>  <br>  About midday, on another occasion, Valluvar called his wife and said, "Bring a lamp immediately, O Vasuki! I am stitching the cloth. I cannot see the eye of the needle. I cannot pass the thread properly". Vasuki did not say to her husband: "It is broad daylight now. Why do you want a lamp? You can see the eye of the needle clearly". But she implicitly obeyed his word. The aspirants were much inspired by the ideal life of sage Thiruvalluvar and the exalted conduct of Vasuki. They did not speak a word to the saint. They took leave of the saint and quietly left the place with profound satisfaction. They were deeply impressed by the practical and exemplary life led by Thiruvalluvar and Vasuki. They learnt the lesson that the life of an ideal householder was in no way inferior to that of an ideal Sannyasin who was treading the path of Nivritti and austerity in the Himalayan caves and that each was great in its own place, time and circumstances.<br>  <br>  Dear readers! Such ladies sit enthroned in the hearts of their husbands. No doubt they are hard to find, because such women never advertise themselves; but there must be many in our land of Rishis and sages; and unless we maintain such a high level of moral purity, we will all be going down in these days of modern civilization and scientific advancement. If the husbands of the present day behave like Thiruvalluvar, the wives will say, "My husband has become senseless. He wants to fan the rice when it is so cold! He wants a light when there is broad sunlight". The wives will rebuke their husbands and fight with them.<br>  <br>  for more information,see this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.humanistictexts.org/tiruvalluvar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.humanistictexts.org/tiruvallu...</a><br>  <br>  all the best..!!<br>  <br>  i hope this helps you..!|`|iaUo3tvMaa	This might help: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071218072945AADND20">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

However, you can post the link to the questions. To do this, store your picture or pictures on a reliable photo-storing website. The best websites to store your photos in and post the links are Flickr, Photobucket and Tiny Pic, but if there is another website that you can use, feel free to use it. Then, all you need to do is copy and paste the link to the picture into your question/answer.

Once you hit Level 7, it really is ALL about self-motivation. Raising your BA level, getting TC label(s), rising higher on the Leaderboard, etc. Or about self-satisfaction, which works even better, I think.<br>  <br>  As to the TC badge, either you are 'unfocused' and answering all over the site, or you are sticking with the few areas that don't get the TC badge, like P&S or Jokes & Riddles.|`|oOVAbKPmaa	There's nothing level about Yahoo at all, and you can bet I'm on the level when I say that...|`|AA12361841	I don't think so but congrats on all the points.

5gG2OfHIaa	If the father is the sheriff of your county, township, whatever,  he is likely elected to office.  I would have someone in the family to chat with the father about controlling his daughter.   I don't think you need to get into the "good guy, bad guy" side of the story.  Just have some political type to speak with him about the whole mess could be embarrassing to him if it does not stop.  If you can get someone to approach the dad about the problem who is also a politician, then it will stop.  This is the best way to settle a misunderstanding.  Use a "go between."|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Video with a date/time stamp, copies of emails or phone messages, or other 'hard evidence' may be needed in a case like this. Check the laws for your state, as well. Here in Delaware, a person can apply for a 'protection from abuse' order against former 'relationship' partners, not just family members and married partners. This would move it out of the sheriff's hands and into the Courts, if your state allows this type of filing. There are also advocate groups for this type of thing that may be able to help.|`|rb8OGnmZaa	I'd say don't become defencive about it because it'll look as though you have something to be defencive about.

Someone needs to go to court whatever that entity is in your location. Usually in my state anyway, you simply go to the County Court Clerk and fill out the application. That goes into effect instantly forbidding her from being within 200 feet of your family. Then in ten days or you must both explain to a judge why the order should or should not be in effect. The order is usually granted. Orders of protection are good in all 50 states for one year. They can be renewed if necessary.<br>  <br>  For evidence I would walk in a familiar place where she follows and take photos, by a third person , maybe your brother staying hidden until she shows. Keep a log of everything she does, Show these records when you go to court. After the order they will do something if you call and they catch her. If not start writing letters to the press anybody that will listen. Name the sheriff's daughter as the pest she is. Send the press a copy of the order. Your sheriff is going to reign in his daughter.

I4WfmJMqaa	My dog recently had an FCE, which is like a stroke in his spinal column that cut off blood supply to his back legs.  As suddenly as it happened, he was paralyzed in his back legs.<br>  <br>  I paid for his surgery, and also have him in canine rehab right now.<br>  <br>  When my mom's boss heard about my dog, without ever even meeting me, he donated $500 to help cover the medical bill costs.<br>  <br>  Just a random act of kindness that has happened to me personally.<br>  <br>  : )|`|380FLuAuaa	You should go to the library and check out the Chicken Noddle Soup for the Soul books they have tones of story's about people doing really nice things for other people.

As he got older, he recieved a medical degree from the School of Medicine at New York University in 1939.  Salk had mentioned that helping people stay alive from diseases would be his greatest feat.  In 1940, Salk began to work on an influenza vaccine but eventually gave up.  During his years of 1947 - 1955, Salk began to work on a vaccine that was killing thousands of innocent children in that time period, Polio.  In 1955, Salk tested his vaccine for Polio, which proved to be a correct defeat of the virus.  Dr. Salk had won the Noble Peace Prize for stopping the most deadliest condition in children.  In 1965, Salk struck out on his own, and in his remaining last years on earth, he began to work on vaccines for AIDS.  Salk died on June 23, 1995 in La Jolla, at the age of 80, due to heart failure.  Dr. Jonas Salk will always be rememberd as the individual who would not stop caring about the weakened innocent, and the diseased ill.|`|U2PZvOZLaa	No not really but i've watched Greys Anotomy and that's a show where they do lots of heart transplants any good deeds stories there is tons don't know really google some up

qBYZwuijaa	When you send a self addressed stamped envelop you are suppose to put your address in the top left corner and address the envelope back to yourself. You can put the other persons return address on the left corner if you wish, but you are suppose to put your own. Never leave a return address blank just in the event the mail gets lost.
