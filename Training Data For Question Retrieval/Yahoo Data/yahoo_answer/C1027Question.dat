20090304131601AAglD9Z	Sports;Running	Heart Rate Training Zone Calculations?	I've been doing some research about varying heart rate training zones and how to calculate your HR to correspond to these zones.  In many methods, I see reference to 70%-80% of your max heart rate.  In several other methods, it says to use (Max HR - Resting HR) * X%+Resting Heart Rate.   Using these two different guidelines, I can get to very different answers.  For example, my Max HR is 189, my Resting HR is 60.  Based on this, to do aerobic endurance training (recommended around 70-75%) I should be between 132-141 BPM using method one and 150-157 using method two.  This seems like a very different range, and to be honest 132-141 seems really low, that is like a really slow jog for me... which is right?

20090304133721AASuaHD	Sports;Hockey	Is Sean Avery A Genius?	All I ask is that you think about this question and answer with your "own" thoughts… not the blind bandwagon thoughts.      Perhaps NY knows something that many people don’t know? I mean… after all it’s NY.      Difference/creativity/brilliance has always been met with a violent opposition.       Did Sean actually do or say anything that was illegal or untrue? He spoke out of turn? Do you really want players to have a turn? Do you want all players to say the same thing and act the same way? Do you want everyone to agree with the blind leader? Do you really want a stale NHL? / Personally - what attracts me (and keeps me attracted) to the NHL is the difference from other sports. It's that rare breed of young men who have the balls to stand and fight for what they believe in.      It is - but it shouldn't-be JUST the NHL. I belive there’s room in every industry for all types. Wouldn’t you really rather know that Sean’s ex-friends were doing his sloppy-seconds? Wouldn’t you want to see a player expose an unfair NHL rule?  (or lack of one)       If he weren’t a good player would you know who I was talking about?

20090304144206AAMmHAs	Sports;Basketball	Why does the SAME Lebron & Kobe fans of recent years say that Dwyane Wade doesn't deserve "MVP" this season?	The same Lebron fans who were fighting for Lebron last season are against Wade.      &       The same Kobe fans who were fighting for Kobe in 2005-06 & 2006-07 are against Wade.      During those seasons those same fans where pulling up stats & not supporting the "team record" idea. Even after Nash (06), Dirk (07), & Kobe (08) won MVP, those fans (Kobe fans in 06 & 07 and Lebron fans in 08) were COMPLAINING saying, "They (Lebron & Kobe) got robbed and they should  be MVP". No way shape and form did they (fans) support the outcome and still don't until this day.......      Example: If you ask a Lebron fan if Kobe should have won MVP last season they'll say "no" and the same with Kobe fans if you ask about Nash & Dirk.          So why change your thought pattern because your favorite player favors the system that you were so against? To me that sounds bias & hypocritical!      DWYANE WADE FOR 2008-09 MVP!

20090304155252AAIyLM2	Sports;Wrestling	Welcome back to TWE\Re-Born, come check it out, WQ inside as well. Who's gonna win these matches this week?	Welcome back to TWE Re-Born, we are on The Road To WrestleMania. Last week on Re-Born we had 2 Money in The Bank Qualifying Matches which were won by Gregory Helms beating Paul Burchill and Chris Jericho beating Edge. Also last week Jeff Hardy faced off against US Champ The Miz and won via DQ because of interference from RVD tonight Rey Mysterio will face The Champ then Jeff Hardy next week in a Contenders Match where the winner will face The Miz at WrestleMania. Women’s Champion Mickie James beat Layla, and Tommy Dreamer and Mick Foley defended they’re Tag Team Title’s against Hawkin’s and Ryder. In the Main Event The Undertaker was supposed to face Matt Hardy who apparently had an accident and TWE Champion HBK came out and said his replacement would be Kane who beat his brother.      Event 1   Rey Mysterio Vs The Miz      Event 2   TWE Champion HBK is in the ring with Kane and Matt Hardy, he tells us that it was not true about Matt having an accident, it was just that Kane came up to him and really wanted to face The Undertaker so he thought it would be a better option. He says that the reason they are with him now is because they both believe it is time for The Undertaker’s Streak to end and that he does not deserve to hold The TWE Title and want to make sure that he (HBK) walks out of WrestleMania still Champion. He says that tonight Matt Hardy will be facing The Undertaker, but Kane will be ringside. HBK is then interrupted by Re-Born GM Sting, he comes out to tell HBK that he also will be in action tonight, after watching his confrontation with Chris Jericho last week he thought it would be nice to see them in action and it will be up next, HBK smiles and tells him to bring it on, but Sting then says that Matt and Kane have to leave The Ring and go backstage.      Event 3   Shawn Michaels Vs Chris Jericho      Event 4   Cruiserweight Champion The Brian Kendrick is backstage with Chavo Guerrero, it was due to Chavo’s attack on Evan Bourne which helped Kendrick win The Title, tonight Chavo will face Evan Bourne in a MITB Qualifying Match. Kendrick offers to return the favour and will be ringside for they’re match, Chavo thanks him they shake hands and get ready for the match      Event 5   MITB Qualifying Match   Evan Bourne Vs Chavo Guerrero escorted by Brian Kendrick   Before The Match starts Kendrick approaches Bourne, but before he can do anything John Cena from Revenge appears on The Ramp, Cena calls Kendrick and says that he is an unworthy Cruiserweight Champion and cheated his way to victory and he is gonna make sure he will lose the Title, Kendrick grabs a mic and reminds Cena that he is unable to compete for The Cruiserweight Title, Cena says that it will not be him, then Shannon Moore comes running down the ramp and attacks Kendrick, all 4 are in the ring brawling with Cena still on the ramp. GM Sting comes out once again and says he is not having any of this on his show, this will now be a Tag Team Match between Evan Bourne and Shannon Moore Vs Chavo and Brian Kendrick and that Bourne will face Chavo next week in they’re MITB Qualifying Match.   Event 6   Tag Team Match   Evan Bourne and Shannon Moore Vs Brian Kendrick and Chavo Guerrero   John Cena ringside      Event 7   Women’s Title contenders Match Triple Threat   Gail Kim Vs Layla Vs Melina      Event 8   MITB Qualifying Match   Rob Van Dam Vs D’Lo Brown   Before The Match begins RVD tells us once again how he is going to bring JUSTICE to Re-Born and will soon he holding The TWE Title once he wins The MITB at WrestleMania and nothing is going to stop him from achieving his goal.      Event 9   GM Sting is in his office, he is approached by Edge who says he wants to be involved with WrestleMania, Sting says that he is not the first person to ask him that tonight, he says that we still have to find someone to represent Re-Born in The brand Vs Brand contest for Brand Supremacy. Sting says that Edge will face AJ Styles next week and the winner will represent Re-Born at WrestleMania.      Main Event   Matt Hardy Vs The Undertaker   Kane ringside with Matt Hardy      Thankyou for viewing TWE Re-Born, please vote for who you think should win each match and give the show a rating.      WQ. Do you like the idea of having Heavyweights in this years Money in The Bank Match and could it make things more interesting?

The Panthers have their play in high gear right now and for the first time in many years we have a legit shot at the playoffs. Bigger than that, the fans down here are actually believing in this team, and believe in the playoff push going on down here.       What do you think of it?

20090304151713AAL1R7a	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Which was the last English club to finish at the bottom of their CL group?	IF and thats a big IF Aston Villa make it into the Champions League next year I have a feeling they will be the next if there was one before. People love to shoot at Arsenal saying they don't deserve to go to Europe if they are playing so crappy domestically, but if thats the case Liverpool should not have won their CL trophy either for finishing 5th that year.      Villa are obviously not European quality yet if they could not get past CSKA Moscow in the UEFA Cup. People may be happy to say "yes finally someone broke into the top 4" but that is usually only temporarily and they usually don't do jack in Europe. The way I see it only 'the big 4' should represent England in the Champions League until other teams can prove their worth, and Villa has yet to do so.

20090304153654AAs5Hef	Sports;Football (American)	Should the Bills switch to a 3-4 defense or stay with a 4-3?	everyone else in their division is a 3-4. They have the nose tackle in Stroud. They would still need to draft a defensive end. At linebacker, it looks lik they are going to sign Cato June. The only other question with it is if they will have to draft another linebacker (depending on how good Alvin Bowen will be coming off his injury. I think he should start though.)
20090304142338AAHkCdb	Sports;Baseball	Do you think I will make the team?	PLEASE READ! ITS NOT THAT LONG I SWEAR! YES OR NO ANSWERS WILL WORK!      Ok so there are about 20 girls trying out for the JV softball team   most of them are freshmen, and two are 8th graders possibly getting moved up.   there are about 4 - 6 girls who have never played before, and one who might get moved up to Varsity      so that leaves us at like 15 trying out      Last year I was a Freshman, and the team bechwarmer/cheeleader   It was so degrading. I lost all of my confidence and just completely gave up by the end of the year      This year I plan on going out for the team again, and I'm going to show that I really want it.

With the Pistons having a three game winning streak and returning to the form that made them so great with Chauncey Billups, what would the future hold for Iverson? Michael Curry said that Iverson will come off the bench instead of Hamilton and with Iverson injured, the Pistons are much better than the team throughout the season with Hamilton coming off the bench instead.

20090304103958AAoDstT	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	I need some advice on training collars for a scent hound?	This isn't a hunting question, but I know hunters use training collars for their dogs, and hopefully one here will have some input, I apologise to any fudds who may object to this question being here.   I have a 10 or 11 month old dog who loves to run, and will not come back when you call for her. I'm disabled and she's too fast for me to catch her, it's a real ordeal trying to get her to come back home. I live in the country and keep her on a chain when she wants to go outside, but usually she's an indoor dog. She will sometimes slip off the leash when I go to transfer her to the chain, then the trouble starts, she's off and running and I really don't want to see her get hit by a car, or maybe just run off and get lost somewhere. She's a tall dog, about 40 to 43 pounds, hound mix, definitely a scent hound, she gets a scent of something and she;s gone.   I am going to buy a training collar to hopefully break her of this habit, which will also let me take her off the chain in the backyard. Eventually, this summer I plan on having an invisible fence installed. I would need a strong collar for her, one that would hopefully work in conjunction with the fence. Does anyone here know of a training collar, with remote, that has enough power to dissuade even the strongest running dog? Hopefully a training collar with remote, that can be used with an invisible fence at a later time.   I would greatly appreciate the opinions and advice from those who either use, or have used a training collar.   Thank-you.

Lately, I have been having pain in my knees and would like to try swimming as an alternative for working out for now, to give the knees a good rest.    I used to swim laps pretty hard in out home pool at my old house, but being confused about the effect I was getting- in other words I wasn't sure if I was getting a good workout, because if I was out of breath I didn't know if it was because I was working hard or just needed air?    Thanks so much, swimmers! God bless you!   :D

First of all he says "GOAL MAN UTD! 1-1! Wayne Rooney scoring a trademark United goal, getting a lucky deflection as he shot past the keeper.." then he says.. "Park strikes goalwards for United but it hits Rooney. To be fair to Park, it's a big target to avoid at the best of times..."..And now he says.."Ronaldo's crying again. Steven Taylor puts a hit on the Portuguese - a kick and a punch simultaneously, gets booked, and Fergie is livid..." :D Funny :D      And he has a fancy for Ngog ;).."By the way, Rob Keane got Spurs' goal from close range after a flick-on from Dawson. He's no David N'Gog, let's be honest..." and "Meanwhile, Modric sets up Keane slightly wide of goal but Brad Jones - the new Edwin van der Sar of course - smothers...N'Gog would have buried it..."      Anyway..End of game

They aren't doing anything with Charlie and it's not fair. He's loaded with talent and needs to be on weekly. I think they made a great Tag Team. They had an "old-school" feel to them. They would make a huge comeback! They had great chemistry and put on amazing matches. Now, with The Miz and Morrison, could you imagine how much better the Tag Team Division will become! The matches those four men will put on together. Add in Carlito and Primo. The Tag Team Division will be so great! It could return and make a huge impact. Throw in some other Tag Teams and it will be huge!       WQ: So do you think that's a good idea, bringing them back as a Tag Team?

I know I'm probably doing something wrong though.      Does anyone have any tips for mastering these?      I just can't seem to get my board high enough to grab it.  Also, sometimes I just practice getting the board high by shifting weight to the nose, then shifting it to my tail and pulling up the nose.   It can get pretty high, but I notice the board doesn't flex very much, it stays pretty straight.   I ride a Ride Vista.  It's an intermediate/advanced board, and it's not specific for park.  It's about in the middle in terms of what it does, it's not a "park board,"  but it's not specifically "mountain".  I was told it is kinda half and half.      Any tips would be great!!   Thanks:)

My legs are perfectly fine its just my head and my lungs can not handle it.       It made me feel sooo bad that i was the only one sitting out yesterday. It probably did not look good since it was tryouts.      Do you have any tips to make my lungs hold out for running? Also how to make myself not get so dizzy! thanks sooo much!

20090304142053AA85mzP	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Camping	Should I go on this camping trip?	I've known this girl for about 3 years, we didn't start hanging out a lot until lately. She's nice but is a flaky and fareweather friend and we're not super close or anything. She invited me to go on this 5 day camping trip and about a 2000 mile drive to get there this summer with about 10 people. Problem is, there's a few people going who don't like me much nor do I like them. I haven't met about half the others yet but I haven't had the best luck getting along with her friends, nor do they make you feel very welcome if they don't know you. When we 've hung out in a group in the past, she's tended to kind of ignore me and i've found it to be rude. My gut says don't go because i'll feel like the oddball, not have fun and won't want to be trapped with these people for five days. I also realize it also has the potential to be a blast, but i'm just afraid i'll be miserable being around people I don't enjoy. From you experienced campers,  what do you think I should do?

20090304152513AA20Cg3	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Who should I take #1 overall?	The question seems harder to answer this year than past years      The league is a standard roto, 12 teams. My keepers heading into the draft are Alex Rios, Jake Peavy, and Chris Davis.      For the most part, all of the premiere talent is on the board. I have limited my choice to 3 players: Hanley Ramirez, Alex Rodriguez, and Albert Pujols.      I know Hanley Ramirez is the 30/30 guarantee and the 40/40 threat, and his RBI's will jump after probably being moved to the 3rd in the Marlins order. And I know Alex Rodriguez statistically is better every other year, and this year just happens to be one of the predicted stronger years and he will do extremely well trying to make the doubters eat crow after the steroid scandal.      But for some reason, I'm sold on Pujols. He is always a solid MVP candidate and is a guarantee .330/35 HR's/115 RBI's. I just question if this is the right move because I have Chris Davis and can stick him at the 1B hole but the same case can be made for picking against A-Rod due to Davis' dual position eligibility.       So Han Ram would be the logical choice, right? I just feel he has the best chance of the top 3 to not reach his potential and not be as good as last year. Plus the Marlins lineup sucks. Plus I'd be content with a Drew, Jeter, or Peralta in later rounds. Plus I am already off to a nice start in SB's with Rios (a guaranteed 25) so I just don't know      So as you can see I'm in a big dilemma. And since I don't get a pick till #24, I can't mess this up.      Thanks for the help!

20090304151421AAJBwMp	Sports;Auto Racing;NASCAR	Are Logano's Parents suing J.G.R.?	It was announced today that the Parents of Joey Logano are thinking of suing J.G.R.. Seems young Joey told his Parents that he had a part time job with Home Depot but forgot to tell them that the job was driving a race car. Joey had told his Parents that he would work on weekends and try to save money for a promise ring for his Girlfriend. He also told them that he would stay with a friend on the weekends to save money on gas by not coming home every night. His Parents thought it was a very good idea. Seems Mom found out as one of her friends came over on Monday Morning with the sports page and lo and behold there was a picture of young Joey surrounded by scantily clad show girls. Mom went upstairs and demanded an explanation of the picture. Joey told mom that he had gotten a promotion at work and they were just publicity photos. She kind of had an idea that something was up when two weeks ago he came home with a bruise on his neck and said that he had a slight accident at work while driving a C.O.T. and bumped a wall. At first mom thought it was a hickey from his Girlfriend but thought about it and believed his story. He told her a C.O.T was a new vehicle and was still getting used to it, mom thought it was a new kind of forklift and went along with it for the time being. Mediation is on going and Mom is holding out for a picture of Tony Stewart wearing nothing but old spice, Dad has settled his part and will get free tools as long as Joey is with Home Depot. Mean while Joey is still saving up for that Promise ring for his special girl. And at least one parent will be at every race from now on as Mom doesn't trust the Little Trollops that hang around the track.

My previous question really helped point me in the right direction, So i thank the 3 gentleman that gave me great advice on bikes.      I have narrowed it down a bit more. I am looking for a bike in the price range of 200-400$. As time goes on and my skills and interest grow w/ mountain biking, i will look to upgrade my bike for more rough/advance terrain.      here is a little info I am 5'4", so i need a smaller bike. the trails i am looking to ride on, are not steep, moderate to no hills, but the terrain can be muddy at times, and loose dirt. So i am looking for a bike w/ disc brakes, tires that will be great in mudd ;), comfortable, front suspension (i dont need full, since i wont be on crazy bumpy terrain), and decently light weight      the problem is finding this kind of bike, or something compromisable to it.       All help is wanted :). I know to stay way from department store bikes, such as Dicks and Wal-marts :P. I have found some local stores in NJ and been on their websites, but still cant find something to fit my needs and budget :P

This isn't meant to be a knock on either of these guys they both are great players and both are certain to go down as 2 of the all-time greats when it's all said and done

20090304154119AAXTvrp	Sports;Martial Arts	Can't fight even though I know how...?	See, I take karate (gold-belt) and I have discovered a huge flaw. I know most of the basic punches, kicks, and combos and I can execute them perfectly when practicing (on machines, in front of the mirror, etc.). But the problem comes in when I spar (fight other people) because I can't execute the moves nor the combos correctly on my opponent. It's most likely because I am under pressure that I will be attacked. There's really no point in doing karate if I can't use the moves in a fight, so how can I spar with no fear and use the moves quickly and correctly?
