20090219183127AADLAaL	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Proof by contradiction?	I know that with a proof by contradiction, you have to show that the negation of a statement is always false, and this proves that the statement itself is always true.   Is it necessary in a proof by contradiction for two statements to actually contradict each other (i.e., in the end getting something like x = ~x)? Or is it enough to simply prove that the negation is false?      Here are parts of the actual problem I'm solving:   Claim: For all integers x,y,   (3x + 5y = 47) --> ( ~(7|x) ^ ~(7|y) )   Negation: There exist integers x,y such that   (3x + 5y = 47) ^ (7|x) ^ (7|y)   Definition of a|b: For integers a,b with a != 0, there exists an integer such that b = ak      After some work, I ended up getting:   47 = 7(3i + 5j)   which is in the form b=ak, which by definition means that 7|47, which is false.      Is this a proof by contradiction? If not, what SHOULD I do?

20070209143611AAarACM	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Math problem - please help!!!?	EXACT PROBLEM   You pull into the mall on a Saturday shopping trip only to find all the spaces full.  Instead of driving around looking for a parking spot, you poise your car at the end of a row, commanding 16 spaces.  As soon as one of the spaces opens up, you will get to park.  How long do you expect to wait?   Suppose there is only one space.  Make an assumption- say 10 minutes to wait for the one space to open up.  Another approach is to make some assumptions about the shoppers.  Assume that the average shopper spends about one hour in the mall on a Saturday.  Then, how long to we expect to wait for our one space to open up?  We could wait one second if the owner comes out immediately, or we could wait one hour.  It seems logical to guess that the space will become available somewhere in the middle, like ? an hour.  So for one space we wait 30 minutes.  How about two spaces?  Solve this simple case and build up the solution of the original problem.

Some of the X-rays emitted by an X-ray imaging machine are fluorescence X-rays and are formed when individual atoms in the machine undergo radiative transitions. While the mercury atoms in a fluorescent lamp also undergo radiative transitions, those mercury atoms emit ultraviolet light, not X-rays. The reason for this difference is that (Select one)         A) the electrons in the imaging machine atoms experience much larger changes in energy during their radiative transitions than the electrons in the mercury atoms do.      B) mercury atoms aren't massive enough to emit X-rays, whereas the atoms in an X-ray machine are.      C) the atoms in an X-ray machine are packed together in a solid and can amplify each other's waves much more effectively than the gaseous mercury atoms in a fluorescent lamp can.      D) the electrons in the imaging machine atoms experience much smaller changes in energy during their radiative transitions than the electrons in the mercury atoms do.

It compiles the number of heartbeats after t minutes. When the data in the table are graphed (and the data points are connected using a smooth curve), the tangent line to this curve at any instant of time gives the instantaneous heart rate of the patient at that moment of time in beats per minute.   t (min)           36      38       40     42    44   Heartbeats 2530 2661 2806 2948 3080      So the question is:    Estimate the patient's heart rate after 42 minutes using the secant line between the points with the t values, t = 36 and t=42.

Here is the article:  http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090219/sc_...       Ok, They said that the blast occurred in September (without stating a year, which means 2008 I'm guessing) and that the huge gamma-ray burst occurred 12.2 billion light years away, which means that the blast itself happened 12.2 billion years ago as light took that long to travel to us, which means that what we're seeing now is what happened 12.2 billion years ago in the area of the blast, right??      So, in that case, they should have said that the blast was detected (and not "occurred") in September...      Do you agree and understand what I'm trying to say?   Sorry but English is a second language for me, I hope that I've been clear enough

This means that the        antibiotic will bind to the enzyme and alter the shape of the enzyme.     antibiotic will bind to the substrate and alter the shape of the substrate.     antibiotic will bind to the enzyme-substrate complex and alter its shape.     antibiotic will bind to the product that is being produced and alter its shape.     antibiotic will bind to the receptor proteins embedded in the phospholipid bilayer, which will in turn close the channels.      Question 12         The temperature is raised slightly above the optimum for a specific enzyme. What would you expect to observe as a result of the change in temperature?        increased enzyme activity     decreased enzyme activity     no change in enzyme activity     enzyme denaturation      5. When the substrate is bound to the enzyme, the shape of the enzyme may change slightly, leading to        a better induced fit.     a great range of possible catalytic activities.     a greater supply of activation energy.     more permanent binding through intimate total contact.     more possible products of the reaction.

Huge gamma-ray blast spotted 12.2 bln light-years from earth            Buzz Up Send    Email IM Share    Delicious Digg Facebook Fark Newsvine Reddit StumbleUpon Technorati Yahoo! Bookmarks Print Thu Feb 19, 3:58 pm ET AFP/NASA – This NASA image shows an X-ray afterglow in orange and yellow in this view that merges images from Swift's … WASHINGTON (AFP) – The US space agency's Fermi telescope has detected a massive explosion in space which scientists say is the biggest gamma-ray burst ever detected, a report published Thursday in Science Express said.      The spectacular blast, which occurred in September in the Carina constellation, produced energies ranging from 3,000 to more than five billion times that of visible light, astrophysicists said.      "Visible light has an energy range of between two and three electron volts and these were in the millions to billions of electron volts," astrophysicist Frank Reddy of US space agency NASA told AFP.      "If you think about it in terms of energy, X-rays are more energetic because they penetrate matter. These things don't stop for anything -- they just bore through and that's why we can see them from enormous distances," Reddy said.      A team led by Jochen Greiner of Germany's Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics determined that the huge gamma-ray burst occurred 12.2 billion light years away.      The sun is eight light minutes from Earth, and Pluto is 12 light hours away.

Hello,      We have a science project where we have to produce a maximum output of electricity using hydroelectricty. We have little 12V motor and all the necessary gears and all... The rest is for us to decide....      So, what should I do? I don't know anything about hydroelectricity/turbines and all...We thought (my team and I) about doing a Pelton wheel ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelton_whee...  that we will eventually attach to the motor and produce that way some electricity with water but my question is: How can I maximize the energy? Is there some things that I should know about turbines and stuff that can help us optimize the produced output?      Thanks in advance.   If my question isn't clear, please tell me and I'll explain.

20090220011511AArIV9x	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Why is copper such a good electrical conductor? (in terms of atomic/molecular structure)?	I am comparing the electrical conductivity of copper and PVC. I understand that for a metal to be a good conductor, little energy is needed to delocalize the valence electron(s) when the metal is arrayed in its 'cations in a sea of electrons' arrangement. I figured that metals with a larger atomic radius would be more conductive as they are holding onto their valence electrons with less attractive force, and thus a smaller amount of energy would be required to dislodge them.      Basically my question is, how is copper such a good electrical conductor in relation to its molecular/atomic structure? If my logic used in the above paragraph is flawed i would appreciate it if you corrected me.      Thankyou

20090220011809AAvtLCx	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Paracetamol overdose? Please help!?	About 74 hours ago i took 10 paracetamol tablets in one go. I wasnt thinking properly at the time and yes i know it was a stupid thing to do. Anyway, 3 hours later from when i took the tablets my skin started to feel like it was burning and my whole body felt extremely itchy. I even left deep marks on myself from scratching. Then gradually my head started to hurt, i began to feel like i was zoning out and i lost the ability to talk properly. My hands and feet felt numb and i couldn't move. At around 4 hours after taking the pills, i lost consciousness for about half an hour. I went to bed after this and threw up several times during that night and i still cannot move 74 hours later, and im still vomiting. I've never had this before. Please help me, what could this be? I'm really worried! For the record i am 16 year old female and 7 stone in weight.

20090220015303AAAbIlS	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Could someone review this combined standard deviation attempt?	Mean and SD of exams marks of 2 groups of students, calculate the mean and sd of the combined group:      Group 1: N=20, mean = 65%, SD = 1%   Group 2: N=20, mean = 60%, SD = 2%      combined mean = (20*.65 + 20*.60)/40 = .625 => 62.5%      combined SD:      SD=sqrt[sum(x - mean)^2/(n)], or we can use   SD=sqrt[(n*sum(x^2)-(sum(x))^2)/(n(n))...      Using this, we obtain for Sample I:   Since the mean is 65 with n=20   ...this gives sum(x)=65*20=1300      now we can solve for sum(x^2)...getting   sum(x^2)=[(1^2)*20*20+1300^2]/20=2544....    = (400+1300^2) / 20    = 84520         Now do the same thing for Sample II:   sum(x)=60*20=1200, and   sum(x^2)=[(2^2*20*20+1200^2]/20=72080      So, for the combined data, we get:   sum(x)=1300+1200=2500, and   sum(x^2)=84520+72080 = 156600      Now use the formula for SD (with n=20+20=40)   SD=sqrt[(40*156600-2500^2)/(40*40)]   = sqrt 8.75   = 2.9%

Inside the container is a paddle wheel that can be used to stir the gas. The paddle wheel is started and turns anti-clockwise.       Immediately after stopping the paddle wheel, we wish to return the gas to its original state (i.e. to the state before we started turning the paddle wheel anticlockwise).      So what do I do ?? So far, all I have come up with is 'Unseal the container, remove and replace the gas with a fresh supply and reseal the container'.      But somehow....I dont think that would work...any ideas??      I have also considered the possibility of this being a trick question where the answer would be the process cannot be reversed as this a closed system.      FYI. I have worked out that this an adiabatic process.
