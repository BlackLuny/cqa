20090220193400AAWwpqy	Dining Out;Fast Food	What is the deal with Tina's Burritos?	They are one of my guilty pleasures and a few days back I notice that they were changing the packaging.. Whatever, fine. But now all the old ones are gone and I looked a little closer and now they are 4oz instead of 5oz but the price is still what it was before.  I remember when they were four for a buck, then three for a buck and finally two for a buck and sometimes 65 cents each.  It seems like all the cheap college food is getting as pricey as regular food now.        I'm going cut back on my Tina's by about half as much as I used to buy, maybe more. I used to buy up to 12 at a time, now it will two maybe three at a time.  Geez-- Even soup is like a $1.50 plus now too.   The only thing cheap now is ramen and there is only so much of that you can eat.  Will the latest 20% price bump affect how much you will buy the burritos?  Will you change brands?

20090203092710AA4V7bH	Dining Out;Fast Food	Question about Five Guys Reastaurant?	Ok. Five Guys offer free peanuts to their customers while they wait for their order to be cooked. I work at a car dealership, and one of the lot attendants, Kofi, always goes over and snags a bag of peanuts and leaves. Now, of course there are signs saying peanuts cannot leave the store. Also they want you to place the peanuts in little paper trays instead of bags so customers wont take them home. Did Kofi ruin it for all of us? Is he ghetto? We used to eat their peanuts all the time. They are very good. Holla.
