AA11932246	Reliable electricity is more important than the environment (which is why when you ban nuclear power, coal power plants get built (as well as not shut down)).<br>  <br>  There is the fact that wind and solar can not power our civilisation whilst coal and natural gas can, therefore we use coal and natural gas (uranium could as well, if idiots didn't ban it or impose stupid regulations that effectively prevent it's expansion).|`|TT7O1JXUaa	Renewable energy is more expensive than traditional sources and it's not yet efficient enough to be a major contributer to our energy needs.

0KmJwYunaa	If made correctly, the bio-diesel will contain just methyl esters.   <br>  <br>  The NaOH reacts with a portion of the long hydrocarbon chain to form glycerins which settle out of the solution,  The idea is that this would leave two methyl ester remnants of that long chain and that hopefully the length of the ester chains approximate iso-decane through iso-dodecane.   <br>  <br>  To prevent the NaOH from reacting with the entire hydrocarbon chain, it is diluted in methanol before being added to the oil so when the glycerin has settled out, it's a mixture of methanol and methyl esters that are skimmed off.   <br>  <br>  The Methanol is corrosive so you want as little of it as possible hence water is added as all alcohols have an affinity for water and will separate out if there's enough water mixed in, this is called washing and results in a layer of esters at the top, and a layer of water and ethanol at the bottom, since soap (glycerins) also have an affinity to water, washing also removes any leftover glycerin that hasn't settled out.   The esters are skimmed off the top as bio-diesel.     <br>  <br>  This bio-diesel will still have some water in it so it should be left to settle out, perhaps kept warm to encourage more separation, again it separates to two layers, water and bio-diesel and the bio-diesel is siphoned off the top.   If necessary, the remaining water may be removed by boiling the bio-diesel such that the water evaporates but that risks polymerization to form fatty acids which would put you back where you started.   It would probably be better to use some kind of zeolite to absorb the water.   The zeolite could be reused by heating them till the absorbed water evaporates.<br>  <br>  Hence if all the reactions have been carried to completion and the separations been thorough, the bio-diesel will be just methyl esters, no NaOH, no methanol and no water despite the three of them being used to produce the bio-diesel.|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	Vegetable oil, mixed with sodium methoxide to replace the glycerol.|`|I38WF5aFaa	Vegetable oil,  methanol and lye (sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide).|`|sBrYcT5daa	and the best part is, food prices skyrocket, farmers lose money and people starve... and for palm oil (just 1 example), which is also used as an alternative fuel ingredient, it takes two liters of common diesel to cold-press one liter of palm oil.

La + grande truffa che è stata realizzata in Italia dal dopoguerra l’ha subita la Campania (truffa da 10.000.000 di euro) : una grande azienda (Fibe) prese l’impegno di smaltire i rifiuti facendo pagare alla Campania più di un miliardo di euro, ma anziché smaltirli li imballò (ecoballe); oggi ci sono milioni di blocchi di spazzatura imbustata in Campania che sono stati dati dalla Fibe in garanzia alle banche perché erano considerati combustibile; il paradosso è che per smaltirli non si possono toccare perché sono patrimonio dell’azienda. Sostituire la democrazia con l’azienda ci ha portato al disastro totale.<br>  Un altro fattore determinante per il disastro ambientale in Campania è stato quello della camorra.<br>  La Camorra ha guadagnato moltissimo in ogni fase del ciclo di rifiuti; poi si è specializzata nello smaltimento dei fanghi altamente tossici proveniente dalla depurazione delle acque ed ha cominciato a controllare anche le fognature e le bonifiche. <br>  Anche lo Stato Italiano ha avuto la sua parte ne disastro.<br>  Hanno fatto pagare dalle tasche degli italiani la spesa per la costruzione di inceneritori (con le bollette Enel), anziché provvedere alla costruzione di impianti per energie rinnovabili (eolica, solare, ecc). Tali inceneritori sono inquinanti, al di la di quello che dicono riguardo ai filtri (gli scienziati sono pagati per dire bugie). L’inceneritore produce del materiale altamente inquinante che va poi a finire nelle discariche. Le immissioni di nanoparticelle sono molto più pericolose perché entrano dentro gli organi e possono provocare tumori. Inoltre, la spazzatura viene trasformata in fumi pericolosi. Le immissioni che escono dagli inceneritori vanno ad aggravare l’effetto serra.<br>  Secondo le ultimi ricerche (vedesi Blog di Beppe Grillo), le pecore che pascolano nei pressi delle discariche producono latte inquinato di diossina. Analogamente accade per le mucche, per le coltivazioni, ecc.<br>  La diossina è un fattore determinante per l’insorgenza di tumori e già molti si sono ammalati gravemente.<br>  La soluzione ideale è la raccolta differenziata: più la si fa e più si ha un risparmio e guadagno. In Campania non c’è però un’impiantistica per la differenziata come c’è al nord. Con la raccolta differenziata si trasformano in terriccio inerte le sostanze organiche. I materiali vengono divisi e riciclati e in più si crea occupazione li dove ci sono problemi di disoccupazione elevata. Purtroppo senza un’impiantistica adeguata per fare il riciclo non si può farlo e allo Stato preoccupa soprattutto costruire inceneritori.|`|qCczFMbnaa	troppa fatica|`|qJXR53uDaa	Appunto metaldad sono cazzate!!!Perchè parlare se non ci vivete dentro???E' brutto vedere che c'è così tanto"razzismo"in italia!!!|`|ucYrNXRuaa	io ho sentito dire  da gentwe che c'è stata che buttano l'immondezza dalla finestra, ...boh magari son cazzate|`|w9ILrMpQaa	Perchè non sa come si fa e non vuole neache informarsi!!!|`|fYxgaCiuaa	Certo che si può peccato che a napoli non esistano contentiori differenziati e che quelli della immondizia mischiano tutti insieme -.-|`|AKcbdyW2aa	sto guardando matrix e parlano di questo argomento...<br>  sono anni che protestano, hanno avuto 8 milioni di € per risolvere il problema, ma se li sono pappati ( chissà da chi )<br>  le altre regioni non vogliono i rifiuti se non sono differenziati, loro non vogliono la tossicità e nemmeno gli altri sono disposti a prendersela!
I38WF5aFaa	No.  The type of driving I do would drain batteries very quickly.  My pickup is loaded with tools and equipment for my business for 1/2 of the miles I drive.  I live in an area with long cold winters.  Electric cars don't have heaters.  Its 50 miles to the nearest supermarket or walmart.  The vet is 80 miles away and even further for other big box stores.  An electric car would not work for me.|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Sure, when the one I have now gives out.    I've got at least another 10-15 years in it though.|`|L8zmQS8Jaa	I can't see any reason for saying NO except a personal bias.  You have asked if any such a consideration might be made in the future.  Unless someone is certain what technology may be available in an uncertain future on what basis can they say they will never make such a consideration? <br>  <br>  At some time it may be the clear choice, or the only choice, or no choice at all.  I am intrigued with the idea of an electric vehicle.  Someone else may have other interests.  I had one fellow rant on about how global warming was a hoax but at the end he said he couldn't wait for electric cars because of the potential power they could have.   <br>  <br>  For someone to say that they will NEVER make even a consideration is just a little absurd.  The very process of deciding they would never buy one is in fact a consideration (but just with a negative conclusion.)<br>  <br>  With respect to the wiki article.  I have some problems.  It wants to define the "electric car" rather narrowly to BEV.  This is a mistake.  Electric vehicles are powered with electricity.  <br>  <br>  1.But this electricity can be produced on board as in a fuel cell vehicle or a solar powered vehicle (or even a series hybrid with a genset trailer.)  <br>  2. It can be stored as is the case of a battery electric vehicle or some would say a compressed air vehicle where the compressed air is produced with electricity.  <br>  3. Or at last the vehicle could have electricity transmitted to it by way of a third rail or overhead wires as is the case in many light rail or trams.  <br>  <br>  All of these with the exception of the compressed air vehicle would be expected to use electric motors to drive the wheels.|`|O4m7cKHCaa	No, because they have batteries in them that will need to be replaced every so often, and they will cost about half the price of the car.They take a long time to recharge, do you want to wait for 7-8 hours on a trip for them to charge up? Don't let anyone tell you that they can make a battery that will charge in less than an hour. The physics of the battery won't let it happen. The cars will only go on one charge for around 50 miles. I think the speed is a consideration too, you won't be going 65-70 miles an hour. Last but not least, when everybody starts to charge their batteries at night, where do you think the electricity will come from? Coal burning power plants that contribute to global warming. There is no such thing as "clean coal".|`|ywOqliwKaa	No. Most of my driving is on the highways driving long distances. Might be ok for city driving, but are very expensive and still produce a lot of CO2 via the power plants producing the electricity.<br>  <br>  We need to focus our resources on Nuclear, Wind, and solar first. Cars only produce about 5-6% of our CO2. Even if we got rid of all cars, the effect on global warming would be minimal.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	why not, if its cheap. but too bad that its still quite expensive|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	Absolutely.  Not only would I consider it, but my next car purchase is going to be an electric car.<br>  <br>  I already own an electric moped and a Prius, and I won't buy a new car until there's an electric car available that I can afford which can replace the Prius.  They're more efficient, cleaner, more reliable, quieter, and just plain cooler than gas cars.|`|AA10297143	I doubt it very seriously unless there is a way to extend the life of the source and be able to use the car for longer distances rather than just around town.

When we have better access to good battery's I think that the electric car will start to sell a lot more.<br>  <br>  The only electric car that i know of that can actually run at highway speeds and that the charge will last more than 60 miles is a Tesla. Yes it is a extremely cool and fast (0 to 60 in 3.4) electric car but it still only has a range of 240 miles and takes over 4 hours to charge so it is no more than a commuter car or and the car costs over $200,000.00. And when you need to replace the battery pack in 5 years it would cost you just as much if not more than buying a compact car. So it not very affordable for the general public. I would love to go buy a Tesla but that ain't going to happen any time soon. Some day we will have electric cars that can do all this for a reasonable price but that time is still at least a decade away.|`|eQZYW6BPaa	when there are more on the market and they are cheaper i would say the positives will definetly outwheigh the negatives.<br>  <br>  -don't have to buy gas<br>  -better for the environment<br>  -probably more reliable(less items to replace and clean)<br>  <br>  btw people who say that they won't last long enough and take to long to charge.

So it's not really possible to conserve the climate even if we suddenly stopped emitting pollutants into the atmosphere, it would happen eventually anyway.<br>  <br>  For me the need of the hour is to understand how extreme weather events will change with our changing climate so we can adapt our society to coming changes without ending up in a global disaster.

If you do your own labor that may reduce that down however I also imagine smaller units are less efficient and this is refering to larger ones.  Solar is over 2X    One correction, only a small amount of our electricity comes from foriegn oil.  It remains unclear if alternatives can replace that, as the energy from oil is usually just for peek loads, and we will still need that capicity.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Solar, wind, wave, tidal, geothermal, composting etc. Geothermal being the ultimate alternative.

Since the grid and the power companies are already built and paid for it's cheaper to buy energy from them immediately.   Until your energy production device is built and paid for you will not be saving any money; but after that, its free.|`|5tpV7Jdcaa	Solar is the only way and wind too.  We need to stop using oil.

I had a solar system installed last year, I didn't zero out my bill, but I cut it way down. I'm still on the grid, so I am able to sell back my excess and drawn from the grid when I don't generate enough or there is no sunlight.

It destroys the economies of scale.|`|gf0ygrYSaa	There are a number of ways to go off the grid for electricity generation, wind is probably the most used way in the UK. However it is unlikely you would be 100% self sufficient 100% of the time as wind turbines generate power approximately 35% of the year.     The incentives for power generation in the UK means that when a wind turbine is generating if you generate excess you can sell it back to the grid and even claim a Renewable Obligation Certificate which can be worth in the region of 44 per mega watt hour of electricity generated. You can often do a deal with your electricity provider to sell them the excess in return for a good deal on your unit price when you are buying back from them.    There is funding from the energy savings trust, the carbon trust and a number of other organisations.    The average cost of electricity from a wind turbine to generate enough power for a large house occupied by four adults paid back over 20 years in approximately 8.5pence per kilo watt hour (per/kwh) without grant aid. current electricity suppliers are charging in the region of 12pence per kwh.|`|3ico2IkGaa	Going off the grid has some drawbacks, but there are some areas where if you stay on the grid, and add photovoltaic solar panels, wind turbine or small hydro you can make your electric meter spin backward and get paid for the electricity that you make as a supplier. People do it and they really like it. I don't know about your area. You can check around.|`|LFYr9iH0aa	It's a bit of both. Alternatives to the national grid can't supply the amount of electric for the demand of your house. So you would have to reduce your consumption to use the electric producing alternatives. That would mean losing the electric cooker and electric shower.    Then you could have a wind turbine, solar power and if you live beside a river, a water turbine. Once the cost of these come down and the efficiency increases, we're very much dependant on the grid.    If we can alter the way we live, you could do away with electric. In my city, an old lady died in her late 80's and her house was all gas, and that was late 1980's. Apparently she still had the old gas lights.    Have we advanced to a standard of living that the planet can't support much longer.|`|TWfuO1xoaa	Solar panels are expensive to install, they are not very efficient at the moment as there still needs to be alot of development on them - they are only really useful if you live somewhere with a hot and/or sunny climate.     Wind power is good if you live in a particularly windy place, hills are always a good place to put them, however they can cause significant noise pollution.     water power can be a good source of cheap energy however, again it has some limitations. The best way of conserving energy and saving money is investment into heat insulation, energy saving light bulbs and other such methods     This should save you money, however it still relies on buying from the national grid
